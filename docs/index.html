              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">What’s causing this summer’s extreme heat waves?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dog days of summer are upon us. Brutal heat waves are roasting regions around the globe, smashing records with unrelenting severity.</p>



<p>In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, devastating heat has been scorching the region for weeks. For 19 straight days and counting, temperatures in Phoenix have reached above 43.3° Celsius (110° Fahrenheit), surpassing a record streak from 1974. The Texas city of El Paso has endured an unprecedented 33 consecutive days of temperatures reaching over 37.8° C (100° F), and that streak is only expected to continue. And just after midnight on July 17, Death Valley, Calif., may have sweltered under the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere for that time: 48.9° C (120° F).</p>





<p>China has also been enduring extreme heat for weeks. On July 16, the township of Sanbao broke not only the national record with a temperature of 52.2° C (126° F), but also the record for highest temperature above 40˚ N latitude. Meanwhile, southern Europe is in its second heat wave in a week, with Rome recording a new all-time high of 42.9° C (109.2° F) on July 18 while a town in Catalonia, Spain set a new record for the region, 45.3° C (113.5° F).</p>



<p>What’s concocting these bouts of extreme heat? It’s partly because the world has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">exceptionally warm</a> this year, thanks to the compounding of human-caused climate change with a natural climate phenomenon called El Niño, whose influence is known to temporarily warm our planet (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>But it’s not just that Earth’s a hotter stovetop; the cooks have been busy. The jet streams, powerful ribbons of wind that control much of the planet’s weather, have been meandering and getting stuck, holding bulges of hot air over many parts of the Earth. While that’s not unusual, some scientists have suggested that climate change may be altering the dynamics of the consequential winds.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know about how climate change is impacting extreme heat and how these potentially dangerous events occur.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Extreme heat waves are becoming more likely</h4>



<p>Let’s start with that hot stovetop. Humans have been warming the planet for decades by emitting climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That’s made extreme heat waves more common, many researchers say.</p>



<p>Since 2004, scientists have conducted <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution studies</a> to estimate how much climate change may have influenced the probability and severity of a specific bout of extreme weather. These studies essentially simulate the world with and without climate change to compare how often certain types of extreme weather events occur.</p>



<p>The work of the <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Weather Attribution initiative</a> has repeatedly indicated that climate change has made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-storms-deadly-africa-early-2022">extreme weather</a> events like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">heat waves</a> more likely and more severe (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>; <em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>A May report concluded that an <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-humid-heat-in-south-asia-in-april-2023-largely-driven-by-climate-change-detrimental-to-vulnerable-and-disadvantaged-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April heat wave in South Asia</a> — during which locations in Thailand and Laos set new national temperature records of 45.4° C and 42.9° C, respectively — was made at least 30 times more likely due to climate change.</p>



<p>Another study suggested that a different heat wave in northern Africa and southwestern Europe, which subjected some areas to temperatures <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-april-heat-in-spain-portugal-morocco-algeria-almost-impossible-without-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 degrees C higher than is normal</a> in April, was at least 100 times more likely due to climate change.</p>





<p>Climate change is pushing heat waves in general to have higher temperatures, but it’s having a particularly strong impact on the frequency of the most extreme events, says atmospheric scientist Noboru Nakamura of the University of Chicago.</p>



<p>“What used to be once every 1,000 years might now occur every 20 years,” he says. “It’s still a rare event, but … you can actually feel that in our daily lives.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How heat waves form</h4>



<p>What’s actually whipping up these summer scorchers, and why are only certain regions getting roasted?</p>



<p>The answer lies roughly 8 to 14 kilometers high in the sky. There, the jet streams flow at about 177 kilometers per hour on average, though they can reach speeds of more than 400 kilometers per hour — faster than a Shinkansen bullet train.</p>



<p>These powerful winds control much of Earth’s weather by transporting high- and low-pressure systems around the world.</p>



<p>Jet streams develop where large masses of air with different temperatures meet, flowing faster where the temperature contrast is stronger. When jet streams are blowing strong, they tend to orient themselves more parallel to the equator, says atmospheric scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. “But when those winds get weaker … then we tend to see the jet stream take these bigger meanders.”</p>



<p>When the jet stream meanders, it forms broad waves, with crests and troughs that reach north and south for hundreds of kilometers. Jet streams in the northern and southern hemispheres typically undulate more during their respective summers. Due to Earth’s axial tilt, polar regions receive more warming sunlight during their summers, weakening their temperature contrast with the tropics. As the waves become amplified, high- and low-pressure systems in the crests and troughs encroach farther north and south. Sometimes these pressure systems become stuck over one spot for days to weeks, causing weather to persist over a region.</p>



<p>When a high-pressure system gets stuck over an area, it pushes air down toward the surface, compressing and warming the air. The high pressure also pushes clouds away, clearing the sky for the hot sun to beat down unabated. These factors compound to produce a heat dome, a phenomenon that scorches and often dries landscapes.</p>

<p>An exception is when heat domes form by coastlines — such as the one that has formed by the U.S. Gulf Coast. Since warmer air can carry more moisture, heat domes near the ocean can make for weather that is both hot and humid, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">potentially lethal combination</a> for humans (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>It’s a bit of a mystery why pressure systems become stuck, Nakamura says, making the phenomenon difficult to predict. It may occur when jet streams become especially wavy, he and a colleague reported in 2018 in <em>Science</em>. The waves may get stuck like cars in a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat0721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic jam</a>, causing weather to idle in place.</p>



<p>But this explanation is a theoretical one, and more evidence is needed to validate it, Nakamura says. Until then, he says, the underlying mechanics of those jams will remain elusive.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The jet streams’ uncertain future</h4>



<p>A related, but similarly unresolved, problem is how climate change may affect the dance of the jet streams in the future. In 2012, Francis and a colleague proposed climate change could <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make the powerful winds more wobbly</a>.</p>



<p>“The Arctic is warming about four times faster than the globe as a whole,” Francis says. “That means that the north-south temperature difference has been getting weaker and weaker.” As a result, jet streams may be becoming more unstable, she says, and more prone to meandering.</p>



<p>But that’s still “a very hotly contested hypothesis,” Nakamura says, pointing out that some climate simulations have suggested that in the Northern Hemisphere, the jet stream may actually become less wavy. “There is not a widely accepted consensus on this,” Nakamura says.</p>



<p>Even if the fate of the jet streams remains up in the air, one thing seems clear: Extreme heat waves aren’t going anywhere.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-is-better-science/">Open Science is better science</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the heart of the Open Science movement is the conviction that <strong><em>Open Science is better science</em></strong>. More rigorous. More inclusive. More efficient. More trustworthy. More reproducible. And more impactful for society.</p>



<p>The different aspects of Open Science practice&mdash;from open methods and data, to preprints, to ORCID and CRediT, to published peer review&mdash;are all part of a mutually reinforcing cycle. Each component works in tandem, and as adoption rises the benefits increase, spiraling ever outward, reshaping our research system and, ultimately, producing <strong><em>better science</em></strong>.</p>



<p>At PLOS, our mission is to lead that transformation. We believe we can best accomplish that by empowering researchers to engage in fundamental Open Science practices on a large scale, by:</p>



<ol><li>Offering Open Science options that serve researchers&rsquo; goals and priorities, as well as those of the public, and</li><li>Removing barriers and expanding access to Open Science to all researchers.</li></ol>



<p>So far, it has worked. PLOS helped to demonstrate the feasibility of Open Access journals beginning in 2003 with <em>PLOS Biology</em>, and put Open Access within reach for more researchers than ever before with <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2009. Our pioneering 2014 data availability policy has reset the standards for data sharing industry-wide. Our streamlined and collaborative approach to preprints reduces the administrative burden on researchers, normalizes early sharing, and increases access to new science.</p>



<p>This work continues today, through key projects designed to better understand researcher needs, incentivize Open behaviors to improve research quality and reliability, and increase access to Open publishing options. Read on for a short summary of some of our current efforts.</p>



<h2>Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</h2>



<p>In order to increase the prevalence of Open Science practices, we need to be able to reliably measure Open Science practices. Until recently, there was no easy way to do so, other than having an expert review and assess individual articles. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-indicators-update-q1-2023/">Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</a> use Natural Language Processing to identify and quantify Open Science behaviors in the published literature, and to compare rates of generation and adoption across discipline, region, and other factors. This enables PLOS to better understand and meet researcher needs; by making the dataset publicly available, we hope to support efforts outside PLOS as well. Currently, the OSI dataset includes data sharing, code sharing and preprints. We aim to include additional indicators in the future.</p>



<h2>Accessible Data</h2>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data for understanding, verification, replication and reanalysis, and to inform future investigations, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. But researchers can only access and use data if they are aware it exists. PLOS&rsquo; Accessible Data feature is an experimental functionality which increases the visibility of data posted in select public repositories on PLOS article pages. By highlighting publicly available data in this way, we hope to facilitate access and reuse, save readers time searching for public data online, and learn from user behavior. After a successful first year, the Accessible Data functionality was recently expanded from the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">original three servers</a> to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">nine.</a></p>



<h2>Moving beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Article Processing Charges (APCs) have demonstrated that Open Access is viable, and allowed Open publishing to become a force in our industry. But APCs are also exclusionary and inequitable; burdensome for authors and time consuming for publishers to administer; and tend to create incentives that privilege volume over other considerations. At PLOS, we&rsquo;re moving beyond APCs to new funding models that distribute the costs of publication more fairly and reduce expenses for everyone involved, including <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional agreements</a>. To date, we&rsquo;ve partnered with over 280 universities, libraries, and other institutions in 28 countries to help bring Open Science within reach for all.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll join us in this important work in whatever ways make sense for you. When serving on search and tenure committees, consider candidates&rsquo; Open contributions alongside other qualifications. When communicating your own research, share as much as possible as early as you can within ethical boundaries. Choose mission-driven, Open Access publication venues when you have the opportunity. Let your institutions and funders know that you support APC-alternative funding. Together, we can reshape the scientific research system to serve <em>all </em>researchers, and produce the highest quality research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/granite-moon-surface-volcanism">Granite likely lurks beneath the moon’s surface</a></h4>

              
                <p>Watch out Yosemite — the moon has its own impressive rock display.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06183-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enormous chunk of granite</a>, measuring roughly 50 kilometers wide, may be buried beneath the lunar surface, researchers reported July 5 in <em>Nature</em>. Finding such a behemoth, by far the largest granite structure spotted beyond Earth, is a surprise given that forming this type of rock typically requires plate tectonics or abundant water.</p>



<p>When Apollo astronauts landed on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, they encountered vistas dominated by basalt. The igneous rock is run-of-the-mill stuff on both the moon and our planet, says Matthew Siegler, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson. “Everything starts as basalt.”</p>





<p>But over time, with enough heat and pressure, basalt can melt and morph into more durable granite. Plate tectonics and water, both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">mainstays on Earth</a>, often help facilitate that transformation: Tectonic forces can help drag rocks down deep, where it’s hotter, and water, acting like a salt, helps rocks melt at lower temperatures (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Because the moon has no plate tectonics and very little water, finding copious amounts of granite there would be unexpected, Siegler says. Indeed, out of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">roughly 380 kilograms of moon rocks</a> (about the heft of a large bear) brought back to Earth by Apollo astronauts, just a handful of millimeter-sized pieces are granite (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>). “That’s our whole inventory,” Siegler says.</p>



<p>But Siegler and his colleagues now have strong evidence that a massive piece of granite might be lurking under the moon’s surface. The team analyzed microwave data collected from the farside of the moon by China’s Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 lunar orbiters and discovered a geothermal hotspot roughly 9 degrees Celsius warmer than expected. Elevated temperatures are often an indicator of granite, Siegler says, because uranium and thorium — radioactive elements that decay over time and release heat — tend to aggregate within the rock. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To estimate how large a piece of granite could be lying beneath the region, known as the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex, the researchers ran computer simulations of different sizes of granite buried at different depths. The team concluded that an ellipsoidal hunk of granite roughly 50 kilometers wide and 25 kilometers tall capped by a smaller ellipsoid of granite, all buried four kilometers below the lunar surface, best explained the Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 observations.</p>



<p>The big question is how such an edifice formed. One idea that Siegler and his colleagues propose is that a mantle plume — a column of molten rock — once persisted under the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex. That plume would have turned some of the region’s basalt into granite.</p>



<p>On Earth, mantle plumes famously combine with tectonic plate movement <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-volcanoes-share-split-personality">to create island chains like Hawaii</a>, Siegler says (<em>SN: 9/19/11</em>). But on the moon, where there is no plate tectonics, a mantle plume would just continuously heat one region, he says. “You get a single spot of the crust that keeps getting roasted.”</p>



<p>This is an intriguing discovery that should be followed up with a lunar mission, says Brad Jolliff, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved with the new study. “It’s ripe for a robotic mission that has a small rover that can test some of these properties up close.”</p>



<p>In the next few years, scientists plan to do just that. NASA’s Lunar Vulkan Imaging and Spectroscopy Explorer mission, or Lunar-VISE, which is slated to launch by 2027, will land on the summit of one of the <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/482/a-lunar-mystery-the-gruithuisen-domes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gruithuisen domes</a>. Located on the moon’s nearside, these volcanic features are believed to also contain granite. Lunar-VISE will be able to take a closeup look at the region’s chemical composition, says the mission’s principal investigator Kerri Donaldson Hanna, a planetary geologist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</p>



<p>That’s important because it’s often difficult to capture small details from orbit. Landers like Lunar-VISE can shed light on the moon’s geology, says Donaldson Hanna. “We need new observations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milking-umbilical-cord-help-sick-newborns">‘Milking’ umbilical cords may help some sickly newborns</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giving birth to a child who is unresponsive or struggling to breathe is a harrowing experience. The medical team must quickly cut the umbilical cord and then rush the baby to aid. But taking a few seconds to squeeze blood from the cord into an infant’s abdomen before cutting the cord could help with the infant’s recovery, two recent studies suggest.</p>



<p>The practice, known as umbilical cord milking, is relatively unknown and not without some controversy. But if its promise holds up, it may help protect some of the most at-risk newborns, researchers say.</p>





<p>During fetal development, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/public-private-cord-blood-banks-caveats">the umbilical cord</a> brings nutrients from the placenta, which also serves as a reservoir for blood, iron and stem cells (<em>SN: 4/4/18</em>). At birth, the infant is still connected to this reservoir, and the <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recommendation</a> is to wait at least 30 seconds to a minute before clipping that connection, allowing the baby to take in more of those essential nutrients.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest that for healthy babies, delayed cord clamping can improve some aspects of health, such as iron levels or fine motor skills, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for months</a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2296145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even years</a>.</p>



<p>For babies born with urgent health problems, however, there’s no time to wait. In these cases, quickly milking the cord might provide similar benefits as delayed cord clamping. But the jury is still out on if or when to use the technique. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that there is “insufficient evidence to support or refute umbilical cord milking” in its 2020 <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines</a>, which the group reaffirmed earlier this year.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, researchers randomly assigned 10 medical centers in three countries to one of two groups. If an infant was born limp, with difficulty breathing or bluish skin, the cord was immediately clamped and cut in one group. In the other, the umbilical cord was milked four times before being cut. The hospitals then switched practices halfway through the study.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937822006494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzing outcomes for over 1,700 infants</a>, researchers found that babies who had had their umbilical cords milked were less likely to need extra oxygen or other breathing assistance. The newborns were also less likely to suffer from a brain injury called hypoxic encephalopathy that’s caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before or shortly after birth, the team reported in the February <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>.</p>



<p>In a follow-up analysis of <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(23)00179-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood flow in over 200 of the infants</a>, published in the June <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em>, the researchers found that these improved outcomes were probably due in part to increased blood volume and blood flow to the heart, lungs and brain in the infants who received the cord milking. These newborns also had slightly higher levels of hemoglobin, the protein which carries oxygen in human blood, than babies whose cords were quickly cut.</p>



<p>“We saw dramatic differences in the babies that have this extra blood,” says Anup Katheria, a neonatologist at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women &amp; Newborns in San Diego.</p>



<p>The new research adds key evidence in favor of umbilical cord milking, says Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in England who has collaborated with Katheria but wasn&#8217;t involved in the two studies. The findings offer important assurance to obstetricians who might be hesitant to adopt the practice, she says. “It should really be getting into standard of care.”</p>



<p>The intervention is quick, simple and does not require equipment, meaning it might be readily adopted in places with limited medical resources.</p>



<p>But the practice could harm some infants’ health. Another study lead by Katheria ended early in 2019 after it found that umbilical cord milking increased the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2755614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likelihood of brain bleeding</a> in very preterm infants, those born at less than 32 weeks of pregnancy.</p>





<p>Based on the recent studies, umbilical cord milking “shows promise” in infants born in poor health at or near term, says Sarah McDonald, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the studies. But more research is needed before the practice is recommended for use, even in emergency situations. And for most infants, she and Katheria agree, delayed cord clamping will likely remain the best course of action.</p>

<p>An engineering researcher has stepped down from an editorial board at the request of a journal’s leadership following a sleuth’s comment on a Retraction Watch post linking him to paper mill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, an assistant professor of engineering at the Islamic Azad University in Iran, was, until recently, on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/about/editorial-board">editorial board</a> of the journal <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>. He also was listed on the website of <em>Scientific Reports</em> as a member of the journal’s editorial board in the subject of mechanical engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He now has neither position. He has not responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127540"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">our original story</a> with Undark, Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan, said Afrand “was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in <em>Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences</em>, where Afrand was cited over 130 times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov had cited Afrand’s association with <em>Scientific Reports</em> as an example of researchers seemingly associated with paper mills attaining editorial roles with reputable journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting, <em>Scientific Reports</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/">removed Afrand</a> from the webpage with its editorial board members. Rafal Marszalek, its chief editor, told us that the journal had “parted ways” with Afrand in March 2022, after an internal audit uncovered “irregularities” in how he handled papers. Afrand had still been listed on the webpage “due to an oversight,” and the journal updated the page after our story brought attention to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2174179">separate comment</a>, he asked, “Why Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements hired Afrand as editor in March 2023?”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this week, Alexander Cheng, the editor in chief of <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>,” responded with a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2175490">comment</a> on the post, stating the journal had asked Afrand to resign due to the “serious accusation” of “unethical publication conduct.” The researcher “kindly agreed,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng’s comment elaborated on the findings of the journal’s investigation into Afrand’s citations and the work he did as a guest editor for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/special-issue/10QV09LJ40D">special issue</a> of the journal. “Scanning the first 10 papers” of the 56 in the special issue uncovered a “not out of the ordinary” number of citations of Afrand’s papers, Cheng said. Cheng also said he had monitored Afrand’s editorial work and “did not find any irregularities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In conclusion, concerning Afrand’s editorial work for EABE, the special issue was not an effective way for him to boost his citations, particularly in view of his very high citation record. His editorial conduct has been honorable, and I find no fault in it. The journal regrets that due to the bad publicity, justified or unjustified, we have asked Afrand to step down. He gracefully agreed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Cheng confirmed he had submitted the comment, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As these are serious accusations and can destroy careers, we need to be careful in delivering the punishment to whom is due. I am neutral in the process. I only comment on the journal&#8217;s relation with Afrand.</p>

<p>Magazinov <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2175710">replied</a> to Cheng&#8217;s comment on our post with the results of his analysis of the citations in 44 of the special issue papers, which found 69 citations to Afrand’s work. Others had received even more citations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rain-electrons-mercury-xray-auroras">A rain of electrons causes Mercury’s X-ray auroras</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mercury’s auroras are perfectly in character. While temperate Earth gets heavenly light shows over its poles, hellish Mercury gets invisible ribbons of X-ray radiation that cling to its sun-blasted surface.</p>



<p>But as alien as they may appear, Mercury’s X-ray auroras have a lot in common with Earth’s polar lights, and with auroras throughout the solar system.</p>



<p>Scientists have now directly shown that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39565-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluctuations in Mercury’s magnetic field can fling electrons toward the planet</a>, where they eventually rain down and cause auroras of X-ray light. This process, called electron precipitation, now appears to be practically universal in the solar system: It causes auroras on every planet with a global magnetic field except Neptune, researchers report July 18 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Even Mars, which has only localized magnetic fields, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-aurora-high-altitude-dust-clouds-surprise-scientists">auroras caused by raining electrons</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/15</em>).</p>





<p>For Mercury, “this is really the first time to detect these electrons directly,” says space plasma physicist Sae Aizawa of the University of Pisa in Italy.</p>



<p>Electron precipitation usually happens because of interactions between planets’ magnetic fields and the solar wind — a stream of charged particles spewed from the sun’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>Buffeted by the solar wind, the sun-facing side of a planet’s magnetic field gets squished while the night side is swept out into a long “magnetotail” that extends behind the planet. Eventually, the magnetotail stretches so much that its formerly mostly-parallel magnetic field lines snap and reconnect, sending some field lines flying off behind the planet and others back toward it.<s></s></p>

<p>“The magnetic field lines sort of break and form new ones,” says space physicist Ryan Dewey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the study. “And in that process, a lot of energy is released.”</p>



<p>All that energy sends packets of electrons flying planetward, spiraling in corkscrew-like trajectories along magnetic field lines. When these electrons hit the planet or its atmosphere, they release energy as light.</p>



<p>The light’s wavelength depends on what the electrons encounter as they rain down. Earth’s auroras shine in visible wavelengths because incoming electrons excite molecules of uncharged gases in the atmosphere like oxygen and nitrogen, which release visible light when they relax back to their normal states. Mercury’s auroras shine in X-ray wavelengths because electrons decelerate as they smack the planet’s rocky surface. The lost energy is released as X-rays.</p>



<p>Researchers first spotted <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JE004118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercurian X-ray auroras</a> in data beamed back from the MESSENGER probe, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/messenger-mission-ends-crash-landing-mercury">orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/15</em>). But while scientists reasoned that electrons must rain down on Mercury to cause its X-ray glow, MESSENGER didn’t have the right instruments to measure the precipitating particles.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s BepiColombo spacecraft does. Analyzing data from the probe’s first flyby of Mercury in 2021, Aizawa and her colleagues spotted telltale signs of the process.</p>



<p>One clue was that as BepiColombo flew through Mercury’s magnetosphere, it observed surges of fast-moving, high-speed electrons followed by several subsequent waves of progressively slower, lower-energy electrons. “This is exactly what we’d describe as a precipitating signature,” says Aizawa, who did the work while at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France.</p>





<p>To Dewey, the new discovery is a tantalizing sneak peek at the discoveries waiting to be made at Mercury once BepiColombo enters orbit in 2025. By then, it will have been a decade since scientists last had a probe continuously orbiting Mercury.</p>



<p>“To me, it&#8217;s very exciting to see just how much we can learn from even just a short pass through the magnetosphere,” he says. “It’s a glimpse.”</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies &#8211; </strong></em><a href="https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-023-04028-2">Effects of laughter yoga on health-related quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized clinical trial</a></p>
<p>Laughter yoga is a type of complementary therapy which promotes deliberate laughter in combination with yoga breathing practices and yoga stretching poses. Intentional laughter can provide benefits equal to those of spontaneous laughter derived from jokes or humor programs, releasing a rush of stress-busting hormones.</p>
<p>In this randomized clinical trial, the authors investigate the effects of laughter yoga on health-related quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The intervention group received laughter yoga for four sessions at one-week intervals. The patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was evaluated using the Quality of Life Questionnaire European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The study questionnaires were completed before and after the laughter yoga sessions by the cancer patients, through interviews, meanwhile the control group received a self-care training education.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that laughter yoga contributed to improvements in emotional and physical functioning, reduction of fatigue, pain and sleep disturbance, and enhanced quality of life compared to the control group. Laughter yoga comes with many advantages as it is an easy, cost-effective, and affordable method that can be also taught to patients so that they can practice this by themselves, increasing their self-care management.</p>

<p>Degenerative meniscal tear (DMT) is common in adults over 35 years of age. Unlike the acute meniscal injury that is associated with acute trauma, DMT often shows up spontaneously and it is usually considered atraumatic. The first management approach for patients with symptomatic DMT, includes exercise, physiotherapy and pain medication.</p>
<p>In this qualitative study, the authors investigated the general practitioners&#8217; (GPs) experiences of managing patients with knee pain attributed to a DMT. Seventeen GPs were recruited in the South and Mid-West of Ireland and data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that the GPs sometimes found difficulties in facing patient’s treatment expectations, which are often oriented toward a ‘quick fix’ or passive treatment, such as surgery or injection. Furthermore, some GPs expressed their concerns about the limited access to public physiotherapy and orthopedic services within the Irish healthcare setting.</p>
<p>This study highlights the importance of filling the gap between patients’ expectations and best practice in the management of DMT. New training for GPs to empower their skills to prescribe exercise aligned with patient’s goals would facilitate their job, providing a better service for the patients and reinforcing the clinician-patient relationship.</p>

<p><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito is the primary vector of dengue fever, which is the most widespread vector-borne infectious disease. The state of California has an active mosquito-monitoring program since 1917, although only sporadic specimens of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> were detected for decades near airports. Since 2013, breeding populations have been reported in different cities, indicating that the mosquito has now become established and is spreading throughout large areas of California.</p>
<p>In this study 96 individual adult female <em>Aedes aegypti</em> from 12 geographic districts were collected across southern and central California. The authors integrated whole-genome sequencing data from mosquitoes with 25 annual topo-climate variables. This approach resulted in the identification of 112 genes showing strong signals of local environmental adaptation among the population, and most of them were supported by multiple environmental variables, with the top three variables including AHM (annual heat-moisture index), CMD (Hargreaves climate moisture deficit) and DD18 (degree days below 18 °C). Among the top genes, the authors identified genes involved in biological processes with an important role in adaptation to local abiotic environmental conditions, such as cell growth, response to stress and DNA repair.</p>
<p>The findings show how the adaptive evolution is a driving force for the emerging or re-emerging of viral diseases. This work highlights the importance of the disease-vector genotypes to deal with the occurrence of invasive species that cause ecological and economics harms.</p>

<p>A normal trachea has a structure supported by a series of C-shaped rings of cartilage linked together. In most respiratory fluid dynamic studies this characteristic is omitted and the assumption is that the trachea and the bronchi have smooth walls. When a tracheal stenosis is present its characteristic rings appear as O-shaped and constrict the airway.</p>
<p>In this study the authors tried to understand the effect of cartilaginous rings on the flow passing through a stenosed trachea with Grade II stenosis. They measured the flow inside two simplified trachea models at resting breathing state, using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) which allows them to perform non-intrusive velocity field measurements close to the wall. One model has a smooth wall, and the other model has idealized symmetric rings. The results showed that the cartilaginous rings disturb the flow inducing velocity fluctuations and turbulence near the wall, although minor differences were observed in the mean velocity field when compared to the model with smooth wall.</p>
<p>The model described in the study highlights the importance to consider cartilaginous rings and other small structures along the airway wall. These observations could have important medical implications, including the development of diagnosis and treatment protocols for different diseases, pollutants and drug delivery.</p>

<p>Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is represented by different types of cancer, with each type including different symptoms, diagnosed methods and treatments. In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the cancer cells don’t have receptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone and for HER2. Compared to other subtypes, TNBC shows a higher risk of developing distant metastasis and death following locoregional recurrence. As a consequence of lack of therapeutic targets, the treatment options for this type of cancer are few and have a poor clinical efficacy. The androgen receptor (AR) is emerging as a promising prognostic marker for TNBC and new studies are now aiming to investigate the related potential of receptor-targeted therapies.</p>
<p>In this retrospective study the authors selected 99 patients, represented by 36 patients with histologically confirmed TNBC and 63 patients with non-TNBC, who underwent breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) before surgery. The authors calculated the pharmacokinetic parameters of DCE-MRI and their corresponding texture parameters between TNBC and non-TNBC groups, and AR-positive (AR+) and AR-negative (AR-) TNBC groups. The results showed how  the pharmacokinetic parameters of DCE-MRI were significantly different in AR-TNBC from AR+TNBC.</p>
<p>The findings highlight how DCE-MRI can be used to predict AR expression in patients with TNBC using DCE-MRI-based pharmacokinetic parameters containing histograms and texture features. The assessment of intratumor heterogeneity has a great potential in clinical practice as it could help to improve diagnosis and to provide tailor-made treatment strategies for each patient.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iron-deficiency-goes-anemia-us-female-adolescents">Iron deficiency goes unnoticed in too many U.S. female adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many female adolescents in the United States may not have enough iron in their bodies. But most may never know, partly due to a lack of routine screenings as well as disagreement over what constitutes too little iron, pediatric hematologist Angela Weyand argues.</p>



<p>Iron deficiencies are most commonly diagnosed in toddlers, people who menstruate and pregnant people. But Weyand, of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, frequently treats female adolescents for severe cases of the condition. That led her to suspect that its prevalence was being underestimated in that group.</p>





<p>Her analysis of data from thousands of blood samples collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which evaluates a nationally representative sample of people each year, suggests the issue is worthy of attention.</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2806540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Up to 40 percent</a> of U.S. females from the ages of 12 to 21 could be iron deficient, she and colleagues report in the June 27 <em>JAMA</em>. That’s much higher than <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1334/4596788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous estimates</a> of about 16 percent, which use a lower cutoff point than Weyand’s team did for iron levels.</p>



<p>Iron is an essential component of red blood cells that helps deliver oxygen to organs and tissues. Iron deficiency can cause dizziness, headaches, fatigue, sleep disorders and cold hands and feet. Some of those problems can lead to low work productivity or an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-for-thought/ironing-out-some-mental-limitations">inability to multitask</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/04)</em>. Severe iron deficiency can also lead to anemia, a condition in which the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. Anemia can spark more severe issues, such as heart problems or pregnancy complications.</p>



<p>Weyand and colleagues analyzed levels of two iron-containing proteins, hemoglobin and ferritin, in blood samples collected from almost 3,500 female adolescents from 2003 to 2020 as part of the national survey. The researchers diagnosed iron deficiency if the level of ferritin was below 25 micrograms per liter.</p>

Treating even mild cases can make a huge difference in their quality of life, she says.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129602">A. Weyand</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Weyand and colleagues used that cutoff based on <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanhae/PIIS2352-3026(21)00168-X.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previous study</a><em> </em>on nonpregnant females showing that their hemoglobin levels started to drop when their ferritin levels dipped below 25 μg/L. Hemoglobin is produced in bone marrow and carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. Low hemoglobin is a sign of anemia.</p>



<p>Typically, 15 μg/L is the cutoff used to diagnose iron deficiency, says Laura Murray-Kolb, a nutrition scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not involved in the study. The <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/85843/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.2_eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> set that cutoff based on when the body’s iron stores in bone marrow are already depleted. Without enough iron, bone marrow can’t produce more hemoglobin.</p>



<p>But the standard may not be the most effective measure of iron deficiency, Weyand says, because it doesn’t capture “how much iron our [bodies] think we need.” Weyand has treated patients with symptoms of iron deficiency who have ferritin levels above the 15 μg/L cutoff.</p>



<p>In the new study, about 40 percent of participants met the 25 μg/L criteria for iron deficiency. Only 17 percent would qualify based on the 15 μg/L standard set by the WHO, which is roughly in line with previous estimates. Six percent met criteria for anemia, with both ferritin levels below 25 μg/L and hemoglobin levels below the standard cutoff of 12 milligrams per deciliter. Factors such as menstruation, food insecurity or low income increased the risk of iron deficiency or anemia, and Black and Hispanic participants were more likely to meet criteria for iron deficiency than non-Hispanic white participants.</p>



<p>Weyand isn’t surprised that cases of iron deficiency and anemia are so prevalent. Families and medical care providers often brush off symptoms as being a normal part of menstruation, she says, and symptoms can also be attributed to other health issues. “Iron deficiency isn’t necessarily what [primary care providers] are thinking of first,” Weyand says. Taken together, that means cases might go unnoticed and untreated.</p>





<p>The recommendations for iron deficiency screening should be reevaluated, Weyand says. For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051880.htm#:~:text=The%20CDC%20recommends%20periodic%20screening,nonpregnant%20women%20of%20childbearing%20age." target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that nonpregnant females be screened for anemia every five to 10 years beginning in adolescence but offers no recommendation on screening for iron deficiency.</p>



<p>More research is needed to confirm that the 25 μg/L cutoff is appropriate for widespread adoption in clinical practice, Murray-Kolb cautions. But she agrees that screening recommendations should be reconsidered, especially since screening is so easy to do — requiring a simple blood draw.</p>



<p>The findings underscore just how crucial testing and treatment are for the health of female adolescents even with mild cases, Weyand says. “I’ve seen patients who are really iron deficient and feeling horrible, and we corrected their iron deficiency and their lives really changed.”</p>

<p>An economics study has been retracted after other researchers identified several inconsistencies in the study’s code and submitted a comment to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those critics say the flaws drove the paper&#8217;s main findings, but an author of the study says they had no major effect and stands by the results.</p>



<p>The original paper, &#8220;<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210369">Dividend Taxes and the Allocation of Capital</a>,” was published in the <em>American Economic Review</em> in September 2022. It examined the impact of a 2013 increase in the tax rate on dividends in France, concluding an increased rate can encourage the accumulation of capital. The study has been cited four times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction is only the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?ttl%3dEffects%2bof%2bEnvironmental%2band%2bLand%2bUse%2bRegulation%2bin%2bthe%2bOil%2band%2bGas%2bIndustry%2bUsing%2bthe%2bWyoming%2bCheckerboard%2bas%2ban%2bExperimental%2bDesign">second in the journal’s history</a>. As Retraction Watch has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/12/12/why-arent-there-more-retractions-in-business-and-economics-journals/">previously reported</a>, research shows that it is less common for economics papers to be retracted than research in other fields.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127532"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.113.7.2053">retraction notice</a> published this month states, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors are retracting the paper because Figure 4 of the published paper, which pertains to the second result on the increase in investment and which plots the event study difference-in-difference coefficients of the within-firm change in year-to-year investment flows by treated firms, relative to control firms, differs from the figure that was conditionally accepted by the handling editor in two ways.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first difference, the authors write in the retraction notice, was that “the firm size control variable in the conditionally accepted manuscript was coded in changes but was incorrectly written in the baseline specification as levels.” The authors write that this error was found and corrected during the review and replication process, but they failed to inform the appropriate editor of the changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second instance, a line of code divided two coefficients by a factor of 1.8. The authors write that while they are not sure how the mistake originated, the data were “stored on remote, external servers that were inaccessible to the authors for prolonged periods of time during the publication process so it is unfortunately not possible to recover past versions to isolate the error’s origin.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/skenqoxmygjxfcr/retraction_note_for_website.pdf?dl=0">response</a> to the retraction, author Adrien Matray, an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University, wrote that both alterations were “made in good faith.” Matray posted the response on his <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adrienmatray/papers?authuser=0">website</a> and linked to it in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AdrienMatray/status/1670839660753436704">tweet</a>. He maintained that neither alteration changed the basic conclusions of the paper.</p>



<p>He also contradicted the text of the retraction notice, which stated that it “explains the authors’ reasons for retracting the published paper.” Matray wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to clarify that it was not my decision to retract the paper. I believe that the scientific concerns could have been addressed in a reply.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that given corrections to the study do not change its results, “this paper may not fall within standard publication ethics (COPE) guidelines for retraction.”</p>



<p>Martray did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charles Boissel, the other author of the paper, left academia in 2018 and was not involved in the alterations that led to the retraction, according to the retraction notice. He was previously a PhD student at HEC Paris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erzo Luttmer, the editor of the <em>American Economic Review</em>, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors’ retraction notice and the comment published on their article by Bach et al. (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20221432) jointly explain the issues that led to their retraction. The comment explains the nature of the errors and shows how they affect the main results of the article by Boissel and Matray.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In contrast to Matray’s claims that correcting the errors would not change the paper’s conclusions, the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=18907">comment</a> Luttmer mentioned argues that the alterations essentially invalidate the study’s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comment was written by Laurent Bach, an associate professor of finance at ESSEC business school; Antoine Bozio, an associate professor at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS); Arthur Guillouzouic, a research economist at the Institut des politiques publiques (IPP) in the Paris School of Economics; and Clément Malgouyres, a researcher at the Paris School of Economics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, the authors of the comment wrote that the main conclusions of the paper are “driven by a series of undocumented alterations in the code.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referencing Matray’s personal response to the retraction, the authors of the comment said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>One thing that matters for the validity of such an empirical design is that there are no statistically significant coefficients in the pre-treatment period, and both figure 4a and figure 4b in that response clearly present such significant coefficients. More generally, what matters for scientific validity in this context is that coefficients in the post-treatment period do not appear significant when the treatment truly has no effect, and both figures 4a and 4b suffer from this assumption being incorrect due to the inclusion of improper control variables in the analysis, according to our comment and as per [Matray’s] own recognition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors also said that the original version of their comment identified further problems with the study, but that they were asked by the journal’s editor to include only two of these issues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/benjamin-franklin-money-counterfeiter">How Benjamin Franklin fought money counterfeiters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though perhaps better known for its newspapers and almanacs, Benjamin Franklin’s printing business also churned out paper money to support the colonial economy. Now, scientists are confirming some of the ways that Franklin and his associates thwarted counterfeiters to help early American paper currency succeed, including by adding a reflective mineral to bills.</p>



<p>Franklin’s bills “served as an archetype for printed money” to come, says Khachatur Manukyan, a physical chemist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. “It was very sophisticated for that time.”</p>





<p>In past studies, Manukyan and his colleagues have analyzed ancient Roman coins, medieval manuscripts and other artifacts using nuclear imaging techniques. When the researchers realized that Notre Dame housed paper money bills dating to the early colonial days of North America, the team decided to take a closer look. They examined about 600 paper notes.</p>



<p>By using techniques such as infrared, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X-ray analysis, the researchers could see features such as colored threads and muscovite — a crystalized mineral — incorporated into the paper. The blue threads are visible to the naked eye, and the muscovite produces a glimmer that reflects light — features most knock-offs wouldn’t have been able to reproduce, the team reports July 17 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></p>



<p>The muscovite, found in about 95 percent of the analyzed Franklin bills produced after 1754, was probably sourced from the same geologic area, the team says. The mineral was also probably used to increase the durability of the notes so they could hold up better during circulation.</p>



<p>It’s wonderful that scientists are using these techniques to analyze these bills, says Jessica Linker, a historian at Northeastern University in Boston who studies early moneymaking. Still, she says, historians have known for some time from historical documents that muscovite — also known as mica — and blue threads were incorporated into old paper money to fight counterfeiting.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, while Franklin contracted with the colonial governments to print money, others were involved in the decisions about its manufacture — not just Franklin, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1.png" alt="Two photos of Benjamin Franklin’s incorporated elements like blue thread (left) and microscopic muscovite (right) in their paper money." class="wp-image-3129763" width="680" height="221" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1-330x107.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129763">Franklin’s operations incorporated elements like blue thread (left) and muscovite (microscope image, right) in their paper money in an effort to make it difficult to counterfeit.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129763">K. Manukyan <em>et al</em>/<em>PNAS</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new analyses also showed that Franklin’s operations used graphite in their black ink. Other money printers of the time, including Paul Revere, generally used a type of black ink that had a higher proportion of chemicals that came from burnt bones like phosphorus and calcium. Counterfeiters had figured out how to fake the bone black ink, and some knock-off Franklin notes are distinguishable by the fact they use this bone black rather than graphite.</p>



<p>Franklin’s operations may have used graphite to one-up the counterfeiters, the researchers say. But Franklin wasn’t the first printer to use graphite in ink, Linker says. Black lead — the historical term for graphite — is listed in some 18th century ink recipes, she says.</p>



<p>“Even if it was unique to the money or new in the mid-Atlantic, it’s possibly not a Franklin innovation, but something he read about, experimented with and used to improve the quality of the ink generally,” she says — not necessarily something to fight counterfeiting.</p>



<p>Still, the discovery of the graphite in Franklin’s notes is intriguing, she says. “I don’t think historians of colonial American printing would expect it to be there,” mostly because graphite was relatively scarce in the colonies at the time. Linker wonders whether this ink was used more broadly in Franklin’s other imprints or used exclusively for paper money.</p>





<p>Efforts to thwart counterfeiters of early American money were eventually upended by the British, who figured out some of the techniques when they flooded their upstart colony with fake bills as a destabilizing tactic during the American Revolution. The value of American money tanked, and in the years following the revolution, the United States typically favored coins, only issuing treasury notes during later wars.</p>



<p>Even so, some of Franklin’s techniques would go on to form the basis of increasingly sophisticated methods used to combat savvier forgers, Manukyan says. “The techniques utilized in producing pre-federal American currency were refined and enhanced during the 19th century whenever new bills were printed,” he says. “For that time, [Franklin’s paper money] was really groundbreaking.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-market-brain">New Alzheimer’s drugs are coming. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Yet another new drug can temporarily hold off the mental decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease, scientists say.</p>



<p>The drug, called donanemab, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2023.13239?utm_campai[…]PDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jama.2023.13239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowed cognitive decline by about 35 percent</a> over the course of a year and a half, according to data presented July 17 at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Amsterdam and published the same day in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>The finding comes just weeks after the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration gave full approval to another drug, called lecanemab (brand name Leqembi), that can also slow the disease’s progression. Last summer another similar drug, known as aducanumab (Aduhelm), received accelerated approval, though access to it is still very limited.</p>





<p>These drugs target amyloid, a sticky protein that piles up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The arrival of this new treatment approach marks a turning point in what has been a long, hard slog to come up with ways to slow the disease.</p>



<p>“I think this truly represents a sea change,” says neurologist Jeffrey Cummings of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the rare times where it’s OK to use the word ‘breakthrough.’”</p>



<p>The developments may bring a bit of hope to the 6.7 million people ages 65 and older in the United States who have Alzheimer’s. Even so, lots of questions remain, including who should get the drugs, how well they work and how to weigh the possible benefits against the risks, which can be significant.</p>



<p>One thing is already clear: The drugs aren’t for everyone. They come with risks and require close monitoring. And, even if a person is a good candidate medically, high costs, limited availability and time-intensive dosing schedules could prevent the drugs’ widespread use.<br><br>Here’s what to know about these new medications.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do these Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs work?</h4>



<p>The “mab” that ends their unwieldly names — donanemab, lecanemab and aducanumab — is a clue to their job: All three of these drugs are monoclonal antibodies.</p>



<p>These custom-designed antibodies take inspiration from the antibodies that the body makes to detect harmful substances, a key part of the immune system. In the brain, the lab-made antibodies attach to specific parts of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Once the antibodies attach to amyloid, they call in other immune cells to come take out the trash.</p>



<p>This cleanup job brings mental benefits, recent clinical trials suggest. And that finding supports the idea that amyloid plaques are a key part of Alzheimer’s disease, a long-standing idea called the “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memories-cant-wait">amyloid hypothesis</a>” (<em>SN: 2/25/11</em>).</p>



<p>Failed clinical trials had led some researchers to abandon that idea. “People were about ready to give up on amyloid altogether,” says neurologist and neuroscientist Erik Musiek of Washington University in St. Louis. “I don’t think a lot of people felt like removing the plaques was that big of a deal.” But this new class of drugs suggests that the plaques aren’t innocent bystanders.</p>



<p>Instead, plaques do indeed seem to harm brain function, and getting rid of them helps, Musiek says. “It seems to suggest that getting those plaques out of there is important.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How well do these Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs work?</h4>



<p>None of these drugs stop the disease. But they can buy some time, the data suggest.</p>



<p>On average, the 588 people who received donanemab in the recent clinical, for instance, stayed sharper for a bit over four months longer than the 594 people who received a placebo. Using a different scale to measure symptoms gave an estimate of seven and a half months of extra time due to the drug, made by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis.</p>



<p>Results from studies of aducanumab are more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-fda-approved-controversy-aducanumab">mixed</a>, generating lots of debate about whether the drug, made by Biogen Inc., based in Cambridge, Mass., is effective (<em>SN: 6/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>For lecanemab, a drug made by Eisai Co., based in Tokyo, and Biogen, people who got the drug spent about five months longer in a milder stage of the disease before developing more severe symptoms than people who got a placebo — about a 30 percent delay over the course of the 18-month study. That may not sound like a lot, and for some people, it might not be worth the drug’s risks. But Aimee Pierce, a geriatric neurologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, says that for some people, that delay could be especially meaningful.</p>



<p>“Some of my patients are writing memoirs or writing books or still struggling through their last year of teaching.” In those circumstances, a five-month reprieve before progressing to more confusion is significant, she says.</p>



<p>So far, the studies have not been representative of the broader population, enrolling very few people who are Black or Hispanic, for instance. That leaves a lot to learn.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who can get Alzheimer’s drugs?</h4>



<p>So far, the drugs are for people who are showing mild signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists don’t expect the drugs to help once Alzheimer’s has progressed to more intense stages.</p>



<p>To be treated with the drugs, a person should have amyloid plaques in their brain. That’s confirmed with either a brain scan or a cerebrospinal fluid test that can detect amyloid. New <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blood-test-could-predict-risk-alzheimers">blood tests</a> for amyloid buildup — a less-invasive option — are also being studied (<em>SN: 2/1/18</em>). The recent study of donanemab also required people to have excess tau in their brains, another sign of Alzheimer&#8217;s, to qualify for the trial.</p>



<p>Autoimmune disorders, medical implants that preclude MRI scans that monitor brain reactions and other health issues may also stop someone from being a candidate for the drugs. People who carry <em>APOE4</em>, a version of a gene that ups a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s, seem to be at higher risk of harmful side effects from the drugs too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How are the Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs delivered?</h4>



<p>The drugs are intravenous infusions that are given in medical centers where health care workers monitor reactions.</p>



<p>Aducanumab and donanemab are monthly infusions. But it&#8217;s possible that donanemab may be stopped once plaques are cleared away. In the clinical trial presented July 17, some participants were switched to a placebo once their plaques were gone. Still, the benefits lasted throughout the trial.</p>



<p>Lecanemab infusions happen every other week. That intense dosing schedule can be tough for patients, says Pierce, who was involved in one of the lecanemab clinical trials. And there&#8217;s no good cutoff for when to end the treatment. “As of now, it’s out there and people don’t have a stopping point,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the risks of taking Alzheimer’s drugs?</h4>



<p>Brain swelling and bleeding are two of the risks. In the recent trial of donanemab, three people died as a consequence of the treatment. People on the drugs ought to be monitored with brain scans that can detect possibly dangerous changes, researchers say. Those scans can identify the worrisome condition ARIA, or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.</p>



<p>Overall, about a quarter of people in the clinical trials who received the drug developed the condition. In a trial of nearly 1,800 people, for instance, <a href="https://www.eisai.com/news/2022/news202271.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 21 percent of people who received lecanemab had ARIA</a>, while about 9 percent of people who got a placebo did. Most of those cases came with without symptoms, which can include headache, nausea, dizziness and seizures.</p>



<p>Scientists suspect that ARIA stems from the antibodies working well. Amyloid can be in the walls of blood vessels. Removing the amyloid may make the blood vessels less stable and more prone to break.</p>



<p>These drugs can also lead to infusion reactions such as changes in blood pressure, fevers and chills. Those are often temporary and manageable, Cummings says, nor are they specific to these treatments. “This is not unique at all to Alzheimer’s drugs.”</p>



<p>Weighing the risks and the potential benefits of taking the medications is a personal call. An 80-year-old with a list of medical problems who is generally content might have a very different calculation from a 62-year-old CEO of a company with a kid in college, Musiek says. If you are that younger person, “your appetite for risk is probably much higher,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers hope that this spate of drugs may serve as a stop-off on the way to even better ones that are more effective, less risky and easier to administer.</p>



<p>“Hopefully once we can optimize [these drugs] and help whoever we can help, it will pave the way for the next set of drugs that will come out,” Musiek says. “And then maybe things will get better and better.”</p>

<p>A journal that didn’t get an impact factor this year after Clarivate, the company behind the closely-watched but controversial metric, identified unusual citations in several articles will retract the offending papers, according to its editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Genetika</em>, a publication of the Serbian Genetics Society, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">did not receive an updated impact factor</a> in Clarivate’s 2023 Journal Citation Reports due to citation stacking, a practice in which authors or journals seem to trade citations, also known as “citation cartels” or “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">citation rings</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, Clarivate identified five papers published in <em>Genetika</em> in 2021 that had been cited by 22 papers published in the journal <em>Bioscience Research</em> in 2022, Snezana Mladenovic Drinic, the editor of <em>Genetika</em>, told Retraction Watch. Clarivate also suppressed <em>Bioscience Research </em>this year, meaning that the journal did not receive a new impact factor either. </p>



<span id="more-127503"></span>



<p>(Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, previously told us <em>Genetika</em> leadership had offered to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, but Clarivate went ahead and suppressed the journal anyway.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate also removed <em>Genetika</em> from its Web of Science index when it refreshed its Master Journal List on Monday. The company said the journal failed to meet at least one of <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">24 quality criteria</a>, but would not comment on which.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Removing a journal from Web of Science, which Clarivate calls “delisting,” means the company will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor. The company does have a <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-and-appeals-process/">pathway</a> for journals to become relisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Milasin and Drinic for comment on the delisting, and Milasin reiterated her earlier comments to us on the suppression, that Clarivate’s decision was “extremely unfair!” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You will agree with me that it would be totally illogical to do something for “the benefit of our own detriment”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Drinic said <em>Genetika</em>’s editorial team “did not know anything about misused over citations,” and had no influence on the editorial policy of <em>Bioscience Research</em>, no relationships with the authors of the papers involved, nor control over which papers the authors cited.</p>



<p>Still, Drinic acknowledged the citations from <em>Bioscience Research:&nbsp;</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>affected the real picture of the citations of papers published in the journal <em>Genetika</em> which had tremendous consequences for the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal Genetika condemns such for the scientific community</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>an unethical and inappropriate pattern of behavior and we will take all measures to prevent this happening again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked if <em>Genetika</em> would retract any of the relevant papers, and Drinic confirmed the journal would retract “papers for which it was determined that the peer review was not done validly” in its next issue. Drinic said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to note that all papers are reviewed by two reviewers, during 2020 and 2021 a huge number of papers were received by the editorial office, and due to the Covid 19 pandemic it was difficult to find reliable reviewers, so we were forced to ask the authors to suggest reviewers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, a group of authors and reviewers misused it. All authors and those reviewers have been blacklisted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal editors learned of the problem in the middle of last year, Drinic said, and “took all measures to prevent it from happening again.” </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last September, scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSJa5OCqYVVhSd10NN6mvI73Ra0Pfjwx3aMLwHtgGAI/edit?usp=sharing">31 papers</a> published in <em>Genetika</em>, mostly in 2021, that seemed linked to what she called the “<a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2022/09/15/the-iranian-plants-paper-mill/">Iranian Plant Paper Mill</a>.” One of the hallmarks of the papers, she noted, was repeated coordinates indicating where plants were sampled, although the names given for the locations elsewhere in the papers were different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another similarity she found: Many of the papers cited work by S.M. Esfandani-Bozchaloyi and M. Khayatnezhad, “perhaps as part of a citation ring.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, she linked to the PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5F1B8F7B15E55225C5BA91239742BA">page</a> for the <em>Genetika</em> paper “<a href="https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0534-00122102837M">Study on genetic diversity between Erodium (Geranaiceae) species based on inter-simple sequence repeat markers</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment on the journal’s suppression, an email attributed to the editorial office of <em>Bioscience Research</em> denied having any relationship with <em>Genetika</em> or exchanging citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have never heard the name of this journal before,” the email stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the office pinned the blame squarely on Khayatnezhad:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On critical analysis of the provide data by Clarivate, we found that mainly one author i.e.&nbsp; Majid KHAYATNEZHAD from Islamic Azad University Iran cross cited his papers for his personal benefits in papers published by his colleagues from same Iranian university.&nbsp; This was a common authors in all papers published in Genetika citing our journal papers published by his colleagues from same university.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editorial office also shared the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Appeal-ISI-web-09-05-2023.pdf">appeal</a> the journal sent to Clarivate, which listed four <em>Genetika</em> papers on which Khayatnezhad was a coauthor. Clarivate did not change the decision to suppress the journal based on the appeal. The editorial office of <em>Bioscience Research</em> wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>it was extremely unfair that our journal and hundreds of the authors who trusted and published with us were punished for&nbsp; misconduct of a single author who did it for his personal interest and we don&#8217;t have any role in it and even cant not check and control it.&nbsp; All his conduct was beyond control of editorial office and even no journal can check and fix this type of activity by any of authors among hundred of author. Instead of journal suppression, authors like Majid KHAYATNEZHAD&#8221; must be blacklisted for misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3621-5153">Khataynezhad</a>, of the environmental science and engineering department at the Islamic Azad University’s Ardabil branch in Iran and also <a href="https://ap.ardabil.iau.ir/journal/editorial.board">managing editor</a> of the university’s journal <em>Anthropogenic Pollution</em>, for comment. He responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, I recently encountered many problems in this regard. The increase in my citations in recent years is due to my return to university. But if you check my articles, there are no unusual citations in this field. I would like to retract the articles that have cited me unusually. Increasing citations does not matter to me.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-use-antibird-spikes-build-nests">In a ‘perfect comeback,’ some birds use antibird spikes to build their nests</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s the Mad Max dream of a bird’s nest: A menacing composite of metal, clay, twig and plastic.</p>



<p>Spotted in a sugar maple tree in Antwerp, Belgium, the gnarly architecture brims with at least 1,500 long, sharp antibird spikes pointing out from its center. “That is really like a bunker for birds,” says biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra. “Like this fortress which cannot be taken.”</p>



<p>The nest is <a href="https://www.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/documents-nmr/Publicaties/Deinsea/Deinsea_21/Deinsea_21_17_25_2023_Hiemstra_et_al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five found in Europe</a>, each one decorated with antibird spikes, Hiemstra and his colleagues report July 11 in <em>Deinsea</em>. The pointy strips of bird-deterrent materials normally line eaves in cities around the world. Now, they line some birds’ homes.</p>





<p>The study started when a hospital patient in Antwerp looked out his window and saw the nest in question. He sent a picture to Hiemstra, who researches nests and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-ppe-trash-masks-gloves-pollution-deadly-wildlife">plastic pollution</a> at Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands (<em>SN: 4/12/21</em>). After breeding season, Hiemstra and his team travelled to collect the nest and take it back to the lab for study. As he wrote up his report of the nest, he was tipped off to four more similar bird nests in cities in the Netherlands and Scotland.</p>



<p>The nests belonged to Eurasian magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and carrion crows (<em>Corvus corone</em>). The crows used the spikes as part of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">structure of their nests</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). But Hiemstra believes the magpies employed them much as they were originally intended: to ward off other birds.</p>

<p>Magpies are relatively small, so they create domed roofs over their nests to protect their eggs and hatchlings from avian predators. Often, the magpies adorn their roofs with thorny branches for extra protection. But in large cities, spiny vegetation is harder to come by, so the magpies innovate with whatever materials they have available, like nails, screws or knitting needles. Antibird spikes serve as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canada-crawford-lake-beginning-anthropocene">ultimate Anthropocene replacement</a>, the researchers say (<em>SN: 7/11/23</em>).</p>



<p>The observations are “fascinating,” and the use of citizen science is laudable, says Zuzanna Jagiełło, an ecologist at the University of Warsaw who wasn’t involved in the study. However, she thinks that the paper lacks the experiments or in-field observations to claim that the spikes in the magpie nests are used as a bird deterrent. “It’s a starting point to explore [the phenomenon] more deeply,” she says.</p>



<p>Already, Hiemstra has received reports of other nests made with the spiky material, leading him to believe that the construction may be more common than previously thought. With enough nests, he might even be able to study if the spikes are improving the survival of the young magpies that call the nests home.</p>



<p>Still, amid his scientific excitement, Hiemstra can’t help but laugh. “I just love the irony of it all,” he says. “It&#8217;s just the perfect comeback of the birds.”</p>

                Millions of years ago, retroviruses invaded the human genome. Today some of these viral remnants threaten the developing embryo, while others fight to defend it.

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/07/16/the-idea-for-a-journal-elife-a/">The idea for a journal “eLife-A”</a></h4>

              
                <p>The process of publishing and reviewing scientific results is often a strange and difficult-to-navigate landscape.</p>



<p>It would take too long to mention <em>all</em> the problems and pitfalls related to publishing. For example: overly high publication charges; long turnaround times for reviews and editorial decisions; incomprehensible reviews; incomprehensible manuscripts; delayed careers due to rejections and revision processes; lack of transparency of manuscript evaluation; lack of open access. Just to name what comes to my mind immediately.</p>



<p>Some of these issues have been partly addressed during the last decade by preprints (<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/q-bio?query=neuroscience&amp;searchtype=all&amp;abstracts=show&amp;order=-announced_date_first&amp;size=50">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/neuroscience">bioRxiv</a>), open reviews (check out <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">my previous blog post on public peer reviews</a>), non-legal mirrors of closed-source material (sci-hub) and experiments with new publication models (most prominently, the new eLife publication model).</p>



<p>Since the inception of <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research">eLife&#8217;s new publication model</a> End of 2022, the first papers have now gone through this process, and I have the overall impression that the model is mostly well-received and definitely worth the experiment. The published papers now not only include the public peer reviews, but also an assessment by the editors, which summarizes and evaluates the claims of the paper. <a href="https://mschottdorf.github.io/">Manuel Schottdorf</a> just pointed out to me that this digest can also be an outright negative assessment, for example concluding that &#8220;the evidence&#8221; for the claims is &#8220;considered inadequate&#8221; (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89106#tab-content">full article plus assessment</a>)! That&#8217;s impressive! Even though such an assessment might appear harsh from the authors&#8217; side, such an open process makes science itself and its progress more transparent. The specific paper is outside my area of expertise, but I like the idea in general. The conclusions and claims of a paper should not be evaluated based on its association with a specific journal, but based on its assessments by expert reviewers.</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3B5ItaIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Aaron Milstein</a> just put forward a suggestion to implement this assessment in a way that is also readable by evaluation and grant committees: by giving to each paper a grade between &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8221;. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if journals placed papers in quality tiers after peer review? So then the press would report &quot;published in eLife-F&quot;, immediately recognizable as different from &quot;eLife-B&quot;. Is that the problem &#8211; we need to know the rating without reading 4 sentences?</p>&mdash; Aaron Milstein (@neurosutras) <a href="https://twitter.com/neurosutras/status/1679981581774061569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For example, &#8220;eLife-A&#8221; would correspond to &#8220;Nature/Science/Cell&#8221; in terms of broad relevance, &#8220;eLife-B&#8221; to &#8220;Nature Neuroscience&#8221; or &#8220;Neuron&#8221;, &#8220;eLife-C&#8221; maybe to the current version of eLife, and so on.</p>



<p>Personally, I do not like the US grading scheme (from A to F), and I&#8217;m also a bit skeptical about mixing impact/relevance and methodological rigor/correctness &#8211; I really hate high-impact papers with strong claims that are not supported or only weakly supported by data, but I know that many people think differently. In any way, a one-dimensional metrix (from A to F) would certainly benefit from improved interpretability, which is already better than what we have right now.</p>



<p>I could also imagine that as a further step, a retrospective re-evaluation of specific papers could be possible, with this secondary, retrospective evaluation reflecting the impact a paper had on its field. It is easier to tag an existing paper that already has a specific &#8220;rating&#8221; with a new additional &#8220;post-publication review rating&#8221;, rather than saying that &#8220;in retrospect, this Scientific Reports paper should have been published in Nature&#8221;. But this is just a side-note.</p>



<p>In an ideal scenario, such a publication model would be set up by an independent entity. eLife would actually be a good choice, because its publication model is already very close to this model. Alternatively, the EU funding agencies or the NIH could set up such a journal and oblige all projects funded by EU or NIH to publish in this journal.</p>



<p>One of the several positive and less obvious side-effects would be to prevent journal hopping. Journal hopping is the process of sequentially submitting a paper to several high-impact journals, in the hope of being lucky with one of them. This process not only wastes a lot of resources from both journals and voluntary reviewers but also comes at the cost of junior researchers whose careers are delayed to an unnecessary degree by this process.</p>



<p>I really hope that a publication scheme that gets rid of the journal tags and replaces them with grades (=subjournals) becomes a reality soon. I think it is a good idea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-detect-coronavirus-air">A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever thought it would be great to walk into a room and know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 is hanging around, scientists have a device for you. Researchers have created a machine a little bigger than a toaster that can detect airborne SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in minutes.</p>



<p>It takes only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39419-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five minutes to detect</a> as few as seven to 35 viral particles per liter of air, researchers report July 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That is about as sensitive as PCR nasal swab tests, says Rajan Chakrabarty, an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. His team worked “nonstop” for three years to create the detector, he says.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges when sampling airborne viruses is collecting enough air to concentrate viral particles at detectable levels. Previous attempts have sucked in between 2 and 8 liters of air per minute. This detector pulls in 1,000 liters of air each minute.</p>



<p>To trap the virus, “we create an artificial cyclone inside of the sampler,” Chakrabarty says, by swirling liquid at high speed. Viruses get trapped in the wall of the cyclone and concentrated for analysis. Any viruses not captured in the liquid get filtered out of the air with a HEPA filter attached to the device. After five minutes of collection, the liquid is pumped to a biosensor.</p>





<p>The biosensor consists of an electrode attached to a llama nanobody, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-treatments-target-nose-prevention">specialized immune system protein</a> made by llamas and their relatives that fights infections much the way antibodies do but is smaller and perhaps tougher than human antibodies (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>). The nanobody grabs any passing coronavirus by its spike protein. Electricity passing through the nanobody and spike protein causes tyrosine amino acids in the spike protein to oxidize, or lose electrons. Another device attached to the electrode detects that oxidation as a change in voltage, signaling that SARS-CoV-2 is in the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The biosensor is based on a detector for the amyloid-beta protein fragments that form Alzheimer’s disease plaques developed by Chakrabarty’s colleagues Carla Yuede and John Cirrito.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test the detector, the researchers sent the device to the apartments of two people who had COVID-19 infections. “The device was detecting even the trace amounts of virus being shed by the patients,” Chakrabarty says. Air collected from an empty, well-ventilated conference room showed no sign of the virus.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;ve demonstrated that it works. It&#8217;s able to detect [the] virus at low levels that we would be concerned about in the air,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies the spread of viruses. She was not involved in the study but is working on a detector, too.</p>



<p>There are still some challenges to overcome. For instance, the device is about as noisy as a vacuum cleaner or a ringing phone. That’s probably too loud to use continuously in a classroom or office, Marr says, but could be tolerated if run for 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Such detectors cost about $1,400 to $1,900 to build in a research lab, Chakrabarty says. Commercial versions may initially be too expensive for home use, Marr says, but could be used in hospitals, airports and other public areas to survey for the virus. The devices could be linked into HVAC systems, which could ramp up ventilation and filtration if the virus is found, Marr and Chakrabarty suggest.</p>



<p>In the future, Chakrabarty hopes to add llama nanobodies that can detect other respiratory viruses as well, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-asteroid-stardust-old-space">Ryugu asteroid samples are sprinkled with stardust older than the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu contain bits of stardust that predate the birth of our solar system.</p>



<p>Slivers of Ryugu material, snagged by the Japanese Hayabusa2 spacecraft, appear to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh1003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come from the solar system’s frozen fringes</a>, rather than from the asteroid itself, scientists report July 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>. These foreign fragments could illuminate details of the solar system’s history.</p>



<p>Finding these fragments “is really unique,” says cosmochemist Ann Nguyen of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It’s showing us a new type of material, but also telling us about the dynamics of material from the outer solar system.”</p>





<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft visited the asteroid in 2018 and 2019, then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">returned to Earth with 5.4 grams of the space rock in 2020</a> (<em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Scientists examined those samples in the lab in ways that can&#8217;t be done with telescopes or even spacecraft, like getting detailed measurements of chemical composition.</p>



<p>So far, those examinations have shown that Ryugu is rich in carbon, that it’s made of the same material as some of the rarest meteorites found on Earth, and that it was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">altered by water</a> at some point in its past (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). Scientists think that Ryugu formed from the debris of a larger asteroid, which broke up in a collision and re-formed into a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">loose pile of rubble</a> (<em>SN: 3/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>Nguyen, however, was searching for something different. “My focus of research is presolar grains,” tiny specks of material that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteorite-stardust-oldest-ever-examined-lab">formed from the ashes of dying stars</a>, she says (<em>SN: 1/13/20</em>). “I was on the hunt for them.” These delicate grains contain different isotopes — atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons — than those formed by the sun, giving away their alien origins.</p>



<p>Nguyen and her colleagues examined two samples of Ryugu, each less than a millimeter in size. They then picked out tiny slivers of rock, 50 to 200 micrometers wide, called clasts, that stood out from the rest of the Ryugu sample.</p>



<p>Using scanning electron microscopes and other imaging techniques, Nguyen and colleagues found that two of the clasts are chemically different from the rest of Ryugu, with lower oxygen, magnesium and silicon contents, and greater amounts of iron and sulfur.</p>

Nguyen <em>et al</em>/<em>Science Advances</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The clasts also have much higher concentrations of presolar grains than the rest of the Ryugu material. The grains contain silicon carbide, which is easily destroyed by water, plus an extra abundance of organic matter.</p>



<p>That means the grains could not have been part of Ryugu’s parent body, which was extensively altered by water. The researchers think the grains were bits of a comet that formed in the outer solar system’s Kuiper belt, where the conditions were cool and dry. Then the grains sprinkled onto the rubble that formed Ryugu sometime between the original asteroid’s destruction and the rubble pile’s formation.</p>



<p>“Between these events, it kind of collected some other friends that came from other bodies, from different parts of the solar system,” Nguyen says. It’s not yet clear how material from the outer solar system found its way to Ryugu. Perhaps the asteroid formed farther from the sun — and hence, closer to the Kuiper belt — than it is today. “It’s interesting to visualize how this asteroid came about and what it gathered along the way.”</p>



<p>The discovery is “very exciting,” says cosmochemist Philipp Heck of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who was not involved in the new work. “These clasts that got incorporated into Ryugu after it formed, they’re really valuable. I think they’re even more valuable than the Ryugu sample itself.”</p>





<p>The clasts can reveal what the unaltered ingredients that formed the solar system were made of. Think of the disk that formed the planets as bread dough, Heck says. Once the dough is well-mixed, it’s hard to tell what went into it. Clasts like the ones in the Ryugu sample are like bits of unmixed flour that survived intact in the final loaf, he says — not delicious, but very informative.</p>



<p>“If we want to understand the ingredients from which the solar system formed, the original ingredients, we need to find these very rare, unaltered clasts,” Heck says. “This is one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-missing-chunk-neuroplasticity">Elyse G.’s brain is fabulous. It’s also missing a big chunk</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE</strong>: Most of the Interesting Brains Project participants featured in this story are using shortened forms of their names and/or pseudonyms to protect their privacy.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>You’d never guess that Elyse G. has a black hole in her brain.</p>



<p>Meet her on the street, and it’d be impossible to tell she’s lacking a chunk of neural tissue about the size of a small fist.</p>



<p>Looking at her brain scans is a different story. It’s as if someone has knocked over a bottle of ink. The darkness pools inside her skull near her left ear, a puddle of fuliginous black. Inside the splotch, there’s no white matter or gray matter, no blood vessels or tissue at all.</p>



<p>Elyse says you don’t have to be a neurosurgeon to spot what’s different about her brain: “There’s a big honking piece missing!”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="438" height="636" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_REV-2.gif" alt="A gif showing the MRI scan of Elyse G. and the large chunk of her brain missing on the left hand side." class="wp-image-3129547" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129547">In this view of Elyse G.’s brain, scientists stacked MRI slices that go from the bottom of the brain to the top. On the left side, the missing temporal lobe shows up as a large black hole that appears and then disappears as the scans move up through the brain.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129547">COURTESY OF THE FEDORENKO LAB</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scientists can’t say exactly how it happened. It’s possible that sometime long ago, perhaps due to a stroke before or shortly after birth, a portion of Elyse’s brain died and then ultimately disappeared, leaving behind only liquid — brain tissue swapped for a fluid-filled void. Her sister has one too.</p>



<p>Elyse and her sister, Martha M., who are not using their full names to maintain their anonymity, look and act perfectly ordinary. But each lacks most of a temporal lobe, and each in a different hemisphere. Elyse is also missing part of her brain stem. The women are two of who knows how many people living their lives without brain structures generally thought to be crucial.</p>





<p>Martha, now age 59, didn’t know her brain was different until she was a teenager. Elyse, who will turn 61 this year, found out in graduate school. Two sisters. Two brains. Two black holes. When MIT cognitive neuroscientist Evelina Fedorenko’s team first learned about the duo, “we were all kind of blown away,” she says.</p>



<p>Elyse emailed Fedorenko her brain images in 2016, decades after the void was discovered. She had read an article about neuroscience research at MIT and was curious if scientists would be interested. “She said, ‘I’m missing my left temporal lobe. Do you want to study me?’ ” Fedorenko remembers.</p>



<p>The left temporal lobe is generally thought to be essential for speech and language, and Fedorenko, who trained as a language researcher, was intrigued. Her lab hadn’t studied people like Elyse before, but “I’m a very adventurous scientist,” she says. So her team brought Elyse to the lab for tests.</p>



<p>Fedorenko didn’t know it at the time, but those first studies would set in motion a whirlwind that would alter the course of her research. Her team’s findings would ignite media attention, prompting even more people to send along their brain scans. What started as a single case study has now snowballed into <a href="https://web.mit.edu/~interestingbrains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Interesting Brains Project</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of this fall, the project will likely have scanned more than 40 people with atypical brains. In many cases, participants are missing entire brain regions, and like Elyse, they didn’t find out until they were adults.</p>



<p>That may be a tribute to the brain’s flexibility — its ability to change and adapt — including its redundancies, Fedorenko says. Like backup generators, some brain areas can kick into gear if others get injured. A close look at cases like Elyse’s could help scientists better understand how our brains cope with damage and why some kinds are worse than others.</p>



<p>For now, Fedorenko’s team is focusing on language and aspects of high-level cognition, such as a person’s capacity for general reasoning. But the effort could also offer insights into the workings of the brain more broadly and might one day give doctors a better sense of what outcomes a person with a brain injury might expect.</p>



<p>That’s what Elyse and Fedorenko hope, anyway. Before she started working with the MIT team, Elyse says, “I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.” Not anymore. These days, there’s a different word that comes to Elyse’s mind when she thinks about her brain. “It’s fabulous,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MRI turns up atypical brains</h4>



<p>Elyse first learned about her atypical brain after an MRI scan in the fall of 1987. She was 25 years old and in her first year of grad school in Washington, D.C., an avid reader and a whiz with a needle and thread.</p>





<p>At an appointment with a neurologist at the George Washington University Hospital, Elyse — who had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy despite never having a seizure — sensed mostly boredom from the doctor and an accompanying resident. They didn’t pay her much notice, she says.</p>



<p>That feeling evaporated when Elyse came back for her results. Now she had the doctors’ full attention. They leaned forward in their chairs, elbows on knees, chins in hands, eyes laser-focused on Elyse. “How do you feel?” she remembers them asking. She felt like a lab specimen — like a frog they were zapping with electrodes, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What the doctors had seen in her brain scan, of course, was that blatant black hole. When detected in babies, it’s the kind of lesion that makes parents fear the worst. In adults, strokes in the left hemisphere can steal people’s ability to read and write and jumble their speech. The meaning of words can slip suddenly from the mind, as if an eraser has scrubbed away a person’s mental dictionary. Elyse’s doctors, she remembers, were surprised she had more than a fifth-grade vocabulary.</p>



<p>At the time, Elyse felt sickened and scared. She didn’t know if the lesion was growing, if it foreshadowed early Alzheimer’s disease or if it was going to “explode in my head,” she says. A follow-up scan six months later eased her fears. The scan looked the same as the first. Her brain’s black hole wasn’t expanding.</p>



<p>Elyse never returned to those doctors, but she did get a second opinion that summer from her sister’s neurosurgeon. He had operated on Martha when she was 17, after she had noticed vision problems. The bulk of her right temporal lobe was gone, possibly due to a stroke in the womb. Fluid buildup in the brain was pressing against the nerves of her eyes, hindering her sight. “They drained it, and I went on my merry way,” Martha says. She hasn’t had the area drained since.</p>



<p>Martha’s doctor looked at Elyse’s scan and told her that as MRIs were becoming more common, doctors were finding other people with brains that diverged from the norm. “He said, ‘We’re seeing more and more deviations, and you’ve got one,’ ” she remembers.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Interesting Brains Project is born</h4>



<p>When Elyse and Fedorenko first met, Fedorenko was interested in how language areas wire up when a chunk of crucial tissue is missing. Her plan was to peek inside Elyse’s head using functional MRI, a technique that tracks blood flow in the brain. Functional MRI lets scientists see which parts of the brain are active while a person performs a specific task.</p>



<p>For Elyse, that means lying statue-still inside the giant tube of an MRI machine while equipment whirs around her. Depending on the task, Elyse may look at or listen to words, sentences and stories or see math problems or spatial puzzles. Occasionally, she’ll press a button so the team knows she’s staying alert.</p>



<p>Outside the tube, the researchers have also tested Elyse’s vocabulary, reading and writing skills, and intelligence. She scored near the top of every language test she took. “I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain,” Elyse jokes.</p>



<p>Elyse’s first scan with Fedorenko’s team revealed language activity in the right side of the brain, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported in 2022 in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>. Shifting functions to the right is one trick our brains use to deal with damage on the left, something other scientists have reported previously, Fedorenko says.</p>



<p>The team wondered if Elyse’s left frontal lobe might chip in too. Yes, Elyse lacks her left temporal lobe, Fedorenko says, but her left frontal lobe — where language also typically resides — is perfectly intact. “Is there any language going on there?” Fedorenko asked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>But that lobe showed no language-responsive areas at all. The findings hint at a neural order of operations for language development: Without Elyse’s left temporal lobe, language areas in her left frontal lobe couldn’t wire up.</p>



<p>Fedorenko’s team also revealed that Elyse completely lacks a typical region for reading words. The team thought such a region might show up in Elyse’s right temporal lobe. Instead, she appears to tap into a network of neurons across the visual cortex, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643294.2023.2164923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported this year in <em>Cognitive Neuropsychology</em></a>.</p>



<p>“It turns out you can have perfectly functional reading visual machinery in your brain that’s implemented in a different way,” Fedorenko says. Elyse may be the first reported example of this.</p>



<p>The findings from Elyse’s brain caught the attention of a reporter at <em>Wired</em> who wrote an article last year with an eyeball-grabbing headline: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/she-was-missing-a-chunk-of-her-brain-it-didnt-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She Was Missing a Chunk of Her Brain. It Didn’t Matter</a>.” Then the emails started pouring in.</p>



<p>The morning after the <em>Wired</em> story published, Fedorenko’s inbox was “filled with cool brain pictures — brains missing all sorts of big parts,” she says. In many cases, people found out about their atypical brains accidentally. Fedorenko heard stories about people with neck tension going in for an MRI and finding out they’re missing most of their right frontal lobe. Others, like Helen Santoro, have known about their brain lesions since they were little.</p>



<p>Santoro, a science journalist who reached out to Fedorenko after reading the <em>Wired</em> story, had a stroke before birth and was missing her left temporal lobe, like Elyse. Doctors said Santoro would never speak and would need to be institutionalized. “But month after month, I surprised the experts, meeting all of the typical milestones of children my age,” she wrote last September <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/science/brain-language-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an article about her experience</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear why some brain injuries slide by unnoticed while others demand attention, says neuroimaging scientist Helen Carlson. Her team at the University of Calgary in Canada has worked with kids who’ve had early strokes in the motor cortex, the brain region responsible for movement.</p>



<p>Some kids with large brain injuries have only minor weakness on one side of their body. Others with just “a little whisper of a smudge on their MRI … have quite profound disabilities for their entire life,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>That mismatch can be true of other difficulties too, including problems with language and general reasoning — and it’s one of several mysteries the Interesting Brains Project is pursuing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the brain adapts</h4>



<p>As of May 30, the Interesting Brains Project had scanned the brains of 30 people. Some have holes in their frontal or temporal lobes; others are missing parts of their cerebellum, a brain structure involved in balance and movement. Still other participants have brain matter that’s squished up against the sides of their skull; scans show voids that appear to have ballooned from the brain’s center.</p>



<p>These atypical arrangements can stem from cysts, surgery, strokes or excess fluid buildup in the brain. Some can result in a brain with much less neural tissue than usual — and sometimes the change can be abrupt. What happens when the brain needs to perform its same jobs but in a much smaller space, Fedorenko asks. “What are the solutions that our brains come up with when suddenly there’s a lot less turf to work with?”</p>



<p>A community of scientists has already dug up some answers by studying kids who have had perinatal strokes. In some of these cases, during a baby’s birth, or the weeks before and after, blood flow in the brain can cut off altogether, starving tissues of oxygen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“My brain is special, unique and interesting.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The brain can adapt to this injury, but it’s not a lump of clay with infinite potential. “Everybody thinks, ‘Oh, the brain is endlessly plastic,’ ” says Elissa Newport, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. But it tends to deal with damage in set ways.</p>



<p>Newport worked recently with a group of 15 kids and young adults who all had perinatal strokes that resulted in left hemisphere damage in an area that processes words and sentences. In nearly every case, the participants’ brains shifted language over to the same spots in the right hemisphere, Newport and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207293119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2022 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>



<p>It’s as if the language region has flip-flopped from left to right, “exactly the mirror image of what ordinary, typical brains look like,” she says. This pattern suggests that certain brain areas can serve as pinch hitters for language function.</p>

<p>But there’s still a universe of more questions, Fedorenko says. She’s curious if brain functions can overlap, sharing the same cortical machinery in an atypical brain when they might otherwise have set up shop in different locations. And a damaged left hemisphere doesn’t always mean language moves to the right. Sometimes language function stays behind, surviving on the fringes of the damaged region, Fedorenko says. “Nobody knows why that happens.”</p>



<p>Carlson and colleagues reported this kind of adaptation in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887899420302770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 in <em>Pediatric Neurology</em></a>. The team was studying young stroke patients who had perinatal strokes that hit the motor cortex. Carlson says the Interesting Brains Project is valuable because it could tell scientists more about plasticity in the brain at the individual level — how a specific person’s brain has adapted to injury.</p>



<p>Not every person’s brain is able to bounce back. What scientists learn from the project, along with individualized neuroimaging, could help with prognosis, and potentially rehabilitation. “Perhaps if we can tailor intervention options to an individual brain, they might be more effective,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>Getting results will take time. Fedorenko’s team is currently juggling experimental logistics, including scanning a new participant every one to two weeks, performing behavioral tests and analyzing data. Still, they’re seeing some interesting results, Fedorenko says, and hope to submit a paper this summer.</p>



<p>She hopes the project can showcase the range of solutions our brains can, in some cases, employ to deal with a slow or sudden loss of neural real estate. Maybe, she says, the project’s findings will help more people understand “how different you can be and still grow up and do amazing things.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a normal brain anyway?</h4>



<p>In an opening note in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedorenko’s 2022 paper in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>, Elyse wrote about how her brain’s structure doesn’t define her. “Please do not call my brain abnormal, that creeps me out,” she wrote. “My brain is atypical. If not for accidently finding these differences, no one would pick me out of a crowd as likely to have these, or any other differences that make me unique.”</p>



<p>Elyse hopes the message comes through for doctors and research scientists. “I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar,” she says.</p>



<p>One thing Elyse likes about working with Fedorenko’s team is that the research feels collaborative. Scientists rely on close partnerships like this to understand how the brain works under typical situations and how it may recover from injury, says Lesley Fellows, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies how brain damage affects decision making. People with atypical brains “can give us all kinds of great ideas we might not have thought about,” she says. “They have a unique vantage point.”</p>



<p>Elyse, for example, experiences smell hallucinations. She picks up whiffs of electrical fires whenever she’s under a lot of stress. “When I was in grad school, I would smell electrical fires three times a week,” she says. Elyse hasn’t yet explored this brain quirk with Fedorenko and her colleagues, but she’s open to their ideas for future investigations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For the team’s most recent study, reported in a preprint this year, Elyse, Martha and another sister (one with an “ordinary” brain) participated in hearing tasks inside the MRI tube. Fedorenko’s team wanted to find out <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.18.523979v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the left or right auditory cortex works when the other side is missing</a>.</p>



<p>You might think that the remaining auditory cortex would have to be enhanced somehow to pull double duty, perhaps taking up extra space, says Tamar Regev, a cognitive neuroscientist in Fedorenko’s lab. But that’s not what the team found.</p>



<p>In both Elyse’s and Martha’s brains, “activity looks completely neurotypical,” Regev says. That suggests there’s some redundancy to the brain’s auditory system, and that the development of one auditory cortex does not depend on the existence of the other.</p>



<p>Elyse is curious what other insights Fedorenko’s team will glean from her brain, and the brains of fellow Interesting Brains Project participants. “My brain is special, unique and interesting,” she wrote in the 2022 paper, “and I am excited that it can help neuroscientists understand the plasticity of the human brain.”</p>

<p>Holmes has two retractions in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHolmes%252c%2bRos">database</a>, both for plagiarism. </p>



<span id="more-127518"></span>



<p>The first retraction, from May of last year, was for “Bad Citizens and Symbolic Subjects: Wang Jin, Zhou Tiehai, and the Art of (In)civility,” originally <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/issue/view/13">published in 2019</a> in the <em>British Journal of Chinese Studies</em>. The journal removed the article from its website, but updated the <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/article/view/32">introduction</a> to the issue with a retraction notice that stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been alerted to the fact that this article uses phrases and ideas taken verbatim from a number of other scholars’ works without being properly cited. In many cases, the scholarship was also not included in the bibliography.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice also included nine references as the “most significant” sources Holmes had plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holmes’ other retraction to date came last October. “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/7/1/31/18049/RETRACTED-Meanwhile-in-China-Miao-Ying-and-the">Meanwhile in China … Miao Ying and the Rise of Chinternet Ugly,</a>” was published in 2018 in the journal <em>ARTMargins</em>. The <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/11/3/144/112388/Retraction-of-Holmes-Ros-2018-Meanwhile-in-China">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A reader conveyed concerns regarding the originality of parts of the author&#8217;s article in May 2022. The journal independently investigated the charges and verified them. Following Dr. Holmes&#8217;s admission of plagiarism in all the instances identified by the ARTMargins investigation, the journal informed the journals and authors whose work was left un-cited, as well as the Ethics Committee at the author&#8217;s university.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice said Holmes agreed to the retraction, and listed 24 sources she “failed to cite,” including Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of St Andrews’ online statement said it had begun the investigation after academic publishers “and other parties” raised concerns about the lecturer’s work in May and June of last year. The university said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation found incontrovertible evidence that the individual had used the texts and conclusions of other scholars and journalists in their published works without appropriate attribution, and that this amounted to plagiarism and research misconduct.</p>



<p>Over 70 instances of plagiarism, from a wide range of sources, were established across seven pieces of work published between 2014 and 2022.</p>



<p>The individual is no longer employed by the University of St Andrews.</p>



<p>The University is informing all relevant publishers and previous employers of the findings of the research integrity investigation and is grateful for the cooperation and support on which it has been able to rely throughout the investigatory process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/University-of-St-Andrews-Staff-Plagiarism-Investigation-Outcome.pdf">forwarded an email</a> from a university official that named Holmes as the lecturer referred to in the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KnwXZYPjq7UJ:https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/schoolpeoplepublic/html/build/4208b996-d70a-4ef6-9ef7-4ba3e2a957f1/rmh21/&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">cached version</a> of Holmes’ profile page&nbsp; at St Andrews indicates she joined the university in 2020 and was a lecturer in Chinese studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email to Holmes’ school email address was not returned as undeliverable, but we have not yet received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment, a university spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have published a statement on this matter on our website in which we have agreed not to name the individual out of concern for an ongoing health issue. All relevant publishers and previous employers are being informed, in keeping with our unwavering commitment to research integrity. University colleagues have also been made aware. We do not intend to comment further on this matter at this time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mass-moon-orbit-gravity-space">Mass has different definitions. The moon’s orbit confirms two are equivalent</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mass is mass is mass.</p>



<p>Physicists have three different definitions of mass, all thought to be equivalent. Measurements of the distance between Earth and the moon confirm that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.021401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of those masses are one and the same</a> to higher precision than ever before, physicists report July 13 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That result confirms one of the most basic foundations of physics: Newton’s third law of motion.</p>



<p>Inertial mass determines how easily an object accelerates in response to a force. Then there’s active gravitational mass, which determines the strength of an object’s gravitational field. Rounding out the trio is passive gravitational mass, which dictates the force on an object in a given gravitational field.</p>





<p>“It is a big question in physics why these masses are all the same,” says theoretical physicist Claus Lämmerzahl of the University of Bremen in Germany. So scientists want to be sure they aren’t slightly different.</p>



<p>Previously, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">MICROSCOPE experiment</a> confirmed the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational mass in tests aboard a satellite (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists compared active and passive gravitational masses for two elements found in different parts of the moon: iron in the core and aluminum in the crust.</p>



<p>Newton’s third law, often stated as “for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction,” suggests the iron’s gravitational pull on the aluminum should be the same as the aluminum’s pull on the iron.</p>



<p>If the active and passive masses were different, that would violate the rule and the uneven tug-of-war would alter the moon’s orbit. Based upon decades of laser measurements of the moon’s distance from Earth and its location in its orbit, the ratio of active and passive gravitational masses for the two materials were the same to about four trillionths of a percent, Lämmerzahl&nbsp; and colleagues report.</p>



<p>Finding a difference would also clash with Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. So the moon serves up a win not only for Newton, but for Einstein, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">Last week was the hottest ever recorded — here’s why we keep smashing records</a></h4>

              
                <p>Global temperatures are shattering records as El Niño and climate change compound.</p>



<p>On July 3, the planet sweltered as the average global temperature reached 17.01° Celsius (62.62° Fahrenheit), the highest ever recorded, according to data from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction. That surpassed the previous record of 16.92° C (62.46° F) from August 2016.</p>



<p>By the end of the week, that new record was tied or broken three more times, peaking on July 6 at 17.23° C (63.01° F). And Earth just experienced its hottest June ever recorded.</p>





<p>This time of year is usually when the average global temperature peaks. But the extraordinary nature of this year’s June and July probably stems from what’s going on in the big blue. Oceans around the world have grown alarmingly warm, thanks in no small part to human-caused climate change, researchers say. And El Niño, the recurring climate pattern known to temporarily heat the planet, has finally returned.</p>



<p>“We’ve really never had this set of circumstances before,” says atmospheric scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. “We’re entering uncharted territory.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hot oceans are a problem</h4>



<p>Much of the extreme heat we’re seeing goes back to the state of our oceans, says climate scientist Thomas Di Liberto of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, D.C. “The global ocean has just been so, so warm.”</p>



<p>Our planet&#8217;s seas have been warming for decades. The most recent decade has been the sea surface&#8217;s hottest since at least the 1800s. In April, the average surface temperature of the world’s oceans reached 21.1° C, the highest ever recorded. </p>



<p>It’s been particularly warm in the North Atlantic, where records are being broken by large margins. In April, sea surface temperatures there surpassed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">4 degrees C above what’s normal</a> for that time of year (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>). And in the Gulf of Mexico, the average surface temperature is more than 30° C, as of July 12, the highest recorded for this time of year since satellites began monitoring there in 1981. Both are examples of marine heat waves, persistent periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures.</p>



<p>Such heat waves currently plague about 40 percent of the world’s oceans. NOAA forecasts suggest that by September, <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marine heat waves could prevail across half the global ocean</a>, Di Liberto says.&nbsp; These extreme events have become about 50 percent more common over the last decade. Much of that warming has to do with climate change, he says. “We’ve juiced the system.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Marine heat waves June 13–July 12, 2023</h4>



<p>About 40 percent of the world’s oceans are currently afflicted by marine heat waves — persistent periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Their distribution can be seen on this map, which shows average sea surface temperature anomalies throughout the oceans from June 13 to July 12, 2023. More intense temperature anomalies are darker shades of red. </p>

<p>Hotter seas are a huge problem, says atmospheric scientist Marybeth Arcodia of Colorado State University in Fort Collins.</p>



<p>“The ocean is currently taking [in] about 93 percent of the heat associated with global warming,” Arcodia says. As the oceans warm, they become less capable of absorbing heat from the atmosphere, so that’s where it remains, raising the global temperature.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">El Niño has arrived</h4>



<p>Operating on top of this background of ocean warming is a natural climate cycle called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The phenomenon entails yearslong fluctuations in sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. These water temperature changes are controlled by equatorial air currents known as the trade winds.</p>



<p>During neutral ENSO conditions, the trade winds blow westward against the surface of the Pacific Ocean, pushing warm water toward Indonesia and triggering the upwelling of cold water from the ocean’s depths along the South American coast. When the trade winds blow especially strong, more warm water is pushed east. This part of the cycle is called La Niña. In March, the Earth exited three years of La Niña conditions, a relatively long-lived phase.</p>



<p>Then in June, La Niña’s counterpart, El Niño, got underway. Many scientists think that El Niño can be triggered by westerly wind bursts — anomalous winds that sometimes appear in the western Pacific, says physical oceanographer Regina Rodrigues of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. These bursts blow opposite to the trade winds and weaken them, she says, setting the stage for El Niño.</p>



<p>Unbidden by the westbound winds, warm water in the western Pacific sloshes back toward the Americas. Ocean upwelling along the tropical South American coast is stifled, and much of the tropical Pacific — which at the equator wraps halfway around the planet — becomes swaddled in a warm duvet of water, which can be hundreds of meters deep. That balmy layer exudes heat into the atmosphere, where much of it is trapped by the greenhouse gases that humans have emitted, raising the global temperature.</p>



<p>El Niño is typically associated with warmer global temperatures, while La Niña is often correlated with cooler temperatures, Arcodia says. “2016 is currently the hottest year on record,” she says. “That lines up with the strongest El Niño event on record.”</p>



<p>But El Niño and La Niña don’t always have predictable outcomes. For instance, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2020-was-earth-s-2nd-hottest-year-just-behind-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 was the second hottest year</a> on record, and it was during La Niña conditions, Arcodia says. That underscores the influence of climate warming on these record-breaking temperatures, she says.</p>



<p>While it’s probably safe to say that El Niño is exacerbating climate warming, it’s hard to say exactly how much the phenomenon’s return contributed to the recent unprecedented heat, Di Liberto, Rodrigues and Arcodia agree.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We’re just getting started</h4>



<p>This El Niño is still in its infancy. The climate pattern typically peaks during the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, so Earth has probably not yet felt the full brunt of the impact. That means the planet may be in store for even higher global temperatures later in July, Di Liberto says. Even later in the year, Earth will probably see more anomalously warm months as El Niño continues to strengthen.</p>



<p>Since the climate pattern hasn’t reached full force, it’s hard to draw comparisons with its past manifestations. But forecast models do suggest that there is a <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better than 50 percent chance</a> of this El Niño developing into a relatively strong one, Arcodia says. In such a scenario, the average temperature of the east-central tropical Pacific would temporarily reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C above normal. In early June, temperatures in that part of the Pacific were already 0.7 degrees C above normal.</p>



<p>It’s possible that the relatively long La Niña period we just exited might have set the stage for a strong El Niño, Rodrigues speculates. That La Niña spent three years packing the western Pacific with warm water, loading it like a spring, she says. Now, that spring has been released.</p>

<p>With El Niño exacerbating things, this year could become the hottest year on record. There’s about <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202305/supplemental/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 13 percent chance</a> that 2023 takes the title, and a nearly 90 percent chance that it’s among the top five on record, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information.</p>



<p>What’s more, some scientists are concerned that the El Niño could temporarily push global warming more than 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels for the first time, Rodrigues says.</p>



<p>Many experts have warned that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-limit-degrees-ipcc-climate-change">crossing that benchmark</a> could trigger irreversible changes in some parts of the planet (<em>SN: 10/7/18</em>). That could include the transformation of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">Amazon rainforest</a> and more widespread melting of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">Greenland</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">Antarctic ice sheets</a> (<em>SN: 6/16/23</em>;<em> SN: 11/9/22</em>; <em>SN: 2/15/23</em>). But because El Niño is a temporary phenomenon, it’s hard to say if, or how, the climate pattern might impact these elements, Rodrigues says.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a momentous experiment, she says. One with us, and the rest of life on Earth, stuck in the middle.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324005087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eight Bears</a><br><em>Gloria Dickie<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Bears have long been considered family. “Stories of a familial bear exist in almost every human culture that shares territory with the animal,” writes journalist Gloria Dickie in her new book, <em>Eight Bears</em>. </p>



<p>The Yakut people of eastern Siberia call brown bears “grandfather” and “uncle.” Shepherds in the French Pyrenees call the brown bear <em>la va-nu-pieds</em>, the “barefooted one,” a reference to its humanlike footprints. In Peru, the Ukuku is an Andes-traipsing man-bear hybrid in Quechua lore that steals away young women.</p>





<p>The ancient and recurrent history of humans recognizing bears as either spiritual or biological brethren sets the tone for the book, which provides rich lessons for understanding our ursine neighbors and how their lives have intertwined with our own.</p>



<p>That bears have had such a cultural grip on our species is impressive given their dearth of global diversity. As you might have guessed, there are only eight bear species: brown, black, sun, moon, polar, spectacled, sloth and giant panda. Dickie explores each in vivid detail, traveling across three continents to some of the places where they amble.</p>



<p>The settings Dickie presents — some remote, some urban — are marvelously rendered. She transports readers to the perilously steep ridgelines of the Andes, perpetually misty and buzzing with hummingbirds, and to Churchill, Canada, a subarctic town on an icy seashore sitting square in the path of migrating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-paws-traction-snow-microstructures-friction">polar bears</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/22</em>). Through these travels, Dickie weaves in each species’s unique stories — of decline, recovery and an uncertain future — and how humans have roped their own desires and ambitions to the bears, for better or worse.</p>



<p>Dickie expertly peppers her “ursine odyssey” with dry humor, augmenting the experience of encountering the bears, which oscillates from dopey to truly dangerous. One moment that stands out is when Dickie is preparing to visit the forest homes of Indian sloth bears and describes digesting jarringly matter-of-fact stories and photos of the aftereffects of maulings. But not to worry, a local biologist assures her “in a way that was meant to be comforting,” she will see more injuries like this where she is set to travel.</p>



<p>Such engaging insights into Dickie’s experiences elevate <em>Eight Bears</em> well above a patchwork of bear facts.</p>



<p>Though, there are facts aplenty. Dickie provides ample context on each species’s biology, ecology and historical (and sometimes prehistorical) relationship with humans. The robust accounting of so much about these animals is fascinating, though some forays into the evolutionary history of each branch of the bear family tree and the taxonomic identity of Paddington Bear and Baloo from <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disneys-jungle-book-resurrects-giant-extinct-ape">The Jungle Book</a> </em>can feel meandering (<em>SN: 4/3/16</em>). Still, Dickie excels in crafting a captivating and carefully considered mosaic of stories that will engross any reader interested in wildlife and wilderness.</p>



<p>One primary theme in <em>Eight Bears </em>is that many species inhabit woefully shrinking natural spaces. In the Andes, spectacled bears’ cloud forests risk ascending upslope into oblivion due to a warming climate. Polar bears are caught between <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-bering-sea-ice-winter-melt-lowest-level">rapidly dwindling sea ice</a> and a genetic tidal wave from hybridizing with brown bears that have started wandering poleward (<em>SN: 9/3/20</em>). Sloth bears are squeezed into smaller and smaller pockets of forest as human populations expand, leading to violent, tragic conflicts with people.</p>



<p>These eight bear species, Dickie shows, manage to capture the full range of people’s attitudes toward wilderness, from awe to exploitation, neglect to reverence. She illuminates radically varied consequences of humans placing political, social or economic value on bears. For instance, circumstances aligned for giant pandas to be useful in “panda diplomacy” as a political bargaining chip for China, thus feeding a cultural status and conservation investment the seven other bear species lack. Dickie’s honest and bleak accounts of moon and sun bears languishing on farms in Vietnam that collect bear bile to treat inflammation and high cholesterol present a far darker reality for some species.</p>



<p>There are relative success stories in which bears have bounced back into abundance, but that can present ongoing tension. In the United States, humans and black bears navigate coexistence at the wildland-urban interface (and national park trash cans). On the eastern flanks of the Rockies, brown bears lollop into territories gone bearless for decades due to intentional extermination, now saturated with farms and people.</p>



<p>In the end, Dickie warns that only three species — black, brown and panda bears — seem well-positioned to persist in the wild in the future. Losing animals whose lives have so closely paralleled our own would be like losing family, she writes. “And in some ways, we would lose a part of our own wildness. Without bears, the woods, and our stories, would be empty.”</p>

<p>An anesthesiologist who had his funding revoked for fabricating data has earned a fourth retraction for publishing the same data in two Springer Nature journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wen-fei Tan, an anesthesiologist at The First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, is the first author of the recently retracted paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-016-9974-x">Changes in the first postoperative night bispectral index of patients after thyroidectomy with different types of primary anesthetic management: a randomized controlled trial</a>,” published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC),</em> a Springer Nature journal, in 2017. It has been cited four times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-023-01045-x">retraction notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>

It shares four authors with the newly retracted article – Tan, Ma, Jin, and Lu – and was pulled for similar reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-021-01437-z">2021 retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reached out to Tan and Ma for more information, but have not heard back. We also contacted the editor of <em>JCMC</em> who has not responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loadsman <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/75E2D10B90BB43E5F9CB2871C807F3#1">had also posted</a> about the retracted <em>BMC Anesthesiology</em> paper that has the identical graph.

<p>I received the letter from editor several days ago. We checked the original data of this paper and found that we did use wrong data to make the figure. We connected with the editor and waiting for decision of next step.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Loadsman first started looking into the group of authors after receiving a submission from Wen-Fei Tan for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/AIC"><em>Anaesthesia and Intensive Care</em></a>, where Loadsman is editor-in-chief. Loadsman spotted extensive alterations in the clinical trial registration and anomalies in the raw data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr Tan&#8217;s efforts to refute my concerns were perplexing and unhelpful,” Loadsman wrote in an email. He decided to reject the paper, and shortly afterwards discovered it had already been rejected by another journal because of the data irregularities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2019, Tan submitted another problematic paper to <a href="https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652044"><em>Anaesthesia</em></a>. The editors’ review of the article described it as “scientifically nonsense”, calling out significant changes in data registered on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03570645?tab=history&amp;a=1#StudyPageTop">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. Tan confirmed the data were fabricated, according to the journal’s editor-in-chief, Andrew Klein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Klein contacted The First Hospital of China Medical University about his concerns with the paper, the reply from the institution came from Hong Ma, the chair of the anesthesiology department, and an author on the retracted papers mentioned previously, who wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have known all things from Dr. Tan and it is a very serious scandal of our department. We decided to treat this as follow:</p>



<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fired the statistics staff, and she is shamed of all thing and fall in deep depression.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stop the research of Dr. Tan group and withdraw the funding.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will not publish this paper in any magazine.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let all department and institute to know all this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this June, those same four authors of the two retracted papers, along with several other anesthesiologists from The First Hospital of China Medical University, earned another retraction for the paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-017-0074-3">Effects of ultrasound-guided stellate-ganglion block on sleep and regional cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery: a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial</a>,” published in 2017 in the<em> Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-023-01040-2">retraction notice</a> cited overlap between panels of data as the reason for the retraction.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geothermal-energy-africa-kenya-renewable-electricity">How Kenya is helping its neighbors develop geothermal energy</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The dusty town of Naivasha sits within the Great Rift Valley, where the African continent is being divided into two. About 90 kilometers northwest of Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi, Naivasha welcomes gaggles of tourists each year trekking to Hell’s Gate National Park. The forces that are splitting apart the African tectonic plate have sculpted the area’s steep cliffs, plummeting valleys and undulating hills — a rugged landscape that inspired the backdrop of Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>



<p>Those forces have also made Naivasha the frontier of Kenya’s geothermal power industry.</p>





<p>The country’s first geothermal well was drilled there in the 1950s. By 1981, Kenya had its first geothermal power plant, harnessing a renewable resource that taps into heat generated deep within the Earth. Today, Naivasha’s Olkaria geothermal power project plus a small facility at another site are capable of generating 963 megawatts of electricity when running at full power.</p>



<p>At the end of last year, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal energy countries in the world. Geothermal accounts for 47 percent of the country’s total energy production — a percentage that’s growing. The only other geothermal energy producer in Africa, Ethiopia, started production in 1998 and has an installed capacity of just 7.5 megawatts.</p>



<p>But regional interest is growing, especially as Africa works toward universal energy access by 2030, in accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Roughly 43 percent of the continent’s population, equaling about 600&nbsp;million people, lacks access to electricity. A 2021 analysis by the Dalberg consulting firm in partnership with the U.N. showed that there’s enough renewable energy potential to power Africa’s energy needs well into the future, though the up-front costs would be higher than if fossil fuels were used to meet those energy demands.</p>



<p>If African countries pursue renewable energy to meet their electricity goals, the up-front cost would be $1.5 trillion, about 50 percent more than the $1 trillion that fossils fuels would require, says James Mwangi, formerly of Dalberg and founder of the group Climate Action Platform for Africa. But thanks to lower operating and maintenance costs, renewables eventually pay off. In one scenario in the Dalberg analysis, a renewable-heavy future would take 13 years or so to break even with one where fossil fuels are still heavily used.</p>



<p>With the renewables route, Mwangi says, “Africa could reach universal energy access much faster and ultimately have the lowest energy costs in the world.” The localized nature of renewable sources, compared with often-imported fossil fuels, could also enhance energy security and independence.</p>



<p>In East Africa, geothermal energy is an attractive option. It’s abundant thanks to the East African Rift System, which brings heat toward the surface. Like other renewable energies such as wind and solar, geothermal doesn’t emit carbon dioxide. And it comes with extra benefits. “Geothermal power is reliable,” says Anna Mwangi, senior geophysicist at the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen, the government entity that operates Olkaria (and no relation to James Mwangi). Geothermal sources are available night and day, and don’t depend on the sun, wind or rain. So geothermal energy may be more resilient to climate change than some other renewables.</p>



<p>But setting up geothermal power plants requires more money and specialized expertise than other renewable energies. And like any development project, it can come with social costs, such as displacing people from their land.</p>



<p>Given its long-standing experience, Kenya is now assisting its neighbors. “We are offering technical support to the countries in the region, as a way to help them develop their geothermal potential,” says Anna Mwangi. KenGen has already drilled multiple geothermal wells in Ethiopia and Djibouti.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why East Africa is a geothermal energy hot spot</h4>



<p>Globally, geothermal resources are often found along the boundaries of tectonic plates, such as around the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire. In Africa, a bounty of geothermal resources exist where a new boundary is forming: the East African Rift System. The exact start of the system is not clearly defined; it originates on the Arabian Peninsula before running south along the Red Sea and into Djibouti. As it runs southward in Africa, the rift zone branches into two arms: The eastern arm ends at the border between Kenya and Tanzania while the western arm goes farther south, running 6,400&nbsp;kilometers through more than 10 countries before ending in Mozambique.</p>





<p>For millions of years, the African Plate has been pulled in opposite directions, at a rate of a few centimeters per year. Eventually, this stretching will split Africa into two separate continents and create two tectonic plates, the Nubian Plate to the west and the Somalian Plate to the east.</p>



<p>The stretching also causes magma to dome up in various points along the rift system. One such place is Olkaria in Naivasha. Beneath the surface, the molten rock heats groundwater. Wells bring that hot water and steam to the surface. When harnessed at high pressure and used to turn turbines, the steam generates electricity. The hot water is then injected back into the ground to recharge the subterranean water supply.</p>



<p>There’s no comprehensive estimate for how much total energy East Africa could harvest from geothermal sources. But experts estimate that Kenya and Ethiopia could each generate 10,000 megawatts. That’s roughly triple Kenya’s total installed electricity capacity and double Ethiopia’s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where’s the heat?</h3>



<p>The total worldwide installed capacity for generating electricity from geothermal energy is 16,000 megawatts. In 2022, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal countries.<br>Source: ThinkGeoEnergy Research 2023</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Top 10 geothermal countries (megawatts of installed capacity)</h5>

<p>*ThinkGeoEnergy’s tally of Kenya’s installed capacity, as of January 2023, differs slightly from KenGen’s.</p>
</div>



<p>For now, it’s mostly Kenya — one of the world’s fastest-growing geothermal power players — that has plumbed this deep heat. In addition to Olkaria, there’s a small site at the nearby Eburru geothermal field that can generate 2.4 megawatts of electricity. Farther to the north, a 35-megawatt power plant is expected to open this year at the Menengai geothermal field, with another one in development.</p>



<p>A push toward geothermal energy in recent years has come as droughts have dwindled some of Kenya’s hydropower sources. With rainfall and temperatures projected to become more erratic and extreme with climate change, geothermal energy may be the more dependable option, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>Geothermal power plants can run at maximum power output up to 90 percent of the time, when taking downtime due to maintenance into account, says François Le Scornet, president and senior market intelligence consultant at Carbonexit Consulting in France. That’s comparable to a nuclear power plant and about twice as reliable as a fossil fuel plant or wind farm (and four times as good as solar). Indeed, with the rise of geothermal energy, <a href="https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Feb/Global-geothermal-market-and-technology-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenya’s power outages have declined</a>, according to a report released in February by the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Geothermal Association.</p>



<p>The scalding-hot water and steam that flow up a geothermal well can do more than generate electricity; they can also be a direct source of heating. The <a href="https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2020/01055.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oserian flower farm near Naivasha</a>, for instance, pipes the water in to warm a greenhouse at night. The warmth dries out the air to prevent fungus from spoiling the roses, carnations and other flowers destined for bouquets around the world. At Olkaria, tourists in need of relaxation after a long day of exploring Hell’s Gate can soak in the geothermal spa near the power plant.</p>

Kamadi</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to find geothermal resources</h4>



<p>It takes a team of specialists to determine a site’s suitability for geothermal resource exploration. At minimum, what’s needed are the presence of groundwater, high temperatures — often around or above 150° Celsius — and permeable rock that will enable heated water and steam to flow into production wells, says Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geophysicist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo.</p>



<p>Certain visual characteristics on the surface may give an initial hint. Hot springs, hot mud puddles, geysers and even steam rising from the ground are signs of geothermal activity. Another clue is the presence of certain rocks, such as travertine, or mineral veins like quartz that indicate rock has been altered during interactions with hot water.</p>



<p>At Olkaria, a tip-off was the fact that the surrounding area is ring-shaped like a caldera, a collapsed volcano. A series of younger volcanic domes appear to have intruded into the caldera.</p>



<p>If the surface characteristics look promising, geochemists will step in to analyze fluid and gas samples to estimate how deep and hot the heat source might be and where the fluids flow. Seismometers might be deployed to infer the brittleness of the subsurface rock. It’s important that rock be permeable, but it needs to be strong enough to withstand the interaction of cool water being heated from the magma below.</p>



<p>If all those data look promising, exploration drilling will commence and if all goes well, a production well and eventually a full-blown power plant will follow.</p>



<p>Zaher and his colleagues recently completed a project that might help experts across the continent zero in on potential geothermal targets before starting costly on-the-ground exploration. “It is quite difficult to predict the precise power or electricity that can be produced for all of Africa,” he says. But his group incorporated a range of geologic, seismic and other geophysical data into a geographic information system to predict the most promising spots for geothermal exploration. The resulting map identifies <a href="https://geothermal-energy-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40517-022-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 areas that have high geothermal potential</a>, the team reported last year in<em> Geothermal Energy</em>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many of these locations are within the East African Rift System, though high potential also exists in northern Africa in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, as well as in Liberia, Namibia, Zambia and South Africa. In many of those countries, the tectonics are such that using geothermal energy for direct heating — as is done at the Oserian flower farm and could be applied in a variety of settings, including industrial processing — may be more feasible than for electricity generation, Zaher says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Work beyond Kenya</h4>



<p>KenGen has led on-the-ground geothermal exploration in a number of nearby countries. In addition to the drilling done in Ethiopia and Djibouti, surface studies to identify potential geothermal resources have been done in Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and the Comoros islands off the coast of Mozambique, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>In addition, KenGen — in collaboration with the Icelandic-based GRÓ Geothermal Training Programme and Kenya’s Geothermal Development Company — has been training university students, energy professionals and government officials within East Africa on geothermal resource exploration and development, as well as power plant financing and management. With help from the World Bank, Kenya is also setting up the Geothermal Centre of Excellence, which will train professionals in the region once it opens in a couple years, Mwangi says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deep-seated power</h3>



<p>Comprehensive estimates of geothermal energy potential are not available for all East African countries. But the estimates that do exist suggest there’s room for growth. </p>

</div>



<p>Even with the right technical knowledge, though, it can take several years to go from exploration to geothermal energy production. In fact, even once a well has been drilled, it could still take up to a decade or more before a power plant is up and running. Funding constraints can be one barrier.</p>



<p>This is what Kenyan engineers were faced with in 2012, Mwangi says. Wells had already been drilled, yet funding for putting up power plants to generate electricity at full capacity was still unavailable.</p>



<p>This opened an avenue for experimentation. Typically, a power plant is supplied with water and steam from multiple wells at varying distances away. But a new wellhead approach, which hadn’t been implemented anywhere in the world, allowed for the generation of power directly and quickly from a single well, at low cost, in the meantime.</p>



<p>Once a permanent power plant is ready to be built, the wellhead installation can be disassembled and taken to another well for the same purpose. About 85 megawatts of power have been produced this way in Kenya. “Such well-based power plants give us the early generation benefit, and generate revenue in the meantime,” Mwangi says. “Otherwise, these production wells would have remained capped awaiting construction and commissioning of a new power plant.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The costs of geothermal energy</h4>



<p>Even as interest and expertise in geothermal energy grow in East Africa, financial constraints remain an impediment. In Kenya, a single geothermal well can cost about $6 million to drill, and it can be another $300 million to build a roughly 165-megawatt plant.</p>



<p>“Up-front capital cost is high in geothermal, but running costs are limited,” says Le Scornet, the energy consultant.</p>



<p>The worldwide levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE, for a new geothermal installation in 2021 averaged $0.068 per kilowatt-hour, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The LCOE is the lowest price at which electricity can be sold for an energy project to break even. The figure takes into account lifetime costs, from building a plant to operating and maintaining it.</p>



<p>Geothermal’s LCOE is about 40 percent higher than a new hydropower project or solar photovoltaic array, which have an LCOE of $0.048 per kilowatt-hour. An onshore wind farm is about half as expensive, at $0.033 per kilowatt-hour, but geothermal energy is slightly less costly than an offshore wind farm’s $0.075 per kilowatt-hour. (For context, Kenya’s per capita energy consumption in 2019 was about 168 kilowatt-hours, according to the U.N.)</p>

<p>Le Scornet says that stable financing mechanisms are needed to provide stability and reduce actual and perceived project risks. To tackle this challenge, the <a href="https://grmf-eastafrica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility</a>, funded by the European Union and the African Union, was set up in 2012 to cofinance surface studies and drilling programs.</p>



<p>“Support from project partners like the EU, for instance, and the African Development Bank can be instrumental, especially in countries with high debt levels and where competition with alternative projects presents obvious challenges for the development of new geothermal projects,” Le Scornet says.</p>



<p>But not all costs are purely financial. Kenya’s Olkaria project demonstrates one of the social costs. In developing and expanding the project over time, some members of the local Maasai community, a seminomadic pastoralist group, have been removed from their land, says Ben Ole Koissaba, lead consultant for Rarin Consulting Services, which champions for the land rights of Indigenous communities. Relocated people “have been cut off from the rest of the community,” says Koissaba, who is a member of the Maasai. And some of the housing built for them has not been culturally appropriate, he says.</p>



<p>While some of the Maasai consider the displacement an outstanding issue, Kenya’s geothermal exploration isn’t slowing down. By 2025, the country aims to more than double its current production capacity to 2,500 megawatts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronal-rain-sun-space">Coronal rain has been seen splashing on the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>Plasma rain in the sun’s atmosphere makes a splash when it lands. New observations from the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter have revealed <a href="https://nam2023.org/press-releases/279-solar-astronomers-discover-shooting-stars-on-the-sun-s-corona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously unseen details</a> of how this coronal rain falls, including bright fireball effects and sudden upward surges in plasma.</p>



<p>“These are the highest resolution images we have ever obtained from the solar corona,” says solar physicist Patrick Antolin of Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He presented the results at the National Astronomy Meeting in Cardiff, Wales, the week of July 3 and in a paper <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/202346016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be published in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em></a>.</p>





<p>The corona is the sun’s wispy upper atmosphere, the sizzling tangle of plasma and magnetism that is visible during a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2019-total-solar-eclipse-south-america">total eclipse</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/19</em>). When clumps of scorching-hot plasma in the corona suddenly cool, they condense and fall toward the solar surface, just like water droplets in Earth’s atmosphere. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plasma-rain-sun-atmosphere-falls-surprising-places">coronal rain</a> has been observed before, but details of its formation and falling were fuzzy (<em>SN: 5/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones">2020 launch of Solar Orbiter</a> promised to change that (<em>SN: 2/9/20</em>). The probe is making passes over the sun’s unexplored polar regions, carrying high resolution cameras and other instruments to investigate solar mysteries. In late March 2022, Solar Orbiter made its closest approach to the sun to date, swooping within 49 million kilometers of our star — about a third of the distance between the sun and Earth.</p>



<p>In images from the spacecraft taken during that close encounter, Antolin and colleagues discovered a new feature in the coronal rain. As the plasma raindrops fell, the region immediately below them brightened. The researchers think the brightening came from other plasma below the falling rain getting compressed and heated, similar to the way meteors in Earth’s atmosphere can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-explodes-over-russia">create fireballs</a> just ahead of the falling rocks (<em>SN: 2/15/13</em>).</p>



<p>“This is the first time we’ve seen that kind of compression from the rain falling this clearly,” says Emily Mason, a solar physicist at Predictive Science, a research company based in San Diego, who was not involved in the study. “The resolution just wasn’t there before.”</p>



<p>Antolin and colleagues also saw a rebound and upward flow of material after coronal raindrops smacked onto the chromosphere, the thin layer of plasma that lies between the sun’s visible surface and the corona.</p>



<p>“This rain is as dense as the chromosphere,” Antolin says. “It can fall to the chromosphere and then make a splash.” This sort of splash was predicted in computer simulations but had never been observed on the actual sun before.</p>



<p>On their own, the observations won’t directly solve the biggest solar mysteries, like why the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">diffuse corona sizzles at millions of degrees</a> Celsius higher than the surface of the sun (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). But more observations of the same phenomena can help figure out details of the coronal environment, like how easily its gas compresses, or what its chemical composition is.</p>



<p>“We are not able to send a probe to the inner part of the corona because it’s so hot,” Antolin says. “So we can use these observations as indirect probes of the local environment.”</p>



<p>The observations are “an important litmus test for Solar Orbiter itself,” Mason says. “It’s good to see what Solar Orbiter is capable of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">Wildfires aren’t going away. Here’s how smoke can affect your health</a></h4>

              
                <p>North America’s summer of smoke may well be a harbinger of what’s to come. As record-breaking wildfires in Canada continue to sweep across the land, smoke has been suffusing the skies for more and more people. Frequent fires like these can mean more smoke inhaled, and over longer periods of time.</p>



<p>What are the health consequences of breathing in this fumy miasma? I asked three experts.</p>



<p>Air pollution exposure scientist Jeffrey Brook’s office at the University of Toronto is roughly 500 kilometers from some of the raging blazes that have engulfed more than 8 million hectares in Canada this year. Even at that distance, the air has been bad, he says, shrouding the city in noxious gasses and tiny particles of burned biomass. “It’s the worst particulate matter air quality I’ve seen in 30 years or more,” Brook says.</p>





<p>When I reach him, he’s on a boat on the eastern end of Lake Ontario. All around, the air is hazy from wildfire smoke; he can just make out the shoreline. Driving there from Toronto, Brook felt like he was moving through a curtain, he says.</p>



<p>Some 800 kilometers south, where atmospheric scientist Katelyn O’Dell works at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the scene has been less apocalyptic, but it can change abruptly. Some days, you can see and smell smoke in the air, and “the sky doesn’t even look blue,” she says.</p>



<p>From across the continent, at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, environmental epidemiologist Sarah Henderson says those smoky scenes look all too familiar. “We’re no strangers to wildfire smoke,” she says. In previous years, the region has seen extreme episodes driven by fires in the Pacific Northwest.</p>



<p>These three scientists have been studying the health effects of wildfire smoke for years. They talked with me about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">how smoke impacts our health, what questions remain</a> and what researchers might be able to learn from the current fires <em>(SN: 9/18/20)</em>. Our conversations have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why are scientists focusing on wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>The wildfire season has been expanding, so it&#8217;s impacting us more throughout the year. [And] wildfire smoke is different than the typical urban smog that has been studied historically.</p>



<p>[That smog], emissions from traffic and industry, has been decreasing due to successful emissions control policies — and those are projected to continue to decrease. Because those are going down and wildfire smoke is going up, it’s really important for us to study wildfire smoke and its impacts on health.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How can wildfire smoke affect people’s health?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>Wildfire smoke is a really complex form of air pollution. And we have decades of research that tells us exposure to air pollution isn&#8217;t good for us. <strong></strong></p>





<p>What we know at this point is that when smoke is occurring, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">there are measurable effects</a> in the population almost immediately <em>(SN: 6/17/22)</em>. Respiratory effects, especially for people with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], are the first things to happen. We generally see that these people need more of their rescue medications, meaning that their airways are closing up.</p>



<p>The magnitude of that impact in those populations seems to be larger for wildfire smoke than for other types of air pollution. We [also] see small detriments to cognitive performance.</p>



<p>And then [there’s] quite a bit of evidence around impacts to the developing fetus. There’s risk of preterm birth and reductions in birth weight for infants who are exposed in utero.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>People will say, “Oh, it&#8217;s natural. It&#8217;s campfire smoke, it&#8217;s OK.” No, it&#8217;s not. [Wildfire smoke] contains some of the same toxicants that we think about all the time as bad ones in air pollution.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s in wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> There are multiple pollutants in wildfire smoke that can impact health, but the one that we&#8217;re typically most concerned with is the fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5. PM 2.5 is a particle in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> Those [are] particles that can travel deep into the lungs.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> Wildfire smoke has a lot of gases in it too. Things like formaldehyde, benzene and sometimes ozone.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-air-pollution-ozone-shutdown">Ozone negatively impacts respiratory health</a> <em>(SN: 1/4/21)</em>. It&#8217;s unclear right now if benzene and formaldehyde are often at [dangerous] levels in smoke plumes, but we do know these pollutants at certain levels can negatively impact health from both short-term and long-term exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gauging air quality&nbsp; <strong></strong></h3>



<p>The Air Quality Index, or AQI, ranges from 0 to 500, based on the amount of pollution in the air at a given time. Ground-level ozone, particulate matter (both PM<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are the primary parameters considered in the index. Code orange (above a score of 100) is unhealthy for people in sensitive groups. Code red and above (151–500) is unhealthy for everyone.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What questions do researchers still have about the health effects of wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> If you have a wave of wildfire smoke multiple times every summer, how does that affect your health in the long term? It’s a very important question [and] an open area of research right now.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>It&#8217;s a slightly more challenging question to address because you might have a population that&#8217;s exposed for a couple of weeks, at a really high magnitude for one summer, and then for the next three summers, there&#8217;s no smoke and everything&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>That intermittent episodic nature of exposure might mean that [the longer-term effects of wildfire smoke] are quite different from the more steady types of air pollution that affect our air quality, day in and day out.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re still learning about what that means. We might be seeing kids, if they are exposed very early in life, [with] a lifelong detriment to their lung function.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>What if you happen to be pregnant and the fetus is at a particularly important part of development? If it’s getting really high [smoke] exposure coupled with stress because the mom’s worried about the high exposure, [could] that alter how certain organs – lungs, brain, heart – develop? We don’t know.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> [Another] open question is how the health impacts of fresh smoke differ from old smoke [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c04497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than three days old</a>]. There are a few reasons [the impacts] might be different, one being chemical changes in the smoke itself — smoke changes as it travels through the atmosphere. Another major factor is the public’s awareness of smoke. If you live close to where the fire is burning, you’re very aware that there is likely smoke. But [people] farther away, might be less aware and maybe take less action to protect their own health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn from the current wildfires?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>These fires are impacting a different population than have historically been predominantly studied. A lot of the wildfire and health studies have occurred in the western United States. This event that we&#8217;re experiencing right now [will] hopefully allow us to have a greater understanding of how wildfire smoke might impact people in the eastern states.</p>



<p>There are many factors that may lead to a different health response for those out east compared with those out west, including different baseline disease rates or levels of pre-existing conditions, different responses to smoke, level of outdoor activity, et cetera.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>What we need [are] populations that are resilient to these exposures, populations that know how to take protective measures, and policies that look at how we keep smoke out of the indoor environment to ensure that people are protected when they&#8217;re indoors. All of those types of things are going to allow us to be resilient to the smoke exposures in the decades ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can people do to protect themselves from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>[In our current lifestyle], the vast majority of us spend the vast majority of our time inside. If we are effectively reducing smoke in the indoor environment, we are effectively protecting our health for about 90 percent of the time. </p>



<p>We highly recommend that you have some sort of air cleaning device running in at least one room of the home so that you have kind of a smoke-free haven — especially the bedroom because you&#8217;re probably going to be there for at least eight hours of the day.</p>



<p>Then we can look to what happens when you’re outdoors. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">A well-fitted respirator type mask like an N95 or KN95</a> will effectively filter the particles of wildfire smoke out and probably some of the gases as well <em>(SN: 2/12/21)</em>.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a good idea to check the local air quality before you undergo any outdoor activity, and then adjust your behavior accordingly. If you really need to be outside, maybe go for a walk instead of a run, and wear a mask if it&#8217;s really bad. And if you&#8217;re in an extra-sensitive group — children, the elderly, people with preexisting conditions — you might choose to stay indoors on days that are especially smoky.</p>



<p>At the local government level, it’s good to have plans in place for when there is smoke. Do schools cancel recess? Do we open clean-air shelters for people who aren&#8217;t able to have clean air in their homes — or maybe don’t have a home — to protect that vulnerable set of the population?</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>A key principle we always follow in environmental protection is to set our policies to protect the most vulnerable. It’s always good to be cautious. If you’re healthy, smoke is a little piece of many things in your life that impact your health. But if you’re compromised, maybe you’ve got a respiratory infection or just had a heart attack or some other condition, smoke could really hinder [your] recovery.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How worried should we be about wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>We should be more worried about climate change. When you look at Canada, we’ve had fire impacts from coast to coast this year. I’ve never seen that. It’s just unprecedented. It&#8217;s a wake-up call. Like, hey folks, you&#8217;ve been hearing that these things are going to happen. And look, they’re happening sooner, they’re happening faster. Look at your air. This is not just bad luck.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>In the western United States and even in parts of Canada, [wildfires] have been increasing over the past several decades due to several factors. In the United States, one [factor is] historical fire suppression tactics, but another [is] anthropogenic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">climate change</a> <em>(SN: 6/9/23). </em>And those increases in fires, and the smoke that they emit, is expected to continue to increase across the coming century.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> &nbsp;There are people who live their daily lives in cities that are about as polluted as some of the cities we&#8217;ve seen in eastern North America over the past month. On one hand, humans are quite resilient to air pollution exposure, and on the other hand, air pollution exposure is not good for people. We need to find a balance somewhere in the middle that doesn&#8217;t make people feel panicked, [and] makes them feel empowered to make the best possible decisions for themselves in their health.</p>

<p>The German anesthesiologist <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dBoldt">Joachim Boldt</a> has lost 20 more papers since January 2023, earning him the top spot in our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>, with 184 retractions. </p>



<p>Boldt, readers may recall, was once one of the leading international figures in perioperative medicine. His work, particularly studies involving the use of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">fluid management</a> during surgery, helped inform clinical guidelines that, thanks to his misdeeds, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.362.6413.394-a">some experts believe</a> may have put patients at risk for serious harm and even death.</p>



<p>Boldt has vaulted over another anesthesiologist, Yoshitaka Fujii, to take the crown (more on that in a moment) – although one might fairly ask: Why did it take so long?</p>



<span id="more-127491"></span>



<p>The bulk of the recently retracted papers appeared in <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/134"><em>Intensive Care Medicine</em></a>, a European title published by Springer Nature. Since March, the journal has pulled 15 articles by Boldt, whose misdeeds – including but not limited to fabrication of data and lack of ethics approval in his clinical trials – first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">came to light</a> in 2010. Five more came in the journal <em>Chest</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s one<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07133-5"> notice</a>, for “Right ventricular function and cardiac surgery,” which <em>Intensive Care Medicine</em> published in June 1988. (Note that the statement from Justus Liebig University <a href="https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(20)30163-X/pdf">dates to 2020</a>.)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. A statement by Justus Liebig University (JLU) [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4#ref-CR1">1</a>] on the scientific credibility of articles by Joachim Boldt has recommended that journal editors consider retracting all articles “where Boldt is the responsible author even if there is no obvious indication of falsification”. Given the concerns about the studies performed by Joachim Boldt the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the work reported in this article. J. Boldt has not responded to correspodence [sic] from the Publisher about this retraction. The Publisher was not able to obtain a current email address for T Wollbrück, S. Sonneborn, A. Welters and G Hempelmann.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited seven times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. The new retracted article with the most citations (27) is “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4">Thrombomodulin in intensive care patients</a>.” Of those, eight came in the years since the Boldt scandal broke, and once came after 2020, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the editor of the journal about the delay. He passed us along to someone else at Springer Nature, who didn’t reply. We eventually got this statement from a spokesperson for the publisher:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors of Intensive Care Medicine and its publisher Springer Nature have been aware of concerns regarding the integrity of the work of Joachim Boldt for some time. When we were first made aware of the concerns we carefully investigated – in line with COPE best practice &#8211; and acted to retract nine articles by Boldt in 2011. A further three articles were retracted in 2020; these were review articles which were deemed to be unreliable as their content relied on articles reporting studies that had been retracted. However, a number of papers by Boldt remained unretracted as our investigations were unconclusive and the allegations could not be confirmed.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the Editors were made aware of a statement by Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU) recommending the retraction of any article for which Boldt is a responsible author. Upon further assessment, the journals Editors and the Springer Nature Research Integrity Team decided to proceed with the retraction of the remaining articles where Boldt is the responsible author. These retractions are in the process of being completed.</p>



<p>We are committed to maintaining the integrity of the scientific record, and although evidence of fraud cannot be ascertained in all cases, the Editors and Springer Nature considered it prudent to proceed with these retractions and warn readers about the unreliability of this research, in line with the recommendations of Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We wondered about the journal’s investigation into “unconfirmed allegations” against Boldt and why the letter from JLU would have affected those investigations, but did not receive a reply to that follow-up question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, at this point, we need to make something of an apology. For the last several years, we have listed the number of retractions attributed to Yoshitaka Fujii as 183. (We also included this figure in a <a href="https://nautil.us/how-the-biggest-fabricator-in-science-got-caught-235421/">2015 article for Nautilus</a>.)</p>



<p>That figure came from the list of Fujii’s paper investigators – from the Japanese Society of Anesthesiology in particular – had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/15/retraction-record-broken-again-university-report-should-up-fujii-total-to-183/">marked for retraction</a>. But as we know all too well, journals don’t always act, even when asked. More than a decade after that report, and now that the dust has (mostly) settled, we have records of only 172 retractions.</p>



<p>Although Boldt now beats the incorrect 183, and while Fujii was indeed the most-retracted researcher until Boldt’s recent bolus, details are important. We’ve updated our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> accordingly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canada-crawford-lake-beginning-anthropocene">Canada’s Crawford Lake could mark the beginning of the Anthropocene</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists are one step closer to defining a new chapter in geology, one in which humans have become the dominant driver of Earth’s climate and environment.</p>



<p>Out of 12 locations around the world, Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada, has been selected as the site that would mark the official beginning of the Anthropocene, a proposed geologic epoch starting in the 1950s, researchers announced at a July 11 news conference during the&nbsp;<a href="https://climate-conference.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Planck Society Conference for a Sustainable Anthropocene</a> in Berlin.</p>





<p>The lake bottom’s sediments hold one of the most precise records of humans’ alteration of Earth, including upticks in plutonium from nuclear weapons testing, ash from burning fossil fuels as well as heavy metals and microplastics.</p>



<p>But the Anthropocene isn’t an official geologic epoch yet. Now, several more committees must approve of the proposed epoch before it can be added to the geologic time scale. Doing so would end the nearly 12,000-year-old Holocene Epoch, which encompasses the rise of humankind since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Scientists first started using the term <em>Anthropocene</em> in the early 2000s to refer to the ongoing time of humans altering the planet on a global scale. Although framed in terms of geology, the Anthropocene lacked a formal geologic definition.</p>



<p>Still, the idea spread. “It exploded so quickly into other disciplines without it being defined,” says earth scientist Simon Turner of University College London. So “that’s what we’ve been trying to do ever since.”</p>



<p>In 2009, the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the scientific group responsible for defining geologic time, convened a committee to characterize the Anthropocene and see whether it deserved a spot on the geologic time scale. Over a decade later, that committee has now chosen Crawford Lake out of the 12 candidate sites as the Anthropocene’s “Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point,” a reference site that shows a change in its rock, ice or other layers to mark the beginning of a new geologic time.</p>



<p>From coral to ice to peat, each of the candidate sites holds a remarkable record of human activity in its layers. Selecting Crawford Lake was “like choosing a favorite child,” says Turner, secretary and a voting member of the committee.</p>



<p>Among the locations, Crawford Lake’s muddy layers have trapped one of the most precise histories of human activity. Each summer, the water’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20530196221149281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pH and warm temperatures cause mineral crystals to form near the top of the water</a>. The crystals fall to the lake’s bottom like snow, where they lay undisturbed. “You get these lovely stripes,” Turner says. “And you can resolve what year [they’re from] pretty much by counting backwards from the surface layer, like a tree ring.”</p>



<p>The layers capture a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-blasts-other-human-activity-signal-new-epoch-anthropocene">radioactivity and other evidence of human activity starting in the early 1950s</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/16</em>).</p>



<p>But not all scientists agree that the Anthropocene began merely 70 years ago, or that it should be defined as a geologic term at all. “Any time you draw a hard line in the geologic record or in any other system, you’re creating a binary —&nbsp;there’s a before and there’s an after,” says paleoecologist Jacquelyn Gill of the University of Maine in Orono. “We know human impacts began well before 1950.”</p>



<p>Retaining an informal&nbsp;and flexible concept, like what’s used now in disciplines beyond geology, might be more beneficial, she adds. “It’s more powerful as a tool in that way,” Gill says, “than it is to try to confine it or constrain it to a narrow definition that then creates confusion about everything that came before.”</p>





<p>Still, attempting to define the Anthropocene in geologic terms underscores humanity’s rapid and intense impact on the planet, Turner says. “We’ve become a geological force.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thermal-cloak-material-temperature">This ‘thermal cloak’ keeps spaces from getting either too hot or cold</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever burned your hands on a car steering wheel, you know how hot the inside of a car can get on a summer day. But a new fabric could one day help cars and other objects stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>



<p>Researchers created a prototype of the fabric, which <a href="https://cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(23)00008-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acts as a “thermal cloak”</a> that keeps the space underneath it from getting too hot or too cold. The cloak, described in the July 11 <em>Device</em>, doesn’t require an external power source, which could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reduce energy consumption</a> associated with heating and cooling (<em>SN: 9/28/18)</em>.</p>





<p>Globally, heating and cooling make up <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101427X#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20HVAC%20consumption%20represents,as%20the%20UE%20or%20Russia." target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent of energy use in buildings and 12 percent of total energy consumption</a>. Materials like this thermal cloak could help keep us comfortable during heat waves while reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity used in temperature control, says Aaswath Raman, an applied physicist at UCLA who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In the new study, Kehang Cui, an engineer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and colleagues built the cloak using two layers. The outer layer is made of white silica fibers that reflect visible light, coated with hexagonal boron nitride, a ceramic material that reflects ultraviolet light and helps dissipate heat. Together, the silica fibers and boron nitride reflect 96 percent of the sunlight that hits the fabric. At the same time, the outer layer absorbs heat from the surrounding area and emits that energy as infrared light, which also lowers the temperature under the cloak through a process called radiative cooling.</p>



<p>Though the outer layer keeps the space under the cloak cooler for longer than an uncovered area, the cloaked space slowly warms up throughout the day. The inner layer, made of aluminum foil, keeps the space warm at night by trapping some of that heat inside, similar to an insulating survival blanket.</p>



<p>The researchers tested the cloak material’s durability under several extreme conditions. They baked the fabric at 800° Celsius, just about hot enough to melt table salt. They also exposed it to extreme cold by dunking it in liquid nitrogen, subjected it to the same amount of vibration as a rocket launch, doused it in acid and blasted it with fire from a butane torch — all with virtually no changes to the material’s structure or performance. This extreme durability might lend itself to use in spacecraft or extraterrestrial environments, the team says.</p>



<p>To see the fabric in action, Cui and colleagues built a full-size prototype cloak and tested it on an electric car. On a summer day in Shanghai, the cloak kept the car at about 23° C — up to 8 degrees C lower than the outside temperature and 28 degrees C lower than the inside of an uncloaked car. The cloak also kept the car about 5 degrees C warmer than the outside air on a winter night.</p>



<p>The cloak “definitely shows the capability of saving energy, but the next step is that we want to demonstrate it in even larger-scale field tests [such as rooftops] to see the impact on our daily lives,” Cui says.</p>

                <p>Lauren Schroeder has loved dinosaurs since age 3 and bones since she was 10. In her second year of university, she started studying the early evolution of the <em>Homo </em>genus and it turned into her Ph.D. Many fossils have taken her breath away, she says, but a 2-million-year-old <em>Homo habilis </em>skull holds such a special place in her heart that it’s tattooed on her forearm.</p>



<p>“I think I can safely say that I&#8217;m doing what I wanted to do,” she says.</p>

<p>As a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, Schroeder works to untangle the various processes by which humans have evolved. One such process, natural selection,&nbsp;is adaptive: Changes in an organism’s features make it more suited to its environment. But some changes are not selected for, or even totally random. Despite the existence of “nonadaptive” processes, paleoanthropology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has often attributed</a> evolutionary changes in hominids to adaptation alone.</p>



<p>While a Ph.D. student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, Schroeder questioned the emphasis on natural selection to explain changes seen in the fossil record. “It was very clear that something was missing,” she says. Not much research had considered the role played by nonadaptive processes, such as genetic drift and gene flow.&nbsp;“That was really the big moment for me … these are important questions that haven&#8217;t really been asked. I should try to answer them.”</p>





<p>Since then, her research has suggested that nonadaptive processes play a much bigger role in evolution than previously realized.</p>



<p>“All aspects of Lauren’s research have been consequential for the discipline,” says Benjamin Auerbach, a biological anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “We’re witnessing maybe a change in the way we talk about human evolution.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of chance</h4>



<p>Schroeder’s research centers around questions of how and why body features in humans (or other animals) — called “morphology” — came to be.</p>



<p>They are hard questions to answer, in part because fossils often don’t contain usable DNA. Paleoanthropologists rely on patterns in the morphology, established theory and statistical analyses to try to understand the evolutionary processes at play. It’s math “all the way through,” Schroeder says —&nbsp;which is good, because she adores math.</p>



<p>Before the math, Schroeder measures the features of the fossils. During her Ph.D. research, she traveled across Africa to scan and analyze fossil <em>Homo </em>skulls dating from 2.8 million years ago until just tens of thousands of years ago. Some features of the skulls showed a strong adaptive signal, including the jaw; that means that early <em>Homo</em> jaw shape probably evolved via natural selection, driven by a changing diet. </p>



<p>But surprisingly, when Schroeder looked at the results for the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841630152X?casa_token=sK6RMWS3q8UAAAAA:8FlfRoRlTg_7tEoFdQ63zifQXHv_JpzFHDW90IYcBrjVB8_ptd8pA2iEHNTZovoFgwTWbMoJ4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of braincases</a> across the <em>Homo </em>genus, genetic drift appeared to be at play, she reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution.</em> A nonadaptive process, genetic drift is the loss of genetic variation in a population due to the chance disappearance of certain genes. In other words, the braincase shape evolved just because.</p>

<p>Schroeder also turns to today’s animals to better understand the evolution of our ancestors. Another nonadaptive process — gene flow — occurs when genes spread from one population to another through breeding, including when two species hybridize. Hybrids in the fossil record could thus offer clues to evolutionary processes. But there’s currently no good way to determine whether a fossil represents a hybrid.</p>



<p>Schroeder aims to change that by developing a framework based on morphological patterns in living hybrids. So far she’s focused on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.21417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skulls of coyote-wolf hybrids</a> (chosen in part because Schroeder loves dogs), and she’s identified traits consistent with other hybrids, she and colleagues reported in 2021 in <em>Journal of Morphology</em>, including a higher incidence of dental and other anomalies.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rewriting narratives</h4>



<p>Schroeder, who grew up in South Africa, remembers noticing as early as her undergraduate years that most of the paleoanthropological research in her country was conducted by foreign researchers. In fact, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub#fig5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 percent of papers</a> published in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> from 2016 to 2021 were authored by African researchers, Schroeder reported in the journal this past January.</p>



<p>Additionally, “even though most of it is based in Africa, paleoanthropology is so white,” she says. As a Black African woman, “it was such a lonely place, actually, for a long time.” Schroeder has struggled to publish papers, received sexist reviews on papers and experienced instances of blatant racism.</p>



<p>Some things have improved. At American Association of Biological Anthropologists conferences, she used to be able to count the number of Black people on two hands, she says. When she attended this past May, she was one of many. But there is still a long way to go. She credits her mentors for helping her get through the tough early years and the <a href="https://www.blackinbioanth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black in BioAnth Collective</a> for working to transform the field.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not an easy journey getting to where she is, but she&#8217;s there,” says Rebecca Ackermann, Schroeder’s Ph.D. adviser at the University of Cape Town. “And so now the world is her oyster.”</p>



<p>Schroeder recently secured tenure at the University of Toronto. As the first in her family to attend university, it means a lot to her and her parents. “They don’t necessarily get everything I do,” she laughs. But “we’re in disbelief that I’ve gotten here.”</p>
