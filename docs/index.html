                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-2.png"><img decoding="async" width="104" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130521"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A journal formerly published by Hindawi has yet to publish any sort of notice on a paper sleuths reported for containing duplicated images 1.5 years ago. </p>



<p>According to Kevin Patrick, the sleuth who contacted the publisher in mid-2023, the episode “might be a useful case study” of the issues facing Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021 and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">stopped using the brand name</a> earlier this year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">retracting thousands of papers</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">closing journals</a> overrun by paper mills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8840692">Resveratrol Derivative, Trans-3, 5, 4 ′-Trimethoxystilbene Sensitizes Osteosarcoma Cells to Apoptosis via ROS-Induced Caspases Activation</a>,” appeared in <em>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em> in 2021. Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">removed the journal</a> from its Web of Science index in March 2023 for failing to meet quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2023, Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B54C4603D17F0D264C1C82E95BA24#1">left a comment</a> on PubPeer, noting “several figures in this paper look identical to figures in a 2019 paper by some of the same authors,” which had been retracted. “I could not find wording about e.g. a republication of part of that study, and the 2019 paper is not included in the references,” she wrote.</p>



<p> </p>



<span id="more-130520"></span>



<p>Ming Hong, the 2021 paper’s last author, with an affiliation listed at Guangzhou University &amp; Zhongshan People’s Hospital Joint Biomedical Institute, in China, responded soon after. Hong said a student had used the data and published the manuscript in the other journal, and the team had retracted the paper when they found out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Bik asked how Hong’s name could have been on the earlier paper without Hong knowing about it, Hong replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have not received any notice when the paper on cells was submitted. When I found it is [sic] published, I immediately retracted the paper. I am so sorry for this paper on cells. We will pay much more attention on [sic] these things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At that point, Patrick added a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B54C4603D17F0D264C1C82E95BA24#5">comment</a> about images in the paper “seemingly derived from a paper published by different authors in Scientific Reports where they are described differently.” Hong did not respond to that concern.</p>



<p>Patrick sent the PubPeer thread to Wiley’s research integrity email inbox on April 27, 2023. A few days later, a research integrity speciality for Hindawi replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. Please be assured that they will be fully investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will be in contact with you on the outcome of these investigations, or should further action be required.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Oct. 31, 2024, Patrick asked for update on the case. He received the following email in reply: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Due to a high volume of emails, the Research Integrity team is unfortunately experiencing slightly longer than usual response times. Please be assured that these concerns are being investigated and we will be in contact with you as soon as we have a further update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you again for your patience and understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our inquiry, a Wiley spokesperson said the publisher “expect[s] the case in question to be resolved soon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wiley takes research integrity very seriously,” the spokesperson said. “The complexity and scale of research integrity concerns have increased vastly across publishers over the last few years, and Wiley has responded by both expanding the number of in-house research integrity experts and investing in new technological tools.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Wiley “has been aware of multiple serious problems in this paper” for more than 18 months, Patrick said, the publisher has not marked it with an expression of concern or any other indication of the ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That they do not act with a sense of urgency on these matters, and don&#8217;t seem to care that their readers might be depending upon a flawed paper, bothers me,” Patrick said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I also do not have any sympathy for the ‘high volume of emails’ leading to ‘slightly longer than usual response times.’ If a publisher is spitting out papers at a rate so fast that they cannot fix problems in papers as they are brought to their attention &#8211; by volunteers &#8211; they have admitted that they don&#8217;t care about the content in their publications or their readers.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, December 10.</p>



<p>PLOS has been awarded a $3.3million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, underscoring its commitment to pioneer a shift away from traditional publishing models. The 3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation will support PLOS&rsquo; transition towards APC-free publishing by enabling authors, funded by the foundation, to publish with PLOS without facing APC barriers, and to contribute to open access publishing options for authors who do not have access to funding. This 3-year grant offers support while PLOS is actively working on new publishing models grounded in open science starting with an ongoing <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">research &amp; design project</a>.</p>



<p>The grant will also support improvements to enhance the capture and dissemination of funding metadata and to experiment with the posting of peer reviews alongside preprints during the evaluation process, promoting greater transparency in scholarly communication.</p>



<p>The transition away from APCs is not a new concept for PLOS, which has been actively developing alternative business models since 2020 with the express aim of reducing financial barriers in scholarly publishing and fostering open access for a broader range of researchers. PLOS has been a vocal champion regarding the benefits of preprints for the <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">early sharing of research </a>&nbsp;and has significant partnerships with bioRxiv, medRxiv and earthRxiv.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of APC-free, open science-based publishing models and inspire a transformative shift across the scholarly communication landscape,&rdquo; said Niamh O&rsquo; Connor, Chief Publishing Officer at PLOS. &ldquo;We are grateful for the foundation&rsquo;s funding support as we explore ways to transition publishing services away from &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; based pricing and incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research.&rdquo;<br></p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://scholar.google.bg/citations?user=TpJ45YkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Milen Zamfirov</a>, dean of the faculty of educational sciences at Sofia University in Bulgaria, was named an exceptional scientist in the social sciences and humanities. As part of the accolades at the prestigious <a href="https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/672653-pythagoras-science-awards-presented-in-sofia">Pythagoras Science Awards</a> from the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science, Zamfirov received a commemorative plaque, diploma, and a cash prize of 8,000 BGN (US $4,300).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, he is accused of plagiarising past research in a paper he co-authored with <a href="https://shtastie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CV_MBakrachevaEN.pdf">Margarita Bakracheva</a>, who received a certificate of excellence from the Union of the Bulgarian Scientists earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fnoi.uni-sofia.bg/EN/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4.-MARGARITA-BAKRACHEVA.pdf">Their study</a>, titled, “In Search of Integrativity of Sciences: the Principle of Supplementarity in the Story of Pauli and Jung,” was published in Bulgarian in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the paper seems to have significant overlap with other sources, according to Irene Glendinning, a researcher and consultant based in Leicester, UK.</p>



<span id="more-130514"></span>



<p>“I don’t think there is any doubt that this is plagiarism,” said Glendinning, who <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276864042_Impact_of_Policies_for_Plagiarism_in_Higher_Education_Across_Europe_Results_of_the_Project">has studied plagiarism policies</a> at higher education policies across the European Union. “In this case, together with the ridiculous mistakes in the narrative, I guess they knew it was wrong, but thought it was worth the risk because their paper was in Bulgarian and they thought it unlikely anyone would notice or care.”</p>



<p>Two previous English-language papers that the 2021 paper has overlap with are a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01822/full">2015 <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> study</a> and a paper published by the <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs"><em>Journal of Consciousness Studies</em></a> in 2012.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zamfirov did not reply to a request for comment. Bakracheva told <em>Retraction Watch </em>in an email that her study was a theoretical review of the “very few studies highlighting Jung-Pauli collaboration and common approach in different sciences, in this case physics and psychology.”</p>



<p>As for the text overlap and similarities between figures, Bakracheva said past literature is “correctly referenced” at the end of each paragraph. “Since it is explicitly stated that the aim of the article is to give a brief example of a possible historical illustration of the cooperation and integration of different scientific fields, there is no demarcation between the referenced sources and the ‘personal thoughts’.”</p>



<p>However, Jerome Busemeyer, a psychologist and brain sciences researcher at Indiana University Bloomington who co-authored the paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychology </em>study, was not convinced. “I think the work should be retracted or rejected,” he said. “There are proper ways to refer and make use of others’ work by properly acknowledging and getting permissions.” </p>



<p>As a “minor defence,” Glendinning said  some academics “think it is OK to paraphrase or directly copy material as long as a reference to the original is given somewhere in the paper. No real excuse in this case, but I’ve come across this quite a lot in different countries.”</p>

<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> has retracted a paper by a former group at Harvard following a postdoc’s allegations the work contained manipulated data.</p>



<p>The retracted paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009557"><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>–induced nociceptor activation increases susceptibility to infection</a>,” appeared in 2021 from the lab of Mihaela Gadjeva, an immunologist previously based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Gadjeva had been employed at Brigham and Women’s hospital for 16 years until her departure at some point in 2022. Since then, she has been an associate director of bacteriology at Moderna.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130511"></span>



<p>The retraction comes after a former postdoc in Gadjeva’s lab reported suspicions about possible data manipulation using photo editing software&nbsp; to the hospital and the journal. We spoke with the postdoc via email, where they shared evidence of their correspondence. They wished to remain anonymous for this story. We also reached out to Gadjeva for comment and got an email from her lawyers, Gelb &amp; Gelb LLP, based in Massachusetts, requesting that we direct any further communication through them. They have not responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc contacted the editor at <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> in August 2022 with concerns about the article. They alleged some data in figure 5 had been changed to support the claims in the paper.</p>



<p>The retraction notice doesn’t repeat the postdoc’s allegations of manipulation. Instead, it attributes the retraction to “concerns about the reliability of the reported results and conclusions” related to six figures, including figure 5. The authors acknowledged “some data underlying the figures of concern are no longer available,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice also stated the authors told editors they had combined multiple experiments during data preparation and analysis, and noted other factors that may have contributed to errors in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving the postdoc’s report, PLOS launched an investigation into the paper and reassessed the article, identifying additional duplications and errors, David Knutson, the head of communications at PLOS, told Retraction Watch. When we asked whether the journal’s own investigation into the paper addressed the allegations of data manipulation, Knutson responded, “Our publication ethics investigations do not investigate culpability or origin of error.”</p>



<p>To fix the problems, the authors offered updated figures, some original data and repeat data, but the journal’s editorial board concluded the materials&nbsp; “did not resolve the issues,” according to the retraction notice. After the two-year-long process, the paper was retracted this October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc had reported the same issues to the hospital’s research integrity office in April 2022, several months before contacting the journal, but told Retraction Watch that they did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked if Brigham and Women’s Hospital had looked into the postdoc’s concerns about the paper, a spokesperson for the hospital replied that Gadjeva “is not employed at BWH.” In a follow up email, she added, “We always undertake a robust and confidential process and respond to any claims that are brought to our attention in accordance with hospital policy and federal regulations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can not comment on the confidential process,” the email continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS contacted Brigham and Women’s Hospital to “discuss concerns,” Knutson said. Those discussions “are confidential,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our editorial decision was made independent from the information we received from the institute,” he told us. “PLOS retracted the article because we were unable to resolve the concerns raised in the absence of the underlying data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a separate incident in 2020, the attending veterinarian at Brigham and Women’s Hospital appeared to have suspended Gadjeva’s group from using an animal room — where lab rats are temporarily housed for experimentation — after an inspection found conditions that did not comply with regulations,&nbsp; according to an email describing the inspection report seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The room where the mice were housed was too cold, and the animals were kept in dirty cages, with little food and water supplies, according to the report. The inspector also found unsealed food, and no records for the animals.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Nada Yousif will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Optimising burst based deep brain stimulation in a population model of Parkinson's disease and Tremor&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used to treat several neurological conditions
such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), based on the implantation of
electrodes into specific brain targets. Despite its success, the electrical stimulus has
remained as a regular frequency square pulse for decades. Recently, there have been
proposals that phase-locking, coordinated reset or irregular stimulation patterns may be
more effective at desynchronising the pathological neural activity. Here we consider our
population level model of the thalamocortical-basal ganglia network, which generates
pathological oscillatory activity in the beta band (textasciitilde20 Hz) associated with
PD and the tremor band (textasciitilde4 Hz) associated with ET. We stimulate the model
with regular, irregular and phase-dependent bursts of DBS, and use an optimisation
technique to find the best stimulation parameters in each case. Our results show that
bursts can be as or more effective at suppressing pathological oscillations compared to
continuous DBS, allowing exploration of stimulation mechanisms to formulate testable
predictions regarding DBS.</p>

<p><em>Science </em>has issued expressions of concern for two articles from the <a href="https://durocherlab.org/">lab of Daniel Durocher</a>, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto. </p>



<p>The notices, and two more editor’s notes on <em>Nature </em>articles, follow PubPeer comments on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=daniel+durocher">several of Durocher’s papers</a> pointing out potentially duplicated images, as <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/11/15/schneider-shorts-15-11-2024-not-a-clinical-research-article-with-new-data/#durocher">described by ForBetterScience</a>. Durocher has responded to many of the comments promising to look into the issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides his academic positions at <a href="https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/faculty/daniel-durocher">Toronto</a> and the <a href="https://www.lunenfeld.ca/?page=durocher-daniel">Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute</a> at Sinai Health, Durocher co-founded <a href="https://www.reparerx.com/">Repare Therapeutics</a>, a biotech company with five ongoing clinical trials of potential treatments for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two <em>Science</em> articles, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1248024">Mitosis inhibits DNA double-strand break repair to guard against telomere fusions</a>” from 2014, and “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1150034">Orchestration of the DNA-damage response by the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase</a>,” from 2007, together have been cited nearly 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130493"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Jovana Drinjakovic, the science communications officer at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health, confirmed the institution is investigating the 2014 paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We acknowledge that the journal <em>Science</em> is planning to publish the Editorial Expression of Concern regarding two studies that were published in 2007 and 2014. While the 2007 paper has a figure error that the authors are working to correct, the 2014 paper was noted to contain data irregularities. As soon as the senior author was made aware of the irregularities pertaining to the 2014 study, he promptly notified Sinai Health. This triggered an internal inquiry, in accordance with its policy on addressing research misconduct allegations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We received Drinjakovic’s email after reaching out to Durocher for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The senior author is currently in discussions with the journal about the next steps,” Drinjakovic said, referring to Durocher. “It would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter until the internal process has been completed.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FD4EF09B9702618F5B1411AD25C3B#1">April 2021</a>, an anonymous user on PubPeer commented on the 2007 paper, identifying “more similar than expected” microscopy images in one figure. Durocher responded the same month, agreeing with the observation and stating he would “search for the original timelapse movie and will correct if needed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7744">expression of concern</a> for the article states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors informed the editors of a duplicate image in Fig. 3D. We are alerting readers to this concern while we work with the authors to determine an appropriate correction to the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stephen P. Jackson, of the University of Cambridge, in England, and the penultimate author on the paper, has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/23/cambridge-researcher-pulls-cell-paper-five-years-after-nature-science-retractions/">previously retracted articles</a> from <em>Cell</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, scientific sleuth Sholto David, who uses the PubPeer handle “Mycosphaerella arachidis,” pointed out potential duplications in six figures of the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">2014 <em>Science</em> article</a>. Durocher <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#8">responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for raising these issues. They are taken seriously. I have alerted my Institute director about the noted irregularities and they will be investigated.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7951">expression of concern</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The editors and authors have been made aware of potential data integrity issues in several figures. We are alerting readers to this concern while we work with the institution and the authors to determine an appropriate course of action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>David told Retraction Watch the notice “should just be a retraction.” He called the paper “very muddled” and its data “extensively manipulated.”</p>



<p>Meagan Phelan, the communications director for the <em>Science</em> family of journals, confirmed PubPeer “was among the impetuses” for the notices. She added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors have been swift and thorough to respond to us and to address related issues. We’re seeing more and more authors work quickly and thoughtfully to correct the record in this way, and it continues to encourage us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On November 21, <em>Nature</em> added editor’s notes to two of Durocher’s papers, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16142">A mechanism for the suppression of homologous recombination in G1 cells</a>,” from 2015, and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12318">53BP1 is a reader of the DNA-damage-induced H2A Lys 15 ubiquitin mark</a>,” from 2013. The articles have been cited nearly 900 times. Both notices state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Readers are alerted that concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of data presented in this article. Further editorial action will be taken if appropriate once the investigation into the concerns is complete and all parties have been given an opportunity to respond in full.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>David also in November <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AF6C463CAEDA36A79F940CF58BFD#1">commented</a> on the <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/52028782F1A67D6C14A75C58457908#1">studies</a> with questions about the data. Durocher and the first author of one of the articles responded, promising to look into the questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>International Wound Journal</em>, a Wiley title, has retracted 27 papers since June with notices mentioning “manipulated” or “compromised” peer review. </p>



<p>“A comprehensive investigation examining manipulated peer review in this journal is in progress,” a Wiley spokesperson told Retraction Watch. The publisher anticipates retracting more articles as the investigation continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first retraction of the batch, of the November 2023 article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14502">Analysis of the Association Between Serum Levels of 25(OH)D, Retinol Binding Protein, and Cyclooxygenase-2 and the Disease Severity in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers</a>,” appeared June 14. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14947">notice</a> stated Wiley and the journal’s editor in chief “concluded that the peer review process of this article was manipulated” following an investigation by the publisher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authors “did not respond to the notice of retraction,” according to the notice. Corresponding author Liwei Bai of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University in Weihui, China, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher’s investigation began “through our standard processes and channels prior to the receipt of inquiries from external parties,” 20 of the retractions in the batch credited “a third party.” These notices <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70022">stated</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It came to the publisher&#8217;s attention from a third party that a number of articles shared concerning similarities in format and structure. Following an investigation by the publisher, the retraction has been agreed on as the peer review and publishing process for this article were found to be manipulated</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five papers pulled November 12 have different notices, which stated the articles were accepted “solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process,” and therefore must be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>International Wound Journal</em> recently became open access, according to a September 2023 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14380">editorial</a> marking the journal’s 20th birthday. The journal had increased its number of editions from eight to 10 in 2023, and would add two more in 2024, the editors wrote, “as our submission volumes have increased exponentially.” The editors also shared plans to publish “several ‘special’ editions to supplement our annual editions.”</p>



<p>In an August <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70010?af=R">editorial</a>, the editors acknowledged some of the increase in submissions the journal had seen “is related to ‘papermill’ type activity.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This has challenged our submission and review process. To manage this, we are implementing significant back-end processes to identify and reject such content. We are also creating the largest single editorial board for any wound care journal, to strengthen our review process to enhance its effectiveness. This has become necessary to ensure the continued quality of our journal, especially considering the threat that “papermill type” activity may have on our overall subject area. This is a global challenge to the world of academic and clinical research. It is something that the IWJ does not take lightly and we are working diligently in playing our part to minimize its impact in the world of wound care.</p>
