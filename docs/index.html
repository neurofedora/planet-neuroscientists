<p>The authors of an influential but controversial 2020 paper on the activity of bat coronaviruses in China which proposed the animals as a “likely origin” for the virus that causes COVID-19 have retracted their work and republished a revised version of the analysis. They say their results and conclusions did not change.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17687-3">Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China</a>,” appeared Aug. 25, 2020, in <em>Nature Communications</em>. It has been cited 154 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and by at least two <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/88830779/policy-documents">international policy documents</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are affiliated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the New York City-based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which has come under intense scrutiny by members of the U.S. Congress and others. The U.S. government in May <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/federal-officials-suspend-funding-ecohealth-alliance-nonprofit-entangled-covid-19">suspended</a> funding for EcoHealth amid concerns the COVID-19 pandemic virus may have developed from research on which the nonprofit and Wuhan lab collaborated – a so-called “lab leak.” EcoHealth has denied the pandemic virus could have emerged from its work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130566"></span>



<p>Peter Daszak, a corresponding author of the paper and president of EcoHealth, told Retraction Watch the researchers had discovered dozens of the more than 1,000 viral sequences in the paper didn’t come from China, but from “a few miles over the border” in Laos. He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Given that bats on both sides of the border likely co-mingle, and that our initial analyses were conducted by zoogeographic regions which encompass cross-border populations, we did not expect that the inclusion of these samples changed any conclusions substantially. However, given that the title and focus of the paper was for CoVs from bats in China, the authors decided to remove the 41 Laotian sequences, and repeat all of the paper’s analyses. During this process, we were also able to remove 29 sequences that were duplicated in the Genbank database. As expected, the results did not change substantially, and the conclusions remain the same.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nature Communications</em> published the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55384-7">revised analysis</a> on December 19, along with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55454-w">retraction notice</a> for the original article. The abstracts of the original and revised papers are identical, except for the number of viral sequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors learned of the erroneously included sequences “months after publication,” Daszak said. He did not immediately respond to our questions about when his group informed the journal, or whether they considered publishing an expression of concern while they conducted the new analysis.</p>

<p><em>The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation </em>(<em>JHLT</em>) has decided against retracting a November 2024 paper that&nbsp; violated the ethics policy of the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publishing the paper, which describes a new mechanical circulatory support device used to treat heart failure that was developed in China, staff at the journal realised two of the patients in the study had received organ transplants in that country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dozens of research articles have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/">been retracted or flagged</a> for appearing to have used organs procured from executed prisoners in China, and many journals around the world have introduced policies to avoid such research. <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement, published in 2022, bans data on human organ transplants from journals or scientific sessions when they originate from countries, particularly China, where organ procurement from prisoners has been observed.</p>



<span id="more-130542"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01664-4/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">study</a>, “Long-term outcomes of a novel fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device for the treatment of advanced heart failure in China,” has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s abstract was initially presented at the annual meeting of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, which runs the journal, said cardiologist <a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/joseph-g-rogers/">Joseph Rogers</a>, president and chief executive officer of the Texas Heart Institute and the editor-in-chief of <em>JHLT</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a “lengthy debate,” Rogers said, the editors decided retracting the paper would be an “inappropriate response” despite the journal’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>“We didn’t want to convey to the readership that there was something scientifically invalid about the paper,” Rogers said. “That’s not true. The paper was scientifically valid.”</p>



<p>The journal also printed <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01804-7/abstract">two editorials</a>, one by the journal’s then interim editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/michelle-kittleson-309129.html">Michelle Kittleson</a> of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who initially accepted the study, and the other about <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01803-5/abstract?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">the journal’s ethics statement</a>, signed by the <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Retraction Watch</em> has reached out to <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/savitri-fedson-21192">Savitri Fedson</a>, of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a co-author of the editorial about <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal published the editorials to recognise <em>JHLT </em>missed the issue and had violated its own ethics commitments. If the issue was spotted beforehand, he noted, <em>JHLT </em>would have rejected the study. Going forward, the journal has put in “additional safeguards” to prevent violation of the ethics statement, Rogers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1141521/overview">Shengshou Hu</a>, the study’s corresponding author, who is based at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>As part of the safeguards, all papers are now sent to Rogers, who desk-rejects any papers involving human organ transplants in China, he said. That step is particularly&nbsp; important, he noted, because peer reviewers working for the journal are not required to read the publication’s ethics statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal contacted the study’s authors. “What we really wanted to do was reassure them that the reason that we were editorializing their paper in this manner was not because of the scientific content of the paper,” he added. “It was really a failure of our internal checks and balances that allowed that paper to move forward.”</p>

The authors of the report describe ecological medicine as “the structured and deliberate use of connectedness and interaction with plants, animals, and other species to generate a therapeutic effect for individuals.” While few would doubt the value of spending time in the natural world, the suggestion that we need medicine to mediate our connection to nature is a striking one. Surely nothing could be more direct and immediate than the sense of awe we feel when we gaze upon the vast night sky, or the sense of renewal we feel when wandering in a spring meadow? And surely, too, it is more than just our health that is affected by this engagement; <em>we </em>are affected.</p><p>That the concept of ecological medicine seems to be pointing at something so familiar, and yet seems to be expressing it in such a striking and novel manner, gives us pause to reflect. How have we arrived at a point in our civilisation where it seems sensible to describe as a medical discovery the idea that “other species are worthy of respect”, and that the recognition of inter-species reciprocity that is enabled by participating in ecological medicine “serves to counteract some of the societal elements contributing to society’s epidemic of mental health problems”?</p><p>This manner of approaching our sense of connection with nature is, arguably, emblematic of a sweeping cultural trend: </p><div><blockquote> We appear to be losing our grasp on ways of conceiving of human flourishing other than in medical terms. </blockquote></div><p>Today, we speak of ‘mental health’, often treating this as synonymous with the notion of flourishing itself. To accept the notions of ‘mental health’ and ‘flourishing’ as synonymous with each other involves a commitment to the conjunction of the following two claims:</p><div>C1: To be mentally healthy is to flourish; and</div><div>C2: To flourish is to be mentally healthy.</div><p>C1 takes mental health to be sufficient for flourishing, whilst C2 takes it to be a necessary condition. C1 is the stronger of the two claims insofar as it asserts that nothing else—apart from being mentally healthy—is required for human flourishing. C2, unlike C1, allows for the possibility that there may be <em>other </em>conditions besides that of mental health that are also necessary for human flourishing—conditions pertaining to other domains of value such as ethics or aesthetics (domains that are of course salient in our connection with nature). But even the weaker claim, C2, imports a medical connotation into our conception of human flourishing that would have once seemed novel, perhaps even puzzling. Aristotle in the <em>Eudaimian Ethics</em>, for instance, takes health (like wealth or honour) to be a means by which we might come to flourish, rather than as tantamount to flourishing itself. How did this connotation appear, signalling the shift towards the medicalisation of our understanding of what it means to flourish?</p><p>Here is one story of the origin of this connotation (told by Martin Seligman, a founding father of the positive psychology movement): if (severely) distressing emotional experiences are cast as states of pathology, as contemporary psychiatry does, then it isn’t a huge leap (although it is a <em>substantive </em>one) from this claim to the idea that being in a state opposite to this—that is, enjoying a preponderance of pleasant emotional experiences—amounts to a state of wellness, a state of wellbeing, indeed a state of flourishing. This chain of inference is one of the major paths we have taken that has led us towards the medicalisation of our conception of flourishing. If this is right, then recovering alternate, non-medicalised conceptions of human flourishing, conceptions that might well return to us the expressive power to capture (amongst other things) our immediate connection with nature that we intuit, will involve a dissection of the concept of emotional disorder.</p><p>What, then, is the basis of the claim that (severely) distressing emotional states constitute states of pathology? From what general concept of disorder is this identification derived, and in light of what conception of our emotional lives might this identification be motivated?&nbsp;Surprising lines of inquiry emerge in the course of this exploration, all of which point to the pivotal role that our emotions play in the myriad ways we appraise our lives and make sense of ourselves. One particular line is worth mentioning here: it is often assumed that the medicalisation of our understanding of human flourishing signifies progress, at least in the sense that it yields an understanding that is informed by scientific knowledge. But this line of inquiry invites us to consider whether human flourishing is something we should seek to understand exclusively in scientific terms (as the invocation of the idea of progress implies). Indeed, is it something we should seek to understand in scientific terms at all? A systematic investigation of the value of emotions in human life suggests that there are visions of human flourishing that invite, indeed compel, not the detachment of the scientific gaze, but our immersion in life through the exercise of our rational agency. It is in appreciating the trade-offs between these alternative conceptions of human flourishing, and the appraisals they lead us to make of our emotional experiences, that we arrive at a clearer reflective understanding of our current predicament. It is in so doing that we may recover our power to express the immediate connection we feel with nature when we plant an acorn and tend its growth.</p><p>My aim is not to argue in favour of any particular conception of flourishing—and so I do not, for instance, claim that it is a mistake to medicalise our sense of connection with nature. It is rather to display as perspicuously as possible some of the conceptual structures that guide our ongoing quest to live happier and more enlightened lives. This quest has, for the most part, taken a very distinctive shape over the past half century: we pour billions of dollars each year into the enterprise of improving our ‘mental health’. It is ultimately for us to decide, individually and collectively, whether thinking of our flourishing in terms of the notion of ‘mental health’ is a good thing to do—rather than being, merely, something we’ve simply ended up doing.</p><p><em><sub>Featured Image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@cmdor?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Sébastien Bourguet</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-brown-and-red-beans-sxrpceiAKts?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909669284/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/909669284/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f12%2fphoto-1510950109928-f3aac6afbb03-1-273x194.avif"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/jolly-yule/">Jolly Yule</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/a-look-behind-the-curtain-at-the-best-books-of-2024/">A look behind the curtain at the best books of 2024</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/does-the-get-italics/">Does &#8220;the&#8221; get italics?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="768" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-129213" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg 576w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></figure></div>


<p><em>Chemosphere</em>, the Elsevier title which in September published an article on “unexpected exposure to toxic flame retardants in household items” such as black plastic cooking utensils, has been removed from Clarivate’s Web of Science index in its December update. </p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524022173">From e-waste to living space: Flame retardants contaminating household items add to concern about plastic recycling</a>,” received heavy international media coverage questioning whether we should all throw out our black plastic spatulas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors corrected their calculations in a December 15 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X">corrigendum</a>, as reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>. The exposure was an order of magnitude lower than the safe daily reference dose, not approaching it, as they had initially reported, but “this calculation error does not affect the overall conclusion of the paper,” the authors wrote in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130550"></span>



<p>Meanwhile, Clarivate, the scholarly publication data company behind metrics such as the journal impact factor, removed <em>Chemosphere</em> from its Web of Science index December 16 for failing to meet editorial <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">quality criteria</a>. Clarivate places journals “on hold” from indexing for a reevaluation period before removing them, and has recently put <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/24/elife-latest-in-string-of-major-journals-put-on-hold-from-web-of-science/">other major journals</a> “on hold” as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Chemosphere</em> has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;qs=%22retraction%22&amp;years=2024&amp;sortBy=date">retracted eight articles</a> this month and published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;qs=%22expression%20of%20concern%22&amp;years=2024&amp;lastSelectedFacet=years">60 expressions of concern</a> since April. As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">noted elsewhere</a>, removing a journal from Web of Science means Clarivate will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a>, as universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions.</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson said the publisher’s ethics team is “conducting in-depth investigations” of “potential breaches of <em>Chemosphere’s</em> publishing policies. According to a June <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/chemosphere/about/news/commitment-to-research-integrity-and-publishing-ethics">announcement</a> from the journal, these breaches included “unusual authorship changes, compromised or manipulated peer-review processes, and undisclosed conflicts of interest.” The spokesperson continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are addressing the concerns raised during the investigation and are committed to correcting the scientific record in a responsible and transparent manner. We will continue to work with Clarivate to assist in their re-evaluation in due course.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a December 12 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/chemosphere/about/news/discover-the-decisive-steps-we-are-taking-to-ensure-research-integrity">news update</a>, the journal laid out steps it would take as a result of the investigation, including retracting articles and publishing expressions of concern.</p>

<p>An engineer accused of being involved in paper mill activities mysteriously reappeared on a list of editorial board members at Springer Nature’s <em>Scientific Reports </em>earlier this year, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The journal had “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/">parted ways</a>” with the engineer, Masoud Afrand of the Islamic Azad University in Iran, in March 2022 after an internal audit found “irregularities” in how he handled papers, editor-in-chief Rafal Marszalek told us last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of “an oversight,” however, Afrand remained on the publication’s website until <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">a story</a> by Retraction Watch and Undark raised concerns about his work last year.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130539"></span>



<p>Our story quoted sleuth Alexander Magazinov saying Afrand “was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in <em>Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences</em>,” in which Afrand was cited more than 130 times. Magazinov later expanded on his suspicions in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#:~:text=July%2012%2C%202023%20at%201%3A22%20am">a comment</a> on our site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But at some point this year, Afrand, who has not responded to emails seeking comment, was back on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214124738/https:/www.nature.com/srep/about/editors"><em>Scientific Reports</em>’ website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a December 15 email copying Retraction Watch and fellow sleuth Dorothy Bishop, among others, Magazinov wrote to Marszalek to ask why Afrand had apparently been reinstated. Marszalek replied:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr Afrand left Scientific Reports Editorial Board in 2022, and this remains true to this day (i.e. he has not been re-instated). However, as a result of clerical mistakes, he was not removed from our homepage (though has been properly retired in 2022 from all other systems), and this has been rectified now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bishop countered in a December 16 email to Marszalek that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>contrary to what you say, Dr Afrand was removed from the home Editors webpage in 2022, and was still absent in June 2024 [as evidenced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240609132634/https:/www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">this archived webpage</a>]. However, his name did reappear some time in the summer of 2024. I checked with the Wayback machine, and he was absent from the list at the start of 2024 through to June 2024, but was present in September 2024 [&#8230;] This is a strange kind of clerical error.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek offered no explanation, telling Bishop only:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I appreciate you flagging that. At this point I can only confirm that Dr Afrand has not been a member of Scientific Reports Editorial Board and has not handled any content since 2022. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek told us he did not have “much more to add than what I told Dr Bishop.”</p>

                <p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, December 10.<br><br>PLOS has been awarded a $3.3million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, underscoring its commitment to pioneer a shift away from traditional publishing models. The 3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation will support PLOS&rsquo; transition towards APC-free publishing by enabling authors, funded by the foundation, to publish with PLOS without facing APC barriers, and to contribute to open access publishing options for authors who do not have access to funding. This 3-year grant offers support while PLOS is actively working on new publishing models grounded in open science starting with an ongoing <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">research &amp; design project</a>.</p>



<p>The grant will also support improvements to enhance the capture and dissemination of funding metadata and to experiment with the posting of peer reviews alongside preprints during the evaluation process, promoting greater transparency in scholarly communication.</p>



<p>The transition away from APCs is not a new concept for PLOS, which has been actively developing alternative business models since 2020 with the express aim of reducing financial barriers in scholarly publishing and fostering open access for a broader range of researchers. PLOS has been a vocal champion regarding the benefits of preprints for the <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">early sharing of research </a>&nbsp;and has significant partnerships with bioRxiv, medRxiv and earthRxiv.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of APC-free, open science-based publishing models and inspire a transformative shift across the scholarly communication landscape,&rdquo; said Niamh O&rsquo; Connor, Chief Publishing Officer at PLOS. &ldquo;We are grateful for the foundation&rsquo;s funding support as we explore ways to transition publishing services away from &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; based pricing and incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="171" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130050"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kaikobad Irani</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A cardiology researcher who left the University of Iowa with a six-figure <a href="https://settlements.regents.iastate.edu/uploads/d/b/3/db3e65406066a177970e559957526d3d75fb4e3f/K.-Irani-Settlement-Agreement.pdf">settlement</a> earlier this year won’t be starting the new job he’d lined up at the Providence VA Medical Center, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justyn Charon, a spokesperson for the Providence VA, previously told us the researcher, Kaikobad Irani, would begin his new position “around November.” When we followed up, Charon confirmed, “there is currently no plan for Dr. Irani to be employed by VA Providence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, the University of Iowa in Iowa City has launched an investigation about the leak of a report regarding Irani to Retraction Watch that appears to be an attempt to identify the source of the document.</p>



<span id="more-130530"></span>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/19/exclusive-providence-va-hires-scientist-previous-employer-found-had-harassed-mentees/">previously reported</a>, administrators at the institution investigated allegations Irani had harassed mentees. That inquiry found, based on a “preponderance of evidence,” Irani had violated the university’s policies on harassment, professional conduct, and use of information technology resources, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment on why he would no longer work at the Providence VA, Irani said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My VA employment was targeted using an illegally leaked and misleading investigation report into fabricated allegations of harassment. The allegations were made by persons who worked in my lab who I had in good-faith previously reported for serious violations of research integrity. The investigation did not verify the allegations made by those I had reported. After considering the totality of evidence and lack of evidence, University of Iowa authorities did not find I violated its anti-harassment policy. The narrative that my &#8220;previous employer found [I] had harassed mentees&#8221; and that my &#8220;behavior violated university&#8217;s policy on harassment&#8221; (see Retraction Watch Sept 19, 2024) is false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Irani, who claims that the University of Iowa provost did not uphold the findings of the investigation, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Retraction-Watch-Statement-2024.09.17.pdf">previously told us</a> he had “faced a campaign of retaliation” for reporting one colleague for research misconduct and others for failing to disclose conflicts of interest on grant applications to the National Institutes of Health. The findings of the investigation “are largely based on false unsubstantiated allegations made by persons whom I had earlier reported in good faith,” he said when we contacted him for our earlier story. At that time, he did not dispute the investigation had found he had violated the university’s harassment policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publication of our story on the investigation report, Julian West, an investigator in the Office of Civil Rights Compliance at the University of Iowa, and Todd Rent, the university’s senior director of employee and labor relations, contacted us with questions about the document we had obtained, such as how many pages long it was, and whether and how it was redacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rent said their goal was not to identify our source, but to “determine whether our university&#8217;s existing document control procedures are sufficient to maintain an environment where campus community members feel safe raising concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid providing information that could identify our source, we declined to answer their questions. They, and the University of Iowa media relations office, did not respond to our request for comment on their investigation into our source for the document.</p>
