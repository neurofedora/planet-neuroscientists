              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-americas-olmec-maya-star-calendar">Lasers reveal sites used as the Americas’ oldest known star calendars</a></h4>

              
                <p>Olmec and Maya people living along Mexico’s Gulf Coast as early as 3,100 years ago built star-aligned ceremonial centers to track important days of a 260-day calendar, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-calendar-hieroglyph-date-oldest-evidence">oldest written evidence of this calendar</a>, found on painted plaster mural fragments from a Maya site in Guatemala, dates to between 300 and 200 B.C., nearly a millennium later (<em>SN: 4/13/22</em>). But researchers have long suspected that a 260-day calendar developed hundreds of years earlier among Gulf Coast Olmec groups.</p>





<p>Now, an airborne laser-mapping technique called light detection and ranging, or lidar, has revealed <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq7675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astronomical orientations of 415 ceremonial complexes</a> dating to between about 1100 B.C. and A.D. 250, say archaeologist Ivan Šprajc and colleagues. Most ritual centers were aligned on an east-to-west axis, corresponding to sunrises or other celestial events on specific days of a 260-day year, the scientists report January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The finding points to the earliest evidence in the Americas of a formal calendar system that combined astronomical knowledge with earthly constructions. This system used celestial events to identify important dates during a 260-day portion of a full year.</p>



<p>“The 260-day cycle materialized in Mesoamerica’s earliest known monumental complexes [and was used] for scheduling seasonal, subsistence-related ceremonies,” says Šprajc, of the Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana. “We cannot be certain exactly when and where it was invented.”</p>



<p>Some of the oldest ceremonial centers identified by lidar clearly belong to the Olmec culture, but others are hard to classify, says archaeologist Stephen Houston of Brown University in Providence, R.I., who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Olmec society dates from around 3,500 to 2,400 years ago. Links between the Olmec and later Maya culture, known best for Classic-era cities and kingdoms that flourished between roughly 1,750 and 1,100 years ago, are unclear. But Classic Maya inscriptions and documents also reference the 260-day calendar.</p>



<p>Mobile groups in Mesoamerica, an ancient cultural region that extended from central Mexico to Central America, may have scheduled large, seasonal gatherings using the 260-day calendar long before it gained favor among Classic Maya kings, Šprajc and colleagues suggest. The same calendar may also have marked days of important agricultural activities or rituals as maize cultivation spread in Mesoamerica starting around 3,000 years ago, they add. Some Maya communities still use a 260-day calendar to organize maize cultivation and schedule agricultural rituals.</p>



<p>Previous lidar data indicated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-blueprint-olmec-maya-ceremonial-archaeology">ceremonial centers based on a common blueprint appeared at many Olmec and Maya sites</a> along Mexico’s Gulf Coast by about 3,400 years ago (<em>SN: 10/25/21</em>). Only now has the calendrical significance of ceremonial centers’ alignments become apparent.</p>





<p>The most common architectural alignment detected in the new study corresponded to the position of sunrises on February 11 and October 29 when complexes were in use, separated by 260 days. These complexes faced east toward a point on the horizon where the sun rose on those two days.</p>



<p>Another frequent orientation matched sunrises separated by 130 days, or half of the 260-day count.</p>



<p>A minority of ceremonial complexes were aligned with dates of solstices (longest and shortest days of the year), quarter days (the midpoint of each half of the year) or lunar cycles in the 260-day year. Other centers tracked the position of Venus, a star associated with the rainy season and maize farming.</p>



<p>Sunrises or sunsets recorded at ceremonial centers were typically separated by multiples of 13 or 20 days. Aside from representing basic mathematical units of a 260-day year, the numbers 13 and 20 have long been associated with various gods and sacred concepts among Maya people and other Mesoamerican groups, Šprajc says.</p>



<p>Future excavations at lidar-detected ceremonial complexes can investigate whether ancient groups formally dedicated certain structures to specific days in the 260-day year, Houston says.</p>

                <p>Tiny drops of dirty water, often mistaken for air bubbles, tell the tale of rippling icicle growth.</p>



<p>Icicles made of pure water are smooth. But salt or other impurities make icicles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ripple-effect">develop ripples</a> as they hang from branches, bridges and power lines (<em>SN: 11/24/13</em>). Impurities are also responsible for the hazy appearance of icicles that has typically been attributed to air bubbles. Those bubbles are actually <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.054211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minute dollops of contaminated water</a>, researchers report in the November <em>Physical Review E</em>.</p>



<p>While examining 3-millimeter-thick cross sections of icicles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicle-turns">grown in the lab</a>, University of Toronto physicists Stephen Morris and John Ladan uncovered pockets of impure, liquid water surrounded by relatively pure ice (<em>SN: 8/13/10</em>). “It turns out that there are very few air bubbles in an icicle,” Morris says. He calls the water pockets “inclusions” to distinguish them from air bubbles.</p>

<p>What’s more, “the inclusions record the history of the growth of the ripples. It’s like the rings in a tree,” Morris says. Inclusions form in layers near the surface of an icicle, with older layers covered by younger ones as an icicle grows. “You can deduce something about the history of the growth by looking at the pattern of inclusions.”</p>



<p>To track icicle formation, the researchers mixed fluorescent dye into water in place of other types of impurities and used the water to grow icicles in the lab. The dye ended up concentrating at higher levels in liquid inclusions in the icicles, just as any other contaminant would. It also glowed brightly under ultraviolet light, which made the inclusion layers easier to see.</p>



<p>By varying the dye concentration in the water, the researchers showed one way that impurities affect the patterns of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicle-waves-go-flow">icicle ripples</a> (<em>SN: 10/10/02</em>). All it took was contamination comparable to that in tap water, Morris says, “before they change their shape from smooth to ripply.”</p>



<p>The underlying reasons that contaminants lead to ripples aren’t yet clear. As an experimentalist, Morris says, that’s a puzzle he’ll leave to theorists.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbes-give-cheeses-flavor-bacteria">Meet some of the microbes that give cheeses flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cheese making has been around for thousands of years, and there are now more than 1,000 varieties of cheese worldwide. But what exactly makes some cheeses like Parmesan taste fruity and others, such as Brie and Camembert, taste musty has remained a bit of a mystery. Now, scientists have pinned down the specific types of <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02894-22?_ga=2.72158995.1824052991.1668439872-336013472.1642513742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bacteria that produce these flavor compounds</a>.</p>



<p>The findings, described November 10 in <em>Microbiology Spectrum</em>, could help cheese makers more precisely tweak cheese flavor profiles to better match consumer preferences, say food microbiologist Morio Ishikawa and colleagues.</p>





<p>A cheese’s flavor depends on more than the type of milk and starter bacteria used to make the fermented dairy delight. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/studying-cheese-reveals-how-microbes-interact">constellation of organisms</a> that move in during the cheese-ripening process also contributes to the flavor (<em>SN: 5/14/16</em>).</p>



<p>Ishikawa, of the Tokyo University of Agriculture, likens these nonstarter bacteria to an orchestra. “We can perceive the tones played by the orchestra of cheese as a harmony, but we do not know what instruments each of them is responsible for.”</p>



<p>Previous research by Ishikawa and colleagues used genetic analysis, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to link specific flavor molecules with specific types of bacteria on surface mold–ripened cheeses made from pasteurized and raw cow milk in Japan and France.</p>



<p>In the new study, to show that each bacterial suspect was responsible for producing the flavor compound it had been linked to, the team unleashed each type of microbe onto its own unripe cheese sample. The researchers then observed how flavor compounds in the cheese changed over 21 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, <em>Pseudoalteromonas — </em>a genus of marine bacteria found in various cheeses — produced the greatest number of flavor compounds. And the microbes produced esters, ketones and sulfur compounds, known to impart fruity, moldy and oniony flavors in cheese.</p>



<p>Besides helping perfect popular cheeses, Ishikawa says, the findings might help cheese makers conduct new orchestras that would play new harmonies.</p>

<p>Are academic writing centers agents of US hegemony, spreading the evils of colonialism as they work to topple rogue syntax and rehabilitate failing grammatical states?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So argued a pair of authors in Canada in a now-retracted 2022 article which claimed that such centers have been used as “neocolonial tools” to push American foreign policy goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to critics, that claim –&nbsp; which seems like it might have emerged from a cross between Don DeLillo’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/books/white-noise-by-don-delillo.html">White Noise</a>” and Graham Greene’s, well, lots of his books – suffered from a fatal flaw or two, as we’ll shortly see.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126337"></span>



<p>“Writing Centers and Neocolonialism: How Writing Centers Are Being Commodified and Exported as U.S. Neocolonial Tools” appeared last November in the <em>Writing Center Journal</em> – a publication of Purdue University – and was written by Brian Hotson, of <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Hotson%22%20author_fname%3A%22Brian%22&amp;start=0&amp;context=119483">Dalhousie University</a>, in Nova Scotia, and Stevie Bell, of York University, in Toronto.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Writing-Centers-and-Neocolonialism%3A-How-Writing-Are-Hotson-Bell/110380051fdac2d535d3f339463f520625b8455c">abstract of the article</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In this paper, we explore the complicity of Western writing centers in global neocolonialism despite its resounding rejection within Western writing center scholarship, in which Romeo García contends that writing tutors can be “decolonial agents.” We show that higher education is used by Western governments as a neocolonial tool and situate international U.S. writing center initiatives within this context. Writing centers have remained complicit in global neocolonialism involving the commodification and exportation of American English as well as Western-style institutions, curricula, and pedagogies. This is most explicit in recent writing center initiatives undertaken by the U.S. Department of State in South America, Eastern Europe, and Central and Southeast Asia. Our analysis of the IWCA and the global community of writing center organizations reveals that few institutions in the field are well positioned to address this important issue. Indeed, the IWCA has remained silent on the complicity of Western writing centers in neocolonialism despite the resounding rejection of neocolonialism within the writing center community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the journal has now issued the following <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/wcj/vol40/iss2/4/">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors of the Writing Center Journal and Purdue University Press, publisher of WCJ, are retracting the following article:</p>



<p>Hotson, Brian, and Bell, Stevie. (2022). &#8220;Writing Centers and Neocolonialism: How Writing Centers Are Being Commodified and Exported as U.S. Neocolonial Tools.&#8221; Writing Center Journal, vol. 40, no. 2, article 4. <a href="https://doi.org/10.7771/2832-9414.1020">https://doi.org/10.7771/2832-9414.1020</a>.</p>



<p>This article contains two significant factual errors that the authors have agreed to correct. The Writing Center Journal is committed to the highest standards of publication ethics and has accepted the request of Dr. Ron Martinez and colleagues from the Universidade Federal do Paraná and the article’s authors to retract the piece until a revision can be posted. The journal will also create a space for published rebuttal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The nature of those errors is unstated. However, we received a tip about the article on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAsw4i5J8M7sOQ9GiG0_dglkim9gdPPba92yZRLfCq4u-o7w/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">database submission form</a>, which claimed:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors were obliged to acknowledge major factual errors in the article, which included baseless claims that the US Department of State were responsible for &#8220;exporting&#8221; writing program initiatives to Brazil and Russia in a &#8220;neocolonial&#8221; fashion when, in fact, those initiatives were created by scholars in those countries. With those false claims refuted, the article lost much of its validity and the editors felt compelled to retract.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bell initially told us that the article would be republished “with one minor correction” but acknowledged a second, “interrelated” problem. She did not immediately respond to our request for elaboration on the mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.drronmartinez.com/about.html">Martinez</a> confirmed the details in the tip, which he and several colleagues left, we received and told us the matter has “caused many people a great deal of stress” – one of those people being himself. Among his lengthy list of beefs with the article, as he wrote to the journal in a December 12 email, was its allegation that the:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“writing center Centro de Assessoria de Publicação Acadêmica (CAPA) at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) in Curitiba, Brazil, as well as the organization Writing Centers of Brazil (WCB) were created and are currently directed by the Department of State.” <strong>This is false. </strong>The CAPA writing center<a href="https://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/noticias/professor-da-ufpr-lanca-primeiro-centro-de-escrita-academica-do-brasil/"> was created by Dr. Ron Martinez as a professor of UFPR</a>, initially directed by him and vice director Eduardo Figueiredo (also of UFPR), completely independently of any government involvement (US or Brazilian). The center was opened in October of 2016 within the School of Humanities of UFPR, without any influence by the Department of State whatsoever, and never directed by anyone outside of UFPR. There is no source of information anywhere, including the bibliographic and media sources cited by the authors, in which CAPA is said to have been &#8220;created&#8221; or &#8220;directed&#8221; by the Department of State. Indeed, there is a notable lack of rigor with which basic facts —facts essential to the article’s entire thesis— were checked by the authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the end, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the mischaracterizations and prevarications presented here are serious. Under normal circumstances, it would behoove us to simply write a rebuttal to the article. However, there is no point in debating when the basic facts are unquestionably wrong, and can be proved to be so. In their own words, the authors of the article posit that writing centers are being “commodified” and “exported” by the US government —their central thesis. However, the data on which they base that assertion largely rests on the precarious examples provided from Brazil, especially. It has been established in this letter that CAPA did not originate in the US and therefore could not have been “exported.” Likewise, the Russian NWCC was created in Russia, by Russians, for Russians. These are verifiable facts that would have been easily discoverable by the authors. Indeed, all of the Brazilian initiatives mentioned in the article emerged endogenously in Brazil. Throughout —but especially in pages 55-57— most of the examples the authors provide to support their thesis are either outright falsehoods or, at best, half-truths. In that light, the entire thesis of their article is undermined. <strong>It means that readers of Writing Center Journal are being persuaded to sympathize with a position based on spurious information.&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martinez told us:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the errors were quite obvious, and that is not even counting the selective omissions of facts. I do believe the editors could have easily caught the issues in advance; what the editor wrote was as follows:</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When authors submit to the WCJ, they certify to the veracity of their facts because the journal is a completely voluntary staff without labor to provide such review in its own right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In other words, they allege that they did not have the &#8220;bandwidth&#8221; to have caught the falsehoods and simply relied on the integrity of the authors. However, I believe that the nature of the content of the article —which bordered on personal attack— should have compelled the editors to proceed with more caution to avoid possible libel exposure. In this case, it was not only myself and the organization that I created that was maligned, but also organizations in Russia and, especially, the US Department of State. In all cases, the evidence the authors presented in the article was based on errors and half-truths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martinez did commend the editors for acting promptly in the case, but he expressed concern that the posting of a corrected version of that paper might obscure the fact that the original had been retracted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If the authors want to submit a new article, it should be considered a new submission and not a &#8220;correction&#8221; &#8212; the errors the original article contained were far too egregious for a corrigendum.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-created-amazon-dark-earth">Indigenous people may have created the Amazon’s ‘dark earth’ on purpose</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — Indigenous people in the Amazon may have been deliberately creating fertile soil for farming for thousands of years.</p>



<p>At archaeological sites across the Amazon River basin, mysterious patches of unusually fertile soil dot the landscape. Scientists have long debated the origin of this “dark earth,” which is darker in color than surrounding soils and richer in carbon.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have shown that indigenous Kuikuro people in southeastern Brazil <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1188579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentionally create similar soil around their villages</a>. The finding, presented December 16 at the American Geophysical Union meeting, adds evidence to the idea that long-ago Amazonians deliberately manufactured such soil too.</p>





<p>The fact that Kuikuro people make dark earth today is a “pretty strong argument” that people were also making it in the past, says Paul Baker, a geochemist at Duke University who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>In doing so, these early inhabitants may have inadvertently stored massive quantities of carbon in the soil, says study presenter Taylor Perron, an earth scientist at MIT. The technique, he says, could provide a blueprint for developing methods of sustainably locking atmospheric carbon in tropical soils, helping fight climate change.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Indigenous people have altered the Amazon for thousands of years</h4>



<p>The Western world has long viewed the Amazon as a vast wilderness that was relatively untouched before Europeans showed up. At the center of this argument is the idea that the Amazon’s soil, which is poor in nutrients like other tropical soils, precluded its inhabitants from developing agriculture at a scale required to support complex societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a slew of archeological finds in recent decades — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia">the discovery of ancient urban centers in Amazonian areas of modern-day Bolivia</a> — has revealed that people were actively shaping the Amazon for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans (<em>SN: 5/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Most scientists today agree that the presence of dark earth near archaeological sites means that long-ago Amazonians used this soil to grow crops. But while some archaeologists argue that people purposely made the soil, others contend that dark earth was laid down through geologic processes.</p>





<p>Perron and colleagues reviewed interviews of Kuikuro people conducted by a Kuikuro filmmaker in 2018. Those conversations revealed that Kuikuro villagers actively make dark earth — <em>eegepe</em> in Kuikuro — using ash, food scraps and controlled burns.</p>



<p>“When you plant where there is no eegepe, the soil is weak,” explained elder Kanu Kuikuro in one of the interviews. “That is why we throw the ash, manioc peelings and manioc pulp.”</p>



<p>The researchers collected soil samples from around Kuikuro villages and archaeological sites in Brazil’s Xingu River basin. The team found “striking similarities” between dark earth samples from ancient and modern sites, Perron says. Both were far less acidic than surrounding soils — probably thanks to the neutralizing effect of ash — and contained higher levels of plant-friendly nutrients.</p>

<h4>Dark earth could store a lot of carbon in the Amazon</h4>



<p>These analyses also revealed that dark earth holds twice the amount of carbon as surrounding soils on average. Infrared scans of the Xingu region suggest that the area is pockmarked with dark earth, and that as much as roughly 9 megatons of carbon — the annual carbon emissions of a small, industrialized country — may have gone unaccounted in the area, the researchers reported at the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This number, while preliminary, could inflate to roughly the annual carbon emissions of the United States when all dark earth across the Amazon is taken into consideration, Perron says.</p>



<p>Figuring out how much carbon is actually stored in the Amazon could help improve climate simulations. But the researchers’ estimates are a “huge extrapolation from a very small dataset,” Baker cautions — a sentiment echoed by Perron.</p>



<p>Pinning down the true value of carbon stored in the Amazon’s dark earth will require more data, says Antoinette WinklerPrins, a geographer at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the study. Still, the research has “profound implications of the past and future” of the Amazon, she says.</p>



<p>For one thing, the technique highlights how ancient people were able to thrive in the Amazon by developing sustainable farming that doubled as a carbon-sequestration technique. With more and more greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere, making dark earth — or something like it — could be a method of mitigating climate change while supporting agriculture in the tropics.</p>



<p>“People in the ancient past figured out a way to store lots of carbon for hundreds or even thousands of years,” Perron says. “Maybe we can learn something from that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-beans-strategy-shade-moth">Jumping beans’ random strategy always leads to shade — eventually</a></h4>

              
                <p>Given enough time, jumping beans will always find their way out of the sun.</p>



<p>Jumping beans, which are really seed pods with twitchy moth larvae inside, hop around in a way that — if they live long enough — is <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/accepted/91078Rc6Gf214f2471c06a70cd26a2926ce89101e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guaranteed to eventually land them in the shade</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in January in <em>Physical Review E</em>.</p>



<p>When a jumping bean finds itself in a sunny spot where it might overheat and die, the moth larva will twitch to make the bean jump a short distance. “If I’m a bean and I exist outside of the shade,” says physicist Pasha Tabatabai of Seattle University, “all I want to know is what’s the eventual probability of finding shade?”</p>





<p>To determine how the creatures approach the problem, Tabatabai and Devon McKee — now a computer scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz — tracked the jumps of beans placed on a warm surface. They discovered that each jump was in a random direction, with no correlation to the previous jumps. Mathematicians call this way of moving around a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/winning-winding-random-walk">random walk</a> (<em>SN: 3/15/06</em>).</p>



<p>While a random walk isn’t a quick way to travel, Tabatabai says, a creature using it to move on a surface, like the ground near a tree, will theoretically visit every place on the surface eventually. That means a random walking bean will always end up in the shade if it keeps it up long enough.</p>



<p>Picking a direction and repeatedly going that way would cover distance faster. “You’re certainly going to find shade fastest,” Tabatabai says — assuming you’re headed the right way. “But it’s also very likely that you’ll pick the wrong direction and never find shade.”</p>



<p>Random walks are slow, and many jumping beans don’t survive to find shade in real life. But, Tabatabai says, the strategy minimizes the odds that they will never escape the sun.</p>

<p>Medicare records from 2007 through 2016 show that the fungi have spread, causing infection rates above a certain threshold in 47 states and Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>These fungi are now “a lot more common than we think they are,” says Andrej Spec, an infectious diseases doctor and mycologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p>





<p>Doctors using maps from the 1950s and ’60s may fail to diagnose infections in patients who live outside of the fungi’s historical borders. Such missed or delayed diagnoses can have deadly consequences.</p>



<p>Spec and colleagues drew updated maps for <em>Histoplasma</em> cases and for two other fungi whose ranges have expanded, probably because of climate change.</p>



<p>Coccidioidomycosis cases, caused by <em>Coccidioides</em> fungi, have spread from their 1955 roots in the Southwest to 35 states, Medicare records indicate. <em>Coccidioides</em> includes fungi that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">cause valley fever</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-microbes-air-health-risk-bacteria-fungi">Wildfires have been linked</a> to a rise in valley fever cases in recent years (<em>SN: 4/13/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When diagnosing infections, doctors are taught to look for horses, not zebras, meaning tests typically focus on common infectious organisms, not rare ones, Spec says. “We’ve talked about these [fungi] as zebras … but they’re not zebras. They’re Clydesdales. Clydesdales aren’t the most common horse you’ll see, but they’re still horses.”</p>





<p>He hopes the updated maps encourage doctors to test for the fungi more often in patients with lung infections.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541600713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Voice in the Wilderness</a><br><em>Joseph L. Graves Jr.<br>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>It’s both good and bad that the first Black American to earn a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology is not a long-ago hidden figure but a contemporary scientist. On the upside, there’s no agonizing over papers no one saved, no stitching together other people’s memoirs to guess what pioneering might have felt like. Instead, Joseph L. Graves Jr., who finished his degree in 1988, tells his story himself in <em>A Voice in the Wilderness</em>.</p>





<p>But evolutionary biology’s first Black Ph.D. in 1988? That “first” came late even considering that the field took a while to declare itself a specialty. The Society for the Study of Evolution didn’t form until 1946.</p>



<p>Long before that, U.S. Black biologists had started cracking the glass ceiling of academic credentials. Graves credits Alfred O. Coffin as the first Black American to earn a biological Ph.D., awarded in 1889. He began a slow, intermittent series of Black Ph.D. biologists, who also struggled to get jobs befitting their credentials. Even now, while nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population is Black, Black scientists make up only about 3 percent of the resident Ph.D.s working in a biological discipline.</p>



<p>Showing how racism narrows the gateways to science becomes a major theme in<em> A Voice in the Wilderness</em> as Graves describes his own twisty, bruising path to becoming a “first.” Yet he declares that the book isn’t an autobiography but a call to embrace evolutionary science as crucial to the times we live in. <em>Voice</em> feels like a long, candid, free-flowing conversation. Graves mixes in bitter and sweet childhood memories, the lab challenges of coaxing insects to fly in place, quick math and science explainers, enthusiastic accounts of the scientific questions that drew him to the field, vignettes from his political activism, his alienation from and return to Christianity, some <em>Star Trek</em>…</p>



<p>Graves has already published on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12052-019-0110-5?fbclid=IwAR1vjZReAkzSLY8bEdcSGUJImAF5xUy9xUmlU7VXutr4f3cJhuKBsHzgmJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why Black evolutionary biologists are rare</a>, lamenting the longtime lack of an inclusive culture and the few, often barely visible, role models. Also, evolutionary biology has baggage. He described in his 2001 book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-emperor-s-new-clothes-biological-theories-of-race-at-the-millennium-joseph-l-graves-jr/12292320?ean=9780813533025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Emperor’s New Clothes</em></a>, a long whack-a-mole history of serial racist pseudoscience. Polygeny, for instance, a popular 19th century delusion, held that races had independent origins and were separate species. In the 20th century, the selective breeding notions of eugenics supposedly justified forced sterilizations and exterminations to purge unwanted traits as if people were livestock. Misuse of science continues, though Graves highlights a few heroes who have summoned science to fight the perversions.</p>

<h4>First Black U.S. Ph.D.s in their fields</h4>



<p>Black talent in the United States long contributed to science without Ph.D.s, but breaking through the barriers to earn the formal credentials was also a major achievement. Alfred O. Coffin is credited as the first Ph.D. biologist, earning his degree in 1889. Here are examples of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2962707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other pioneering Black Ph.D.s (from a 1997 accounting</a>). New scholarship may unearth even earlier pioneers but being second or third was still hard work.</p>



<p>1876: Physicist Edward Alexander Bouchet</p>



<p>1907: Entomologist Charles Henry Turner</p>



<p>1915: Physiologist Julian Herman Lewis</p>



<p>1916: Chemist St. Elmo Brady</p>



<p>1921: Botanist Thomas Wyatt Turner</p>



<p>1925: Mathematician Elbert Frank Cox</p>



<p>1930: Anatomist Roscoe Lewis McKinney</p>



<p>1942: Geologist Marguerite Thomas Williams</p>

<p>Graves’ own path was not easy. His parents were born in 1920s Virginia. His grandfather started the migration north after a tip that the Ku Klux Klan was about to target him. His moonshine was getting too competitive with white suppliers’.</p>



<p>“Both my parents grew up under the constant threat of the lynch rope should they in any way sass a white person,” Graves writes. He was born in New Jersey in 1955. “Four months after I was born, young Emmett Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi, for supposedly doing just that.”</p>



<p>Graves attended largely white-majority schools that didn’t see his potential. His mother, Helen, was the advocate who won him his education. For instance, she fought back when his elementary school pushed to move him into “special education.” Then in third grade, eye tests revealed that what he really needed were glasses. New possibilities dawned.</p>



<p>Another critical boost came from a student teacher who noticed that the library books he read were more complicated than his classmates’ reading. At the age of 13, for instance, he was fascinated by Charles Darwin’s <em>On the</em> <em>Origin of Species</em> and wowed by Karl Marx’s <em>Manifesto.</em><em></em></p>



<p>At another turning point, he convinced some kids playing chess to let him have a try. He lost badly but found two chess books in the library that he devoured that night. “In hindsight, I credit chess with being the most important factor changing the trajectory of my life,” he writes. He played on the school team and made lifelong friends.</p>



<p>His path through higher education got complicated. He went to Oberlin College in Ohio because its recruiting brochures had pictures of students who looked like him. There were still some tough spots. He and many other students struggled with freshman physics. Yet, as far as he could tell, he and the class’s other Black student were the only ones to get their final exams back marked, “You have no talent for physics, you should never take another physics class at this college.” Graves avoided physics, but the other student went on to earn a physics Ph.D. at MIT.</p>



<p>While studying parasites for his master’s degree, Graves discovered that his ability to spot weaknesses in current knowledge, which led him to overthink exam answers in his earlier school days, became a strength in research.</p>



<p>For his Ph.D., at first he wanted to go to Harvard University despite his experiences on campus visits. He recalls “European American students coming back and locking their offices or removing valuables from sight when I walked through the common area.”</p>



<p>The National Science Foundation awarded him a fellowship in 1979, not just honoring his talent but offering schools the catnip of full funding for his tuition and support. “I suspect I am the only person in the history of the [fellowship] to be rejected for admission to a graduate program in the same year the award was made,” he writes. Harvard informed him that he was qualified but that no one could be found to advise him.</p>



<p>So he happily plunged into the intellectual fizz of the University of Michigan. Yet passionate political activism eventually pulled him away. He organized efforts to stop Klan threats against Black Americans moving into Detroit suburbs. He went to the United Kingdom to stand arm in arm with the wives of striking miners as police charged them.</p>

<h4>First Black U.S. faculty hires</h4>



<p>Even after Black Americans began earning Ph.D.s , finding a faculty position at highly ranked, white-majority universities was just about impossible for decades. Harvard University’s dental school, one of the rare white-majority dental schools to take Black students, hired one of its own graduates, George F. Grant, in 1870. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25073834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A survey published in 2007</a>, however, didn’t find other examples of openly Black teaching faculty scholars at high-profile, white-majority schools — in any academic discipline — until 72 years later. Here’s a sampling of when a few select schools hired their first Black faculty.</p>



<p>1870: George F. Grant &#8211; Harvard University</p>



<p>1942: W. Allison Davis &#8211; University of Chicago</p>



<p>1952: Joseph T. Gier &#8211; University of California, Berkeley</p>



<p>1953: William F. Strother &#8211; Princeton University</p>



<p>1956: Joseph R. Applegate &#8211; MIT</p>



<p>1962: Michael G. Cooke &#8211; Yale University</p>



<p>1970: James Lowell Gibbs Jr.&nbsp;&#8211; Stanford University</p>

<p>Graves returned to academics and finished his Ph.D. in 1988 at Wayne State University in Detroit. His career took off as he worked on the evolutionary genetics of aging, and in 1994 he was elected a fellow&nbsp;of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Today, he’s a professor at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, a historically Black school.</p>



<p>In keeping with his activist past, Graves uses his evolutionary expertise to fight racism that claims a basis in science and to advocate for a culture that values scientific reasoning. The book’s title comes from the biblical phrase, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’” It has become a metaphor, Graves says, “for any perspective of great importance and truth that has been silenced to maintain the status quo.” He is far from silenced.</p>

<p>The president of an Iranian university and a colleague appear to have published the same microelectronics paper twice, according to allegations seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The articles, by <a href="https://nit.ac.ir/en/page/738/presidential-office">Bahram Azizollah Ganji</a> and Kamran Delfan Hemmati of Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, deal with the design of a new capacitive accelerometer with a high dynamic range and sensitivity. Both appeared online in 2020, <a href="http://www.midem-drustvo.si/Journal%20papers/MIDEM_50(2020)1p55.pdf">first</a> in the Slovenia-based <em>Journal of Microelectronics, Electronic Components and Materials</em> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00542-020-04932-4">later</a> in the higher-impact Springer journal <em>Microsystem Technologies</em>. The former version has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, while the latter has been cited twice.</p>



<p>The editors of <em>Microsystem Technologies</em> were made aware of the allegations on November 16 in an email that cited &#8220;significantly identical content&#8221; in the two papers. &#8220;Pretty much the entire introduction section and almost all figures are an exact copy from&#8221; the authors&#8217; previous article, the email stated.</p>



<span id="more-126333"></span>



<p>In a response shared with Retraction Watch, a Springer publishing assistant wrote on November 24:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I heard back from the Editors in Chief and they are all in agreement that this is a serious breach of ethical standards and violates copyrights laws. I am in contact with our Research Integrity Group daily and we are working to get this manuscript withdrawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <em>Microsystem Technologies</em> article has not been retracted as of this writing.</p>



<p>The allegations first surfaced publicly in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/international-community-of-iranian-academics_evidence-of-plagiarism-in-the-work-of-bahram-activity-7002089110836326401-JSrs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">LinkedIn post</a> from November by the International Community of Iranian Academics. The post included pictures highlighting identical passages and figures in the two articles, prefacing them with the text, &#8220;Evidence of plagiarism in the work of Bahram Azizollah Ganji, current president of Babol Noshirvani University of Technology and one of the prominent faces of oppression in the Islamic Republic’s higher education.&#8221;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has called the university and contacted both authors by email, but has not been able to reach them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/get-messages-sent-through-wormhole-relativity">We could get messages back from spacecraft sent through a wormhole</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you ever happen to fall through a wormhole in space, you won’t be coming back. It will snap shut behind you. But <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.104054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you may have just enough time to send a message</a> to the rest of us from the other side, researchers report in the Nov. 15 <em>Physical Review D</em>.</p>



<p>No one has yet seen a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-circling-wormhole-weird-gravitational-waves">wormhole</a>, but theoretically they could provide shortcuts to distant parts of the universe, or to other universes entirely, if they exist (<em>SN: 7/27/17</em>).&nbsp;Physicists have long known that one of the most commonly studied types of wormholes would be extremely unstable and would collapse if any matter entered it. It wasn’t clear, though, just how fast that might happen or what it means for something, or someone, heading into it.</p>





<p>Now, a new computer program shows how one type of wormhole would respond when something travels through it.</p>



<p>“You build a probe and you send it through” in the wormhole simulation, says Ben Kain, a physicist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. “You’re not necessarily trying to get it to come back, because you know the wormhole is going to collapse — but could a light signal get back in time before a collapse? And we found that it is possible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior studies of wormholes have concluded that the cosmic passageways could potentially stay open for repeated trips back and forth, Kain says, provided they’re supported by a form of matter that’s so exotic it’s called “ghost matter.” </p>



<p>Theoretically, ghost matter responds to gravity in exactly the opposite way to normal matter. That is, a ghost matter apple would fall up from a tree branch instead of down. While allowed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, ghost matter almost certainly doesn’t exist in reality, Kain says (<em>SN: 2/3/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Kain simulated ghost matter traveling through a wormhole and found that it caused the hole to expand as expected, rather than collapsing.</p>



<p>It was a different story with anything made of normal matter; that would trigger a collapse that pinches the hole closed and leaves something resembling a black hole behind, Kain’s simulation confirmed. But it would happen slowly enough for a fast-moving probe to transmit light-speed signals back to our side just before the wormhole completely closes.</p>



<p>Kain doesn’t imagine ever sending humans through a wormhole, if such things are ever found. “Just the capsule and a video camera. It’s all automated,” he says. It’ll be a one-way trip, “but we can at least get some video seeing what this device sees.”</p>





<p>The idea should be approached with a fair bit of skepticism, says physicist Sabine Hossenfelder of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. “[It] requires one to postulate the existence of [things] that for all we know do not exist…. Lots of things you can do mathematically have nothing to do with reality.”</p>



<p>Still, Kain says, it’s a valuable effort that might reveal ways to make wormholes that don’t rely on ghost matter to stay open long enough for us to travel back and forth throughout the universe or beyond.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-prematurely-aged-teens-brains">Brain scans suggest the pandemic prematurely aged teens’ brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Living through the COVID-19 pandemic may have matured teens’ brains beyond their years.</p>



<p>From online schooling and social isolation to economic hardship and a mounting death count, the last few years have been rough on young people. For teens, the pandemic and its many side effects came during a crucial window in brain development.</p>



<p>Now, a small study comparing brain scans of young people from before and after 2020 reveals that <a href="https://www.bpsgos.org/article/S2667-1743(22)00142-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the brains of teens who lived through the pandemic look about three years older than expected</a>, scientists say.</p>





<p>This research, published December 1 in <em>Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science</em>, is the first to look at the impact of the pandemic on brain aging.</p>



<p>The finding reveals that “the pandemic hasn’t been bad just in terms of mental health for adolescents,” says Ian Gotlib, a clinical neuroscientist at Stanford University. “It seems to have altered their brains as well.”</p>



<p>The study can’t link those brain changes to poor mental health during the pandemic. But “we know there is a relationship between adversity and the brain as it tries to adapt to what it’s been given,” says Beatriz Luna, a developmental cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, who wasn’t involved in the research. “I think this is a very important study that sets the ball rolling for us to look at this.”</p>



<p>The roots of this study date back to nearly a decade ago, when Gotlib and his colleagues launched a project in California’s Bay Area to study depression in adolescents. The researchers were collecting information on the mental health of the kids in the study, and did MRI scans of their brains.</p>



<p>Lockdown orders in the spring of 2020 forced the researchers to stop the project. When they restarted a year later, Gotlib worried that stress from the pandemic threatened to skew their results.</p>



<p>It turned out that the kids making their way back to the study after a year of pandemic life were reporting higher rates of anxiety and depression than their peers from before 2020. So, the team decided to compare brain scans captured before the start of the pandemic with scans taken between October 2020 and March 2022. </p>





<p>The researchers looked at differences in 64 scans from each group, matched by the kids’ sex and age, with an average age of around 16 for each group.</p>



<p>The results were “striking,” Gotlib says.</p>



<p>Adolescent brains naturally go through a maturation process that results in the thickening of the hippocampus, an area involved with memory and concentration, and the amygdala, which regulates emotional processing. At the same time, the cortex — an area that regulates emotional functioning — starts thinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain scans revealed that this maturation process had moved more quickly in teens who had lived through the pandemic. Gotlib says that their brains appeared three to four years older than the brains of the teens scanned before the start of the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Exactly what part of the pandemic may have shaped teen brains is unclear. But “this study shows that the pandemic has had a material impact on brain maturation,” says Joan Luby, a child psychiatrist at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>Gotlib suspects that stress is to blame. Previous studies have shown that exposure to violence or negligence can lead to accelerated brain maturation in children. Considering that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-long-term-imprint-health">mental health plummeted for teens during the pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 9/8/22</em>), “it’s not a big leap” to think that the stressful conditions could also have shaped brain development in his study’s cohort, Gotlib says.</p>



<p>But what caused the alterations and what implications they may have are still open questions. Rudolf Uher, a neuroscientist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, points out that other factors like more screen time due to online schooling could be at play. And he cautions that future research may not back up this study’s findings.</p>



<p>And it’s unclear whether accelerated brain aging has impacted teen health, or if issues will manifest later in life. While researchers can’t say for sure, “if your brain is prematurely aging, that’s generally not a good thing,” Luby says.</p>



<p>Either way, ensuring that people have access to mental health services will be crucial to helping children of the pandemic, Gotlib says.</p>



<p>“These kids are hurting,” he says. “We need to take that seriously and make sure we’re offering them treatment.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Elsevier psychology journal took down an article in early December with a notice that appeared to be an internal memo, including a typo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, a letter titled “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820301842?via%3Dihub">First COVID-19 suicide case in Bangladesh due to fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia: Possible suicide prevention strategies</a>,” was published in June of 2020 in the <em>Asian Journal of Psychiatry</em> by Mark D. Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University in the UK and Mohammed A. Mamun of Jahangirnagar University and the Undergraduate Research Organization in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It has been cited more than 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Griffiths’ high publishing rate – according to his <a href="https://llr.ntu.ac.uk/rpd/researchpublications.php?pubid=db51913b-503e-4bef-920c-13d7630b28e5#group_Journal=5Farticle">university’s index</a> he published nearly 200 journal articles in 2022 – came under <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2020/07/percent-by-most-prolific-author-score.html">scrutiny</a> from Oxford University psychologist Dorothy Bishop in 2020, including his <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2020/12/faux-peer-reviewed-journals-threat-to.html">many collaborations</a> with Mamun. Griffiths <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mark-griffiths-professor-who-publishes-paper-every-two-days">told the <em>Times Higher Education</em></a> that he “made an intellectual contribution to every refereed paper I’ve published.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126314"></span>



<p>In September of 2022, an anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#1">commented</a> on the June 2020 article from the <em>Asian Journal of Psychiatry</em>, sharing a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppc.12762">letter to the editor</a> published in <em>Perspectives in Psychiatric Care</em> expressing “a number of concerns” about a similar article by Griffiths and Mamun with other coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#2">Bishop commented</a> in October, pointing out that the article used the name of the person who had died by suicide and did not conform to other guidelines for media reporting on suicide. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is not clear what scientific value there is in such a report, which has potential to cause harm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In November, another anonymous user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#3">posted a long comment</a> detailing questions about the evidence the authors had for multiple statements in the article, based on the news report that they cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal acted in early December, taking down the article and replacing it with this notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Frist [sic] and the foremost, the paper mentions the name of a person who committed suicide (in the third paragraph). Besides, there are comments in pubpeer doubts [sic] the scientific value and scientific rigor of the paper. The editor in chief and I are looking into this. In the meantime, in order to protect the person&#8217;s privacy, we ask you to help us take it down temporarily.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed <a href="https://med.wmich.edu/node/1907">Rajiv Tandon</a>, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Western Michigan University and the journal’s editor in chief, asking about the notice. An Elsevier spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We can confirm there was a glitch with our content platform, which led to the publishing of the internal message instead of the removal notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team is working to resolve this issue and to post the corrected notice – which will explain that the paper has been temporarily removed and will either be replaced or reinstated as soon as we reasonably can. The publisher has confirmed that the removal is due to a violation of our ethical policies, which state that we do not mention names of suicide victims.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Later in December, the publisher replaced the first notice (<a href="https://archive.vn/TknDp#selection-501.0-524.0">archived here</a>), with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820301842?via%3Dihub">this one</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed. A replacement will appear as soon as possible in which the reason for the removal of the article will be specified, or the article will be reinstated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also reached out to Mamun and Griffiths for comment on the paper’s removal and the PubPeer comments. Mamun told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have checked the PubPeer comments and found nothing special to respond to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, they claimed the victim&#8217;s privacy was disclosed. This is not the first disclosure of the victim in our paper. The suicide was reported in many newspapers, on TV, and shared on social media. We used publicly available information, and it is not the first paper published by the AJP; you can check here is another paper (you may get other papers too), for example, disclosed the name of suicide victims: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820304950&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another claim in the PubPeer was we used only a reference where they did not find the information in the cited newspaper. This is apparently right for people living outside Bangladesh and probably never tried to reach us about other sources or any clarification before commenting in the PubPeer. Being the first suicide related to COVID-19, it was the talk of the country, and there were several reports, and posts on social media about it. In addition, I communicated with people known to the victim before writing the correspondence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are waiting for hearing from the editor, as well as, will address all the comments formally, but not in the PubPeer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Griffiths shared with us the formal response to the journal, which we’ve made available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Asian-Journal-of-Psychiatry.-response-MG4-2022.docx">here</a>. It includes point-by-point responses to the PubPeer comments, and additional news articles that the authors said could not be included as references due to the journal’s limitations. </p>



<p>Mamun later told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to let you know that the publisher will reinstate the article as we had nothing wrong regarding all the claims made in PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In September of 2018, Nottingham Trent University <a href="https://forbetterscience.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/rj11.jpg">sent a letter</a> to Julian Derry, who had <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/17/nuttingham-trash-university/">criticized Griffiths</a> and another university professor on his blog, stating that “the content of your blog raises concerns of defamation for this University and its employees” and requesting that he remove it.</p>

                <p>2022 has come and gone and we’ve learned a lot about how the brain is – or isn’t – like an artificial neural network. There isn’t a single journal or venue that focuses exclusively on neuroAI so the literature is spread across preprint servers, conference proceedings and the occasional prestige journal. As an end-of-year treat, I challenged myself to gather all papers in neuroAI that were published this year and tell you all about them. I skimmed through ~130 abstracts and I read a few dozen to find the best, most influential, and most interesting, and extract this year’s zeitgeist. A systematic review this is not; rather, these are my humble musings on the state of neuroAI. Hope you learn something useful!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What counts as neuroAI anyway?</h2>



<p>NeuroAI is the intersection of AI and neuroscience, but that’s a little vague. I couldn’t find a good comprehensive survey of neuroAI that delineated what is and isn’t neuroAI, and I wanted to circumscribe my search. So I enumerated all the different flavours of neuroAI that I’ve seen in the wild and placed them in a two-dimensional rubric:</p>



<ul>
<li>On the horizontal axis, one defines the researcher’s “home turf” or “application area”: AI (left) or neuroscience (right). Usually, papers import ideas from an outside field to their home field. Do you want to understand how to the brain works, or do you want to make better AI?</li>



<li>On the vertical axis, one defines whether one is motivated by applications (”doing useful things”, “engineering”, etc.) at the top vs. curiosity driven at the bottom. </li>
</ul>

I tried to limit this yearly review to core neuroAI, but there’s always a bit of leakage on the sides. You can download an <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Typology_of_neuroAI/21818403">editable and citable version on FigShare</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within this framework we can identify major flavours of neuroAI: mining neuroscience to find ways of making AI better ends up in the top left corner, while using artificial neural nets as models of the brain ends up in the bottom right. We also find less common lines of research, for example animats: brain-AI hybrids, at the bottom. The diagram also identifies big chunks of research that use AI <em>in an instrumental fashion</em> to study brains; these fall outside of core neuroAI. For instance, automatic spike sorting or biomarkers for brain health fall outside of core neuroAI in this classification. I’ve found this diagram useful in explaining what our field is to researchers outside of our field and to understand how different pieces of research fit together. It’s still a work-in-progress so please do let me know if you have better ideas.</p>



<p>Even with this fairly circumscribed definition of neuroAI, it turned out a lot of neuroAI research was published this year! I turned to Twitter and Mastodon to ask people for their favorite publications, then I looked through my Twitter bookmarks, then I searched on Google Scholar for people that I knew. I dedupped, removed papers outside of core neuroAI, then applied a completely arbitrary “does this pique my interest?” filter, and ended up with ~130 publications, excluding abstracts from the SVRHM workshop at NeurIPS which may get its own separate blog post later. To sort through this, I tried using sentence embeddings + a UMAP to visualize the results, but eventually resorted to the tried and true method of clustering by hand. Let’s start with the big ideas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big ideas about the future of neuroAI</h2>



<p>Two whitepapers came out to define neuroAI <em>research programmes</em>: ambitious, decade-long, multi-lab research endeavours to solve big questions. The two are not strictly in opposition – they share a couple of co-authors – but they nevertheless represent different visions of where to take neuroAI.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The neuroconnectionist research programme</h3>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718">Doerig et al. (2022)</a> argue from the bottom right corner of the neuroAI diagram. They define neuroconnectionism as modeling the brain with artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a goldilocks zone of biological detail. There’s a healthy dash of philosophy of science thrown in: it’s fruitful to model the brain with ANNs because it helps us uncover deep truths about how the brain works. The core of the theory is not falsifiable, but the belt can be.</p>

<p>Findings where ANNs differ from the brain in key ways, e.g. adversarial attacks, are envisioned as opportunities to change the belt of the theory. This process can continue until the core theory stops being useful as a scientific paradigm. I think this stance is a default stance of many in the field, and it is aggressively neutral: we do neuroAI because we think that brains are cool and we should study them and we now we have a useful tool to do so, so let’s do that!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Toward Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence: Catalyzing the NeuroAI Revolution</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08340">Tony Zador and a who’s-who of AI people and computational neuroscientists</a> argue from the top left corner of the neuroAI diagram: let’s learn about the brain so we can solve AI. Current generation AI is specialized; even a modest mouse shows far more adaptive behaviour than a 300B parameter NLP model trained on the entire internet. They propose a framework and a challenge to measure adaptive behaviour: the embodied Turing test. In their words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>An expanded “embodied Turing test” would benchmark and compare the interactions with the world of artificial systems versus humans and other animals. […] An artificial beaver might be tested on its ability to build a dam, and an artificial squirrel on its ability to jump through trees. Nonetheless, many core sensorimotor capabilities are shared by almost all animals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The way they propose doing this is by building up a series of incremental challenges, starting from simple behaviours (e.g. locomotion) and organisms (e.g. nematodes) and building up on those systems one by one by a process of phylogenetic refinement. The paper that embodies the clearest this vision this year is <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=KblXjniQCHY">this wacky NeurIPS paper</a> from Tony Zador, Bhattasali and Engel where they show how to build an RL agent that can swim by reverse engineering the nematode (C. Elegans) swimming circuit. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Yes, and…</h3>



<p>I am enthusiastic about each of these research programmes. I think they’ll be reinforced by an additional focus on applications of differentiable brain models to brain health (top right corner). With a perfect digital twin of a brain, one could figure out how to stimulate the brain in the right way to give relief to people with neurological disorders. This corner of the neuroAI diagram has deep intellectual roots in cybernetics, but it’s broadly underexplored. Developing the tools to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00583-8">study the brain’s reaction to causal manipulations</a> might give modellers precisely the data they need to make progress in other corners of neuroAI. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/18/whats-the-endgame-of-neuroai/">I wrote a long read about this idea</a> here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skeptical outlooks</h2>



<p>Not everybody came out as pro-neuroAI this year: we saw a lot of skeptical takes and monster Twitter threads. Is neuroAI broken? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">High-performing neural network models of visual cortex benefit from high latent dimensionality</h3>



<p>This paper from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.13.499969v1">Elmoznino and Bonner (2022)</a> looked at the dimensionality of convolutional neural networks acting on images. Here, they defined dimensionality as the effective number of non-zero dimensions via the singular values of the encoding matrices across the ImageNet validation set. They found that networks with high dimensionality correspond better with area IT of the visual cortex. Super interesting idea and pretty convincing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="8080" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/image-1-6/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png" data-orig-size="1328,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=1024" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-8080" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png?w=768 768w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-1.png 1328w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Effective dimensionality correlates with match to IT</figcaption></figure>



<p>This paper was interpreted by some skeptics to mean that <em>it’s not really the network that matters;</em> it’s the fact that the network projects to some high-dimensional space. In other words, one could construct a network that projects input to random directions in a high-dimensional space and that would match well with the brain. That would be a blow to the interpretation that IT is similar to a high-level layer of a deep convolutional neural net</p>



<p>However, that’s not what the paper found: instead, they found that in their sample of neural nets, the ones with higher dimensionality had compact class manifolds. That means that images with the same label were close in feature space. That would not be true for random projections. This paper adds to the body of evidence that there’s something special about the way the brain iteratively refolds image manifolds into <s>beautiful origami swans</s> useful representations; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05808">see also Arna Ghosh’s paper for an application of this idea</a> to DNN regularization.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s still a possibility that it&#8217;s easier to match a low-d brain to a high-d network because of a <em>needle-in-a-haystack</em> effect; there&#8217;s just more potential matches within a high-d representation. I think we&#8217;ll need more subtle metrics than R2 from linear regression to see that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWIiR6mjrXY">Elizabeth Dupre has a beautiful presentation at MAIN2022</a> on the myriad bespoke metrics fMRI people use that we should probably import for neurophysiology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brain hierarchy score: Which deep neural networks are hierarchically brain-like?</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221009810">This paper from Nonaka et al. is from 2021</a>, but I heard about it in 2022 so it makes it into this review. They measured the match between a unit in a given layer of a CNN and the best matching visual cortex voxel and vice-versa to create brain hierarchy scores: how close is the match between V1-V2-V4-IT of the visual cortex and layers 1-2-3-4 of the CNN? This is a harder criterion than to ask that <em>on average</em> the layers of the CNN match those of the visual cortex. They found that shallower models with fully connected layers performed best. Furthermore, even the best DNNs only recapitulated the hierarchy of the brain coarsely.</p>



<p>This does highlight a failure mode of the correspondence between DNNs and brain: DNNs trained end-to-end are underspecified in their correspondence between a specific brain area and an intermediate layer. To resolve this, I think we’ll need to directly supervise intermediate DNN layers by sprinkling in brain data to constrain specific layers to match specific areas. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.21.477293v1">St-Yves et al. (2022)</a> found that you can train a big DNN with multiple readout heads to account for responses in V1, V2, V3, V4h. This doesn’t do better than training separate networks according to traditional criteria like R2 or RSA, but it does better respect the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reassessing hierarchical correspondences between brain and deep networks through direct interface</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2219">Sexton &amp; Love (2022)</a> propose a stricter evaluation of the correspondence between brains and deep neural networks, what you might call the old switcheroo: if the brain really is a proxy for a neural network (or vice versa), then it should be possible to replace the input to an intermediate layer of a neural network with a brain-based prediction of that input. They did this and it didn’t work very well unless the target was one of the very last few layers of the neural network. They conclude from this that the hierarchical correspondence between ANNs and brains must have been incorrectly evaluated in the past, since all brain areas – including primary visual cortex – best correspond to higher-level layers of ANNs.</p>

<p>On the surface, this paper makes the same point as the brain hierarchy score paper. I liked the brain hierarchy score paper, but I’m skeptical about this one. My criticism is pretty simple: you can’t just plug a brain into an ANN and expect it to work out of the box. The ANN is not trained to deal with the noise inherent in brain data, the linear regression doesn’t take into account that noise (error-in-variables model), nor does it attempt to mimic the spatial structure of the mismatch (assumption of iid noise in multiple linear regression). A quick sanity check would have been to learn the weights by minimizing the multinomial classification loss on ImageNet rather than using a sum-of-squares loss for the intermediate activations. I bet it would reverse the conclusions in Figure 2. That being said, the paper is based on open data, so I think it would be a feasible and enlightening project for an enterprising student to come up with a method that could solve the brain-DNN impedance mismatch.</p>



<p><em>Edit</em>: the senior author Bradley Love let me know in the comments that they did run this sanity check. The plot thickens! I&#8217;d still like to see normative simulations to verify that, for example, if you plug a CNN with one seed into another CNN with the same architecture and training but a different random seed. I think the CKA work from <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/kornblith19a.html">Kornblith et al. (2019)</a>, as well as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/252a3dbaeb32e7690242ad3b556e626b-Abstract.html">follow-up work with Alex Williams</a> give a really nice template for how to validate new metrics comparing brains and neural networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">But wait, there&#8217;s more!</h3>



<p>After I first published this, a few people pointed out in the comments and on Twitter other papers with a skeptical outlook. Whatever doesn&#8217;t kill neuroAI will only make it stronger (cf. Doerig et al. 2022), so here they are:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/5zf4s/">Deep Problems with Neural Network Models of Human Vision</a>: there&#8217;s a long history of human psychophysics and vision psychology. A lot of that has been brushed aside in neuroAI with a narrow focus on accounting for R2. This paper makes the point that <em>we need more subtle metrics</em>, which is always a winning argument in my book. In particular, we should be able to replicate subtle effects measured with parametric laboratory stimuli through classical psychophysics. I&#8217;m on board with this idea. Where I have a difference of opinions is in the proposed alternative: non-image-computable, bespoke computational models. I can&#8217;t do encoding, decoding, optimization or control with this set of models, so I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re viable candidates for best-in-class models of visual processing. Perhaps hybrid models will come along.</li>



<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03740">Successes and critical failures of neural networks in capturing human-like speech recognition</a>. A similar paper to the previous one, sharing some authors, but this time focused on audition. I haven&#8217;t dug deeply into this one yet.</li>



<li><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=mxi1xKzNFrb">No Free Lunch from Deep Learning in Neuroscience: A Case Study through Models of the Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit</a>: This paper makes the point that some neuroAI papers have to bake in a lot of assumptions, fine-tuning research degrees of freedom until they get the desired result. They show this for models of grid cell formation. I like this paper a lot: it shows a particular trap in modelling that we should avoid. One way to show that our modelling choices are sensible and robust: doing sensitivity analyses (inspired by Bayesian modelling). </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Auditory cortex and language</h2>



<p>We saw a slew of papers that link auditory and language processing areas to deep neural nets. Some rapid-fire highlights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Self-supervised audio models match auditory cortex: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14252">Vaidya et al. (2022)</a> found that self-supervised auditory models (SSL-audio), especially HuBERT, are a match to auditory cortex during story listening. They saw a recapitulation of the auditory hierarchy, with lower levels of HuBERT matching lower auditory areas and higher layers matching more conventionally semantic areas. This is consistent with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01685">a similar study from Millet et al. (2022)</a>.</li>



<li>Self-supervised large language models match language processing areas: A number of studies found that transformers trained for masked language modelling or next token predictions (e.g. GPT-2) were aligned with responses of the brain to natural language. This includes <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2105646118">Schrimpf et al. (2021)</a>, which came out late last year, as well as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03036-1">Caucheteux &amp; King (2022)</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201968119">Heilbron et al. (2022)</a>. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.04.510681v1.abstract">Hosseini et al. (2022)</a> found that this was true even with developmentally realistic amounts of training data: does it mean that children are little GPT-2 language prediction machines? It’s certainly an intriguing idea.</li>



<li>Decoding speech from brain data: Last year, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2027540">Eddie Chang and his group made a big splash</a> demonstrating that a locked-in person could communicate by decoding signals in their intact speech motor cortex (disclosure: my old group at Facebook funded this work). They used an invasive ECoG array to record from this patient’s brain. This year, multiple groups have attempted to reconstruct perceived or attempted speech <em>non- or minimally-invasively</em>, which is hugely ambitious: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.509744v1">Tang et al. (2022)</a> from fMRI recordings, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12266">Defossez et al. (2022) from MEG</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01457">Kohler et al. (2022)</a> from depth electrodes. Silent speech is surprisingly amenable to decoding because it has wide brain coverage (it seems the whole brain does semantic encoding), it’s relatively low bandwidth, and doesn’t have extremely high accuracy requirements to be useful. Perhaps in a not-too-distant future I can silently speak to my device</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital twins, BCIs, stimulation</h2>



<p>I mentioned earlier that differentiable brain models (i.e. digital twins) could be used to predict the effect of stimulation on the brain and tune that stimulation through gradient descent (top right corner of the neuroAI diagram). I saw two papers that really ran with this idea this year:</p>



<ul>
<li>Differentiable models of retinal implants: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13623">Granley et al. (2022)</a> showed that one could tune the stimulation pattern of a retinal implant to best stimulate the retina using a differentiable model of the effect of the stimulation. They showed in simulation this could give clearer phosphenes that are closer to the ideal of a dot-matrix display. This was one of my favorite papers of the year: obviously important idea, subtle modelling, great proof-of-concept.</li>



<li>Differentiable, personalized models of cochlear implants: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9747683">Drakopoulos and Verhulst (2022)</a> take this idea one conceptual step forward by demonstrating that one could tune a cochlear implant to one’s particular dysfunction, using a differentiable model of the cochlea.</li>
</ul>



<p>This idea of optimizing stimuli using a proxy model also has applications for fundamental research: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921010831">Gu et al. (2022)</a> demonstrate making maximally activating stimuli (i.e. localizers) for particular brain areas measured through fMRI, while <a href="http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.12.09.519708">Cobos et al. (2022)</a> build image metamers of the visual system of mice that transfer across individuals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Non-convolutional and quasi-convolutional architectures for vision</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/04/16/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net/">wrote last year</a> about an apparent mismatch between convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and the visual cortex: brains don’t have a mechanism for weight sharing that we know of. This year, a number of papers came out investigating this and proposing solutions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Convolutional structure emerges in fully connected networks: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201854119">Ingrosso and Goldt (2022)</a> show that localized filters with convolutional structure can emerge in fully connected networks trained to solve a task on inputs with non-Gaussian statistics. They then develop a theory for when this these localized filters may emerge. I’d like to see this type of work expanded beyond toy problems and with known cortical architectural biases baked in, namely sparse, locally connections.</li>



<li>IT domains emerge in topographic layers: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2112566119">Blauch, Berhmann &amp; Plaut (2022)</a> propose a non-convolutional model for the emergence of domains in IT. Basically, they use a standard convolutional base for V1-V2-V4, and allow the V4-IT connection to be fully connected. IT is instead modelled as a topographic layer with local connections instead of a convolutional layer. They show this arrangement can learn domains specialized to domains, faces or scenes.</li>



<li>Visual streams emerge in topographic networks: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=E1iY-d13smd">Finzi et al. (2022)</a> take a similar approach, this time learning a self-supervised representation of images with a topographic layer on top of a ResNet-18 backbone. They show that this can account for the segregation of different visual streams in visual cortex. This is broadly consistent with <a href="https://ventral-dorsal-model.netlify.app/">our 2021 NeurIPS paper</a>.</li>



<li>Topographic maps through kernel averaging: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00062">Bashivan et al. (2022)</a> build a new type of topographic layer by averaging over the kernel dimension. They find filters which slowly vary spatially, not unlike the pinwheels and orientation domains of primary visual cortex.</li>



<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010270">Pooling strategies in V1 can account for the functional and structural diversity across species</a>: after I originally published this blog post, the author let me know about this cool study published in PLoS Comb Bio with a similar idea as Bashivan et al. to explain maps and selectivity in V1 of different species.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food for thought</h2>



<p>Finally, here are some papers that either made me smile or made my blood boil, but definitely didn’t leave me indifferent:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010427">MouseNet</a>: fantastic idea: create a CNN that mirrors the architecture of the mouse visual cortex. Lots of technical detail in there about circuits and connection patterns. Did they find this network to be a better match to mouse visual cortex? No! In fact, they found that a plain VGG was a better match to the areas they were looking at. Big caveat, however: they used ImageNet as the task to train the network. Points towards the need to train neural nets with more ecologically relevant tasks or with direct supervision for intermediate areas.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.12.511910v1">Astrocytes and neurons implement transformer architecture</a>: this is a sort of left field proposal for how neurons and astrocytes might implement self-attention. The idea is that an astrocyte can implement a shared multiplier across multiple synapses. The astrocyte here is viewed as a computational element that uses calcium to maintain state. There’s definitely a few fishy things in this paper, like the softmax implemented through random cosine projections (how would a neuron implement a cosine function?). More generally, I can’t make up my mind about whether this is truly biologically plausible or not, because I don’t know anything about astrocytes, but I think it’s very ambitious and interesting.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627322008066">Sentient neurons in a dish learn how to play Pong</a>: boy I didn’t like this paper. Published in <em>a prestige journal that shall not be named</em>, this paper demonstrated a hybrid computational architecture where a set of biological neurons in a dish solved a Pong. This is a very cool idea, a follow-up to Steve Potter’s work on animats. There’s a genuinely new method proposed to interface biological neurons and virtual environments so the neurons actually learn something based on the free energy principle. However: this paper was super hype-y (”the hybrid NN achieved sentence”, come on), the results were barely above chance, and the core idea, that the HNN would arrange itself so as to make the environment more predictable, untested. Someone (not me!) took the Twitter threads and put it on PubPeer, if you want to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6FAE3AB72B21C472D0B47ACB2FDC15">see other people’s takes</a>.</li>



<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06956">Brain Dall-E</a>: two of the biggest stories this year in AI were diffusion models (Dall-E 2, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney and the rest) and ChatGPT. It was only a matter of time before someone would take one of these and mix them with brain data. This paper uses a Latent Diffusion Model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">Rombach et al. 2022</a>), an open source model distinct from, but in the same model family as the closed source Dall-E. They use this to decode brain data while people were viewing images in the scanner. Basically, a text-conditional diffusion model normally works by taking a sentence, encoding it into a fixed length vector, then using that conditioning information to bias a denoiser (for instance by changing the scaling of normalization layers). It’s possible to learn a model which uses brain data to create desired fixed length conditioning vector instead, hence Brain + Latent Diffusion. This works remarkably well. I would like to use this while sleeping so I can finally remember my dreams. After I published this, a reader let me know of a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.abstract">similar paper from Takagi and Nishimoto</a> which uses Stable Diffusion checkpoints; the difference between the LDM used in the first paper and this one, AFAICT, is that the first LDM is trained on ImageNet, whereas this one is trained on LAION.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.430904v2">Predictive coding</a>: there were a couple of papers on predictive coding, but none more elegant than this one from Tim Kietzmann’s group which came out late last year. They show that predictive coding can emerge by minimizing the total energy needs of a network. They use a new form of regularization that takes into account the cost of EPSPs. I thought this was very elegant and I’d love to see it expanded to more realistic scenarios involving naturalistic movies.</li>



<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010522">Letter perception as neuronal recycling</a>: if there’s one big mystery in visual perception, it’s how do we read? Clearly we haven’t had the time to evolve brain processes specific to reading, because writing is such a recent invention, so we must in some sense recycle existing hardware to do so. This excellent paper from Talia Konkle’s group tests this hypothesis. They train different neural nets on either generic object recognition (i.e. ImageNet) or specifically letter recognition. They find that generic networks are a better match than specifically letter-trained networks. Then they ask whether they can get an even better fit by fine-tuning an object-recognition network for letter perception, and they find this is indeed the case. This is a great strength of neuroAI approaches: we don’t have time machines to study human evolution, we can’t do causal experiments on natural selection, but we can study the evolution of brain processes <em>in silico</em>.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Onwards to 2023</h2>



<p><em>Look back: <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/12/31/2021-in-review-unsupervised-brain-models/">Read the 2021 year end review</a></em>.</p>



<p>So what to make of all this? In terms of insider baseball: If there’s one lesson I saw this year repeated over and over again, it’s that architectural choices alone have an overall relatively small influence on how well an ANN is matched to a brain. <a href="http://www.brain-score.org/">Brain-Score is getting pretty hard to beat</a>. I think we will see a paper (or papers) that 0) use an architecture that is brain-like, 1) carefully select datasets to match ecologically relevant and 2) use auxiliary brain data to enforce that one brain area = one DNN layer to make a big dent in Brain-Score.</p>



<p>I’m seeing tantalizing hints that people are really starting to think about applications. I also see that neuroAI is becoming bigger than any particular lab, with multi-lab research programmes being put forward. We may see a BRAIN initiative-level effort across multiple labs come to fore. It’s a great time to jump into the fray!</p>

To view this big question from a broad perspective at the end of each year, I&#8217;m reporting some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications.

This year, I have been busy with preparations for the implementation of this line of research and hope to be working on it next year. Experimentally, I have been mostly occupied with &#8211; and more and more intrigued by &#8211; the study of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v1">hippocampal astrocytes and how they integrate calcium signals</a>. In experiments connected to this project, we are now studying the role of neuromodulation and the locus coeruleus in more detail. And I&#8217;m glad that I can learn more about this interesting brain area by doing experiments myself. But I will discuss this in another blog post in more detail.</p>



<p>For this write-up, I want to discuss a small subfield of neuroscience that I only became aware of this autumn and that is closely related to ideas of self-organized neuronal networks: the experimental study of learning in cell cultures. How can the neuronal system of a cell culture be used to interact with a (virtual) world in a closed loop? In this blog post, I will discuss a few important papers to understand what can be studied with this model system of learning.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think that this field is interesting in principle, as it provides a method to study plasticity (although this is not necessarily the primary aim of this kind of research). The method suffers from the problem, as most <em>in vitro </em>slice approaches as well, that experimental protocols for plasticity induction might be artificial and not related to processes <em>in vivo</em>.</p>



<p>I became aware if the field in October, when a high-profile paper on this topic came out and was prominently covered on social media &#8211; partly for making misleading claims and not citing prior research. I want to make it better and start chronologically with a seminal paper from 2001.</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons is trained to stop a stimulus</strong></p>



<p>Shahaf and Marom showed in 2001 what can be described as &#8220;learning-in-a-dish&#8221; [1,2]. In these experiments, they grew a culture of cortical neurons on a 2D multi-electrode array (MEA) such that they could both stimulate these neurons and record from them. They used this system to provide some neurons with a specific stimulus. When the neuronal network exhibited a certain firing pattern briefly after stimulation, the stimulation was stopped. With this approach, the cultured network was embedded in a closed-cloop interaction.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the cultured network indeed started to increasingly show these spiking patterns that stopped the external stimulation. The observation is very easily summarized by figure 2 in their experimental paper [1]. After learning, the network is much more activate in a pre-defined time window (shaded area), thereby shutting down the stimulation:</p>

<p>This is a fascinating and also surprising observation. It seems as if the network is realizing that there is a stimulus, decides that the stimulus is annoying and therefore puts forward measures to stop and prevent the stimulus. Such a description is however highly anthropomorphic and does not really help to understand what is going on.</p>



<p>According to Shahaf and Marom, their observation shows in the first place that a neuronal network does not depend on a distinct implementation of reward or other forms of reinforcement. Instead, the network, following Shahaf and Marom, explores configurations until a desired state is reached (in this case: the state of stimulus removal) [1]. The authors discuss the implications a bit more in detail in [2] (check out section 7) but remain rather vague on the possible mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that might underlie such behavior.</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons interacts with a virtual world</strong></p>



<p>Going slightly beyond the very simple closed loop by Shahaf and Marom, researchers from the lab of Steve Potter, which according to <a href="https://potterlab.gatech.edu/">the lab&#8217;s website</a> has &#8220;created the field of embodied cultured networks&#8221;, used the activity of the cultured neurons to drive the behavior of an &#8220;animal&#8221; in a virtual world [3]. The sensory feedback received by this animal in the virtual world is fed back to the cultured neurons. In this study, the focus is primarily on showing that it is possible to have a cultured network and a very simple virtual environment in a closed loop. This sounds particularly fascinating as the paper was published during a time when the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">Matrix</a> had just come out.</p>



<p>Afterwards, in order to be able to evaluate learning and plasticity systematically, the lab moved to specific tasks based on this experimental design [4]. This study by Bakkum, Chao and Potter is conceptually close to the studies by Shahaf and Marom discussed above. The experimental design is depicted in this nice schematic (part of figure 1 in [4]) and shows a clearly identified mapping of the population activity onto a &#8220;motor output&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here, SBS (unpatterned <strong>s</strong>huffled <strong>b</strong>ackground <strong>s</strong>timulation) serves as a kind of reward or neutral stimulus while PTS (<strong>p</strong>atterned <strong>t</strong>raining <strong>s</strong>timulation) serves as an aversive stimulus that makes the network provide different output activity patterns. The (unchanging) context-control probing sequence (CPS) is used as a probe, and the network response upon the CPS pattern is regarded as the system&#8217;s motor output. Therefore, PTS or SBS act as plasticity- or feedback-stimuli, whereas CPS defines a probing time window to elicit the &#8220;motor output&#8221;.</p>



<p>The authors show that the networks could learn to provide mostly correct motor output when trained with such a paradigm. In addition, they quantify plasticity processes over time. Plasticity was higher during the learning procedure compared to baseline and remained higher for &gt;1h after training. To summarize, the authors do not dig into mechanisms of cell-to-cell plasticity but rather provide a broader, systemic description of what is going on.</p>



<p>A difficult-to-grasp feature of this experimental study is the design of the patterned training stimulations (PTSs). The authors repeatedly applied different stimulation patterns (e.g., PTS1 stimulates electrodes 1, 4, 7 and 15, PTS2 stimulates electrodes 6, 8, 19, 20, 21 with specific stimulation intensities). Their algorithm was designed to choose from a pool of PTSs and select the PTS that resulted in plasticity towards a network state that generated the desired &#8220;motor&#8221; output. In 2022, most people (or at least myself) are so much used to deep learning and gradient descent that it is almost strange to read about such a random exploration approach.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the authors also investigated a comparable paradigm in a separate and purely theoretical study [5]. In this study, they replaced the cultured network with a simulated network and found very similar learning compared to the <em>in vitro</em> study. They found that this behavior depended on spike-time dependent plasticity, a cell-to-cell synaptic plasticity rule, and on STD, a short-term plasticity rule that helps to prevent large system-wide bursts.</p>



<p>From my perspective, it is interesting to see that the cell culture results could be replicated with a network that was based on STDP. A large part of the paper however instead focuses on the question how to choose and adapt stimuli that make the network learn the desired output. I would have been interested to get to know more about how STDP is shaped by the stimulation patterns and driven towards the desired output. </p>



<p><strong>Learning by stimulation avoidance and autopoiesis</strong></p>



<p>The group of Takashi Ikegami tried to better understand what is actually going on when neuronal cultures as in the experiments by Shahaf and Marom [1] learn to shut down an external stimulus. They study this effect using simulated neuronal networks and, as in work from the Potter lab [5], they identify spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as an essential factor to mediate this learning process. As in work from the Potter lab, they also use an &#8220;embodied&#8221; application with a moving simulated robot that learns to avoid walls [6].</p>



<p>The main take-away of their simulation experiments is that the experiments by Shahaf and Marom can be replicated <em>in silico</em> and that the observed phenomena can be interpreted as &#8220;Learning by Stimulation Avoidance (LSA)&#8221;. The authors write in the discussion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>LSA is not just an another theoretical neural learning rule, but provides a new interpretation to the learning behavior of neural cells in vitro. (&#8230;) LSA relies on the mechanism of STDP, and we demonstrated that the conditions to obtain LSA are: (1) Causal coupling between neural network’s behaviour and environmental stimulation; (2) Burst suppression. We obtain burst suppression by increasing the input noise in the model or by using STP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have the impression that this is an overstatement of what &#8220;LSA&#8221; is. First, both STDP and burst suppression by spontaneous activity as ingredients to enable learning-in-a-dish had been described already previously [5]. Second, I don&#8217;t think this is &#8220;a new interpretation&#8221; of <em>in vitro</em> learning but simply the demonstration of a model that is consistent with the observed experiments from [1].</p>



<p>The authors expand a bit and provide more context:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As we have shown, LSA does not support the theory of the Stimulus Regulation Principle. It could be closer to the Principle of Free Energy Minimisation introduced by Friston. The Free Energy Principle states that networks strive to avoid surprising inputs by learning to predict external stimulation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The &#8220;stimulus regulation principle&#8221; suggests a network that samples possible network configurations and stops the exploration once a favorable state is reached. A favorable configuration would be one which manages to suppress the stimulation. The STDP-model put forward by [6] instead is based on a synaptic learning rule that specifically strengthens and weakens synapses in order to reach a favorable network configuration.</p>



<p>The mentioned &#8220;free energy principle&#8221;, on the other hand, is infamous for being so general that almost any imaginable theory is consistent with it. The most popular theory about an implementation of the free energy principle is probably predictive processing [7]. In classical predictive processing, an internal model in the brain provides top-down signals to cancel out expected sensory inputs. The internal model adapts in order to improve the predictive power of the top-down signals. It is interesting how this typically hierarchical top-down/bottom-up view breaks down when being applied it to the model system of a dissociated cell culture. It would be hard to assume that there is an hierarchy in this dish. And still, the stimulus-avoidance paradigm does have some clear resemblance with surprise-minimization and predictive processing.</p>



<p>For more work from the Ikegami lab in collaboration with others, check out [8], where they interpret the findings that neurons in cultured networks that receive incontrollable stimulation will be disconnected from the network. They do so in the context of the rather old concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoiesis</a>, thereby going beyond the simple principle of &#8220;learning by stimulus avoidance&#8221; (LSA).</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons learns to play a simplified version of pong</strong></p>



<p>In October 2022, a related paper by Kagan et al. with Karl Friston as senior author &#8211; who is famous for inventing the free energy princple &#8211; was published [9]. It received a lot of attention, but also quite some criticism by several neuroscientists on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Timothy0Leary/status/1580328593824964608">ref 1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stenichele/status/1580910769373265920">ref 2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sina_lana/status/1580362015511437313">ref 3</a>, and other discussions that were deleted afterwards). It was critizised that the paper failed to cite previous research and interpreted the results in a misleading manner. For example, the title speaks of cultured neurons that &#8220;exhibit sentience&#8221;. This statement does not use a commonly used definition of &#8220;sentience&#8221; and therefore seems quite misleading for the reader. Unfortunately, this is not the only part of the manuscript which sounds like a buzzword combination made up by ChatGPT. Check out this excerpt of the introduction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Instantiating SBIs [synthetic biological intelligences] could herald a paradigm shift of research into biological intelligence, including pseudo-cognitive responses as part of drug screening, bridging the divide between single-cell and population-coding approaches to understanding neurobiology, exploring how BNNs compute to inform machine-learning approaches, and potentially giving rise to silico-biological computational platforms that surpass the performance of existing purely silicon hardware.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But let&#8217;s put all the the buzz aside and discuss the science. Similar to the previously discussed studies, Kagan et al. used cultured neurons that were integrated into a closed loop using multi-electrode arrays. The virtual environment of this closed loop was a simplified version of the game &#8220;pong&#8221;. The multi-electrode array (MEA) was used to provide the cell culture with &#8220;sensory&#8221; feedback about the position of the ball and the success of the game, and to provide &#8220;motor&#8221; output from the MEA activity pattern back to the game in order to control the paddle.</p>

<p>Pong as implemented in the paper was less demanding (using a paddle half as large as the side of the arena). Despite this simplification, the performance of the cell culture controlling the game was not very impressive. The cultured network, after some learning, managed to hit the ball on average a bit more often than once (1x) before losing the game. This performance is not much higher (but significantly above) chance level.</p>



<p>The experimental design is well illustrated by this panel from their figure 5 (taken from the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.02.471005v2">preprint</a>, which had been published under the CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 license):</p>

<p>The electrode array is subdivided into a &#8220;sensory&#8221; region indicated by the crosses and a &#8220;motor&#8221; region indicated by up and down arrows; the firing patterns in the motor region move the paddle up or down. The sensory region is provided with sensory feedback about the position of the ball, but also with a predictable stimulus when the ball hits the paddle and a random stimulus when the paddle misses the ball. Over time, the neurons learn to avoid the random stimulation by hitting the ball more often.</p>



<p>The interesting aspect is that the network seems to learn based on an intrinsic preference for predictable as opposed to unpredictable stimuli. The authors interpret this result as supportive evidence for the free energy principle, because the systems seems to learn the game in order to escape punishment by the random and unpredictable stimulus.</p>



<p>I have however some doubts about the interpretation of the results and also about the conceptualization. First, it is strange that predictable and unpredictable stimuli are used to reward or punish the system. This is not how, according to my understanding, the free energy principle works. One would rather expect the the system (the ball/paddle interaction) to be modeled by the neuronal network and therefore become predictable. There would not be any use of additional reinforcement by predictable stimuli as reward. &#8211; Interestingly, in Bakkum et al. [4], in contrast, the negatively reinforcing stimulus was patterned while the stabilizing, positively reinforcing stimulus was random. This fact shows that different stimuli are used for different purposes, and interpretations of their effect on the network depends on the conceptual framework of the paper.</p>



<p>Second, it is strange that the predictable stimulus (75 mV at 100 Hz over 100 ms; unfortunately, the duty cycle is not stated) and the unpredictable stimuli (150 mV at 5 Hz over 4000 ms) differ quite a bit in terms of stimulation strength, duration and frequency of stimulation. One needs to make oneself aware of the fact that in reality the &#8220;predictive stimulus&#8221; is a high-frequency tetanus stimulation. Such tetanic stimuli are known to be able to drive long-term potentiation (LTP). It is not hard to imagine that the slower unpredictable stimulation results in long-term depression (LTD), not by means of being unpredictable but by means of its frequency and duration.</p>



<p>Therefore, an alternative and, in my opinion, much more parsimonious explanation of the results is that the system does not try to minimize surprising/unpredictable results, but that it potentiates neuronal patterns that precede successful performance by tetanic stimulation. I am therefore not convinced that Kagan et al. demonstrated a phenomenon that can be linked to predictive processing or the free energy principle in the way they describe it.</p>



<p>However, I would also like to highlight the positive sides of the paper: the figures are well-designed; a preprint is available; the experiments were done with several conditions which allow for comparisons across conditions (e.g., different cell lines); and the experimental system was characterized with several complementary methods (including IHC, EM, qPCR).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The fact that cultured neuronal networks can interact with a closed-loop and learn to optimize these interactions is quite fascinating. The interpretation of such behavior as &#8220;learned stimulation avoidance&#8221; [6], &#8220;autopoiesis&#8221; [8] or a reflection of the &#8220;free energy principle&#8221; [6,9] is certainly intriguing. However, it might rather serve as a metaphor or a high-level description and does not really provide a deeper analysis or understanding of the underlying mechanisms. One possible starting point to investigate the mechanisms of such learning could be the STDP rules that were found to be consistent with the learning behavior in simulation studies [5,6]. It would be possible to make predictions about how spike sequences evolve over learning in the dish, and to test those predictions in the experiment.</p>



<p>It is remarkable how limited the performance of the cultured <em>in vitro</em> systems is when they were trained to control a virtual agent or a game. The performances are, seemingly without exceptions, barely above chance level, and nowhere close to mastering the virtual world. Years ago, deep Q-learning has achieved performances that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk">close to perfection</a> in video games way more complex than &#8220;pong&#8221;. I do not think that anybody should make a point of &#8220;intelligence in a dish&#8221; when the dish can barely process a binary input.</p>



<p>However, I am still somehow intrigued by the experimental findings, especially those made initially by Shahaf and Marom [1,2]. Would it be possible to observe the same behavior with a more naturalistic network, for example a cultured slice, or an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2012.072">ex vivo explant of a brain</a>, or even a brain region in a living animal? For example, one could use optogenetics to stimulate a subset of cortical neurons in the mouse (&#8220;sensory&#8221; neurons), use calcium imaging or electrophysiology to record from another subset of neurons in the same brain area (&#8220;motor&#8221; neurons) and stop the stimulation once the &#8220;motor&#8221; neurons show a specific activity pattern. Using this experimental design, one could test for example whether the learning by stimulation avoidance can also be elicited <em>in vivo</em>.</p>



<p>Another aspect that might deserve attention is the apparent dependence of plasticity processes on a strong stimulus. In the experiments by Shahaf et al. [1], the stimulus co-occurs with the activity pattern that is then modified by plasticity. In Bakkum et al. [4], the plasticity-inducing stimulus is a tetanic stimulation following the activity pattern. Very similarly, in Kagan et al. [9], the tetanic stimulus is directly following the activity pattern that is strengthened afterwards. The observed effect could therefore be the reflection of a very coarse form of plasticity which occurs in a network that is strongly stimulated by an external stimulus that somehow reinforces previous activity patterns.</p>



<p>Overall, from all these studies it becomes clear that networks of cultured neurons do indeed seem to show some level of systems-level learning when integrated into a closed loop. I have the impression that the plasticity induced (e.g., by a strong tetanic stimulation) is not very naturalistic. Despite this limitation, it would be interesting to investigate experimentally what plasticity rules underlie such behavior. It is likely that the plasticity studied in slices since the &#8217;90s is in some similar way artificial since it does not integrate neuromodulation or realistic levels of external calcium. And still these slice experiments brought forward useful concepts that can be tested in living organisms. Similarly, I think there might be interesting aspects of studying plasticity rules in cultered neurons in closed loops. But I do not think that it is of any use to frame such cultured networks as &#8220;synthetic biological intelligence&#8221; [9] or to overinterpret the results in a theoretical framework of choice &#8211; in particular if the performance of this &#8220;intelligence&#8221; remains so much lower than the lowest standards of both biological and artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>The University of Zurich in Switzerland has announced that it will open an investigation into an adjunct professor alleged to have taken images and other material from a popular blog on medieval manuscripts and published them in her book without attribution.</p>



<p>The news, <a href="https://www.kath.ch/newsd/carla-rossi-ist-nach-wie-vor-titularprofessorin-uni-zuerich-kuendigt-untersuchung-an/">first reported by kath.ch</a>, follows an eyebrow-raising exchange between the researcher who discovered his work had been used without citation and someone claiming to be the professor’s secretary, who told him, “nobody cares about your blog!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://www.carlarossi.info/">Carla Rossi</a>, is also director of the Research Centre for European Philological Tradition, abbreviated as <a href="https://www.receptio.eu/">RECEPTIO</a>. The center operates an academic press that published Rossi’s 2022 work, <a href="https://www.receptio.eu/publishing-house"><em>The Book of Hours of Louis de Roucy: a.k.a. The Courtanvaux-Elmhirst Hours, Digitally Restored Through the Wayback Recovery Method</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book describes a manuscript that Rossi purported to have digitally reconstructed.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126307"></span>



<p>Peter Kidd, an independent scholar who blogs at <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/">Medieval Manuscripts Provenance</a>, wrote a <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html">post</a> on Christmas Eve detailing instances in which Rossi appeared to use text and images from his earlier blogging about the manuscript without attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he attempted to contact Rossi, Kidd heard back from someone representing herself as Rossi’s secretary who first denied that the book’s images had been taken from Kidd’s blog, then told him:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I regret to inform you that blogs are not scientific texts, published by academic publishers, so their value is nil!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The exchange also included:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I forward these delusional e-mails of yours to the lawyer who will, if appropriate, reply to you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidd followed up with several posts <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-i-staff.html">scrutinizing RECEPTIO’s website</a>, which seemed to present stock photos for its staff and <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-ii.html">offices</a>, and <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-iii-my.html">commenting on documents</a> Rossi <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-v.html">posted to Academia.edu</a> (and now seems to have removed) <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-iv-my.html">responding to his posts</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher added this to the book’s download page:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Today, 27 December 2022, a criminal complaint was filed with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (MP) for defamation, slander, incitement to violence and stalking against the blogger who set up a disgusting defamation campaign. The police will contact the blog operators as soon as possible and submit an application for international cooperation in criminal matters. Regarding the ridiculous accusations of plagiarism, let the readers of this edition judge[.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidd told us he didn’t have any comment to add beyond his blogs, which are quite detailed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to the news website kath.ch <a href="https://www.kath.ch/newsd/carla-rossi-ist-nach-wie-vor-titularprofessorin-uni-zuerich-kuendigt-untersuchung-an/">published December 27</a>, the University of Zurich said it would investigate the allegations:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Miss Dr. Carla Rossi is an adjunct professor at the Romanic Department (RoSe) at the University of Zurich (UZH). Until recently, she was employed as a research associate in a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. There is currently no employment relationship between her and UZH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UZH is aware of the allegation made by Mr. Peter Kidd against Ms. Rossi that she used information from his blog in her book entitled &#8220;The Book of Hours of Louis de Roucy&#8221; without citing the blog as a source. In accordance with the Integrity Ordinance, UZH will &nbsp; initiate an independent investigation. This is independent of a current employment. Ms. Rossi is presumed innocent until the investigation is completed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rossi has not responded to our request for comment on the investigation or Kidd’s blog posts.</p>

<p>An article that critiqued a study on what happened after women did not get abortions that they sought has been retracted after observers raised concerns that the peer review process had not been objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905221/full">The Turnaway Study: A Case of Self-Correction in Science Upended by Political Motivation and Unvetted Findings</a>,” was originally published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> in June of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/research/ongoing/turnaway-study">Turnaway Study</a> itself was an effort of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, which followed women who had received abortions and women who sought abortions but did not get them because they were too far along in their pregnancies “to describe the mental health, physical health, and socioeconomic consequences of receiving an abortion compared to carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term,” according to its website. </p>



<span id="more-126304"></span>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/09/author-critical-of-study-involving-abortion-hires-lawyers-after-journal-flags-paper/">we reported in November</a>, the journal placed an expression of concern on the paper after critics pointed out that the editor and all four reviewers (whose names Frontiers published on the first page of the paper) were associated with pro-life organizations. The researchers behind the Turnaway Study responded to the article’s critiques in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1003116/full">commentary</a> published in December.</p>



<p>The paper’s author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscilla-coleman-712ab416/">Priscilla K. Coleman</a>, a professor of human development and family studies at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, told us at the time that she would “actively pursue all options available including legal avenues to rectify the situation.” (She also said she would “pursue all avenues available to me should your article, which is premature at this time cause me any additional reputational harm.”)</p>



<p>On December 26, <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> retracted Coleman’s article with the following notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication, undisclosed competing interests were brought to our attention, which undermined the objective editorial assessment of the article during the peer review process.</p>



<p>Frontiers conducted a post-publication assessment of the article, including consulting with independent expertise, which concluded that the article does not meet the standards of publication of Frontiers in Psychology.</p>



<p>This retraction was approved by the Field Chief Editor of Frontiers in Psychology and the Chief Executive Editor of Frontiers. The authors did not agree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our request for comment on the retraction, Coleman told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The only information ever provided to me by Frontiers (just prior to posting) was the public retraction notice. Relying solely on this statement, I was asked if I agreed or disagreed with the retraction. Via my attorneys, I requested clarity to make the determination. No further information was provided regarding the rationale or internal findings. Frontiers responded that they would get back to us on substance in the New Year; yet that same day (December 26th) they proceeded with the retraction, posted the original ambiguous statement, and inappropriate presumed my response. Given Frontiers&#8217; membership in COPE, it is difficult to reconcile my experience in this matter with their obligations as a member.</p>

<p>Few scholars of the work of William Faulkner know that the winner of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1949/summary/">1949 Nobel Prize</a> in Literature toyed with the <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/articles/wave-energy-and-switching-it-over-completely-to-power-by-actual-embankment-gadget-114889.html">above passage</a> in early drafts of his 1936 novel, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He went instead with the more memorable: </p>



<span id="more-126294"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>‘Why do you hate the South?’ ‘I dont hate it,’ Quentin said quickly, at once, immediately; ‘I dont hate it,’ he said. <em>I dont hate it</em> he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark; <em>I don’t I don’t! I don’t hate it! I don’t hate it!”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, the genius of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass&nbsp; – “I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you” – echoes in his lesser known work, “<a href="https://www.primescholars.com/articles/role-of-human-resources-pay-disparity-and-sustainable-power-utilization-on-co2-alleviation-114887.html">Role of Human Resources, Pay Disparity and Sustainable Power Utilization on Co2 Alleviation</a>,” whose soaring lines include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>Okay, clearly not. But the editors of the <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/british-journal-of-research.html"><em>British Journal of Research</em></a> would <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/archive/ipbjr-volume-9-issue-9-year-2022.html">have readers believe </a>that Faulkner and Whitman, along with other long-dead luminaries including Charlotte Brontë, of the Department of Basic Sciences at the University of Aberdeen, in the UK, and Herman Hesse, of the Department of Basic Sciences, University of Cologne, in Germany, wrote papers for a recent issue of the periodical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Published by Prime Scholars, the <em>BJR </em>claims to be “an international quarterly open access journal which aims to publish articles related to different research fields and specialities.” One of the journal’s purported editors in chief did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We learned about the bogus papers thanks to Dorothy Bishop, who <a href="https://twitter.com/deevybee/status/1608424393683914755">tweeted about them</a> Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Bishop noted, the motive for the scheme isn’t clear:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">that’s what I’m trying to understand.

<p>Of course, readers of Retraction Watch will not find it surprising that it&#8217;s possible to get <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/10/03/science-reporter-spoofs-hundreds-of-journals-with-a-fake-paper/">just about anything</a> published in something <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/06/hello-newman-yet-another-sting-pranks-a-predatory-journal-seinfeld-style/">that looks like a journal</a>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, as Bronte wrote in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, motive is less important than results:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>Update, 1345 UTC, 12/30/22: We heard back from <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/editor/dr-obumneke-amadionuoha-19756">Obumneke Amadi-Onuoha</a>, one of the listed editors in chief of the journal, who said she has &#8220;contacted my publishing company to respond to your inquiry and will give you feedback accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A microbiology research group at the University of Hong Kong lost five papers for image duplication in late October, weeks after other scientists published a critique in <em>Retraction Watch</em> of one of the group’s COVID-19 articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00283-X">paper on COVID-19</a> was published in <em>Cell</em> in 2021 and was led by <a href="http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_PCY_Woo.html">Patrick Chiu Yat Woo</a> and <a href="http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_KY_Yuen.html">Kwok-Yung Yuen</a>, chair of infectious diseases in the university’s Department of Microbiology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/04/when-failure-to-correct-a-flawed-paper-could-put-patients-lives-at-risk/">Writing in <em>Retraction Watch</em></a> in early October, <a href="https://pharmacy.nova.edu/featured/speth.html">Robert Speth</a> of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/bader">Michael Bader</a> of the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin, described their experience notifying <em>Cell</em> of numerous errors in the paper, and the journal’s editor refusing to publish a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weeks later, five of Yuen and Woo’s papers were retracted from two journals published by the American Society for Microbiology:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126285"></span>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jcm.01444-22">False-Positive Results in a Recombinant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Nucleocapsid Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Due to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E Rectified by Western Blotting with Recombinant SARS-CoV Spike Polypeptide</a>,” <em>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</em>, 2004.</li>

</ul>



<p>The five papers have been cited nearly 400 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retractions were spurred by PubPeer comments from sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a>, a familiar name for <em>Retraction Watch</em> readers, pointing out similarities in the papers’ images. The text of the notices was similar. One <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jcm.01444-22">representative notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were alerted that lanes 2 and 6 of Western blot strips in Fig. 2A are more similar than expected on retrospective inspection under magnification. The lapse of 18 years since the publication of this paper made investigation using original research material impossible. We therefore voluntarily take the step of retracting this paper to set the scientific record straight.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our request for comment, Yuen and Woo told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We first received notifications on this issue from Pubpeer on 1st August 2022. We immediately proactively reached out to journal editors for their advice on how to set the scientific record straight. Since we no longer had the serum samples to repeat the experiments, we retracted the articles although three of them have been independently confirmed by other research groups. [They later provided these references: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323548/">Detection and Characterization of New Coronavirus in Bottlenose Dolphin, United States, 2019</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005883">A Bat-Derived Putative Cross-Family Recombinant Coronavirus with a Reovirus Gene</a>; and <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00319-19">Antagonism of dsRNA-Induced Innate Immune Pathways by NS4a and NS4b Accessory Proteins during MERS Coronavirus Infection</a>.]</p>



<p>We thanks for the comments of our work published in Cell. Their concerns have been <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00589-X">addressed and published</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author of the <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jvi.01504-22">MERS paper</a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/dong-yan-jin">Dong-Yan Jin</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83C3B6AAB386978026AAB1E81ACE1F#4">responded to Bik on PubPeer</a> in November that the authors “admitted that an error was introduced and I take full responsibility for it as corresponding author.” At the end of his comment, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The LKS Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong has set up a panel to investigate this and other papers. The panel found no evidence of fabrication or misconduct from any author. The panel also noted that the main conclusions of the paper were not based on the Western blot data concerned, and thus members were convinced that the conclusions drawn in the paper were valid and credible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83C3B6AAB386978026AAB1E81ACE1F#5">posted a longer response</a> from Jin, which stated that Yuen and Woo “were not involved in preparation of the figure concerned,” and ended:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I apologize to Dr. Yuen, Dr. Woo and other coauthors. It was my supervisory oversight and not theirs in this paper. I feel bad that another co-author’s honest error and my own oversight have resulted in criticism and attack of Dr. Yuen in the media. This is completely unfortunate and unhealthy. It does not help to keep a high standard of responsible science. It is completely unfair, groundless and counterproductive. It will only bring more harms than benefits to science. This has already wasted tremendous amount of energy and resources from different parties. Dr. Yuen&#8217;s response to the papers concerned was quick and highly responsible. He has my full respect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Russian philosophy journal has retracted a paper about lesbian fashion magazines, citing a newly passed law that bans “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal <em>Logos</em>, which <a href="https://logosjournal.ru/about/">describes itself</a> as “​​the leading Russian-language journal in the fields of philosophy, social sciences, humanities and cultural studies” and counts the philosopher Slavoj Žižek as a <a href="https://logosjournal.ru/council/">member of its editorial council</a>, earlier this month retracted a paper titled “<a href="https://logosjournal.ru/upload/iblock/6bd/Logos%201-2022_Press-173-196.pdf">Looking good: The lesbian gaze and fashion imagery</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, by <a href="https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/579-reina-lewis/about">Reina Lewis</a> of the London College of Fashion, still appears online, but an <a href="https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=48052624">entry</a> on the Russian database eLIBRARY indicates it was retracted for being “in violation of standards.” The notice continued:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126281"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction was issued by the decision of the editorial board due to the presence of signs that fall under the scope of Law No. 217471-8 &#8220;On Amendments to the Federal Law &#8220;On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection&#8221; and certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation (regarding the prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences)&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The abstract of the paper stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This paper is concerned with the different forms of pleasure and identification activated in the consumption of dominant and subcultural print media. It centers on an analysis of the lesbian visual pleasures available in reading fashion articles in the new lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines. This consideration of the lesbian gaze is contrasted with the lesbian visual pleasures obtained from an against-the-grain reading of mainstream women’s fashion magazines. The rise of lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines fueled by the pink pound (the commercial potential of appealing to non-heterosexual consumers) has turned eroticized lesbian visual pleasure into the overt purpose of these magazine, rather than a clandestine pleasure obtained through a transgressive reading of dominant cultural imagery.</p>



<p>In contrast to the polysemic free-play of fashion fantasy through which readers derive lesbian pleasure in the consumption of mainstream magazines, responses to the fashion content in the lesbian magazine <em>Diva</em> suggest that readers in a subcultural context deploy a realist mode of reading that demands a monosemic positive iconography. To consider the different ways in which lesbians read mainstream and subcultural print media the author uses the concept of subcultural competency and suggests that the conflict over <em>Diva</em>’s fashion spreads may be linked to changing patterns of identification and the use of dress for recognizability.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the beginning of December, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law “completely banning propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations, gender reassignment and pedophilia,” the state news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1545959">TASS wrote</a>. According to TASS:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The country’s mass media watchdog will be authorized to put websites with the propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations, pedophilia, and gender reassignment on the register of prohibited resources subject to blocking. It will also be authorized to determine the procedure of internet monitoring to spot such sites.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-parliament-passes-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-among-adults-2022-11-24/">Reuters reported</a> that individuals could be fined up to 400,000 roubles (about $5,800) and organizations up to 5 million roubles (about $72,400) for violating the law, and foreigners could be arrested for 15 days and deported from the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed Lewis for comment and got an out of office reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Valery Anashvili, editor in chief of <em>Logos</em>, whether the journal had received any indication from the government that the paper violated the law, and didn’t receive any response. Anashvili is also editor-in-chief of the Gaidar Institute Publishing House and the Delo Publishing House of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.</p>

Retraction data from Retraction Watch Database, overall publication figures via U.S. NSF.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2002, journals retracted 119 papers from the scientific literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What a difference two decades make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On several occasions this year, publishers announced they were retracting several times that number, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">all at once</a>. (For some of the stories among 2022’s retractions that captured the most attention, see our <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/the-top-retractions-of-2022-70852">10th annual roundup</a> for <em>The Scientist</em>.)</p>



<p>This year’s 4,600-plus retractions bring the total in the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">Retraction Watch Database</a> to more than 37,000 at the time of this writing. </p>



<span id="more-126277"></span>



<p>As the graphic at the top of this post illustrates, the annual rate of retractions as a share of total published papers continues to grow, to now about 8 in 10,000 papers published. The spike in 2015 reflects the lag of how long some retractions can take, and recent greater scrutiny of papers by sleuths. It also suggests – along with many publishers’ realizations that they are being overwhelmed by paper mills – that the growth isn’t slowing down.</p>



<p>We had a few key developments of our own this year. A sampling:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ellie Kincaid joined us as editor, the first time we have been funded to have a salaried person in that role since 2018. Her impact was immediate, we’re sure you’d agree, breaking stories right and left.</li>



<li><em>Nature</em> invited us to contribute a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02071-6">World View column</a> reflecting on a dozen years of Retraction Watch, notably the growth in retractions and the fact that so many papers that should be retracted haven’t yet been.</li>



<li>We presented, or were part of teams who presented, findings at the World Conference on Research Integrity and the Peer Review Congress.</li>



<li>In partnership with Anna Abalkina, we launched the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01666-3">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>.</li>



<li>We published an invited editorial in <em>Anesthesiology</em>, “<a href="https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article/137/3/280/136809/How-to-Stop-the-Unknowing-Citation-of-Retracted">How to Stop the Unknowing Citation of Retracted Papers</a>.”</li>



<li>We partnered with Clarivate, who used the Retraction Watch Database to exclude researchers “found to have committed scientific misconduct in formal proceedings conducted by a researcher’s institution, [or] a government agency” from their list of Highly Cited Researchers.</li>



<li>The WoodNext Foundation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">awarded us</a> a two-year, $250,000 grant that will allow us to hire another editor who will join us in the first week of 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our database – with about three times as many retractions as PubMed – continues to power retraction alerts in <a href="https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1458421915761221643">EndNote</a>, <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/blog-papers-announces-expanded-retraction-support/">Papers</a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/">Zotero</a>. It is also frequently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-that-cite-retraction-watch/">cited in the scholarly literature</a>. Our work is regularly featured in major news outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/sports/football/paul-mccrory-plagiarism-concussions.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stanford-presidents-research-draws-concern-from-scientific-journals-11671142757"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-01/stanford-presidents-scientific-papers-draw-scrutiny"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/13/science/scientific-journal-investigating-umass-hydrogen-study-after-revelations-gas-industry-influence/"><em>Boston Globe</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/11/prestigious-medical-journal-retracts-nine-more-articles-authored-by-concussion-expert-paul-mccrory"><em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>
