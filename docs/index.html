              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frogs-glow-biofluorescence-language">Many frogs glow in blue light, and it may be a secret, eerie language</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the dim twilight hours, many frogs may be capable of emitting a faint green or orange glow.</p>



<p>A survey of hundreds of frogs in South America shows that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.25.550432v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more frogs are biofluorescent</a> than previously thought, researchers report in a preprint posted July 28 at bioRxiv.org. The ghostly colors may have a role in the frogs’ communication with members of the same species, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The findings “are a reminder to check our own perception as humans,” says Jennifer Lamb, a herpetologist at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who was not involved with the research. “We are very visually dominant in terms of our senses. And other animals are too, but they might be experiencing that visual world differently than we are.”</p>





<p>Biofluorescence occurs in many types of creatures. It happens when an organism absorbs light at one wavelength, or color, and reemits it at a different wavelength with lower energy. Over the past several years, researchers have recognized the trait in a growing diversity of species, from the fur of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/1/21/5299493?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flying squirrels</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">platypuses</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">the nests of certain wasps</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/20, SN: 9/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>Fluorescence was <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1701053114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first discovered in frogs</a> in 2017. Since then, researchers have tested more amphibians for fluorescence, says Courtney Whitcher, an evolutionary biologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee. But investigations of frog biofluorescence have used just one or two light sources she says, usually violet or ultraviolet light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get a more detailed and cohesive picture of fluorescence in frogs, Whitcher and her colleagues tested frogs using five different light sources covering a range of wavelengths from green to UV. From March to May 2022, the team captured and shone lights on 528 individual frogs in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and measured any reemitted light.</p>



<p>All 151 frog species they tested had some degree of fluorescence, ranging from 2 percent of the original light intensity to well over 90 percent. Prior to this study, less than two dozen of the 42 frog species that had been previously tested were considered fluorescent.</p>



<p>The frogs’ green and orange fluorescence was most intense under blue light that dominates at twilight. This is similar to how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-frogs-salamanders-may-be-surprisingly-common">many salamander species fluoresce</a> under blue light, Lamb says (<em>SN: 2/27/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fluorescence in land living animals “was recently thought to be rare, and when people go out looking for it, surveying across multiple species, it turns out it’s everywhere,” says zoologist Linda Reinhold, recently a graduate student at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia.&nbsp;“It was only because no one had looked before.”</p>



<p>Many of the frogs’ body parts that strongly fluoresced are also involved in signaling to other frogs. Much of the fluorescence seemed centered on the throat and underside of the frogs, which are commonly used in courtship rituals.&nbsp;“While they&#8217;re calling, that vocal sac region is expanding and contracting,” Whitcher says. Fluorescence may make for a more noticeable display.</p>



<p>The green glow is probably something other frogs can see, the researchers say. The team found that in the twilight hours — a time when frogs tend to court and mate — frog eyes are quite sensitive to the particular green light that’s emitted from the frogs’ skin.&nbsp;The orange fluorescence, on the other hand, may be intended for a different receiver, such as a predator. It may serve as camouflage or a warning signal, Whitcher says.</p>



<p>It’s “astonishing” how widespread fluorescence is among these frogs, says evolutionary biologist Mark Scherz, of the Natural History of Denmark in Copenhagen. “Not a single one of the species they tested failed to fluoresce,” he says, adding that testing the frogs against a variety of light wavelengths might help explain the fluorescence rate.</p>





<p>But he is skeptical that the fluorescence would be strong enough for communication purposes. Twilight is much dimmer than daylight, he says, so there may not be much light available for conversion to an emerald glow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whitcher is now investigating whether fluorescence in male frogs influences female frogs’ mating choices.&nbsp;“Maybe there&#8217;s a threshold of fluorescence intensity that is needed in order to elicit some kind of behavioral response,” she says.</p>

<p>A professor at the University of Pittsburgh is suing the institution and two administrators, alleging they discriminated against him because he is Black.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.sph.pitt.edu/directory/moses-bility">Moses Bility</a>, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and microbiology in the university’s School of Public Health, alleges the school’s response to a 2020 paper he published and later withdrew that proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19 was discriminatory.</p>



<p>He also claims the school discriminated against him by blocking him from transferring his lab to the Pitt-affiliated Hillman Cancer Center, and that one of the named administrators plagiarized his COVID-19 paper, among other allegedly discriminatory acts. Bility says the school denied his application for tenure in June as retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility is seeking lost wages, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. His <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bility-amended-complaint.pdf">complaint states</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127700"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As a result of all the conduct of Defendants as set forth above, Dr. Bility has suffered embarrassment, substantial mental anguish and emotional distress, and loss of wages and potential earnings. The discrimination has affected his family, including his wife and children, who have been deprived of receiving his best care and attention due to him coping with all Defendants’ discriminatory conduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pitt and the two administrators, Donald Burke and Maureen Lictveld, the former and current deans of the school of public health, respectively, have filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that Bility “alleges no facts actually linking perceived wrongs to either his race or his complaints of discrimination.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://marcus-shapira.com/attorneys/jeremy-d-engle/">Jeremy Engle</a>, a lawyer at the Pittsburgh firm Marcus &amp; Shapira, who is representing the defendants, declined to comment. (The firm is unrelated to Retraction Watch co-founder Adam Marcus.)</p>



<p>Bility’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.ohanlonschwartz.com/about-us/">Steven O’Hanlon</a> of the firm O’Hanlon Schwartz, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The motion to dismiss is meritless given the extensively detailed amended complaint.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The article that proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720363592">Can Traditional Chinese Medicine provide insights into controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: Serpentinization-induced lithospheric long-wavelength magnetic anomalies in Proterozoic bedrocks in a weakened geomagnetic field mediate the aberrant transformation of biogenic molecules in COVID-19 via magnetic catalysis</a>, was published as an “article in press” in <em>Science of the Total Environment</em>, an Elsevier title, in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/29/amulets-may-prevent-covid-19-says-a-paper-in-elsevier-journal-they-dont/">critique online</a>, the authors of the paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/16/co-authors-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-blames-the-online-press-and-social-media-for-misinterpretation-in-retraction-letter/">withdrew it</a>, and Bility planned to replace the paper with a new version on which he would be the sole author. (In the process of our previous reporting on the article, Bility <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gmail-STOTEN-paper.pdf">accused</a> Retraction Watch of racism.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility told us that he had presented the work at several conferences this year and resubmitted an updated version of the manuscript to <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> a few months ago. However, the journal rejected it as “not well aligned with the aims and scope of this environmental science journal,” according to the decision letter Bility shared with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I believe that Science of the Total Environment was afraid to review the work due to the previous backlash against the journal when the work was reviewed and published in 2020. I will be submitting my work to another journal in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339721710_Serpentinization-induced_lithospheric_long-wavelength_magnetic_anomalies_in_Proterozoic_bedrocks_in_a_weakened_geomagnetic_field_mediate_the_aberrant_transformation_of_biogenic_molecules_in_COVID-19_v">updated version</a> of the paper Bility shared with us no longer mentions traditional Chinese medicine in the title or jade amulets in the body of the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his complaint, Bility alleges that he withdrew the paper after receiving “violent threats, racial abuse and harassing actions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the alleged harassment involved vandalism. The name tag on Bility’s office wall was torn down multiple times, he says. Later, in the fall of 2021, the complaint says that someone broke into his office:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the ceiling was tempered [sic] with; Dr. Bility believed that electronic recoding [sic] devices were placed in the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bility claims he also received pressure from others at Pitt. Jean Nachega, an associate professor in the school of public health whom Bility listed as last author on the paper, told Bility that Nachega’s “research funding was threatened to be withheld if the article was not withdrawn,” according to the complaint. School officials demanded Bility’s chair investigate him and his research.</p>



<p>When the findings of the investigation – that Bility “did not violate any academic integrity standard” – were presented at a departmental town hall meeting over Zoom, “students in Defendant Pitt’s School of Public Health called Dr. Bility derogatory names, such as stupid, retarded, unintelligent, etc.,” he alleges. Bility also received two emails “from anonymous individuals who Dr. Bility assumes came from the Defendant Pitt community” that included racial slurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the fall of 2020, Bility says he received a verbal offer to move his research lab to the Hillman Cancer Center, which is also affiliated with Pitt, but he alleges the move was blocked on account of the withdrawn paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On December 21, 2020, Dr. Bility was informed (via a zoom call) by Dr. Robert Ferris, the Director of the Hillman Cancer Center and the Associate Vice Chancellor for Cancer Research, Defendant Pitt Health Sciences, that he was instructed by an unnamed powerful individual in the Defendant Pitt Health Sciences not to allow Dr. Bility to move to the center. Dr. Ferris offered Dr. Bility an opportunity that if he apologized for engaging in the research in question, the powerful individual in the Defendant Pitt Health Sciences might reconsider the decision to block the transfer; Dr. Bility refused to apologize.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bility also alleges that, in 2021, Burke, who had retired from his role as dean that January, published a preprint that plagiarized “the assumptions, findings, and prediction framework” of the withdrawn <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> article. (Burke, Bility alleges, had earlier discouraged him from pursuing the line of research and presenting his work at a school workshop in 2019.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility submitted a formal complaint to the university, which an inquiry panel found did not warrant a formal investigation. The school closed the matter in July 2022. Bility alleges the inquiry panel was biased against him.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In August of 2021, Bility alleges that Lichtveld, the current dean of the public health school, emailed him to relay requests from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that he remove two grant funding acknowledgments from a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71548-z"><em>Scientific Reports</em> article</a> he had published in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98417-7">correction</a> in September 2021 removed one of the grants, but Bility was “very concerned” about the request to remove the other, from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), according to the complaint, and doubted that NIH had indeed asked for it. He alleges:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Defendant Lichtveld was aware of the legal consequences Dr. Bility would have faced had he violated Public Law 101-166, Section 511, (also known as the Steven’s Amendment), which requires the acknowledgement of NIH (U.S. Government) funding in research articles. Defendant Lichtveld was aware of the legal consequences Dr. Bility would have faced had he provided false information to the NIH to alter the federal records for his grant to reconcile removing the acknowledgement. Defendant Lichtveld only targeted Dr. Bility, who is Black</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pitt and Lichtveld’s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/22-brief-supp-motion.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> called these allegations “outlandish.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility’s complaint details other behavior by Lichtveld he alleges created a “hostile work environment,” which he attributes to “the belief that a Black scientist should not engage in scholarly activities that challenge the scientific paradigm established by non-Black scientists,” namely, his research “investigating the weakening geomagnetic field, changes in Earth&#8217;s environment/hydroclimate, and human health.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Hanlon, Bility’s lawyer, filed a motion for the judge assigned to the case, Marilyn J. Horan, to recuse herself on the grounds that she is a member of the University of Pittsburgh Law School Board of Governors. The defendants opposed the motion and Horan denied it, writing that the volunteer role “​​will have no actual or apparent impact in this case.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-color-climate-change-visible">Nature’s changing colors makes climate change visible</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following days of torrential rain, more than a dozen rivers in Vermont overflowed in early July, causing catastrophic flooding. Some parts of Vermont saw up to 23 centimeters of rain, or 9 inches, an amount exceeding even the rainfalls from Hurricane Irene in 2011. Once considered 1-in-100-year events, such floods are set to become more frequent as climate change warms the region, scientists say. That’s because warmer air can hold more moisture. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, my hometown of Burlington was largely spared. But Lake Champlain, which runs the length of the city, was not. As the water from the Winooski — a 145-kilometer river that swamped the state capital, Montpelier — flows into the lake near where I live, so too does the garbage, gasoline and other pollutants that it swallowed up.&nbsp;</p>





<p>I glimpsed this pollution firsthand while biking with friends on a path along the lake shortly after the worst of the flooding. The south end of the lake, where we started, remained surprisingly clean and free of debris, appearing light blue. But as we biked north, past the junction of river and lake, the water turned murky and brown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That color shift reminded me of something I’d recently read about deep-sea divers in Estero Salado, a fishing town in the Dominican Republic. The divers describe similar <a href="https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes to ocean hues</a> where they fish, and their color vocabulary is intricate. They speak of blue, black, yellow, green, purple and chocolate to describe the seawater’s appearance at different times and under different circumstances, writes medical anthropologist Kyrstin Mallon Andrews in July in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</em>.&nbsp;These colors tell the divers about the state of the water and possible impacts on the behavior and visibility of sea life, such as depth, turbulence and influx of runoff from storms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Divers also speak of drastic changes to those colors over the years. Purple water, which “surpasses clean,” has become increasingly rare. Yellow water, caused by flooding in the nearby river and toxic runoff from the region’s rice fields, wreaks havoc on once fertile fishing grounds. Longer hurricane seasons turn the waters chocolate brown — a color too dangerous for diving — for months rather than weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My own experience and that of the deep-sea divers made me wonder if using color to describe climate change could work as a communication tool. When I pose the idea to Tim Edensor, a social and cultural geographer at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, he concurs.</p>



<p>Historically, the colors of a person’s world would have stayed fairly constant, he says. But climate change is rapidly altering our visual environment. And those changes can be hard to ignore. “This transformation of the color of the water, I think this is really quite perturbing and it’s also disorienting,” he says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Such color changes are not limited to our waterways. Scientists have been talking about changes to the world’s color palette for several years. Here in New England, <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/news/gund/science-fall-foliage-and-climate-change-uvm-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autumn’s vibrant leaves could become duller</a> due, in part, to warmer nighttime temperatures that slow chlorophyll’s degradation process, researchers say. And satellite images show that while much of the Arctic is getting greener, some parts are turning brown, a sign that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">vegetation could be dying</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>Many flowers, meanwhile, have increased the amount of their ultraviolet pigments, a natural sunscreen to protect against rising temperatures and a thinning ozone layer, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Current Biology. </em>While these changes are invisible to the human eye — we can’t see UV radiation — the flowers <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31267-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear darker to pollinators</a>. That change in hue could reduce a pollinator’s attraction to affected flowers, the researchers wrote.</p>



<p>When it comes to the world’s waterways, satellite images taken over the past 20 years show that over half the world’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06321-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oceans have become greener</a>, researchers reported in July in <em>Nature.</em> Dissolved organic material in the water or changes to the type or quantity of phytoplankton are the most likely culprits, says Emmanuel Boss, an aquatic physicist at the University of Maine in Orono. “The bacteria are very happy. There is a whole microbial community that I think is having a blast.”</p>



<p>Another study of satellite images found that lakes in areas where average summer temperatures were once moderate and the waters froze come winter are also likely to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-lake-color-blue-green-brown">switch from blue to green or even brown</a> as the climate warms in coming years (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>)<em>. </em>Hot spots for this shift include northern Europe and northeastern North America.</p>





<p>Color changes at such sweeping scales can be hard to grasp. But Mallon Andrews’ research with the Dominican deep-sea divers shows how individuals experience these changes in their communities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, Mallon Andrews, of Syracuse University in New York, went to the Dominican Republic to investigate water issues in the region. She spent days standing on a bridge overlooking a bay with the divers and soon learned their ocean language. “Their mode of communicating ocean conditions was always based around color,” she says. “Some colors you can dive in. Some colors have consequences if you dive in them. And some colors are used for navigation purposes.”</p>



<p>As the divers taught her over several years to dive, Mallon Andrews too began to see those nuances in color. She eventually realized that the divers’ color scheme was more than descriptive; it was also diagnostic. Once, for instance, one diver described the water as “methylene blue.” Mallon Andrews had never heard the term, so she looked it up and found that methylene blue is a medication used to treat people suffering from hypoxia. “What he is saying is that previous to these conditions, there was more oxygen in the water,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some colors can affect the divers’ physical and mental health, Mallon Andrews says. For instance, because yellow water clouds the water’s surface, the fishermen must dive continually to see fish, an exhausting process. Yellow water also causes skin rashes and debilitating ear infections, along with “sort of generalized angst,” she says.</p>



<p>Pairing that local, firsthand knowledge with more remote monitoring techniques could bring a deeper understanding of how climate change is altering the colors of our world, some scientists say. “It is very valuable for space agencies to have local people take high quality measurements that can be used to validate what we are inferring from space,” Boss says. </p>



<p>The camera on the satellite Boss’ team used to look at the world’s oceans, for instance, can’t see anything smaller than a kilometer, so it lacks detail. Scientists studying those images also have to sift out the material in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, dust and human-made aerosols, to see the ocean with any clarity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue shift</h3>



<p>Some of the world’s blue lakes will shift to green or brown in coming years as regions that typically see average summer air temperatures below 19° Celsius cross that threshold, researchers reported in 2022. Some lakes (shown) are already in areas within 1 degree (yellow), 2 degrees (cyan) or 3 degrees (purple) of that temperature. The most susceptible lakes — those located in areas closest to the 19° C tipping point — are mostly located in northeastern North America and northern continental Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could learning to read the color of water provide another tool to measure climate change, even for people like me who can barely manage a snorkel? When I pose the question to Brenda Bergman, she is skeptical. People’s subjective look at the water is too variable, says Bergman, who heads the science and freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Vermont. Sensors and direct water readings can do the job more systematically.</p>



<p>But she and Edensor say that helping people become attuned to the world’s changing colors could help them understand how climate change is impacting their local communities.</p>



<p>“A lot of the [climate change] literature is excessively abstract and it’s also unimaginable,” Edensor says. Everyday indicators, like changes to the color of water, are much more tangible.</p>



<p>My bike ride along Lake Champlain was one of these visceral experiences. At first, the kids with us begged to jump into the water. As the water changed color, those requests slowed — then stopped altogether after we spotted seven dead frogs on a rocky outcropping over that murky water.</p>



<p>“These changes can’t be denied,” Edensor says. “You see them with your own eyes.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pondering resistance</h4>



<p><em>Microwaving deltamethrin can renew the insecticide’s ability to kill mosquitoes that have become resistant to it. Scientists are working to add the improved insecticide to bed nets, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-microwave-insecticide-spray">Restoring an insecticide’s mosquito-killing power</a>” (</em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Although the finding “sounds like a welcome discovery,” reader <strong>Linda Ferrazzara </strong>wrote, “might the newer, more effective version of the insecticide also have more serious adverse effects on the human beings it’s supposed to protect?”</p>





<p>Deltamethrin is so commonly used as an insecticide because it’s much more lethal for insects than it is for mammals, says <strong>Bart Kahr</strong>, a crystallographer at New York University. The lethal dose for a human, which is based on toxicology data for rats, would be more than 100 billion times what it is for a mosquito, he says.</p>



<p>Since microwaving deltamethrin changes its crystal structure but not its chemical composition, the lethal dose would not be expected to change, <strong>Kahr </strong>says. The new form might be faster at delivering deltamethrin to both humans and mosquitoes, but it would still take incredibly prolonged contact with a high amount of the insecticide to be consequential to a mammal. “Of course, no one has made such an experiment, but it stands to reason from the data that we have,” he says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding pain</h4>



<p><em>Brain implants in four people with chronic pain revealed a potential biomarker of the debilitating condition. The brain signal could one day help doctors track treatment responses, <strong>Laura Sanders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implants-chronic-pain">Implants track chronic pain in the brain</a>” (</em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 10<em>).</em></p>



<p>Some readers on social media wondered what the discovery might mean for other types of long-lasting pain. “Am SO hoping that this will one day be expanded to those of us who have [the autoimmune disorder lupus],” Twitter user <strong>@SusanFi84657717</strong> wrote. Meanwhile, Facebook user <strong>Wernell Loell</strong> hoped the finding might apply to pain associated with grief.</p>



<p>The study gave researchers a glimpse of just one specific type of chronic pain: neuropathic pain, which is rooted in the nervous system, <strong>Sanders</strong> says. Three people in the study had neuropathic pain after a stroke, and one person had phantom limb pain in an amputated leg.</p>



<p>“So far, researchers don’t have this detailed view of other types of long-lasting pain,” <strong>Sanders</strong> says. But the brain implant study, while small, has provided some hints. Scientists found patterns of activity in the brain shared by all four participants when their pain was high. But the research also turned up brain activity patterns that were unique to each person.</p>



<p>“Figuring out the neural signals — both common and unique — that come with various sorts of chronic pain is the first step,” <strong>Sanders</strong> says. “The bigger goal is to interfere with those signals. Scientists are now testing whether brain stimulation can short-circuit these particular pain signals.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-fossil-lost-world-microbe-life">Ancient molecules tied to complex life</a>” (<em>SN: 7/15/23 &amp; 7/29/23, p. 6</em>) stated incorrectly that the oldest known eukaryotic fossils date to 800 million years ago. Instead, the sentence should say that the oldest known steroid fossils date to 800 million years ago. The oldest known eukaryotic fossils actually date to nearly 3 billion years ago.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-threatens-human-health-worldwide">Extreme weather threatens human health worldwide</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heat waves are synonymous with summer for most people. But this summer’s heat has broken records for temperatures and duration. As of late July, Texas had experienced highs over 100° Fahrenheit for more than 30 days straight. China posted its highest temperature ever recorded, and Europe’s heat may surpass last year’s onslaught, when more than 60,000 people may have died due to excessive heat.</p>



<p>The hot, dry weather helped fuel coast-to-coast wildfires in Canada, with smoke spilling south and blanketing the U.S. Midwest and East Coast. For many people, it was their first experience with dangerous air quality caused by wildfires, a plague that has become all too familiar to people in the western United States.</p>





<p>Scientists know that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">wildfire smoke can harm human health</a>, staff writer Meghan Rosen reports. Tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs are a big concern, and smoke can contain chemicals like formaldehyde and benzene. But researchers don’t yet know the long-term effects of being exposed to wildfire smoke intermittently over many years and are now focused on answering that question.</p>



<p>The Northern Hemisphere <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">heat waves are being driven by warmer oceans amped up by climate change</a> plus the return of a natural climate cycle called El Niño, staff writer Nikk Ogasa reports. Another factor is meandering jet streams, which have pinned hot air in place.</p>



<p>I asked Rosen, Ogasa and earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling the question we at <em>Science News</em> have been asking for a few years now: Is this the year that climate change smacks even the least vulnerable?</p>



<p>When it comes to human capacity to withstand extreme heat and high humidity, “there’s this grim feeling like we’re pushing the limit, except we don’t know what the limit is,” Gramling said. She reported last summer that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">human heat tolerance may be lower than thought</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 6</em>). People are definitely talking and thinking more about it, Ogasa said. And he’s adapting himself, going for runs when it’s least humid. Gramling also noted that there’s been a decrease in the number of people saying that climate change doesn’t exist. “People are considering things now that maybe they were less open to before.”</p>



<p>I asked these reporters what questions on climate change and health they’d like to dig into next.</p>



<p>Rosen: “I’d like to know more about how heat and wildfire smoke may affect a developing fetus. Are there particular windows of pregnancy where it’s especially dangerous for someone to be inhaling smoke, or living through a heat wave?”</p>



<p>Ogasa: “I’m curious about how we’re going to reckon with the growing need for cooling. So many places are starting to face unlivable conditions. How do we deal with that growing energy demand, what alternatives are there for people who can’t get traditional AC and in which climates do those alternatives work?”</p>



<p>Gramling: “I’m definitely interested in the limit of human heat tolerance. What even is adaptation?” As we all travel into what feels like uncharted territory, we’ll keep reporting on big questions about climate change, like how much people can adapt and the technological advances that may make a difference.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-measurement-muon-magnetism">There’s a new measurement of muon magnetism. What it means isn’t clear</a></h4>

              
                <p>Muons might not behave as expected. But scientists can’t agree on what to expect.<br><br>By taking stock of how the subatomic particles wobble in a magnetic field, physicists have pinned down a property of the muon’s internal magnet to greater precision than ever before, researchers from the Muon g−2 experiment reported August 10 in a seminar hosted by Fermilab in Batavia, Ill.</p>



<p>Previous measurements of muons&#8217; magnetism haven’t aligned with theoretical predictions. Those predictions come from one of the most important and carefully tested scientific theories ever developed, the standard model of particle physics, which describes subatomic particles and the forces that bind them.</p>





<p>Many physicists have hoped that the muon discrepancy might be hinting at a flaw in the stalwart theory that could lead to a better understanding of the universe. But several recent scientific surprises have muddled the theoretical prediction of the strength of the muon’s tiny magnet, making it harder to know if the measurement is pointing to new physics or an unresolved issue with the prediction.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Measurements of muon magnetism have long hinted at unknown particles</h4>



<p>Muons are in the same particle family as electrons but are about 200 times as massive. These short-lived particles behave like miniature magnets, each with their own magnetic field. The strength of that magnet is adjusted by a strange effect of quantum physics. Empty space is filled with a constant flurry of particles that appear temporarily before flitting out of existence. Known as “virtual” particles, they have very real effects. These transient particles alter the strength of the muon’s magnet by an amount that can be calculated according to the standard model.</p>



<p>The precise value of this tweak — known as the anomalous magnetic moment, or “g−2” in physics equations — is what has befuddled physicists.</p>



<p>Tantalizingly, particles unknown to science could shift the value of g−2 that scientists measure. So previous hints of a disagreement with the standard model’s predictions have generated a hubbub among physicists.</p>



<p>“The muons’ behavior that we’re measuring is affected by all of the forces and particles in the universe,” says Muon g−2 researcher Brynn MacCoy, a physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “It’s basically giving us this direct window into how the universe works.”</p>



<p>The first indication of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-orbits-may-defy-main-physics-theory">mismatch between the prediction and measurements</a> of g−2 came from an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., completed more than two decades ago (<em>SN: 2/15/01</em>). Then in 2021, the Muon g−2 experiment, based at Fermilab, reported its first results, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">confirming the discrepancy</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, Muon g−2 has <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/result2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubled its precision</a> in an updated magnetism measurement, the researchers reported in the Fermilab seminar and in a paper posted August 10 on the website of the Muon g−2 collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“To reach that level of precision is really unprecedented and really impressive,” says physicist Carlos Wagner of the University of Chicago, who was not involved with the experiment. “I am simply in awe.” The new measurement incorporates four times as much data as the previous one, among other improvements that beefed up the precision.</p>



<p>Scientists aim to compare that measured value to the standard model prediction. But determining what, exactly, the standard model predicts is complicated.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There is a tricky step to calculating the value of g−2</h4>



<p>In 2020, after much careful consideration, a group of theoretical physicists called the Muon g−2 Theory Initiative came to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157320302556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consensus prediction</a> that they could compare with measurements. But since then, new, contradictory information has come out from other experiments and theoretical calculations, <a href="https://muon-gm2-theory.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed in a statement</a> posted August 9 on the Muon g−2 Theory Initiative’s website. That information has left the prediction uncertain.</p>



<p>“It’s not possible to make a comparison at this point and say whether the standard model agrees or disagrees with experiment,” says theoretical physicist Tom Blum of the University of Connecticut in Storrs.</p>



<p>The confusion hinges on a particularly challenging bit of the calculation of g−2. Known as the hadronic vacuum polarization, it refers to the adjustment resulting from a virtual photon emitted by the muon that splits into a quark and its antimatter partner, an antiquark. Quarks are a class of particle that make up bigger particles known as hadrons, including protons and neutrons. The quark and antiquark interact before annihilating back into a virtual photon.</p>



<p>Scientists have come up with two main ways of calculating this hadronic vacuum polarization term. The conventional way involves using certain experimental data as an input to the calculation. Those data come from experiments that measure how electrons and their antimatter particles, positrons, collide and produce hadrons. The results of such experiments are thought to be well understood.</p>



<p>But a recent experiment, CMD-3, at the VEPP-2000 particle collider in Novosibirsk, Russia, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagrees with those other experiments</a>, researchers reported in February at arXiv.org. If this one outlier is correct, that would suggest that the hints of disagreement between muon measurements and the prediction might be weaker than thought.</p>



<p>A second way of estimating the thorny hadronic vacuum polarization term uses a method called lattice quantum chromodynamics. That technique involves mathematically splitting up spacetime into a grid in order to make calculations more tractable. Scientists have only recently managed to make such calculations precise enough for useful comparisons.</p>



<p>In 2021, a group nicknamed “BMW” published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03418-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization&nbsp;contribution</a> in <em>Nature</em>. That estimate pointed to a closer harmony between the prediction and measurement of g−2 and disagreed with the data-driven approach. But the technique demanded confirmation. Since then, other scientists have performed their own lattice calculations to check a portion of the BMW result. Those teams obtained similar results to BMW, boosting confidence in the lattice method.</p>



<p>The focus has now shifted away from scrutinizing the experimental measurement and is instead aimed at analyzing the disagreement among different theoretical techniques.</p>



<p>“The experiment has delivered,” says theoretical physicist Thomas Teubner of the University of Liverpool in England, a member of the Muon g−2 collaboration. Now, to figure out if muons are keeping with the standard model or cracking it, it’s up to the theoretical physicists, he says. “We have to get our house in order.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-ancient-whale-king-tut">Meet the tiny ancient whale named after King Tut</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just days after the world was introduced to the heaviest known ancient whale, a much tinier member of the same family has been found on the other side of the planet.</p>



<p>The newly discovered species is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04986-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the earliest — and smallest — basilosaurids</a>, a family of ancient aquatic creatures related to modern whales, researchers report August 10 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. It measured just 2.5 meters long, the team estimates, and weighed a mere 188 kilograms, about as much as a blue whale’s heart.</p>





<p>“It’s definitely a very small animal,” says Mark Uhen, a paleontologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Researchers found the 41-million-year-old fossilized skull, jaw and teeth of <em>Tutcetus rayanensis</em> in Wadi El-Rayan, a nature reserve in Egypt. Named in part after the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, the species shares King Tut’s regal roots: The name “basilosaurid” is derived from the Latin <em>basilosaurus</em>, or “king lizard” (the first basilosaurid specimen was <a href="http://oceansofkansas.com/Harlan1834b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakenly classified</a> as a reptile).</p>



<p>Like Tutankhamun, the <em>T. rayanensis </em>specimen perished on the cusp of adulthood. It still had a couple of its baby teeth, along with adult molars that grew in relatively early in its life. That pattern of tooth growth suggests that the species “lived fast and died fast,” or at least faster than other basilosaurids, says study coauthor Abdullah Gohar, a paleontologist at Mansoura University in Egypt.</p>



<p>Another group of researchers recently announced the discovery of the basilosaurid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colossal-ancient-whale-heaviest-animal"><em>Perucetus colossus</em></a>, possibly the heaviest animal ever known to exist, in Peru (<em>SN: 8/2/23</em>). Just one of its vertebrae weighed over half as much as its teeny cousin’s entire body.</p>



<p><em>T. rayanensis</em> may have lived around the same time as the gigantic <em>P. colossus</em>, which rivaled modern blue whales in body mass, Gohar says. But their vastly different body types indicate that they probably occupied different ecological niches, Uhen says.</p>



<p>Gohar says he hopes to study older fossils to better understand the full story of whale evolution. The area where the researchers found <em>T. rayanensis</em> contains 15 million years of mammalian evolutionary history, including that of other early whales.</p>



<p>“We’ve been working that area for a long time,” Uhen says. “It’s good to know that there are still things out there to discover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigby-scientist-jwst-lgbtq-astronomers">Meet Jane Rigby, senior project scientist for JWST and advocate for LGBTQ+ astronomers</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">One of a telescope operator’s primary jobs is to keep any stray light out of the instrument. Earthly and other unwelcome photons can swamp the cosmic light from distant stars and galaxies. During more than a decade as a project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, Jane Rigby obsessed over minimizing light leaks — with extraordinary success. The sky looks darker to JWST than most anyone had hoped.</p>



<p>Rigby herself, now the senior project scientist for JWST, is a source of light.</p>





<p>“I remember the light in her eyes,” says astrophysicist Jane Charlton, who met Rigby the summer before her freshman year at Penn State and later advised her research. “Jane had incredible grades, but that’s not necessarily what I look for. The love of astronomy, and passion for that, is what I look for.”</p>



<p>Nearly three decades later, Rigby’s palpable joy in discussing the success of JWST, which launched on December 25, 2021, has made her one of the public faces of the telescope. She presented <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">the telescope’s first images</a> at the White House and has given keynote speeches at some of the biggest astronomy meetings (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>). During public appearances, she often wears JWST-themed socks, scarves and pins. “I have JWST socks for pretty much every day of the week,” she says.</p>



<p>She has also lit a path for queer astronomers, as well as others who are historically underrepresented in astronomy. Rigby has been out as part of the LGBTQ+ community since 2000, when she met her now-wife when they were both astronomy graduate students at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She has devoted much of her career to holding the door open for others.</p>



<p>“I didn’t grow up with any queer role models,” she says. “I hope I’m the last generation for which that’s true.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Focusing on the instruments</h4>



<p>Rigby remembers being asked to draw a favorite TV show in preschool. She used up an entire black crayon drawing Carl Sagan’s <em>Cosmos</em>.</p>



<p>Her interest in space crystallized into a career plan at about age 12, after she saw Sally Ride speak at a local college. Ride, the first American woman in space, made Rigby want to be an astronaut.</p>



<p>“I knew there were two paths to becoming an astronaut: a test pilot or a scientist,” she says. “And it was pretty clear that I was never going to be tall enough to fly the shuttle.” At 5 feet, 2 inches tall, she’s still two inches too short to have been a space shuttle pilot. If she couldn’t make it to space, she saw more potential in science than in flying planes.</p>



<p>Rigby’s first experience using a telescope for research, as an undergraduate student at Penn&nbsp;State, was stymied by light leaks. She, Charlton and another student traveled to western Texas to use the telescope at the McDonald Observatory. They were looking to catch light from a distant quasar filtering through a diffuse and mysterious cloud of cosmic gas. These small, dense clouds appear to be packed with heavy elements from supernova explosions, but surprisingly, they’re not found in galaxies’ centers where a lot of stars are born and dying. “We were, at that time, trying to figure out what they were,” Charlton says. “As we still are.”</p>



<p>After a night of guiding the telescope by hand, the group realized that light from something other than the quasar — maybe an alert light on an instrument panel — had flooded the telescope. The trio tracked it down, covered it with tape and tried again. The same thing happened night after night. Ultimately, they returned to Pennsylvania with no quasar data.</p>



<p>“It didn’t work,” Rigby says. “But it was really fun. I was learning everything, trying to learn how the telescope worked.”</p>

Rigby</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Since then, Rigby has used many major telescopes, from those at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii to the Magellan telescopes in Chile to the Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes. Along the way, her research developed a theme: investigating how galaxies grow and change along with the super­massive black holes hiding within.</p>



<p>But her approach is less “How can I answer this burning question?” and more “What can I do with this shiny new instrument?”</p>





<p>“I’m a very observational astronomer,” she says. “I will use any telescope I can get my hands on.”</p>



<p>All that telescope time meant she was ready to join the JWST team when the opportunity came.</p>



<p>“Because she had seen data from Spitzer and Hubble,” JWST’s precursors, says astronomer Matt Mountain of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C., “she knew what she was looking for.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting the James Webb Space Telescope</h4>



<p>Rigby began working on JWST in 2010, when she took a job at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., as the telescope’s deputy operations project scientist.</p>



<p>One of the first things she did was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cost-overruns-and-delays-add-65-billion-nasas-next-gen-space-telescope">read the report of an independent review panel</a> that found that the telescope was mismanaged, over budget by billions of dollars and would launch years later than originally planned (<em>SN: 11/11/10</em>). “I’ve certainly been four years from launch multiple times,” she says.</p>



<p>Before launch, most of her time was devoted to making sure that changes to the telescope’s design wouldn’t mess up the science. She imagined possible ways to use JWST and met with other team members to make sure the final telescope would deliver on those goals. Would the telescope materials glow or release gases that could freeze to the machine? Could JWST use two cameras simultaneously? Could it study moving targets, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">like asteroids within the solar system</a> (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 14</em>)?</p>



<p>“Because she is a working scientist who really wanted to use the data,” Mountain says, “she was an ideal choice for operations scientist,” a job she moved up to in 2018. “In these complex spaces, with all the engineering, the personalities, the politics at NASA, working with contractors, she always keeps her eye on the prize: What science are we trying to do?”</p>



<p>Rigby bridged the divide between the science and engineering teams, helping them speak a common language. Her job has been “a lot of active listening and soft power, a lot of synthesizing and a dose of specialized technical expertise,” she says. “Oftentimes I’m the big-picture person in a room full of specialists.”</p>

<p>After the telescope launched, got in position and unfolded itself — “the six-month unwrapping of the Christmas present,” Rigby says — her job shifted to characterizing how well the telescope works. In practically every metric, it’s a dream come true.</p>



<p>There’s better-than-expected image quality, higher sensitivity, faster response times and a longer potential mission lifetime than predicted before launch — and practically no light leaks. The telescope’s great golden mirrors are exposed to space, and light can scatter off dust grains on the mirrors, registering on images as faint, diffuse patterns the team calls “wisps” and “claws,” or a ghostly streak dubbed “the lightsaber.” But the mirrors proved remarkably dust-free, meaning the sky appears incredibly dark.</p>



<p>“It’s not an accident that the telescope works so well,” she says. “That was careful work beforehand.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>When asked about such successes, and her own, Rigby points to a huge amount of work by tens of thousands of people. “I understand the desire to humanize something that can seem really big and impersonal. But I don’t like the singling out,” she says. “I try to reflect it back to the team.” It took thousands of people and tasks to ensure JWST’s success. Engineer Larkin Carey, with Ball Aerospace, for example, cleaned every square centimeter of the telescope’s mirrors by hand with a tool like a shaving brush, Rigby says.</p>



<p>With the telescope working so well, Rigby could turn her attention to the scientific questions. She helps lead an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observing program called TEMPLATES</a>, looking at galaxies whose light has been magnified by foreground objects to get a glimpse at how the galaxies form stars. At a June meeting in Albuquerque of the American Astronomical Society, Rigby shared how the TEMPLATES team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05998-6" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05998-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found hydrocarbons</a>, “the same stuff that smoke is made of,” in a galaxy whose light dates back more than 12&nbsp;billion years — the furthest back in time such molecules had ever been seen.</p>



<p>Early in July, Rigby became <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-names-dr-jane-rigby-new-webb-telescope-senior-project-scientist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the senior project scientist for JWST</a>; it’s her job to figure out how to get the most and best science out of the telescope.</p>



<p>Research colleagues describe her as superhuman. “I don’t know how she does everything that she does, and does everything well,” says TEMPLATES collaborator Keren Sharon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. And Rigby’s enthusiasm is abundant: “She gets giddy,” Sharon says. “It could be about figuring out a bug, or discovering this super exciting thing about a galaxy that we didn’t know before … and she’s literally bouncing. Her face lights up.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opening doors for others</h4>



<p>Rigby wants anyone to be able to experience and pursue that enthusiasm. When she started attending American Astronomical Society meetings in the 1990s, she didn’t know there was a secret LGBTQ+ networking dinner. “You had to know it existed. That was a little closety. But it’s where people were.”</p>



<p>At the time, there was a lack of protection from employment discrimination and no guarantee of institutional support for astronomers with same-sex partners. Rigby recalls accepting a fellowship at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., and immediately having to request health insurance benefits to cover her partner.</p>



<p>“That’s awkward,” she says. “You want to be talking about your science and your telescope proposals, not how can I get health insurance for my family because we’re different.” Finding other LGBTQ+ astronomers was “a lifeline,” she says.</p>



<p>These days, the meet-up at AAS is too big to go out to dinner. At a January 2023 meeting in Seattle, “we lost count at 120 people. We had to spill out into the hallway,” Rigby says. “That feels good.”</p>



<p>Seeing queer astronomers like Rigby so far along in their careers was helpful to Traci Johnson, a data scientist who was a graduate student in astronomy in Sharon’s lab at the University of Michigan. Johnson identifies as lesbian and nonbinary and came out during graduate school. “I realized it is possible to be out, and be happy, and also have a really amazing career,” Johnson says.</p>



<p>Rigby has taken an active role in encouraging inclusivity, though she seems to be up against the legacy of JWST’s namesake. Many astronomers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called for the telescope to be renamed</a> because James Webb was NASA administrator at a time when the U.S. government fired employees for being gay.</p>



<p>Rigby won’t comment on the telescope’s name. But her support for LGBTQ+ astronomers is clear. Rigby was a founding member of the AAS Committee for Sexual-Orientation and Gender Minorities in Astronomy, which works to promote equality for LGBTQ+ astronomers within the field; has co-organized conferences on making astronomy more inclusive; and authored a recent white paper urging the astronomy community to address diversity, inclusion and harassment. A current priority is making sure trans people feel safe and welcome.</p>



<p>Rigby doesn’t want to be pigeonholed as “the gay astronomer.” She knows her contributions to astronomy extend far beyond any particular group. But she says the leadership skills, resilience and ability to shift her perspective that she has learned through living and organizing as a member of the LGBTQ+ community have made her a better astronomer. They’re skills she transfers to her role as a leader at NASA.</p>



<p>“The whole vision is, you get to bring your authentic self to work,” she says. “And work embraces your authentic self.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fastest-evolving-moss-adapt-climate-change">The fastest-evolving moss in the world may not adapt to climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s oldest moss has seen three mass extinctions — but may not survive climate change.</p>



<p>The genus <em>Takakia</em> has the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00736-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest number of fast-evolving genes</a> of any moss, researchers report August 9 in <em>Cell</em>. A decade-long study of <em>Takakia</em> in the Himalayas shows that the moss is well-adapted to its high-altitude home, with resistance to extreme cold and intense ultraviolet light. But no matter how fast it can tweak its genes, the scientists found, rapidly rising temperatures in the region were associated with a decrease in the moss’s range — a faster decrease than any of the mosses around it.</p>





<p><em>Takakia</em> consists of just two species of moss. While they can be found individually in the United States and Japan, both species occur together only on the Tibetan Plateau in the Himalayas. The two are unlike any other plant in the world. The evolutionary shoot containing <em>Takakia</em> branched off the other bryophytes — mosses, liverworts and hornworts — around 390 million years ago.</p>



<p>“The evolutionary position of <em>Takakia</em> in plants is like that of platypus in mammals,” says Yikun He, a plant geneticist at the Capital Normal University in Beijing. Just as the platypus has a lot of strange, not-quite-mammal traits — like egg-laying and a beak — <em>Takakia</em> has a bunch of features that make it not quite like other plants, such as featherlike leaves and a lack of pores for controlling the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“It looks very different from other mosses,” says Ralf Reski, a plant biotechnologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany. “For a long time, it was unclear if it was a moss.”</p>

<p>To learn more about mysterious <em>Takakia</em>, Reski, He and their colleagues set up a long-term study in the Tibetan Plateau, more than 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>



<p>Over 11 years, the researchers collected samples, analyzed genomes, collected data on the surrounding ecosystem and compared modern specimens with fossils from 165 million years ago. The team also had to evacuate several students due to altitude sickness. The field sites were accessible only in August and September, and even then, “the climate is unpredictable, and one day may experience spring, summer, autumn and winter,” He says.</p>



<p>Humans might have had a tough time, but the moss was comfortable in its high-altitude home. That’s due in part to its genes. While <em>Takakia</em> sports a genome whose length is average for a bryophyte — just over 27,400 genes — it has the largest known number of fast-evolving genes of any moss, liverwort or hornwort, the researchers found.</p>



<p><em>Takakia</em> needed that speed when the Himalayas began to rise 65 million years ago. As the mountains stretched toward the sky, the mosses on them were exposed to lower temperatures and higher amounts of ultraviolet light. They had to adapt. And adapt <em>Takakia</em> did. </p>



<p>The new study showed the moss&#8217;s ability to withstand solar radiation. When the researchers exposed <em>Takakia</em> to a high amount of UV light, it was unharmed, while comparison mosses began to die within 72 hours. The hardy moss produces “high amounts of metabolites like flavonoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids to protect against radiation,” Reski says. It also sports genes to enable more efficient DNA repair — essential protection against harmful rays.</p>



<p><em>Takakia</em> also adapted to the extreme cold. It can go dormant for eight months of the year while under snow, and gets all of its growth and reproduction done, He says, “in the precious three-to-four-month light window period.”</p>





<p>All of these features evolved from about 50 million years ago to the present, the study showed, without ever changing the moss’s physical appearance compared with fossils of <em>Takakia</em> from about 165 million years ago.</p>



<p>But this relatively speedy evolution doesn’t seem to be fast enough to help the moss adapt to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the 11 years of the study, Reski, He and their colleagues documented an average increase in temperature of about four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the region. Meanwhile, the coverage of <em>Takakia</em> in their sample population decreased by about 1.6 percent per year — faster than four other local mosses.</p>



<p>The researchers predict that by the end of the 21st century, suitable conditions for <em>Takakia</em> will be limited to only 1,000 to 1,500 square kilometers around the world. By that time, the researchers suspect, the world’s oldest moss could be extinct.</p>



<p>Others are more optimistic about the fate of this tough little moss. There are populations in other places, says evolutionary biologist S. Blair Hedges. So while the Tibetan Plateau may eventually be <em>Takakia</em>-free, he hopes the moss can make it elsewhere.</p>



<p>What’s more, “it’s fantastic to see all these different things known about a single [genus], from the fossil record all the way up to the complete genome,” says Hedges, of Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>In the meantime, He, Reski and their colleagues are cultivating <em>Takakia</em> populations and transplanting them to other regions in Tibet in the hopes of giving old moss a new lease on life. “<em>Takakia</em> saw the dinosaurs come and go. It saw us humans coming,” Reski says. “Now we can learn something about resilience and extinction from this tiny moss.”</p>

<p>Following an inspection earlier this month, Colombia&#8217;s FDA has suspended all human research at a facility that until this summer had been receiving <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/adoCUZ3XEU-voptEvqRj0A/project-details/10513808#details">U.S. funding to develop a malaria vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>The Malaria Vaccine and Development Center, in the city of Cali in western Colombia, is part of the <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/consorcio-2/">Caucaseco Scientific Research Consortium</a>, which is run by husband-and-wife team Myriam Arévalo-Herrera and Sócrates Herrera. The couple has secured more than $17 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2003.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in April, an investigation by the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) exposed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/27/us-backed-researchers-in-colombia-accused-of-experimenting-on-animals-humans-without-approval/">a host of serious problems at the facilities</a>, including widespread animal abuse and falsified research approvals. The NIH <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2023/07/05/peta-nih-colombia-monkeys-animal-welfare/">defunded the facilities</a> in June, as first reported by <em>STAT</em>.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-05-invima-suspended-mvdc.pdf">statement released on August 5</a> (in Spanish), the Colombian National Institute of Drug and Food Surveillance (Invima) made the following findings during its inspection of the Malaria Vaccine and Development Center:</p>



<span id="more-127695"></span>



<ul>
<li>The center was not certified by Invima in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and thus was not authorized to conduct clinical trials.</li>



<li>Documents found at the center described clinical studies that had been performed without mandatory approvals from Invima and ethics committees.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Studies had been conducted without written informed consent from participants.</li>



<li>In some clinical studies, the principal investigator was not a physician and other researchers were not registered as health professionals.</li>



<li>Scientific publications from the center described studies in humans that had been performed without regulatory approval. These publications also cited approval by an ethics committee whose participation was not supported by any documents.</li>



<li>Study participants were paid 250,000 pesos (about $60), in violation of local regulations.</li>



<li>The study designs appeared to violate ethical standards, as previously healthy people were exposed to disease in order to measure vaccine immunogenicity, without considering risk control or following established procedures for this type of intervention.</li>



<li>For these studies, ethics committees were not provided adequate information to ensure the safe and ethical conduct of the research.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on the agency&#8217;s findings, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthmagnoliamartinezpena">Magnolia Martínez</a> of PETA, who led the group&#8217;s investigation, has emailed more than a dozen journals requesting retractions of papers citing the nonexistent ethics approvals.</p>



<p>The journals include <em>Frontiers in Immunology</em> (two papers), <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> (11 papers), <em>PLOS One</em> (three papers), <em>Nature Communications</em> and <em>Nature Genetics</em> (one paper each), <em>Redox Biology </em>(one paper),<em> Malaria Journal</em> (six papers), <em>Vaccine</em> (one paper), <em>The International Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> (one paper), <em>Infection and Immunity </em>(one paper), <em>Journal of Personalized Medicine </em>(one paper), <em>Colombia Médica </em>(one paper), <em>Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz </em>(one paper).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">Extreme ocean heat off Florida has ebbed. But for marine life, the danger remains</a></h4>

              
                <p>In late July, a fierce ocean heat wave ratcheted up temperatures in Florida’s coastal waters to unprecedented highs. One buoy bobbing in shallow, turbid Manatee Bay logged a measurement of 38.3˚ Celsius (101˚ Fahrenheit). That may be the highest temperature ever recorded in the ocean. A week later, that surge in ocean heat had ebbed. But South Florida’s denizens are still in hot water.</p>



<p>The concern is not just that the Manatee Bay buoy recorded shockingly high, hot tub–level temperatures — actually, “close to the limit of hot tub temperatures” — for several days in a row, says Benjamin Kirtman, a climate scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.</p>





<p>And it’s not just that June and July’s brutally hot water temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean are linked to shockingly hot temperatures on land. This summer, Miami’s heat index, a measure of air temperature and humidity, soared to a record-breaking streak of nearly two months, reaching a daily heat index of 38° C (100° F).</p>



<p>It’s not even that such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal">ocean heat waves are becoming the new normal</a>, as swells of heat more and more frequently crest atop the baseline warming of the global ocean due to climate change (<em>SN: 2/1/22</em>). Florida’s waters may have hit a record high, but <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July saw widespread ocean heat waves</a> around the world, from the North Atlantic Ocean to the eastern equatorial Pacific to the Southern Indian Ocean.</p>



<p>“The global oceans have warmed up so much … we’re seeing a ratcheting up that’s unprecedented in the modern instrument record, and maybe in the last 125,000 years,” Kirtman says. “It’s really quite remarkable.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">‘Way outside of the bounds of anything these corals have experienced’</h4>



<p>In Florida, the temperatures of the coastal waters have returned to a normal summertime range for now. But the danger remains acute for many ocean dwellers, from corals to fish, says Andrew Baker, a coral biologist also at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School.</p>



<p>Murky Manatee Bay, swirling with sediment, isn’t home to corals — but the water temperatures in the reefs around the Florida Keys were still “incredibly hot,” perhaps reaching up to 36° C (96° F), Baker says.</p>



<p>As the sweltering sea temperatures peaked in July, the Coral Restoration Foundation, a nonprofit marine conservation organization based in Key Largo, Fla., found 100 percent coral mortality at one site, Sombrero Reef off Key West. There, heat had caused the corals to bleach.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Corals may survive a few days of very high temperatures but too long spent in extremely hot water can kill them. That accumulated heat stress is measured by coral scientists in &#8220;degree heating weeks,&#8221; or DHW, a measure of both the intensity and duration of the heat the corals experienced over the previous 12 weeks. Significant coral bleaching begins to occur at 4˚ C–weeks; at 8˚ C–weeks, corals experience severe, widespread bleaching and significant mortality is expected. The accumulated heat stress on the corals at Sombrero Reef in the Florida Keys (shown) generally peaks in August and September (gray lines). But the mounting heat stress on the corals in 2023 (red line) is unprecedented in records going back to 1985.</figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>Bleaching occurs when corals’ symbiotic algae, the main source of their food, flee, leaving the corals colorless and essentially starving. Corals can recover from bleaching, but if the events are too severe or too frequent, they can kill entire reefs. U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/corals-are-severely-bleaching-five-times-often-1980">heat burden on corals globally has been rising since the 1980s</a> (<em>SN: 1/4/18</em>).</p>



<p>Even with the return to typical summertime water temperatures off Florida’s coasts, the impacts of July’s heat wave on the region’s corals will linger. That’s because corals have a limit to how much accumulated heat they can tolerate before bleaching. And with this heat wave, the corals have already received far too much heat far too early in the summer, researchers say.</p>





<p>NOAA records from sites across the Florida Keys each tell the same worrisome story — that what’s happened in 2023 so far is “way outside of the bounds of anything these corals have experienced,” Baker says. And the corals still must contend with two more months of expected, but still very hot, water in August and September.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, scientists are racing to save corals growing at nurseries in the Keys, bringing them to onshore laboratories away from the overheated coastal waters. The cultivated corals are part of a decade-long effort to protect the two most important reef species in the region, staghorn and elkhorn coral, from the ever-looming threat of bleaching.</p>

<p>The fledgling finger- to hand-sized corals are cultivated in coastal waters atop bits of PVC tubing, and are ultimately destined to be planted in reefs. As the water temperatures rose, researchers hurried to collect the cultivated corals ahead of their expected spawning in early August. Scientists feared the &#8220;heat stress is just too much for these baby corals,&#8221; and that they might not spawn at all, Baker says. Happily, some of the rescued staghorn corals, now ensconced in the laboratory, did manage to spawn on August 3, releasing clouds of eggs and sperm into the water. Whether the sperm will fertilize the eggs remains uncertain, but Baker and colleagues are cautiously optimistic.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It’s not just corals in trouble</h4>



<p>The overheated water is also bad news for everything from sponges to sea grasses to fish. “There are a lot of studies that show that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">species experiencing ocean heat waves are migrating [to cooler waters]</a>,” says Regina Rodrigues, a physical oceanographer at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). But in tropical regions like the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, where cooler waters are prohibitively far away, “that community doesn’t have anywhere to go.”</p>



<p>That lack of access to an escape route to cooler waters is why the region’s cold-blooded ocean species, including fish, may be even more vulnerable to warming than their counterparts on land. On average, ocean ectotherms <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1132-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend more time near the upper limits for body temperature</a> than land ectotherms, as marine ecologist Malin Pinsky of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>Then there’s the anoxia. As water heats up, it releases oxygen, like bubbles escaping a pot boiling on the stove, leaving less oxygen available for sea life. Such heat-amped anoxic waters have been linked to increased sea grass die-offs as well as fish kills. In June, for example, thousands of fish killed by a low-oxygen event washed up on the Texas Gulf Coast just south of Houston.</p>



<p>Florida’s sea grasses have been in free fall for years, with thousands of hectares of marine sea grass beds wiped out by anoxia as well as nutrient pollution, which can lead to harmful algal blooms that block out the light for underwater plants. The loss of those sea grass ecosystems has been deadly for manatees and other creatures that rely on the grasses for food.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">‘It’s just bonkers hot’</h4>



<p>What’s driving the brutal ocean temperatures is still uncertain — but human-caused climate change is undeniably at its core, researchers say. “Ninety-three percent of the excess heat in the atmosphere is being absorbed by the ocean,” Rodrigues says. That’s raised the average temperature of ocean waters, “and once the mean temperature is raised, the extremes are easier to achieve.”</p>



<p>Other factors are also likely playing a role, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">this year’s onset of the global climate pattern known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>). The El Niño phase of that climate pattern tends to increase the global average temperature, and this year’s El Niño is bidding to be “a strong one,” Kirtman says.</p>



<p>“Certainly, one of the questions that’s come up is how much [of the heat] is internal natural variability, and how much a ratcheting up of climate change,” he says.</p>



<p>Local extremes — such as the temporary hot tub in Manatee Bay — may also be influenced by factors such as the shallowness of the water and murkier, less-reflective waters absorbing more heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, Kirtman says, the global oceans have warmed up so much that El Niño or sediment-laden waters alone can’t possibly explain what’s going on. “This is so crazy, so bonkers. It’s just bonkers hot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unknome-catalog-genome-protein-mysterious">The ‘unknome’ catalogs nearly 2 million proteins. Many are mysterious</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to vast, under-explored frontiers, space and Earth&#8217;s oceans come to mind. But even in human bodies, there’s still much to be discovered. Meet the &#8220;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknome</a>,&#8221; a new database that emphasizes how much we still don&#8217;t know about human genes and proteins.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://unknome.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly available database</a> ranks groups of proteins by how little is known about them. That information could help scientists identify proteins for future study, including for disease treatment and drug discovery, researchers report August 8 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>





<p>Cell biologist Sean Munro and colleagues compiled the unknome — a portmanteau of the words <em>unknown</em> and <em>genome </em>— to identify understudied but potentially important proteins and their corresponding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">protein-coding</a> genes: DNA that copies a protein’s recipe into RNA (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>Proteins are generally grouped into families that have a common evolutionary ancestor. The unknome database contains all protein families with at least one protein encoded by the human genetic instruction book, or genome, or by the genomes of 11 other commonly studied organisms. Over 13,000 groups and nearly 2 million proteins are included.</p>



<p>The unknome assigns a “knownness” score to each group of proteins based on how much is known about their corresponding genes. Some 3,000 of those groups, including 805 that contain at least one human protein, have a knownness score of zero, showing there’s still much to learn within the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">human genome</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>).</p>



<p>Munro and colleagues used the database to study 260 genes that are shared between fruit flies and humans and that have low knownness scores. After dialing down the activity of each of the protein-encoding genes in the flies, the researchers found that about 60 were essential for life. Others were important for reproduction, growth, movement and resilience against stress.</p>



<p>“Even in really well-studied [organisms] like flies, there are new things to be found,” says Munro, of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.</p>



<p>Whether some or all of those genes have similar effects in humans is still unknown. But the database could help researchers tease out important human proteins by quickly screening similar proteins in more easily studied organisms like fruit flies, says data scientist Tudor Oprea of Expert Systems Inc., a drug discovery company in San Diego, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Munro says the next step for his group is to work with similar efforts like the <a href="https://understudiedproteins.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understudied Proteins Initiative</a> for a large-scale study of these mysterious proteins.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiral-galaxies-lentil-shaped-star">Spiral galaxies might have been lentil-shaped before becoming starry whirls</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way might have once looked more like a legume than a starry whirlpool.</p>



<p>Over their unfathomably long lifetimes, spiral galaxies like the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-galaxies-are-flat-old-ones-are-more-blobby">are generally thought to </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-galaxies-are-flat-old-ones-are-more-blobby">morph</a> into lentil-shaped “lenticular” galaxies and then into elliptical blobs (<em>SN: 4/23/18</em>). But an analysis of nearby galaxies suggests that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/3/3588/7152347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our galaxy, and others like it, was once lenticular</a>, astronomer Alister Graham reports in the July <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. If correct, Graham’s proposed update to the evolutionary sequence of galaxies would rewrite the history of the Milky Way.</p>





<p>“Lenticulars have always been sort of the abandoned stepchild of [galaxy] morphology,” says astronomer Christopher Conselice of the University of Manchester in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. But this paper puts them into focus, he says, as being a major aspect of how galaxies change.</p>



<p>Lenticulars get their name from the way their entire halo of stars, when viewed edge on, bulges in the middle and thins out toward the sides, much like a lentil. These galaxies exhibit a confusing mix of properties that’s made their presumed place in the middle of galaxy evolution sequences rather suspect.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for a while that that’s almost certainly not correct,” Conselice says. Particularly puzzling is that lenticulars, despite their spiral-like disks, don’t have lots of gas, which hinders them from producing new stars. Spiral galaxies do have lots of star-forming gas, and scientists aren’t sure why lenticular galaxies don’t.</p>



<p>Graham, of Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, Australia, found new clues to this mystery of galaxy evolution by considering black holes.</p>



<p>Most galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole in their center, and when galaxies merge, so do those black holes. This makes the mass of a galaxy’s black hole a kind of record of its past collisions. If a galaxy got big by gobbling up its neighbors rather than by sucking up surrounding gas, its black hole should be hefty relative to the swarm of stars that surrounds it.</p>



<p>Using images from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, Graham compared the black hole and stellar masses of about 100 nearby galaxies. For galaxies of the same shape, he saw that black hole mass and stellar mass tend to be linked in a predictable way — except for the lenticular galaxies.</p>



<p>When Graham took a closer look at the lenticulars, he realized they are actually two distinct groups that had been lumped together: those that have lots of interstellar dust and those that do not. This division, which he previously reported in the May <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>, could have been a superficial aesthetic difference. But the galaxies’ black hole masses suggest otherwise.</p>



<p>Dust-poor and dust-rich lenticulars have entirely different relationships between their black hole masses and stellar masses, suggesting different histories and explaining the apparently scattered behavior of lenticular galaxies. The dusty galaxies tend to have a heftier supermassive black hole than the ones found in both spirals and dust-poor lenticulars. Dust-poor lenticulars are usually on the small side in terms of both black hole mass and stellar mass.</p>



<p>This led Graham to conclude that spiral galaxies are actually in between the two types of lenticulars, evolutionarily speaking. His new analysis suggests that dust-poor lenticulars become spirals after capturing small &#8220;satellite galaxies” and other minor mergers —&nbsp;bumping up their black hole masses — and scooping up nearby gas.</p>



<p>When spirals collide with other substantial galaxies, he proposes, they become dust-rich lenticulars — and indeed, he adds, every dust-rich lenticular in his dataset was previously recognized as the remnant of a spiral galaxy merger. Collisions between these dust-rich lenticulars are then enough to finally erode the galaxies’ discs of stars and destroy their dust, producing blobby elliptical galaxies.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Black holes are a good tracer of galaxy evolution, Conselice says, but the new sequence could be controversial. One issue, he says, is that lenticular galaxies in the nearby universe are usually such lightweights that they would need to merge tens or even hundreds of times — far more than the expected average of around three over 10 billion years — to form a large spiral galaxy.</p>



<p>But things might have been different in the early universe, he adds. Long ago, there could have been more massive lenticulars. Figuring that out might be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope, which can see incredibly faint infrared light, so is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">allowing scientists to peer farther away</a> — and further back in time — than ever before <em>(SN: 12/16/22</em>).</p>



<p>“If you could look in the more distant universe, you could potentially see some of these galaxies when they&#8217;re first forming, or when they&#8217;re evolving,” Conselice says. “We could potentially really test this idea.”</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the associate editors of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>, a Wiley title, have resigned in a dispute with the publisher, and more resignations are likely, according to those involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the resignations, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/another-wiley-journal-board-resigns-after-month-long-strike">reported first</a> by <em>Times Higher Education</em>, were effective immediately, but a portion of the associate editors set August 28 as their effective date in hopes Wiley may negotiate with them about <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/08/01/associateeditors-workstoppage-jbiogeography-continues/">their concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the associate editors stopped processing new manuscripts at the end of June, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">we reported</a> last month, due to the dispute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In interviews with Retraction Watch, two associate editors who had put in their resignations described concerns with the journal’s high article processing charges (APCs) fueling Wiley’s profitability, as well as the “breakdown in negotiations” between the publisher and the journal’s lead editorial team. </p>



<span id="more-127686"></span>



<p>As we reported last week, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/01/an-editor-resigned-in-protest-now-wiley-is-firing-him-four-months-earlier-than-he-planned-to-leave/">moved to terminate</a> Mike Dawson, the chief editor of the journal, as of August&nbsp; 27, after he had tendered his resignation in early May with the contractually-required six months notice. Dawson expressed disappointment that the publisher had “not made any efforts to address any of the issues” the editorial team raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve taken these decisions because we believe the decisions lead to the greatest success and longevity of the journal,” Dawson said. “It’s disappointing Wiley is not engaged. They would benefit in the long run. It’s that simple.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignations at the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> are the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/">string</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">such actions</a> by <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/imaging-journal-editors-resign-over-extreme-open-access-fees/">editors</a> <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/elsevier-journal-board-follows-through-mass-resignation-threat">dissatisfied</a> with the actions of publishers. Last week, many moderators of ProMED-mail, an infectious disease bulletin that reported the first cases of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/03/promed-early-warning-system-on-disease-outbreaks-appears-near-collapse/">announced</a> they were suspending work for the service after the host society said it would start charging subscription fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> is not fully open access, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13652699/homepage/fundedaccess.html">charges APCs</a> of $4,800 for authors who wish to make their articles freely available.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127688" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?w=256&amp;ssl=1 256w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Krystal Tolley</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Such fees are “excessive,” and “not affordable,” said Krystal Tolley, one of the associate editors who put in her resignation for the end of the month. Tolley is based in South Africa, and said she and other researchers in the Global South “just don’t have those kinds of funds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley and other major publishers often waive fees for authors in low-income countries, and “transformative agreements” in which funding agencies or universities pay publication fees rather than authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither option is satisfactory, Tolley said. Few articles receive waivers, and as for transformative agreements, “I find it lip service. It’s not them who’s taking the hit, it’s still somebody who’s paying them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publishing model of charging high fees for open access publication, Tolley and other associate editors wrote in an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.14697#jbi14697-bib-0027">editorial</a> about their work stoppage:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>severely hampers the research visibility of early career researchers and those in countries with low-to-middle economies who cannot afford [open access] fees and therefore publish in less visible outlets. At the same time, this system promotes the visibility of those researchers with ample funds and allows unfair free access to their content. [Open access] combined with high APCs creates a pay-to-play system where those that have funds have research that is likely to be more visible and more cited.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides the journal’s high APC, the editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">have also objected</a> to what they understand as the publisher’s intention to make the journal entirely open access, increase its volume, and automatically refer rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors began trying to engage Wiley in discussion about their concerns near the beginning of this year, but the journal’s managers “essentially refused” to talk, Dawson said. After four months of frustration, he put in his resignation on May 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was clear that I could not achieve anything as chief editor when Wiley would not talk at all,” he said. He and the associate editors discussed what to do next, and settled on the work stoppage to try and pressure Wiley to the negotiation table. “Where we are now is the result of them not engaging seriously.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawson said he suspected an email he sent informing authors who had submitted to the journal during the work stoppage that processing their manuscripts could be delayed sparked Wiley’s decision to fire him. He said Wiley initially attempted to fire him by email, effective immediately. He pointed out that termination without notice was in breach of his contract, and later that day received a letter giving him 30 days notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson confirmed the dates of his resignation and termination but would not otherwise comment on the staffing changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson previously told us that the journal<em> </em>was no longer part of the referral program for rejected manuscripts, and “there are no plans to flip the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to open access but that we continually evaluate our journals to ensure they stay aligned with subject areas and funding trends.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither of those statements are concessions, Dawson said. He and the editors of the publisher’s other biogeography journals were only referring a small number of rejected manuscripts to each other, so they had essentially implemented the policy themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley “may not have an explicit plan” to make the journal open access, Dawson said, but at the beginning of the year the publisher was “absolutely clear” that they intended “to flip the journal to open access on a time horizon of two to four years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the resignations, a Wiley spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our highest priority is to continue delivering impactful research that serves the academic community and society at large. Wiley regularly meets with editors on issues that impact research publishing. To that end, we have extended several invitations to meet with the editors from the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to discuss their concerns and further support their important work. We appreciate the feedback shared by members of the academic publishing community and welcome further discussion to strengthen our journals and the people they serve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dawson noted that some of the <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">12 points</a> the editors had raised for discussion were more difficult to resolve than others, and said the editors would take action on the easier things, such as setting up an advisory board consisting of the chief editors of the publisher’s biogeography journals, as a sign of good faith. Then discussion of the difficult issues, such as what constitutes a fair APC and amount of profit for Wiley to make, could follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/staff/williams-jack/">Jack Williams</a>, chair of the department of geography at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who resigned as an associate editor of the journal last week, likened the current scientific publishing system to giving blood. He has gladly donated his time for peer review and editing “as service to science,” and has also given blood to the American Red Cross on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I found out the American Red Cross is making profit margins of 20% or whatever,” he said, he’d think, “Maybe I should give blood somewhere else. That’s not what I’m giving blood for.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, “When you see a model in which labor is essentially given for free, then made part of a business model that includes fees to authors, with fairly high profit margins, that&#8217;s a point of concern.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system can work, he said, but it “feels out of balance to me right now.” With such high APCs, “it doesn’t feel right to me to put my effort into that system currently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s still deciding where to draw the line on journals he will or will not support by editing or peer reviewing, but said shifting his donated service work towards nonprofit, society-associated journals with lower fees made sense. “There’s more alternatives out there now than there used to be. We have to take a hard look at the value we’re getting for the money we’re paying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tolley has decided to stop editing or reviewing articles for journals published by Wiley or the other major scientific publishers, and avoid submitting her own work to them when possible, “because they’re getting free content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of her coauthors don’t agree with that stance, so as a compromise, the group will not pay open access fees for a current submission to a major publisher’s journal, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To change the system, it has to be everyone who buys into this and says ‘No, I’m not going to pay that much money or work for free,’” Tolley said. “The majority of people have to do this, stop sending content to them, stop reviewing, stop editing. That’s the only way.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS is one of eight signatories on this letter. It was sent to Congress last week and posted publicly today (August 7, 2023).</p>



<p>Dear Chairwoman Granger and Subcommittee Chairman Rogers,</p>



<p><strong>RE: Response to House Appropriations Committee release of the Fiscal Year 2024 bill for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee<sup>1</sup></strong></p>



<p>In our capacity as representatives of leading fully Open Access research publishers and Open Science platforms, we submit our objection to the draft language<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;in the Subcommittee&rsquo;s FY24 spending bill<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;that&nbsp; blocks implementation&nbsp; of the Office of Science and Technology Policy&rsquo;s (OSTP) August 2022 guidance to make federally funded research freely available without delay.<br><br>As a group of global publishers, we share a single aim &ndash; the transition to fully open scientific communication for the benefit of all parts of society. We believe the restriction of funds as outlined in Sec 552 of the bill is detrimental to this goal. We strongly support the OSTP guidelines which we believe represent a significant policy advancement for global scientific and academic research.<br><br>If enacted, the current Appropriations Bill will prevent American taxpayers from seeing the societal benefits of the more than $90 billion in scientific research that the U.S. government funds each year, as most of the research remains locked behind publishing paywalls. And it will remove the current requirement for commercial publishers to adapt their business models to make public access to science fair. Science for the few who can access it &ndash; as opposed to the many who pay for it &ndash; is inefficient as scientific or governmental policy.</p>



<p>The political and societal move towards Open Science is well established as the demand for access to all publicly funded research intensifies. The retention of the 12-month embargo, as the Appropriations Bill stipulates, is a retrograde step within the global context of research and access to scientific literature.<br><br>As part of an established ecosystem of publishers, funding organizations, and governmental and scholarly institutions, we have seen prominent examples of the collaborative advancement of Open Science:</p>



<ul><li>The world&rsquo;s largest subscription publishers were transitioning to open policies for years prior to the OSTP announcement, in accordance with the principles of Plan S<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and alongside the organizations of cOAlition S.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;These efforts have received strong support from the Association of Research Libraries,<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;academic societies, and individual researchers.</li><li>Funders such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;have already limited or removed embargoes as a part of their funding mandates.</li><li>Longstanding governmental efforts, such as the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative,<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;increasingly rely on making published results of federally funded research more openly available to researchers and the public.</li></ul>



<p>The United States is a global scientific leader. The inclusion of the current language in relation to Sec 552 would be a block on the advancement of US research and its influence within the international scientific community.</p>



<p>We would be happy to work with the Committee to develop alternative language that maintains the existing direction of Open Science policy and scientific freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Microtektites found in Caribbean may shed light on tektite origin </strong>—<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/microtektites-found-caribbean-may-shed-light-tektite-origin"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 11, 1973</p>



<p>Though their origin remains a mystery to scientists, huge strewn fields of tektites have been found in widely separated areas of the world&#8230;. Microtektites have now been found in the Caribbean, and the characteristics of these newly found specimens may ultimately shed some light on the question of tektite origin….</p>



<p>Some believe that the tektites come from the moon. They feel that tektites were formed when an asteroid hit the moon, splashing droplets of molten rocks so high that they escaped the moon&#8217;s gravity and fell to Earth. However, mass spectrographic analysis of lunar samples shows that elements in the lunar crust are far different from tektites. The tektites are more like the elements in the continental crust of the Earth itself. [Planetary scientist Billy P. Glass] feels that if the parent material of [newfound] microtektites can be determined … the discovery of the origin of the glassy objects might quickly follow suit.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Glass surmised that these geologic curiosities have earthly origins, based on his and his colleagues’ analyses of the North American strewn field — a blanket of glassy particles that covers much the southeastern United States and Caribbean and dates to about 35 million years ago. But it took another 20 years for researchers to identify the source.</p>



<p>In 1994, tektites and concentric fault lines in southern Virginia revealed an 85-kilometer-wide impact crater under Chesapeake Bay. <em>Science News</em> reported that &#8220;a structure this size would rank as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/large-meteorite-scar-identified-virginia">the largest crater in the United States</a>&#8221; and would be among the largest on Earth (<em>SN: 8/20/94</em>). What’s more, when the space rock slammed into our planet, the collision created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangled-microfossils-may-mark-impact-sites">intense seismic waves that bent microfossils</a> into odd shapes, scientists reported nearly a decade later (<em>SN: 6/11/03</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together with evidence from Earth’s three other major strewn fields, the findings helped confirm that tektites form when a bolide slams into our planet with enough force to blast liquified chunks of Earth&#8217;s crust into the atmosphere. These chunks then harden into raindrop-, barbell- and ravioli-shaped particles as they fall back to the surface.</p>



<p>So far, researchers have linked three of the four major strewn fields with impact craters. The North American strewn field is tied to the Chesapeake crater in Virginia, the central European strewn field is associated with the Ries crater in Germany, and the Ivory Coast strewn field originates from the Bosumtwi crater in Ghana. The holdout is the Australasian strewn field, which is the largest known and covers about 10 percent of Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Scientists recently got a break in the case. Analyses of tektites found in Thailand and other geologic evidence as well as computer simulations suggest a probable source. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1904368116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2-kilometer-wide meteorite struck Laos about 800,000 years ago</a> and flung debris across Asia, Australia and Antarctica, scientists reported in 2020 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. </p>



<p>The resulting crater, which may be about 13 kilometers wide by 17 kilometers long, was eventually buried under volcanic material, the team contends. Verifying this hypothesis will require drilling through lava fields to see if the rocks underneath show melting and shattering — both hallmarks of an impact.</p>



<p>To a collector, the curiosities found around an impact crater are full of wonder and poetry. To a planetary scientist, these small pieces of evidence may yet open big windows into Earth’s geologic past.</p>

<p>The authors of a response to an article critiquing the use of the term “terminal anorexia” retracted their letter last month after receiving major backlash from researchers, healthcare providers, and people with eating disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">Regardless of inequities in care, terminal anorexia nervosa exists: a response to Sharpe et. al</a>,” which defended the use of the term, was published May 20 in the <em>Journal of Eating Disorders</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter was a response to “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00791-2">Inaccessibility of care and inequitable conceptions of suffering: a collective response to the construction of “terminal” anorexia nervosa</a>,” an article published earlier in the month in the same journal by researchers with lived experiences of eating disorders<em>.</em> The article outlined methodological problems with the criteria for diagnosis of a “terminal eating disorder” put forward in “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00548-3">Terminal anorexia nervosa: three cases and proposed clinical characteristics,</a>” a previous paper by two of the authors of the response letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The response was retracted on July 17. Its retraction note reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127677"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have retracted this article following discussions with multiple stakeholders. The authors offer their deepest apologies for the distress and the unintended negative impact of this piece.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original response is no longer available online but can be viewed on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230520194241/https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">archived version</a> of the page. </p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Joel Yager, the first author of the retracted response, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We retracted the letter following conversations with involved and affected parties after we better understood how they were impacted by our language in this response letter. But please understand that we remain dedicated to continuing to help encourage compassionate and critical conversations about this patient population.&nbsp; We stand by our advocacy for the rare yet highly deserving population of adults who cannot survive their anorexia nervosa and thus deserve the full and compassionate care that anyone with a terminal illness is due.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response letter prompted immediate backlash online, with James Downs <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297">tweeting</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

In my view this is borderline an abuse of a publication platform and it’s hard to know how to respond without giving this harmful construct oxygen. <a href="https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD">https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD</a></p>&mdash; James Downs (@jamesldowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Downs, who is a psychological therapist, researcher, and a person with a longstanding eating disorder, wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Aside from some of the arguments made, the tone and personal nature of the response disturbed me the most. For instance, the insinuation that authors with lived experience of the subject are less aware of the realities of the deaths of patients with anorexia than clinicians and academics was highly condescending, I was particularly concerned that the response appeared to make a psychological interpretation of Sharpe et al.&#8217;s argument as a product of the &#8220;anorexic voice&#8221;, which felt to me like a misuse of clinical authority, publicly evoking the supposed-psychopathology those within a vulnerable population as a rhetorical device.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Others also felt the letter did not address the main points of the article to which it was responding. Sam Sharpe, the first author of that article, wrote in an email to Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publication by Yager et al. 2023 did not engage with the core components of our thesis and appeared to constitute an attempt to undermine the credibility of our team and other lived experience researchers that, without supporting evidence, likely doesn’t have a place in academic discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Scout Silverstein, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, told Retraction Watch that they and the other authors of the article agree that there are rare situations in which anorexia is deadly, and that people in this situation deserve compassion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Many of us agree that a fraction of people diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa will experience a critical stage of illness that may lead to death, and that those people deserve death with dignity. Our concerns about the original paper by Gaudiani et al. are its methodological flaws, failure to account for systemic inequities, and its lack of foresight in understanding the implications of introducing this diagnostic criteria in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the authors offer an apology in the retraction notice, Marissa Adams, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, pointed to an article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/anorexia-right-to-die-terminal-mental-health"><em>The Guardian</em></a> in which Jennifer Gaudiani, an author on both papers advocating for establishing criteria for “terminal anorexia,” said, “I know for a fact that this advocacy is correct and that these individuals deserve to be cared for compassionately at the end of their lives.”</p>



<p>The co-editors in chief of the journal, Phillipa Hay and Stephen Touyz, did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selene Cary, publishing director of fully open access journals at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article was retracted at the request of the authors, after they raised concerns about potential unintended negative impacts of the correspondence following discussions with multiple stakeholders. We took the concerns raised very seriously and concluded that retraction and removal of the correspondence from the journal website was the most appropriate and responsible action to take.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-human-body-climate">Extreme heat taxes the body in many ways. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded. It could even be the hottest month in human history.</p>



<p>And it’s just one in a chain of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">broken heat records</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>). A record-breaking heat wave is still lingering in the U.S. Southwest. In 2020, temperatures jumped to 38° Celsius in Siberia, marking the highest ever recorded in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context">the Arctic Circle</a> (<em>SN: 7/01/20</em>). Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have taken place in the last decade. &nbsp;</p>





<p>That heat has tested the limits of our very bodies to tragic effect: In 2003, an estimated 70,000 people died from a European heat wave. In 2022, another heat wave there <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused some 62,000 deaths</a>. Thousands more have died in other extreme heat events, and even more have suffered heat illness or injury.</p>



<p>The human body can adapt to heat, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">but only to a certain point</a>, research has shown (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>“The body works quite hard to keep the core body temperature within a pretty narrow range,” says Kristie Ebi, who researches climate change and health at the University of Washington in Seattle. “If you can&#8217;t cool down that core body temperature, then your cells and your organs start being affected.”</p>



<p>Sustained heat waves <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(21)01208-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place our bodies under strain</a>, which can set off a cascade of effects that can lead to permanent injury or death, Ebi and colleagues wrote in a 2021 review in the <em>Lancet</em>. Heat waves are also getting more humid, limiting our ability to cool down, and nights are growing hotter, cutting into the time we might rest and recover. Both these trends undercut our ability to adapt to rising heat.</p>



<p>While people have ways to keep themselves and their communities safe, heat risks will only increase with rising temperatures, researchers say. Here’s what extreme heat and high humidity do to the body — and how you can protect yourself.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Humid heat waves, hot nights</h4>



<p>The body has two main pathways to keep cool. First is sweating. As body temperature rises, sweat glands in the skin release salty water out of pores. That water absorbs heat as it evaporates, cooling you off.</p>



<p>At the same time, the body redirects blood toward the skin surface by dilating blood vessels just under the skin and pumping the heart harder, which is why many people look flush when they’re hot. This allows the blood to better disperse the heat to the surrounding air.</p>



<p>Within a certain range, these systems work in concert to keep your internal body temperature within a safe window, usually around 37° Celsius. Unfortunately, Earth isn’t just getting hotter; it’s getting hotter in ways that are harder for our bodies to handle.</p>



<p>Climate change is spurring <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">heat waves that are not only hotter</a> and longer but, crucially, more humid (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>). “It’s becoming more dangerous because the humidity is acting as a barrier to how we cool ourselves,” says Rachel Cottle, who researches thermoregulation at Penn State. Since humid air is full of water, sweat doesn’t evaporate like it would in drier climates. So instead of cooling us off, the sweat sticks to the skin, and the heart must work even harder to compensate by pushing blood away from our core.</p>





<p>Even nights aren’t offering much of a break. Usually, nighttime is much cooler than daytime, which allows the body to shed heat at night. But global nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime ones. And as nights get warmer, the heart must work harder.</p>



<p>Hotter nights also cut into our sleep, says Kelton Minor, a data scientist at Columbia University who studies climate risks. “Across seasons, demographics and different climate contexts, warmer outside temperatures consistently erode sleep.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00209-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332222002093%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2022 study of global sleep behaviors</a>, Minor and his colleagues found that on random, hot nights “individuals slept less, took longer to fall asleep and woke up earlier” compared with cooler nights, he says. Other research has linked poor sleep to decreased cardiovascular health and increases in the risk of injury, anxiety, depression or even gun violence and suicide, Minor says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The dangers of high heat</h4>



<p>The combined forces of increased heat, higher humidity and hotter nights tax the systems that cool our bodies. And when it stays too hot for too long, things can start to go haywire.</p>



<p>Pushing that blood toward the skin forces the heart to work harder while simultaneously reducing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Over several hours, this can lead to oxygen shortages in the heart and, eventually, heart failure.</p>



<p>This intense strain helps explain why cardiovascular failure is responsible for around half of the deaths among older people during heat waves, Ebi says. The other half happens when other organs, especially the lungs, fail under the stress of handling the heat, in part from lack of oxygen. Usually, these risks pop up in people with preexisting conditions such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>



<p>These risks are especially high if the body can’t keep its temperature stable. In that case, the body’s core temperature begins to crawl upward to dangerous levels. When a person’s internal temperature reaches around 38° C, they can experience heat exhaustion, which can lead to faintness, headache, dizziness and heavy sweating.</p>



<p>Left unchecked, heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke. Here, body temperature pushes past 40° C. The heat can kill cells and interfere with organ function. Symptoms include skin that is hot and dry, delirium and even seizures. Without immediate intervention, heat stroke can lead to organ failure, permanent injury and death.</p>



<p>Even sweating can have its risks. If you don’t drink enough water while sweating, your body begins to get dehydrated. Dehydration can thicken the blood, putting even more strain on the heart. It also puts pressure on the kidneys, which need water to filter out toxins and waste from the body. In cases of chronic dehydration, as with some outdoor workers, it can lead to kidney disease.</p>



<p>Even in cases that aren’t fatal, some research suggests heat-related injury can lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935107000163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years of increased risk</a> of heat injury or death.</p>



<p>While these symptoms and their outcomes may seem dire, “these mechanisms play out over hours,” Ebi says. “It’s not instantaneous.” People often begin to feel symptoms well before they end up in an emergency, she says. Mortality doesn’t start peaking until around 24 hours after a heat wave starts.</p>



<p>This means that, often, there’s time to act and help prevent the worst outcomes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to stay safe</h4>



<p>“Almost every heat-related death is preventable,” Ebi says. “People shouldn’t be dying from heat waves.” Preventing those deaths takes a mix of personal and societal actions to keep those who are most vulnerable safe.</p>



<p>Individuals should stay well hydrated in high heat. They should also turn on air conditioning if it’s available or, if possible, find a cooling center or public location with air conditioning. Cottle also recommends staying inside and avoiding vigorous activity during the hottest hours of the day. Putting a cool towel on your neck, using fans in humid heat or dipping your hands or feet in a cold-water bath can also help you keep cool, she says.</p>



<p>These tips may have particular relevance to those most at risk, either because they are less able to cool down or more susceptible to injury if they overheat. This includes adults over 65, newborns, pregnant people, individuals on certain medications and people with heart and lung conditions.</p>



<p>Some may also be put at increased risk due to their location or occupation. People who are unhoused and outdoor laborers may not have the option to go inside during the hottest part of the day. Poor urban neighborhoods, which tend to have many dark surfaces and relatively few trees, tend to be hotter, including at night, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">putting the people who live there at increased risk</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>). And globally, people living in warmer, humid climates, such as Southeast Asia, are at higher risk than those living elsewhere.</p>



<p>To help alleviate these risks, there are a few steps that local governments can take, such as implementing early warning systems that notify residents of upcoming heat waves, Ebi says. Or officials can require roofs that naturally cool buildings. White or light-colored paint, for example, reflects heat, while “green roofs” with plants on top can cool off buildings as they evaporate water into the air. Cooling infrastructure like trees throughout a city and air conditioning run by clean power to avoid contributing to greenhouse gas emissions would also help, Minor adds.</p>



<p>Some of these suggestions are starting to become reality. In the United States, cities such as Los Angeles, Denver and Washington, D.C., now require some new buildings to have light-colored or green roofs.</p>



<p>Additionally, Ebi says, the world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help limit the climate extremes that can be most fatal. “Heat is an all-of-society issue,” she says, “and needs an all-of-society approach to protect the most vulnerable to make sure that people have access to the services they need.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2023/08/04/so-youre-an-academic-who-wants-to-help-with-the-climate-crisis/">So you’re an academic who wants to help with the climate crisis? </a></h4>

              
                <p>With the hottest days in recorded history, oceans reaching 100°F, droughts, and wildfire air turning the sky orange, it takes little more than walking out your door to be reminded of the ongoing climate crisis we are experiencing. As an academic, you may understand why this is happening. You may also be frightened, angered, or depressed about it. But <strong><em>you may fall short of knowing all that you personally can do about it</em></strong>. If so, this article is for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step is to learn the basic mantra of tackling climate change:<strong> It’s happening. It’s us. We can fix it. </strong>That is: the world is undeniably warming, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, and we have a variety of methods for reducing those emissions and adapting to the unavoidable changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you can guess,<strong> it’s incredibly important that you act</strong>. The effects are already here and already troubling. But there is a lot more and far worse damage on the horizon that we can prevent by acting now. Every fraction of a degree matters. Every ounce of avoided emissions helps. And many of the needed solutions have secondary benefits, like cleaner air and cheaper energy. To serious people, there is therefore no space for doomerism or complacency. An incredible amount of necessary change is already happening, driven by people like you who care about fixing this problem, and<strong> they need your help </strong>to do even more.</p>



<p>What an academic can do ranges from the universal—personal actions anyone can take as a consumer and citizen—to the specific—use of hard-won expertise to advance technology and practice. I will cover the full range here, but, fair warning, <strong><em>I am going to try to convince you to change what you work on</em></strong>.</p>



<p>No matter what options you choose, to make the most impact, you will have to be bold. <strong>You will need to do things that haven’t been done before</strong>—things that aren’t the norm, or part of the typical academic path. Things that some people who don’t understand the situation as well as you might even think are <em>weird</em>. But that’s ok, because doing research and discovering new knowledge is inherently about working on the edge of what is known and comfortable. If you can forge new paths in your research, you can forge new paths in your personal and professional life as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unprecedented action is needed because we are facing unprecedented conditions. Imagine you were conducting a study in your field and saw these kind of outliers:</p>

<p>It would make you sit up and take notice.</p>



<p>For the past century or so, we have been conducting a large-scale experiment (that did not get IRB approval&#8230;) on our planet and our civilization, and the data are coming in with strong results. <strong>We are in a new era and a new world</strong>. The way systems functioned and how people behaved before this period of climate upheaval is not a relevant guide for how things should be done in this new era. We have to be different. You have to be different. As <a href="https://alexsteffen.substack.com/p/old-thinking-will-break-your-brain">Alex Steffan</a>, a writer who focuses on how to grapple with a rapidly evolving world in crisis, wrote “Being native to now demands <em>finding</em> insight, not just receiving it.”</p>



<p>In addition to being bold and creative, to have the most impact, you need to be a “<strong>force multiplier</strong>”. For every action you take, try to get 10 other actions out of it. This can be done by getting whole systems you have control over to change or by convincing other people to make the same changes you are making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>So what can you do from where you are now&#8230;</strong></p>



<p>As an academic, there are levers you can pull that will help reduce emissions and change the expectations and standards in your field. Much of the tips provided here come from Anne Urai and her colleagues whose extensive efforts help academics, and (neuro)scientists in particular, act on the climate crisis. <strong>Check out their </strong><a href="https://anneurai.net/green-neuroscience/"><strong>papers and videos</strong></a><strong> for more information.</strong></p>



<p>First, you have certain affordances due to your <strong>position within a university</strong>. Universities are large systems that can play important roles in their communities and even internationally. Working with (or putting pressure on) your university to take bold and necessary action is one way to be a force-multiplier. Resources that are particularly relevant on university campuses are <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/04/28/divestment-gains-some-colleges-can-it-spread-where-oil-rules">campaigns to divest from fossil fuels</a>, the work of your sustainability office (these can sometimes be hubs for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing">greenwashing</a>, but it is your job to make sure they are not by offering input), and activist organizations like <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/">Sunrise Movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Efforts to change university policies are also part of a general movement of people lobbying their employers for climate action under the notion that “every job is a climate job”. General resources for climate action at work include this <a href="https://drawdown.org/publications/climate-solutions-at-work">Project Drawdown guide</a> and the UK-based <a href="https://www.workforclimate.org/">Work for Climate</a> organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also do an accounting of the <strong>emissions that come from your research</strong>. Think about materials used, the <a href="https://climateaction.tech/">energy needed for computing power</a>, and the emissions that come from flying to conferences. To make changes in these areas, you may need to: petition companies to offer more sustainable products, ask your university about where the energy for computing clusters comes from, or lobby your academic societies to offer distributed conferences (either through several local hubs or remote virtual participation like <a href="https://conference.neuromatch.io/">neuromatch</a>). <a href="https://www.mygreenlab.org/">MyGreenLab</a> and the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/leaf-laboratory-efficiency-assessment-framework">Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework</a> may be good starting points. But in general, be creative. When you find lower carbon alternatives to things you use and do regularly, make sure to <strong><em>share your knowledge</em></strong>, like Anne has in her <a href="https://anneurai.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/rae-et-al-2022-climate-crisis-and-ecological-emergency.pdf">publications for neuroscientists</a>. This makes you a force multiplier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also consider<strong> what you teach</strong>. The causes of, effects from, and solutions to the climate crisis touch nearly every topic taught at a university. Teaching the physical science behind climate change is just as important as explaining the psychological tendencies that prevent action or the economic incentives needed for change. Try developing a new course on “Climate Change and X” for your department (for example, I teach <a href="https://lindsay-lab.github.io/teaching/#machine-learning-for-climate-change-spring-2023">Machine Learning for Climate Change</a> as part of the Data Science major at NYU). Or at least see where in your existing lectures a connection to climate change and its solutions can be made. Not only does this open the eyes of students to how their interests connect to this global problem, it also normalizes talking about it and may encourage them to focus their career on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professors, scientists, and academics are usually considered respected members of the community and therefore <strong>communicating from a place of authority</strong> can also be a useful option. Writing op-eds, appearing on podcasts, or helping <a href="https://scaan.net/">provide input for policy efforts</a> are ways academics can contribute to the conversation. <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-byzb-0s23">Research on how to communicate on climate has provided many tips</a>. In general, this communication can be particularly effective for targeted audiences, for example when commenting on how green efforts on your campus will be beneficial to the local community. Many scientists already engage in various forms of outreach, and including discussion of the climate crisis in these activities can be an easy way to get others talking. Scientists can even consider<a href="https://scientistrebellion.org/ways-to-join/"> joining Scientist Rebellion</a> to participate in coordinated action and activism. Getting the word out and normalizing the idea of taking climate action can be a force multiplier (for example, I’m force multiplying right now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>But you can also change what you do</strong></p>



<p>An academic’s identity can be very tightly wound up with their area of expertise. To suggest that someone change what they work on can be shocking, offensive even. But <a href="https://80000hours.org/">what you do during your working hours determines in large part the impact you have on this world</a>. If you want to increase your effort and expand your impact, <strong><em>pivoting your research to a climate-relevant topic is a great choice.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This pivot will admittedly be easier for some areas of expertise than others, but you may be surprised by the overlap in skills and knowledge that you have and what is needed for some specific corner of the climate crisis response. As mentioned above, it’s difficult to find a university department that has no relevant connection to climate change, and forging new connections can be incredibly important as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I <a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2022/10/19/an-introduction-to-the-lindsay-lab-what-we-are-researching-and-why/">wrote previously</a> about my change from pure neuroscientist to neuroscientist/remote-sensing-of-climate-impacts-scientist. Did I think when I got my PhD in computational neuroscience that I’d be analyzing satellite data as a professor or developing content for a <a href="https://academy.climatematch.io/">course on computational climate science</a>? Of course not. But entering this new field has been exhilarating and expansive. It also gives me clear purpose and a place to put my energy when the news has me frustrated or depressed. And it provides me the time and space to stay up-to-date on climate topics, which otherwise would be a job of its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an academic (especially if you are a tenured one), <strong>you have an uncommon degree of freedom</strong> in what you pursue. You also have a useful set of meta-skills—the ability to survey complicated literature, teach yourself new things, and manage multi-faceted research projects—that have value even outside of the domain you learned them in. This puts you in a rare position to explore and build and forge and test across a range of topic areas, and guide students into these areas as well. If you have the desire to make an impact on the climate crisis, don’t let the traditions of academia or a fear of what might come hold you back. <strong>Use the freedom and skills you have to do what you think is right</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how do you figure out the best topic areas for you? If you’re a novice, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709837/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg/">The Climate Book</a> is a decent place to start; it is a series of expert-authored essays that together provide a thorough lay of the land. Solutions-oriented frameworks like <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> and the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> can also point you to concrete areas that need attention. There are a <a href="https://unfccc.int/blog/5-climate-action-podcasts-you-should-be-listening-to">host of podcasts</a> to provide informal introductions to areas of interest and the people working on them; I prefer <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann">Catalyst</a> and <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/media/podcast">My Climate Journey</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also highly recommend joining the <a href="https://workonclimate.org/">Work on Climate</a> Slack. This is a very large community of people either working on, or hoping to work on, climate change problems. It was started with the explicit goal of getting people from all backgrounds into climate work. It was a big influence on me as I made my transition and provided several concrete opportunities. <strong><em>The community of people working on climate is also incredibly welcoming.</em></strong> You can even join the #role-academics channel, which I created to help shepard academics through this process!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to skill up with some online courses check out <a href="https://academy.climatematch.io/">Climatematch Academy</a>, <a href="https://airminers.org/learn">Airminers</a> (on carbon dioxide removal), <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/summer_school">Climate Change AI summer school</a>, or a wide variety of options on websites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=climate%20change">Coursera</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re currently at a university, see what kind of climate work is already going on and who is doing it. Ask to attend meetings and seminars and see what kind of help you can offer or if your colleagues have any pointers to resources that are a good match for you. Some universities, like <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/office-of-the-provost/current-priorities/climate-change.html">NYU</a>, have established clusters of climate research and are even aiming to fund it more. Columbia University has an <a href="https://www.climate.columbia.edu/">entire school dedicated to climate change</a>, which accurately reflects the importance of the problem and its highly interdisciplinary nature. If your university doesn’t have any hubs of climate work, make one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, you don’t have to completely abandon your past work and go 100% on climate change (though please do if you’d like!). You can explore on the edges at first, dipping a toe into a new topic and see how it feels before taking a deeper plunge.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>You may also conclude that you want to leave academia&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For all its perks, academic work can sometimes feel like fighting with one hand tied behind your back; resources can be sparse and the chance to truly directly create something or make change can be hard to come by. If you want to leave academia, there are many resources that will help you make this switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, know that you are in good company. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/academics-leaving-climate-tech-startups">Many academics</a> have left their university to start or join companies working on climate solutions. <strong>Companies are usually happy to find smart and motivated people who want to work on their problems.</strong> So all you have to do is convey that interest and know how to market your skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent years have seen a healthy increase in acknowledgement of the fact people with PhDs end up in other jobs. Many resources exist to teach former academics <strong>how to identify their skills and passions outside of the ivory tower </strong>and get a job that suits them. Such resources include <a href="https://fromphdtolife.com/">From PhD to Life</a> and <a href="https://www.whatcanyoubewithaphd.com/">What You Can Be with a PhD</a> and a variety of articles and conversations under the heading of “<a href="https://twitter.com/altacchats">alt-ac</a>”.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Thinking of starting your own company?</em></strong> Great! <strong>The world needs radically new ideas and ways of doing things as we undergo a massive climate transition.</strong> <a href="https://climatefounder.org/">Climate Founder</a> provides resources for entrepreneurs and <a href="https://subak.org/about">Subak</a> provides assistance and funding especially for non-profits. If you are still at a university, there may be a Tech Ventures office responsible for helping academics found start-ups. Funding agencies, like the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps/about-teams">NSF</a>, also have programs to get scientist’s ideas into the real world. And you can check out the <a href="https://leonardomassa.notion.site/leonardomassa/50e190493e514b0ba2307f154d0aa3ac?v=c3d6fa96698a4879864335ee18f4401b">Scientist Founder Hub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The past few years has seen the development of quite a <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2023/01/10/the-year-ahead-for-climate-tech-funding">healthy climate startup space</a>. The money is flowing, the work exists and<strong> you are wanted there.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>And don’t forget personal action</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>most important personal action you can do is vote</strong>, and otherwise organize politically, perhaps even through targeted civil disobedience, to make sure that people who have the interest of future generations at heart get into power and make the right choices. US-focused political organizations include <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/">Citizen’s Climate Lobby</a>, <a href="https://www.lcv.org/">League of Conservation Voters</a>, and <a href="https://peoplesclimate.org/">People&#8217;s Climate Movement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other personal action is important too—without individual change we wouldn’t get collective change. Changes in consumption habits regarding meat alternatives and electric vehicles, for example, have allowed companies pioneering these climate-friendly options to thrive and sent a message to the makers of emissions-heavy products that they are no longer wanted.</p>



<p>Individual choices, while having a small but real impact on their own, are also important as <strong>force multipliers because of the conversations they start</strong>. When it comes up at dinner that I eat chicken and fish but tend to avoid dairy and beef, I can explain that this is due to the heavy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">carbon footprint of food that comes from cows</a>. Similarly, when I decline an invitation to an international conference out of a desire to avoid too many flights, this may spur others to consider their own avenues for action as well. In <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Us/Katharine-Hayhoe/9781982143848">Saving Us: A Climate Scientist&#8217;s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World</a>, Katharine Hayhoe discusses how climate-friendly behavior can spread by seeing others do the same, and how <strong>conversations amongst people with shared values are the most effective</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another personal action that matters is donating. This gives the people dedicating their life to important fights in courts and on the ground the resources they need to do their job well. My preferred organizations are: <a href="https://www.catf.us/">Clean Air Task Force</a>, <a href="https://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a>, <a href="https://www.conservation.org/">Conservation International</a>, <a href="https://carbonfund.org/">Carbon Fund</a>, and <a href="https://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>But just do it</strong></p>



<p>Whatever of the above options resonates with you, just <strong>make sure you do it</strong>. Do it now and do more later. There is no reason to wait, and there truly is not time to. Action begets action. And action begets conversations that beget more action. Start the ball rolling now and reap the benefits that you sow.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/a-day-with-aruk">A day with ARUK</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Katie Birditt reflects on her visit to Alzheimer’s Research UK's London Network Open Day and why making research accessible is so important.</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_f529397c09724a2d8a793715ed920b18~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Photo by Sincerely Media on Unsplash." ></figure><p><em>Like seeing the stars through a telescope for the first time. </em>Those words were spoken to Professor Frances Edwards at her stand as a member of the public observed a fluorescently dyed neuron under the microscope. This statement is a wonderful testament to the impact that Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) is having in engaging the public in a dialogue around dementia. </p>

<p>ARUK is one of the largest charities in the UK that funds dementia research and initiatives to promote greater understanding of the condition. The London Network Open Day they organised at UCL provided the public with a space to discuss some of the most exciting developments in the field with preeminent scientists. This event was suitable for anyone, from aspiring researchers and medical professors to families wanting to learn more about dementia. The day consisted of talks, poster stands, and activities designed to showcase the research being conducted at leading London institutions. Here I reflect on some personal highlights and hopefully encourage you to attend or get involved with your next local event.</p>
<h5>Posters </h5><p>My first stop was at the poster stands where an array of neuroscience research was being presented. Prior knowledge was not a prerequisite as all the studies’ key findings were highlighted in accessible, engaging ways. Before the day’s talks had even begun, I found myself on a whistle-stop poster tour of Alzheimer’s disease that took me from misbehaving proteins and faulty immune cells to blame for the disease to spatial transcriptomics (which has the misfortune of sounding more daunting than it really is!) Spatial transcriptomics is essentially a way of visualising and analysing RNA in the brain and identifying the ‘postcodes’ of these nucleic acids. DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids. However, double-stranded DNA <em>stores </em>genetic information while single-stranded RNA ensures that this information is used to make proteins. The transcription of DNA to RNA precedes protein production and can tell us a lot about abnormal processes in disease. When scientists mash brains up for experiments, information about where exactly the detected RNA has come from is inevitably lost. Spatial transcriptomics overcomes this problem by capturing RNA on barcoded surfaces where each barcode corresponds to a distinct tissue region. This ingenious approach allows for gene expression patterns to be compared across different parts of the brain. Spatial transcriptomics was unfamiliar terrain for me, but thanks to some friendly PhD students and post-doctoral researchers I enjoyed a great discussion about the potential of this method for neurodegenerative disease research. </p>
<blockquote>It was incredible to see researchers and the public come together</blockquote><h5>Public Engagement and Pipetting</h5><p>Each poster stand was accompanied by activities designed to start conversations around science. Abiding by journalism ethics and standards, I thought it was only right to give all the activities a go before writing about them! I applied some creative interpretation to images generated by fluorescent microscopy and put my pipetting ability to the test. It was a slightly surreal experience wielding a pipette and seeing a six-well plate outside its normal realm of the lab but once adjusted to the initial shock of this, I like to think some innate skills kicked in to warrant an impressive performance (disclaimer- no chemicals at all were involved in the participation of this activity, only some eager children and slightly competitive adults!) Who would have thought pipetting would be such an effective way of engaging the public and demystifying the inner workings of the lab. </p>
<h5>Presentations</h5><p>The talks encouraged the audience to consider various approaches to dementia research, management, and diagnosis.  Everything from the therapeutic potential of newly emerging drugs to the promise of digital biomarkers was discussed.  As someone who previously worked with rodent models to study Alzheimer’s, I was particularly intrigued by a talk from Professor Frances Edwards’, an academic at UCL. She talked about the relevance of improved mice models to understand Alzheimer’s disease. The use of animals in research is such a contentious topic, not only due to ethical considerations, but also because Alzheimer’s is highly unique to humans and therefore difficult to model accurately in mice. Moving away from a potentially flawed experimental paradigm where foreign genes are randomly integrated into rodent models and used to study disease progression, the Edwards lab conducts research on what’s known as knock-in mice. The older models had their place, but randomly inserting genes carries the risk of potentially confounding disruptions to other genes. These newer models in the Edwards lab are instead created through the <em>targeted </em>insertion of genes associated with developing Alzheimer's, allowing scientists to study important pathological relationships without impacting other gene expression. Professor Edwards and her team use these knock-in mice to investigate synaptic dysfunction in relation to the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s with the aim of discovering early disease-associated changes and identifying promising drug targets. </p>

<p>When speaking to Professor Edwards about the 2023 ARUK Network Open Day, she said her highlights were the “enlightening questions” from the public and the opportunity to “walk around and see the different displays that underline the wide variety of research going on across London”. I personally found it incredible to see researchers and the public come together, united on a shared quest to learn more about the devastating condition that is likely to affect us all in some way. It is easy to have a narrow overview of research, confining it to the realms of laboratories, academic journals, and symposiums. However, this ARUK event emphasised the importance of widely sharing research and making it accessible to those who will be impacted by it. As spatial transcriptomics shows us, information matters but context is important.</p><hr><p>This article was written by Katie Birditt and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/potential-giant-viruses-soil-microbiology">A fantastical world of potential giant viruses lurks beneath the soil</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant viruses may try out all sorts of funky lewks.</p>



<p>New images reveal the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.30.546935v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">varied — and sometimes whimsical — shapes</a> of hundreds of potential soil-dwelling giant viruses. One shape is dubbed “haircut” for its fibers that bristle like freshly buzzed hair. “Gorgon” has tubelike appendages snaking from its shell. And flaps poking out of “turtle” resemble the reptile’s head, limbs and tail, virologist Matthias Fischer and colleagues report June 30 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>These and other peculiar-looking shapes “clearly tell us that we&#8217;ve underestimated how structurally diverse these viruses are,” says Fischer, of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>





<p>Since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-giants-among-viruses">discovery of the first giant virus in 2003</a>, scientists collecting genetic material from the environment have uncovered a wide world of giant viruses (<em>SN: 3/21/18</em>). These viruses are roughly 10 to 50 times the diameter of viruses that cause the common cold. The genetic data suggest that giant viruses are diverse, widespread and abundant.</p>



<p>But genetics can’t tell us everything about a virus’s biology, says Steven Wilhelm, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. “We don’t know what we’re looking at, who it infects or what it could possibly be doing.”</p>

<p>The new work could help change that, Fischer says. Using transmission electron microscopy, his team analyzed about half a kilogram of soil from Harvard Forest in Petersham, Mass., to produce an image gallery of giant virus diversity — potentially.</p>



<p>Fischer is careful not to call the virus look-alikes “viruses” just yet. The researchers have seen the particles only with a microscope; they haven’t confirmed that the potential viruses can infect particular organisms.</p>



<p>Still, looking at the structures Fischer’s team identified, microbiologist Frederik Schulz of the Joint Genome Institute in Berkeley, Calif., says he’s “convinced that many of these are actual virus particles.”</p>



<p>Scientists can only speculate why giant viruses might form tubular, bristly or turtlelike appendages. They may help the virus infect a host or perhaps move through the environment, Fischer says. “It’s going to be a wild ride … to see what each of these structures do.”</p>



<p>Whatever function they may have, Fischer thinks even more peculiar shapes remain to be discovered. “If a handful of forest soil already contains so many different virus particles,” he says, “this is clearly just the very tip of the viral&nbsp;Mount&nbsp;Everest.”</p>

<p>A cancer researcher who admitted to faking data has pleaded guilty to attempted forgery in a case involving letters of recommendation he passed off as coming from his former supervisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Georgios Laliotis, a former postdoc at The Ohio State University, was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/22/fired-postdoc-faked-recommendation-letters-from-supervisor-osu-alleges/">charged with forgery</a> for allegedly creating a fake email address with the name of his PI, Philip Tsichlis, and using it to send two letters of recommendation to prospective employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis was later indicted for identity fraud, forgery, and telecommunications fraud, and pleaded not guilty to each count. </p>



<span id="more-127665"></span>



<p>On June 27, Laliotis <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laliotis-plea-1.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> to the lesser charge of attempted forgery, and prosecutors dropped the other charges. In lieu of six months of jail time, a judge <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laliotis-judgment.pdf">sentenced</a> Laliotis to one year of non-reporting probation, on the condition that Laliotis not contact Tsichlis and “not apply to take medical exams” for the next four years, or until the conviction is sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don Olsen, Laliotis’ lawyer, has not responded to our request for comment, nor has Laliotis.</p>



<p>Also in late June, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/26/fired-osu-postdoc-charged-with-forgery-admitted-to-faking-data-feds-say/#comments">announced findings</a> that Laliotis fabricated “data, methods, results, and conclusions” in three published papers and two applications for grant funding from the National Institutes of Health. The findings were based in part on Laliotis’ admissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tsichlis had <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">discovered the data manipulation</a> and asked journal editors to retract two papers after another scientist contacted him about being unable to replicate some of the results. He also alerted Ohio State’s research compliance office, which initiated an inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20220504-Laliotis-Preliminary-Inquiry-Report.pdf">preliminary inquiry report</a>, which we obtained through a public records request, the panel “​​determined that the allegation does have sufficient substance to warrant investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, an investigation did not proceed, a university spokesperson told us, because “an admission from the Respondent closed the matter prior to a final inquiry report being generated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inquiry examined one allegation: Laliotis falsified an image in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24795-1"><em>Nature Communications</em> paper</a> “by splicing two sequencing chromatograms together to generate a false U2AF2 RNA transcript lacking Exon 2.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel could not find sequencing data to match the falsified RNA transcript. Rather, an image showing the purported transcript “appeared to be manipulated in several ways.” The report concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such falsification could not occur by honest error as it was created by combining two separate chromatograms for it to appear as a single contiguous chromatogram.</p>



<p>The report states that Laliotis did not provide a written response to the report, and canceled a scheduled interview “due to his military service in Greece.” The report’s timeline indicates that a research integrity officer at Ohio State sent him a retraction form for the paper in <em>Nature Communications</em> on April 7, 2022. His sister returned the signed form a week later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was retracted last June, two weeks after we published our <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">initial story</a> about Tsichlis’ discovery and retraction requests, which he had sent the previous November. </p>



<p>The inquiry report also indicates that Laliotis’ postdoc position in Tsichlis’ lab ended on Feb. 28, 2021, contradicting the information in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/22-CRA-102730001.pdf">complaint</a> filed by an OSU police detective, which stated the university had terminated Laliotis “on or around November 30, 2021.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-children-health-risk">Climate change puts children’s health at risk now and in the future</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate-related environmental disasters have not let up this summer. Heat waves are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">roasting the United States, Europe, China</a> and North Africa (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>), while wildfires are raging in Canada and Greece. Choking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">smoke from the Canadian fires</a> has obscured skies throughout the United States (<em>SN: 7/12/23</em>).</p>



<p>This is harmful to everyone, but especially children. The United Nations Children’s Fund calls climate change a child rights crisis. The organization estimates that 1 billion children worldwide – <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/105376/file/UNICEF-climate-crisis-child-rights-crisis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of all children – are at extremely high risk of the effects of climate change</a>. This threatens the health of these children now and throughout their lives.</p>





<p>Children’s ongoing development from the fetal period through adolescence is one reason that they are particularly vulnerable to health harms from climate-related effects on the environment, says environmental health scientist Frederica Perera of Columbia University. She founded the <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health</a> in 1998. <em>Science News</em> talked with Perera about climate change and children’s health and well-being, the disparities in terms of who is at highest risk and why these early harms endanger health throughout life. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How does climate change’s effects on the environment, such as heat waves and wildfire smoke, affect children’s health?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: When we speak of the effects of climate change and air pollution on children, we really need to include the fetal period as well as infancy and childhood and even adolescence, because the brain and other systems are developing all through those periods.</p>



<p>There’s a multitude of health risks. Severe <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ppe.12834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heat is contributing to preterm births</a>, and it’s causing heat-related deaths and illnesses in infants and children. Children are also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23780231221135971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering from severe weather events</a>: they’re suffering physical injury and also psychological trauma. Longer <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013284118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollen seasons due to climate change</a> are causing more allergy and asthma. Asthma attacks are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502220/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased from breathing forest fire smoke</a>. There’s the issue of food insecurity and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905228116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunted growth due to drought</a> in certain areas of the world. Infectious diseases [spread by insects and other vectors are] increasing as <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2200092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticks and mosquitoes have extended</a> their range.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What are some of the physiological reasons that children are at higher risk than adults from the effects of climate change?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: First, there’s the very rapid and complex developmental programming during the fetal period, infancy and childhood, which is vulnerable to disruption by toxic pollutants, climate-related shocks and stressors. A second point is that infants and children don’t have the same fully functioning biologic defense mechanisms that operate in adults to protect them against toxic exposures.</p>



<p>[In terms of heat,] children have less ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control core body temperature during severe heat waves</a>. The young are dependent on us adults for hydration and for care when there are early indications of heat-related illness.</p>



<p>With respect to air pollution and smoke from forest fires, children are especially vulnerable because of increased exposure. They often spend more time outdoors. [Children have a larger lung surface area and so] breathe more air [per kilogram of] body weight [than adults]. [Children’s noses are less efficient at filtering inhaled] particles, so a higher proportion of these particles <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18097948/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penetrates deeply into the lungs</a>. Their narrow airways are more prone to effects of inflammation, and that results in constriction and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How does climate change affect children’s mental health?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: Climate change is affecting mental health both directly and indirectly. Children who experience severe storms and floods and wildfires show <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-020-01615-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated rates of symptoms of depression and also of post-traumatic stress disorder</a>.</p>





<p>But even if children haven’t directly experienced such a disaster, they’re being affected by climate anxiety. In a survey that covered 10 countries, more than 50 percent [of teens and young people] said they <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt very worried or extremely worried</a> about climate change, and this anxiety was negatively affecting their daily lives.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What disparities exist in terms of which children are at greatest risk from climate-related effects on the environment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: All children are vulnerable, but certain children are hurt first and worst, as we say. This is true globally [in terms of low-income countries compared with high-income countries], and also here in the United States, where communities of color and communities of low income have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04190-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately higher exposure to air pollution</a> as well as to severe heat and extreme weather events. If you take the United States, for example, polluting sources like major highways, bus and truck depots, industrial plants and power plants are disproportionately located in and near communities of color and communities of low income. Discriminatory policies like <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1759127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redlining have created urban heat islands</a>.</p>



<p>We see that disproportionate exposure combined with poverty and racism are contributing to the disparities in disease rates. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthmadata/Child_Prevalence_Race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asthma prevalence</a> and <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infant mortality</a> in Black children are twice the rates seen in white children. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preterm birth rate is 50 percent higher</a> [among Black women compared with white women].</p>



<p><em><strong>SN</strong></em><strong>:</strong> <strong>What do these early health harms to children mean for their lives ahead?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: We know that there are long-term effects of these early harms and damages. Respiratory conditions frequently persist. Children with severe or <a href="https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-018-0890-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistent asthma are at increased risk</a> of permanent air flow obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Reduced <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30064-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual functioning associated with air pollution</a>, and also <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/7/e009330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malnutrition prenatally or in early life</a>, affects the ability to learn, and that affects the ability to earn and contribute to society. Stress and trauma from shocks of climate change and other adverse events that are <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced at a young age can affect mental health</a> throughout life.</p>



<p>We should be thinking about the long-term implications of these early health harms from climate change and air pollution. When we look then at policies and other interventions to eliminate fossil fuel emissions, we see enormous health and associated economic benefits. Children will be the greatest beneficiaries.</p>

<p>If Retraction Watch were the child of Jewish parents – which happens to be the case – it would be celebrating its bar mitzvah this year. Yes, that’s right, mazel tovs are in order: Retraction Watch turns 13 today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as the blog becomes some version of an adult, we have plenty to celebrate. This week, we published an <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-corrects-itself-right-a-scandal-at-stanford-says-it-doesnt/">op-ed in <em>Scientific American</em></a>. And here are highlights of the past 12 months:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">$250,000 grant from the WoodNext Foundation</a> that allowed us to hire another editor, Fred Joelving, who is already <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/frederik-joelving/">breaking stories right and left</a>.</li>



<li>The additional bandwidth got us back to partnering with other outlets. Since January, we’ve published investigations and other stories with <a href="https://undark.org/2023/05/31/in-the-death-of-an-iranian-scientist-hints-of-unchecked-strife/">Undark</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">Science</a>, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/09/retracted-suicide-risk-study-how-published/">STAT</a>, and the Flatwater Free Press (with <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/a-cornhusker-concussion-study-appeared-to-accurately-id-head-injuries-then-it-hit-a-brick-wall/">pickup by Nebraska Public Media</a>).</li>



<li>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104815">study published in Research Policy</a> &#8220;found that reporting retractions on RW significantly reduced post-retraction citations of non-swiftly retracted articles in biomedical sciences.&#8221; In other words, when Retraction Watch covers a retraction, the retracted paper is less likely to be cited.</li>



<li>The <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/">Retraction Watch Database</a> surpassed 40,000 retractions, which is three times as many as PubMed and multiples of other sources, and powers <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2119086119">scholarship</a> as well as retraction alerts in <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Wileys-Edifix-Integrates-with-the-Retraction-Watch-Database-to-Improve-Research-Integrity/default.aspx">Edifix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1458421915761221643">EndNote</a>, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/thirdiron/jan2021_newsletter-1414009">LibKey</a>, <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/blog-papers-announces-expanded-retraction-support/">Papers</a>, and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/">Zotero</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/08/02/introducing-arxivs-new-governance-model/">Introducing arXiv’s new governance model</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2022, arXiv embarked on a plan to reorganize its governance. We are happy to report that arXiv leadership, with significant input from its advisory board members, has finalized a new governance model. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/arXiv_bylaws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Bylaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went into effect on July 1, 2023. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the governance restructuring, the Member Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Board were retired, and three new Advisory Councils were created:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Editorial Advisory Council</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Editorial Advisory Council acts as the editorial board of arXiv. It organizes and monitors moderation of arXiv content. The former Subject Advisory Committees have been renamed Section Editorial Committees, and the chairs (also known as editors) of these committees are the regular members of the Editorial Advisory Council.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Institutions Advisory Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(IAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institutions Advisory Council represents the scholarly communications community and advises on topics such as issues related to publishing, standards, open access and open science; issues related to the arXiv membership program and policy; arXiv services, interoperability and advocacy to the community; user needs, metadata, technical and user trends, and other issues guiding the sustainability and success of arXiv. Institutions Advisory Council members must be affiliated with an arXiv member organization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Science Advisory Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(SAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science Advisory Council represents the scientific and research community of arXiv by advising on topics such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intellectual impact and relevance of arXiv, including aspects of significant expansions, high-level issues of standards, expansion in new fields/sections, novelties and changes in the production and dissemination of scholarly works, and impact across disciplines. Science Advisory Council members should be active researchers, be tenured or in a position with similar seniority/stability, be recognized experts in their field, and have had a leadership position and/or successful experience in advisory committees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inaugural chairs of the new councils have been appointed: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editorial Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ralph Wijers, Professor, University of Amsterdam</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Maureen Walsh, Scholarly Sharing Strategist and Associate Professor, The Ohio State University Libraries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Licia Verde, ICREA Research Professor, Universitat de Barcelona</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key difference in the new structure is the splitting of the former Scientific Advisory Board (which included a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mix of section chairs and scientific community members) into two councils–the SAC and the EAC–to better serve the arXiv community. The SAC will be focused on long-term policy and strategy, and the EAC will be responsible for policy and process specific to content moderation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The updated governance model is very important for our future success,&#8221; said arXiv Faculty Director Ramin Zabih. &#8220;I am grateful to all of the stakeholders who provided feedback throughout the process. Everyone involved in running arXiv looks forward to working with the new advisory councils as we navigate technological changes as well as the continuing evolution of the science communities that arXiv serves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new governance structure was put into place to position arXiv well as it seeks to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamline decision making and increase the operational effectiveness of arXiv</span></li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">The thymus withers away after puberty. But it may be important for adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious organ that’s most active in childhood might play a previously underappreciated role in adults.</p>



<p>In a study of almost 2,300 adults who underwent chest surgery, removing the thymus gland was associated with <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 3 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. The discovery pushes back on a long-held belief that the immune system organ is somewhat expendable in adulthood.</p>





<p>“This is a really important finding,” says immunologist Dong-Ming Su of the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, who was not involved in the work. Prior to this study, he says, “there was no direct evidence to demonstrate [the thymus’] importance in adults.”</p>



<p>The thymus resides in the chest between the lungs, right in front of and above the heart. In infants, the gland almost completely covers the heart. It pumps out immune cells called T cells, which detect foreign invaders that could cause illness.</p>



<p>But the gland’s activity dwindles after puberty, producing fewer new T cells as we age. Adults mostly rely on memory T cells, long-lived cells that rapidly produce specialized T cells in response to intruders the body has fought before. The thymus gradually wastes away and gets replaced by fat.</p>



<p>“It progressively becomes something that looks like more of a fatty blob,” says hematologist-oncologist David Scadden of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Doctors might excise an adult’s thymus if it contains an abnormal growth, to help alleviate an autoimmune disease or simply because it’s in the way during chest surgery, he says. “It’s often removed because it’s not thought to be very consequential.”</p>



<p>To look at consequences of getting rid of the gland, Scadden and colleagues examined health outcomes in 1,146 patients who had their thymus removed from 1993 to early 2020 at Mass General. The researchers compared those patients’ outcomes with those of an equal number of patients, matched for age, sex and race, who had undergone chest surgery within that time period but kept their thymus.</p>



<p>Within five years after surgery, 8.1 percent of thymectomy patients died compared with 2.8 percent of patients whose thymus remained intact. That means that removing the thymus gland was associated with nearly three times the risk of death from any cause in that timeframe.</p>



<p>Similarly, thymus removal was associated with an increased risk of cancer within five years; thymectomy patients had twice the rate of cancer as patients who kept their thymus. The increased cancer risk, Scadden says, might come from the immune system’s compromised surveillance capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a handful of thymus-free patients who developed cancer after surgery and whose blood was analyzed, their T cells seemed unable to identify as many varieties of trespassers compared with T cells from patients who retained their thymus and also developed cancer. Whether the T cells’ reduced repertoire in thymectomy patients led to cancer or was a result of cancer remains unclear, Scadden says.</p>



<p>In patients who didn’t have cancer, infection or an autoimmune disease before surgery, thymus removal was associated with a greater risk of developing an autoimmune disease within five years after surgery, the researchers found. Blood samples from about 20 people in each group hinted that thymectomy might be linked to immune system dysregulation.</p>



<p>“This is pretty striking data,” says immunologist Donna Farber of Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “You don’t often find these huge survival differences with these kinds of [retrospective] studies.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>But the study can’t explain why or how thymectomy is connected to increased rates of death or other negative outcomes. “We don’t know for sure whether the deleterious effects on health are due to the lack of producing new T cells or some other less well-defined function of the thymus,” Scadden says. And Farber suggests that the thymus removal procedure itself — unrelated to the immune system — could even be the cause.</p>



<p>Still, she says, &nbsp;the new work hints that “maybe even that little bit of active thymic tissue you have [is] playing some role.”</p>
