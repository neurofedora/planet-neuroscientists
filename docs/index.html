              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-mystery-illness-kennel-cough">Here are 5 questions about the mystery dog illness making news</a></h4>

              
                <p>In recent weeks, claims about a mysterious respiratory illness sickening dogs across the country have spooked pet owners.</p>



<p>Dogs with what veterinarians have dubbed “atypical kennel cough” show more persistent and severe symptoms than those caused by run-of-the-mill kennel cough: a coldlike condition caused by a grab bag of viruses and bacteria. Many ill dogs have failed or been slow to respond to existing treatments. Some have even died.</p>



<p>Efforts to pin down a culprit have so far yielded more questions than answers. That’s fed fears of a new contagion. When Michelle Hiskey’s dog Sheba fell ill, for instance, her friends and family members blew up her phone with texts, concerned about what some on social media branded “COVID for dogs.” Hiskey, a freelance writer in Decatur, Ga., is “not generally a worrier,” but the horror stories she heard did startle her, she says.</p>





<p>Experts, including those who had previously sounded alarm bells, now say there’s most likely a simple explanation behind the cases. Here’s what we know and what still remains unknown.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s different about this mystery dog illness?</h4>



<p>It’s not unusual for dogs to occasionally catch kennel cough, a chest infection that manifests most clearly in a honking cough, runny nose and sneezing. But beginning in late 2022 and surging the summer of 2023, more and more dogs seemed to be showing up to clinics, sicker than usual.</p>



<p>Cases of kennel cough are typically mild and resolve within a week or two. Dogs with atypical kennel cough can be feverish and fatigued on top of their other symptoms, and their symptoms can linger for several weeks. Taking antibiotics does not often lead to much improvement.</p>



<p>In some suspected cases, dogs have gone on to develop pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that in rare occasions can be deadly, says Mike Stepien, a spokesperson from the United States Department of Agricultural Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is aiding state laboratories with diagnostic testing.</p>



<p>For Sheba, who first began hacking and wheezing at the start of November, two rounds of the antibiotic doxycycline and temaril-p, an anti-inflammatory drug, have significantly reduced but not eliminated her symptoms. She needs to be symptom-free for seven days to be declared healthy, but she still hasn’t gone a full week without coughing. “I just keep starting the clock again,” Hiskey says.</p>



<p>It can be normal for dogs to respond poorly to treatment, says Colin Parrish, a virologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. No antiviral drugs exist to combat kennel cough, and antibiotics sometimes have middling efficacy.</p>



<p>The standard prescription from veterinarians is rest and time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How many cases are there?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure. No national program tracks diseases in dogs, making the count unclear, but so far, several hundred cases have been reported in over 16 states, from Rhode Island to California.</p>





<p>Oregon’s Department of Agriculture has launched a formal investigation into suspected cases of atypical kennel cough, counting more than 200 since August. In most states, however, reports remain anecdotal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s causing dogs to get sick?</h4>



<p>Scientists and public health officials do not yet know what is causing atypical kennel cough, but many doubt the cases all have one cause.</p>



<p>The small number of cases and the sporadic transmission patterns point away from a singular, highly contagious pathogen, says Jane Sykes, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.</p>



<p>A mixture of pathogens could instead be to blame, experts now say. A new bacterium or virus could be among them, but it’s unlikely to be the only or main contributor.</p>



<p>Tests for known pathogens such as canine parainfluenza virus or <em>Bordetella bronchiseptica</em> have come up negative, but by the time the dogs make it to a clinic, they are likely to have stopped shedding the pathogen (or pathogens) responsible for their illness. The uptick in severe kennel cough may be due to a “perfect storm” of factors, Sykes and several others argue.</p>



<p>Dog ownership has increased recently. The fraction of American households with at least one dog grew from <a href="https://www.avma.org/news/pet-ownership-rate-stabilizes-spending-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 to 45 percent between 2016 and 2022</a>, largely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, more than 65 million families now have dogs. At the same time, rates of vaccination have dropped for a variety of reasons, experts suspect, making pets more susceptible to disease.</p>



<p>Now, as employees return to the office and families travel for the holidays, pet dogs may increasingly end up spending stints in kennels and doggy day cares. Pathogens of all kinds can spread easily in those group settings, creating a nasty soup that poorly timed or poorly executed swabs may miss. Hiskey suspects her dog caught a bug at the dog park.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are scientists doing to solve the mystery of this illness?</h4>



<p>Veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Oregon, New Hampshire and Colorado are currently examining swabs collected from dogs with atypical kennel cough, but they have not reached definitive conclusions.</p>





<p>Researchers from the University of New Hampshire in Durham have <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a previously unknown bacterium</a> in a majority of 70 samples collected from dogs stricken ill in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But they have yet to grow the bacterium in the lab, or to <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test the idea that it’s a driver of disease</a>, a notice on the lab’s website says.</p>



<p>The UNH researchers could not detect the organism in tissue samples collected from dogs in 2018, long before the outbreak, but such a finding does not clarify the role the mystery bacterium plays — or does not play — in disease. The organism could be innocuous, or could worsen preexisting illness, rather than cause it.</p>



<p>The researchers are now examining more recent samples collected from Oregon, Colorado and other Midwestern states to see if they contain the bacterium, too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can dog owners do to protect their pets?</h4>



<p>Keeping pets up-to-date on their vaccinations can reduce the risk of kennel cough.</p>



<p>Limiting interactions with other dogs, particularly those that may be ill, can help as well. Outbreaks tend to cluster in dog kennels, day cares and parks — places where animals crowd together. There’s no reason to panic, experts say, or to dramatically alter plans. Small precautions should suffice.</p>



<p>If your dog does exhibit symptoms, particularly those that do not improve with time, it’s best to call your veterinarian.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2023/12/15/whole-genomes-from-the-population-of-the-faroe-islands/">Whole genomes from the population of the Faroe Islands</a></h4>

              
                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/IMG_0880_Faroe_Islands-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>Genetic population isolate </strong></p>
<p>Archaeological research suggests that the Faroe Islands were founded in two pre-Viking phases around 300-500 AD and 500-700 AD, before the Viking settlements in the 9th century.</p>
<p>This population is well-suited for genetic research because it was geographically isolated. Indeed, the current population of about 50,000 people is believed to descend from a low number of settlers, who thus had few opportunities to find a partner. This is called a bottleneck effect, which often leads to inbreeding from mating between close relatives.</p>
<p>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are mutations of single DNA-bases, A, C, G, or T, at specific positions in the DNA sequence as compared with a reference genome. Each person has over 3 million SNPs, and these are of great interest in genetic research.</p>
<p>People have two copies of chromosomes, one from each parent. Therefore, we inherit two identical or two different copies of each SNP. The two copies, denoted genotypes, are called homozygotes if the copies are identical and heterozygotes if the copies are different.</p>
<p>SNP heterozygosity <em>H </em>is a measure of genetic diversity. It is the number of heterozygous genotypes divided by the total number of genotypes. High and low <em>H </em>means, respectively, a high and low genetic diversity. It is desirable to have high <em>H </em>because a low genetic diversity and inbreeding can increase the risk of genetic diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic diversity and inbreeding </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09763-x">In this paper</a>, the whole genomes of a small sample of the population are analysed using bioinformatic methods. The results show that <em>H </em>is relatively high for individual samples because individuals have many private SNPs, likely of recent origin. On the contrary, <em>H </em>is low for the SNPs that are shared by the population and therefore are likely of older origin.</p>
<p>Long sequences of SNPs that mainly contain homozygous genotypes are called <em>ROHs </em>(runs of homozygosity). In the paper, <em>ROHs </em>are used to estimate the inbreeding in the Faroese population as compared to both modern and ancient European populations. The inbreeding of the Faroese population is high compared to European populations and population isolates. Thus, it has inbreeding which is more similar to ancient Europeans.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Two methods to estimate relatedness </strong></p>
<p>To estimate the relatedness between individuals, two methods based on whole genomes were investigated. One of the methods (KING kinship) cannot distinguish between ancient and recent relatedness. Therefore, all the supposedly unrelated participants seemed very closely related as siblings or parent-offspring relationships. However, using a method based on <em>ROHs</em>, the author is able to show that the high relatedness is of ancient origin.</p>
<p><strong>The bottleneck effect from the founding event </strong></p>
<p>Then a search for the bottleneck effect was carried out. An older genetic study of the Faroese population was unable to find such an effect. In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p>
<p>The higher limit of this estimate agrees with the oldest archaeological findings from the Faroe Islands, while the lower limit suggests that the founding event may have occurred about 2-3 centuries earlier than previously believed based on archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>After the founding event, the bottleneck effect increased from about 300 AD to 600 AD, where it was the highest. Thereafter, the bottleneck effect slowly decreased, most likely from an increase in the population size from the arrival of new settlers.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with the 1000 Genome Project </strong></p>
<p>Other results in this study were about ancestry and clustering (Multidimensional Scaling) as compared with the international <a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/">1000 Genome Project,</a> where whole genomes from several different populations were studied.</p>
<p>The Faroese results about ancestry showed that the study participants descended from founders of mainly European ancestry (&gt;99% probability) and possibly some admixed American ancestry (&lt;1% probability).</p>
<p>The study participants that cluster closest together are genetically most similar. The Faroese participants clustered all close together and distinctively away from the other populations but closest to the European and British populations of the 1000 Genome Project. Finally, the study showed that the Faroese people have many rare SNP variants. Such mutations are of great interest for genetic research.</p>

                <p><em>Following the launch of </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a><em> earlier this year, we sat down with Editor-in-Chief Hocine Cherifi to learn more about his vision for the journal and developments in the field</em> <em>he&rsquo;s keeping an eye on.</em> <br><br></p>

          <p><strong>What is your vision for </strong><strong><em>PLOS Complex Systems?</em></strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My vision for this journal is to create the richest community possible around emerging tools and techniques that will shape the future of our world. Complexity as a discipline exists with different meanings around the world and different overarching philosophies. With <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> I hope that we can facilitate these important conversations on what makes something &lsquo;complex&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; across traditional disciplines and the network community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p></p>



<p><strong>The journal has a broad, transdisciplinary scope, why is this important?</strong></p>



<p>Complexity is a field that transcends traditional boundaries&ndash;it is not uncommon to see a researcher study economic, social, or natural complex systems at once. As such, the journal must be able to accommodate the broad range of interests many researchers in this space have. When we bring that all together, we can learn from each other. We want <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> to be a space where researchers can connect and share approaches that they might not have discovered otherwise.</p>



<p>It is also a field that is growing rapidly, and this means more and more scientists are starting to use complex systems analysis tools. The journal must be accessible to people who consider themselves a biologist or sociologist, and encourage the diversity of perspectives and expertise that they bring to the community.</p>



<p>In this, I would like to highlight our commitment to constructive peer review. Building the journal&rsquo;s editorial board was an intensive and intentional process, and I am very grateful for the time they have lent us so far, and will continue to invest in the journal. Their expertise is invaluable, and I am thrilled we can count on them to set the standard for the quality of research and discourse seen in <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em><em><sub>.</sub></em></p>



<p><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you currently?</strong></p>



<p>The thing that excites me most is the growth of dedicated coursework and degree programs for complex systems and networks. This is recognition of the importance of complexity science by academia as a whole and I am excited to see how students in these programs think, as well as the problems they want to address. My hope is that these programs will embrace the need for collaboration and subject expertise as well as inspire curious students.</p>



<p><strong>How will Open Science play a key role in the journal achieving its vision and advancing the field?</strong></p>



<p>Open Science is inclusive, transparent, and flexible, making it the optimal way to communicate complex networks research from across a range of disciplines to all its possible audiences. Open Science also increases visibility and reusability, not just of the research article, but the underlying methods and data of the research itself, which creates an opportunity for a wider community to further test and build from these components<br><br>This is particularly vital to ensuring that the datasets and methodologies that researchers create and leverage are properly vetted. With the prevalence of machine learning models, we must be conscientious of the data we use and the risk of perpetuating inequalities that may be hidden in these tools.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cop28-fossil-fuels-climate-change">COP28 nations agreed to ‘transition’ from fossil fuels. That’s too slow, experts say</a></h4>

              
                <p>Days of contentious wrangling in Dubai at the United Nations’ 28th annual climate summit ended December 13 with a historic agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels and accelerate climate action over the next decade. The organization touted the agreement as a moment of global solidarity, marking “the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era.</p>



<p>But the final agreement reached at COP28, signed by nearly 200 nations, did not include language that explicitly mandated phasing out fossil fuel energy, deeply frustrating many nations as well as climate scientists and activists.</p>





<p>The agreement is considered <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world’s first “global stocktake</a>,” an inventory of climate actions and progress made since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">2015 Paris Agreement</a> to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>It acknowledges the conclusions of scientific research that greenhouse gas emissions will need to be cut by 43 percent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. It then calls on nations to speed up climate actions before 2030 so as to reach global net zero by 2050 — in which greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced by their removal from the atmosphere. Among the actions called for are increasing global renewable energy generation, phasing down coal power and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.</p>



<p>But among many scientists gathered in San Francisco at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting to discuss climate change’s impacts to Earth’s atmosphere, polar regions, oceans and biosphere, the reaction to the language in the agreement was more frustrated than celebratory.</p>



<p>“The beginning of the end? I wish it was the middle of the end,” says climate scientist Luke Parsons of the Nature Conservancy, who is based in Durham, N.C. “But you have to start somewhere, I guess.”</p>



<p>It is a step forward, says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Saying it out loud, that we are aiming to phase out fossil fuels, is huge.”</p>



<p>It’s not a moment too soon: The globe is already experiencing many climate change–linked extreme weather events, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">the hottest 12 months ever recorded</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/23</em>). Still, Scambos says, “it’s a tribute to the science and the negotiators that we can take this step now, before the disastrous global impacts truly get underway.” But, he added, “I fear that the pace [of future climate action] will … still be driven by impacts arriving at our collective doors.”</p>



<p>Other researchers had a grimmer take.</p>



<p>“It was weak sauce,” says climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania. “What we really need is a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, on a very specific timeline: We’re going to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent this decade, bring them down to zero mid-century. Instead, they agreed to transition away from fossil fuels — the analogy that I use is, you’re diagnosed with diabetes, and you tell your doctor you’re going to transition away from doughnuts. That’s not going to cut it. It didn’t meet the moment.”</p>



<p>Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, called the agreement “deeply disappointing and misleading,” noting that it didn’t include any language specifically calling for phasing out fossil fuels. Furthermore, he says, “COP28 keeps entertaining the idea that 1.5 degrees Celsius may be achievable, but everyone is offtrack to meet that goal. [And] for ice sheets and glaciers, even 1.5 degrees is not sustainable.” &nbsp;There already are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">fears, for instance, that the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet can’t be stopped</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Even if the world stays close to that average temperature, “the ice sheets are going to be retreating,” says Rob DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “But you start getting out toward the end of the century, and all hell is going to break loose if we go much above 1.5. You’re talking about actually exceeding the limits of adaptation around so much of our coastlines.” &nbsp;</p>





<p>On December 12, the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service noted that the world has, in effect, <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/weve-lost-19-years-battle-against-global-warming-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“lost” 19 years by delaying action to reduce fossil fuel emissions</a>. Back in 2015, climate projections suggested that Earth’s average temperature would reach the 1.5 degrees C threshold by the year 2045 — then 30 years away. Now, projections show that the planet may reach that benchmark by 2034, just 11 years in the future.</p>



<p>“We’ve got a shrinking window of opportunity,” Mann says. “And that window of opportunity will close if we don’t make dramatic and immediate reductions to our carbon emissions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2023-big-if-true">Here are some big-if-true scientific claims that made headlines in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>From ancient cannibalism to stars made of dark matter, 2023 delivered several scientific claims that could shake up their fields — if they shape up to be true.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Spark of life</h4>



<p>Early life on Earth may have gotten a boost from giant volcanic eruptions. A new look at debris from 10 eruptions millions of years ago suggests they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruption-nitrogen-lightning-life">contained a lot of nitrate that formed in the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 7</em>). The eruptions could have triggered fierce lightning that ripped apart molecular nitrogen, freeing nitrogen atoms to bond with other elements and form molecules useful to life — including nitrate. The same process may have happened billions of years ago, some scientists say, producing ingredients for early life. Scientists will need to account for the different chemical makeup of primordial Earth’s atmosphere to bolster that claim.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Butchered bone</h4>



<p>Purported tool marks on a 1.45-million-year-old fossilized leg offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-hominids-stone-age-cannibalism">the oldest evidence of cannibalism among humans’ ancient relatives</a>, researchers contend (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 10</em>). The marks on the bone, found in Kenya, could have been made by some unidentified hominid using a stone tool to carve muscle away from the shin of another hominid. But a few bone nicks do not cannibal table scraps make, some paleoanthropologists say.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overgrown galaxies</h4>



<p>A handful of galaxies from the very early universe are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">up to 100 times as massive as expected</a>, data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope suggest (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). The hefty galaxies not only challenge the idea that matter clumped together slowly over the universe’s lifetime, but also hint at some unknown way to fast-track galaxy formation. But the galaxies’ weights and distances must be confirmed with more detailed analyses of their light before astronomers rewrite cosmic history.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thymus rethink</h4>



<p>The thymus may not be inconsequential for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">adult health after all</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 7</em>). This immune system organ between the lungs is most active in childhood and withers with age, so it is often considered expendable in adulthood. In a study of more than 2,000 adults who had chest surgery, however, researchers reported that removing the thymus gland was associated with higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years. Why thymus removal might be harmful remains unclear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-3.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="An illustration of the the chest with the thymus highlighted in orange" class="wp-image-3134093" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-3.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-3.jpg?resize=575%2C383&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-3.jpg?resize=675%2C450&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-3.jpg?resize=279%2C186&amp;ssl=1 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134093">The thymus (orange in this illustration) is an immune system organ that sits between the lungs, right in front of and above the heart.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dead and buried?</h4>



<p>Honoring the dead may not be unique to big-brained hominids like <em>Homo sapiens</em> and Neandertals. <em>Homo naledi</em>, which lived around the same time as early <em>H. sapiens</em> but had an orange-sized brain, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-dug-cave-graves-carved-marks">intentionally buried bodies</a> in an underground South African cave, a group of researchers claims (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 6</em>). Other experts remain unconvinced, though. The supposedly buried bodies, which predate the earliest evidence of <em>H</em>. <em>sapiens</em> and Neandertal burials by 160,000 years, could have fallen through cave shafts or been washed by water into natural depressions in cave floors, skeptics say.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="363" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-4.jpg?resize=680%2C363&#038;ssl=1" alt="A reconstruction of a grave including adult Homo naledi bones" class="wp-image-3134092" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-4.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_big-if_inline-4.jpg?resize=330%2C176&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134092">A proposed grave including the remains of an adult <em>Homo naledi </em>is shown in this reconstruction.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134092">L. Berger <em>et al</em>/bioRxiv.org 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rocked to the core</h4>



<p>Separate studies both based on earthquake data are shaking up geologists’ concept of Earth’s heart. The solid inner core not only rotates but also appears to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">switch the direction of rotation</a> relative to the mantle and crust every few decades (<em>SN: 2/25/23, p. 7</em>). The inner core may also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">a secret chamber</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 17</em>). Other data, however, hint that the inner core reverses every few years or does not rotate at all. And the supposed discovery of the innermost core hinges on a type of seismic wave that bounces around Earth’s interior, becoming weaker and more difficult to detect with every bounce. Thankfully, whatever is going on down there does not seem to endanger life on the surface.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dark matter stars</h4>



<p>The James Webb Space Telescope may have spotted stars made of dark matter — the unidentified stuff that makes up most matter in the cosmos (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 8</em>). So-called dark stars are so far hypothetical, but JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-stars-dark-matter">observed three objects</a> giving off the kind of light expected from such stars. If they exist, dark stars could shed new light on star formation and the nature of dark matter. However, the pinpricks of light in JWST’s field of view could also come from normal stars, so astronomers will need more detailed data to tease out the objects’ true nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retractions are the stuff of nightmares for most academics. But they aren’t necessarily a career obstacle, and sometimes may be the only way forward, according to <a href="https://www.andersonevolve.com/people">Andrew P. Anderson</a>, a postdoctoral researcher in the biology department of Reed College, in Portland, Ore. Last month, the journal <em>Evolution</em> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evolut/qpad182/7440094">pulled and replaced</a> a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/76/6/1331/6882231">study</a> Anderson had conducted as a PhD student under <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/people/faculty/adamjones">Adam G. Jones</a> at the University of Idaho, in Moscow. The study’s findings suggested sexual selection shaped the responsiveness of the human genome to male sex hormones. Below is a lightly edited Q&amp;A we did with Anderson about his experience.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch (RW):</strong> In the summer of 2022, shortly after your paper was first published, you realized it contained a significant error. What happened?</p>



<span id="more-128414"></span>



<p><strong>Andrew Anderson (AA): </strong>Another research team was trying to follow up on our study using a wider group of animals and wasn’t seeing the same pattern for one of the traits we tested. They went back and tried using just our data in their calculations and got a conflicting result. So they went through our analysis and found the error in our calculations. They emailed me all the details of what they did and sent me the one line they thought I left out that would rectify the issue. They also assured me they could see how I missed it and that I probably wouldn’t be the last person to make that error. </p>



<p>I was obviously not happy with the situation, I felt like a fraud and I let down my advisor. I was initially hopeful that maybe they missed something or that the other traits they didn’t verify would be okay. I emailed my co-author/adviser and began looking at their analysis to confirm my results were incorrect and theirs were correct. At that point, all I could do was thank the researcher who had emailed me for taking an interest in my work and for pointing out the error; then I asked them to give me some time to sort out my next steps.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How did your adviser react when you told him?</p>



<p><strong>AA: </strong>He is always supportive and straightforward. No blame or admonitions, just focusing on how we move forward. He asked if I confirmed the issue, then said we need to write a new table with the new values and write a paragraph about the changes. Then we went back and forth on those edits and a letter to <em>Evolution</em> explaining what happened and asking if we could submit our new table and explanation as a corrigendum.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How did the journal respond?</p>



<p><strong>AA: </strong>They thanked us for the documentation and told us the editorial team for the journal and corrections team for the publisher would discuss and get back to us with a decision. They took a few weeks to decide (sending us updates in between – including a notice that they were putting up an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/77/10/2340/7254508">expression of concern</a> that they had us approve), but came to the conclusion we needed to retract and resubmit. They provided us information of what we needed to do to the manuscript and told us to submit through the journal’s portal like any other manuscript.</p>



<p>It felt like other communications I’ve had with journal editors, and certainly once the resubmission started it was like any other paper. As with my advisor, the only thing that really mattered for the journal was making sure the information was correct. I think the focus on getting it right and providing me the opportunity to correct the record put me at ease with the process.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How do you feel about the retraction?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> A range of feelings really. I’m happy that I got to correct the record, I know some people were reading it and using it for their research and I want them to have the right information. I’m embarrassed that I made a mistake and it’s permanently there for everyone to see. I’ve lived enough to know it’s a blip on the radar, but the timing (looking for an academic job) had me terrified. That feeling has abated more as I have gotten a lot of positive comments from other scientists.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>Has the retraction had any negative consequences for your career?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> I honestly don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m looking for jobs right now and no one has indicated if this made a difference. I can say I have gotten interviews after the statement of concern by the journal and after the full retract/resubmit process was completed. I don&#8217;t know the results of those interviews yet, but I would guess if the retraction was a problem I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the interviews in the first place.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> What were the biggest challenges for you during this experience?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> Not getting in my own head about what was happening. When I have heard about retractions, it’s usually about possibly unethical behavior by the scientist. I was worried that my retraction might be perceived that way. No one ever suggested malfeasance on my part. And every part of that paper is from open-source data and all my code was available since publication. My advisor always had me put the code up for others to see, and this was a great lesson that doing so not only benefits other researchers in reproducibility but also allows me to “show my work” so nothing is hidden and shows I’m doing my analysis in good faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People make mistakes and I’m certainly no different. There are people and procedures in place for correcting a paper. While not common, errors and retract/resubmit seem to happen more than I realized as I was looking for how to communicate with the journal about my situation. I got through it by just telling myself this is how science is supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do you have any advice for others who find themselves in a similar situation?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> Take a breath, admit you made the mistake and reach out to the journal. They have policies and procedures in place to resolve the issue. It’s like trouble-shooting in the other parts of our work as scientists. If you made a mistake or something went wrong in the lab, you can’t ignore it, you have to fix it; the same is true with your papers. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-heat-waves-below-surface-common">Ocean heat waves often lurk out of sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heat waves don’t just strike on land — they can also occur in the ocean. And roughly a third of marine heat waves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01325-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t detectable at the ocean’s surface</a>, a new study reports. The findings, published in the December <em>Nature Geoscience</em>, suggest that far more of these potentially harmful events might be occurring than previously believed.</p>



<p>Ocean heat waves can have a slew of adverse effects on marine ecosystems because many forms of life cannot rapidly adapt to changes in temperature. For instance, cod populations were devastated from 2013 to 2015 when a marine heat wave lingered off the West Coast of North America. Given the interconnectedness of marine food webs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/massive-marine-heat-wave-blob-unprecedented-seabird-die-off">seabirds suffered, too</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/20</em>).</p>





<p>Marine heat waves are often identified with satellite observations that measure the temperature of the ocean surface. But these data leave the ocean depths unmonitored.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To literally take a deeper look, statistician Furong Li and colleagues turned to computer simulations of the ocean’s temperature, salinity and currents, among other parameters, created from both satellite and subsurface data stretching back to the early 1990s. Such simulations are a powerful way of studying the ocean on a global scale, says Li, of the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.</p>



<p>The researchers pinpointed ocean heat waves in the simulations by looking for layers of water that remained unusually warm — up to a few degrees Celsius above surrounding levels — for at least five days. Such events can be caused by changes in atmospheric circulation, for instance, or shifts in ocean currents.</p>



<p>Li and her collaborators spotted several hundred marine heat waves per year. But the real surprise was finding that about 1 in 3 of those events consistently lurked out of view and were never visible in the uppermost 10 meters of the water. “We discovered a great number of marine heat waves hidden below the sea surface,” Li says.</p>



<p>Researchers might accordingly be missing a lot of these events, says Mike Jacox, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Monterey, Calif., not involved in the research. “Just looking at the surface temperature might not be enough.”</p>



<p>Marine life might therefore be contending with significantly more ocean heat waves than previously thought. And that means additional stress on marine ecosystems. In 2020, Jacox and his colleagues showed that animals seeking to escape marine heat waves would have to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">swim hundreds of kilometers on average</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). And when creatures are unable to move, marine heat waves often prove deadly. Warming in the Great Barrier Reef, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">has been linked to coral bleaching</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/20</em>).</p>

<p>As the Editor <em>of BMC Public Health, </em>I had the opportunity to attend  the <a href="https://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association’s</a> (APHA’s) 151st Annual Meeting and Exposition held in Atlanta, Georgia, one of the birthplaces of the civil rights movements.</p>
<p>The theme of the meeting, “Creating the Healthiest Nation: Overcoming Social and Ethical Challenges,” emphasized the importance of investigating the social and ethical challenges we are facing in our society to ensure a healthy and equitable environment, taking actions to apply what we learned from science.</p>
<p>Among all the amazing sessions, I would like to share with you some sessions which stood out as being particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s meeting addressed different topics, including Artificial Intelligence in Public Health, Public Health issues affecting people with disabilities and Anti-Racism research.</p>
<h3><strong>Public Health and Artificial Intelligence: friends, enemies, or frenemies? </strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The APHA meeting was full of exciting sessions, and it was very difficult to decide which ones to attend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joshua M. Sharfstein, Vice Dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, held a fascinating talk discussing the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for public health practice.</p>
<p>AI techniques have been widely applied to infection-disease surveillance, making possible early outbreak detection and prediction of disease trends, allowing timely public-health response modeling and assessment. In this way, AI can identify previously invisible data, providing &#8220;new solutions to old problems.&#8221;  However, AI models can be biased by the sources of data, increasing inequality in the society, for instance in terms of access to equitable care. Using AI brings with it the risks of eliminating the key role for human engagement, violation of personal privacy and lack of transparency, as AI systems make decisions in ways that humans are not always able to understand easily.</p>
<p>Within the field of Public Health, AI offers opportunities as well as risks. The key to success for good use of AI is a people-centered approach controlled by humans, which takes into account ethics issues, personal data protection and transparency of the models.</p>
<h3><strong>Inclusivity Scorecard: improving accessibility for people living with disabilities</strong></h3>
<p>People with disabilities, especially intellectual and developmental disabilities, face every day with many barriers, which are more than just physical obstacles. Disability is surrounded by stereotype, stigma and discrimination. People often assume that those with disabilities have a poor quality of life, are unable to care for themselves and are in general unhealthy. Supporting people with disabilities is a social responsibility and should be aimed to create an environment within our society where people with disabilities can have an independent life.</p>

<p>Within the session dedicated to emerging Public Health issues affecting people with disabilities, M. Alysia Mastrangelo, Professor of Physical Therapy at the Stockton University, described the development of the Inclusivity Scorecard. This tool is designed to be used by site managers of public spaces and owners of business and recreational areas. The Inclusivity Scorecard considers five priority areas, including accessible entrance, access to services, goods and supports, access to restrooms, approachability of the staff and website accessibility. The aim of the scorecard is to increase accessibility, providing equitable access and promoting social inclusion. The development of an Inclusivity Scorecard could help to evaluate a public space and provide important accessibility information in advance, providing support for individuals living with disabilities and their caregivers.</p>
<h3><strong>“Together we can move mountains”: Antiracism research, health equity and social justice</strong></h3>
<p>The second-to-last day of the meeting started with an interesting session held by leaders of anti-racist research. This kind of research tries to identify the reasons for racism and aims to unlearn internalized belief systems dictated by white supremacy, with the final scope to redistribute power and resources, uplift Black and Indigenous leadership in Public Health and more broadly address social injustices in society.</p>
<p>There is a need to develop anti-racist policies and practice interventions to address the issue of racism in communities and to educate, advocate and speak for health equity.</p>
<p>Wendy Barrington, Associate Professor in the departments of Health Systems and Population Health and Epidemiology within the University of Washington School of Public Health, talked about the Center for Anti-Racism and Community Health (ARCH). Dr Barrington was named Director of the ARCH in the fall of 2021. The ARCH Center provides a space within the university to nurture and develop Black and Indigenous scholars and anti-racist researchers, by serving as a resource for the implementation of anti-racist strategies at community level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-fetch-play">When do cats play fetch? When they feel like it </a></h4>

              
                <p>In news that probably won’t surprise cat owners, cats that play fetch do it on their own terms.</p>



<p>Fetching felines tend to dictate when a fetching session begins and when it ends, a survey of over 900 cat owners suggests. The vast majority of the participants’ cats&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47409-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to pick up the behavior on their own</a>, with no explicit training from their humans, animal behavior scientist Jemma Forman and colleagues report December 14 in&nbsp;<em>Scientific Reports.</em></p>



<p>“Ultimately, I think the cats are in control,” says Forman, of the University of Sussex in Brighton, England.<em>&nbsp;</em>The study adds a new facet to scientists’ understanding of cat behavior, which has been less studied than that of dogs.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Previous studies have reported that cats can fetch, but there’s not much research on why or how the animals do it, or whether the behavior requires training. The inspiration for the new study came in the form of a sleek Sphynx named Bear. “He surprised me one day by bringing a toy to me,” says Elizabeth Renner, a psychologist at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a cat play fetch | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/495eLofNkEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bear, a Sphynx cat, purrs while retrieving a crinkly foil ball tossed by his owner, study coauthor Elizabeth Renner. “He really loves fetch,” she says.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So she teamed up with Forman and University of Sussex psychologist David Leavens to create an online survey to learn more about fetching cats. The team recruited survey respondents via social media and targeted people who have (or had) cats that played fetch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers were interested in the animals’ agency: Whose idea was it to play fetch in the first place? More often than not, the answer was the cat, the team found. Of the 1,154 cats tallied in the survey, owners reported that more than 94 percent hadn’t been trained to fetch. The survey also revealed other kitty tidbits, like favorite things to fetch (toys, crumpled paper and hair ties, among other items) and the purebred that fetched most frequently (Siamese).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that owners were training their cats without realizing it, says Dennis Turner, a cat behavior expert who founded&nbsp;the Institute of Applied Ethology and Animal Psychology near Zurich and was&nbsp;not involved with the work. Even just tossing a toy left at your feet rewards your cat with time and attention. That reinforces the fetching behavior, he says. “Cats learn very quickly — if they want to.”</p>



<p>Cats may also be training their humans, he says. One cat owner in the study figured out that her pet would fetch only pom-poms of a certain size. “I bought a larger pom-pom, and she rejected it,” the owner said. In human-cat relationships, Turner says, “there’s a lot of learning going on back and forth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings offer plenty for researchers to sink their claws into. One question is what percentage of cats play fetch, Renner says. Another is whether fetching is a type of social interaction between humans and cats. The researchers are now recruiting cat owners for a new study that may help answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not every cat will fetch like Fido, so Forman emphasizes that it’s important for owners to pay attention to their animals’ needs. “Cats are individuals, and they have very distinct personalities.” Cats may want to eat, play or do something else entirely — like walk on your keyboard. Or sleep on your face. </p>

                <p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023(opens in a new tab)">Weight-loss drugs</a> stole much of the spotlight in 2023, but these medical advances treating other conditions are also worthy of attention (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Green light for CRISPR gene editing</h4>



<p>On December 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-crispr-therapy-sickle-cell-fda">the world’s first CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing therapy</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/23</em>). The treatment, called Casgevy, targets sickle cell disease by helping patients produce healthy hemoglobin. In people with the disease, hemoglobin is abnormal, causing red blood cells to become hard and crescent shaped, which can block blood flow. By March 2024, the FDA will decide whether the same therapy can be used to treat beta-thalassemia, a disorder that reduces hemoglobin production.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Slowing down Alzheimer’s</h4>



<p>The Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) won full FDA approval in July. Like the drug aducanumab approved in 2021, lecanemab removes the amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The drug doesn’t stop the disease, but in a clinical trial, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-market-brain">lecanemab slowed cognitive decline</a> by about 30 percent over 18 months compared with a placebo (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 9</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A gene therapy for muscular dystrophy</h4>



<p>In June, the FDA approved the first gene therapy for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Due to a faulty gene, people with this muscle-wasting disease don’t make the protein dystrophin, which helps keep muscle cells intact. The therapy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">helps the body produce a version of the missing protein</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Guarding against RSV</h4>



<p>Several ways to protect against respiratory syncytial virus arrived this year. In May, the FDA approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-vaccine-rsv">the first RSV vaccine, called Arexvy, in the United States</a>, for adults age 60 and older (<em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 8</em>), and then in August, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-rsv-vaccine-pregnancy">a vaccine for pregnant people</a>, called Abrysvo (<em>SN: 8/25/23</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">A monoclonal antibody</a> — a lab-made antibody that mimics immune system proteins — won approval in July to protect children 2 and younger from the virus, which sends as many as 80,000 young children to U.S. hospitals each year (S<em>N: 4/27/23</em>). But in October, limited supplies of the therapy led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend reserving it for babies at highest risk for complications from RSV.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A pill for postpartum depression</h4>



<p>Until August, the only medication in the United States specifically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brexanolone-postpartum-depression">targeting postpartum depression</a> required a 60-hour intravenous infusion in a hospital (<em>SN: 3/22/19</em>). With FDA approval of zuranolone (brand name Zurzuvae), those afflicted with postpartum depression can take an oral medication at home and experience <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/postpartum-depression-pill-zurzuvae-zuranolone#:~:text=The%20medication%2C%20zuranolone%20(brand%20name,be%20available%20in%20late%20fall." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement in as little as three days</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Birth control, no prescription required</h4>



<p>In July, the FDA ruled that the oral contraceptive norgestrel, first approved in 1973, be available without a prescription. It’s the first OTC daily birth control pill in the United States. Some public health experts argue that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/counter-birth-control-pill-reproductive">reducing barriers to contraception</a> is especially important to reproductive autonomy now that state bans have limited access to abortion (<em>SN: 5/19/23</em>).</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A shot against chikungunya</h4>



<p>The chikungunya virus can cause fever and severe joint pain, and be fatal to newborns. In November, the FDA approved the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> first vaccine against the virus</a>, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus is most prevalent in tropical regions, but the FDA warns that it’s spreading to new parts of the globe.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Narcan over the counter</h4>



<p>The nasal spray Narcan, aka naloxone, can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose within minutes. In March, the FDA ruled <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this life-saving drug can be sold over the counter</a>. Officials hope that easier access to Narcan can help fight the opioid epidemic, which claimed the lives of nearly 645,000 people from 1999 to 2021 due to overdoses.</p>

<p>Just four months after an allegedly stolen dinosaur fossil was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01969-z">returned from Germany to Brazil</a>, a prominent European paleontologist published a paper bound to spark renewed controversy in an <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/chicken-size-dino-furlike-mane-stirs-ethics-debate">already-divided</a> research community.</p>



<p>And so it did: Less than a month after the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GC1464_geocurator_11_7_pp480-495-RETRACTED.pdf">article</a>, which criticized the online repatriation campaign, was published on October 2 in <em>The Geological Curator</em>, it vanished again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This flawed corporatist rant, loaded with racist undertones, has been retracted,” <a href="https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=1785324">Juan Carlos Cisneros</a> of Universidade Federal do Piauí, in Teresina, Brazil, <a href="https://twitter.com/PaleoCisneros/status/1728500510880145596">wrote on the social media platform X</a>.</p>



<p>The reasons for the retraction are not entirely clear, but the journal may have faced external pressure, according to the paper’s author.</p>



<span id="more-128408"></span>



<p>In the article, Jeff Liston, president of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists, accused Cisneros and another researcher in Brazil of using “Trumpian dog whistles” in a campaign on social media that preceded the repatriation of the chicken-sized reptile, dubbed <em>Ubirajara </em>jubatus. During the campaign, the German museum housing the fossil became the target of hate speech on social media and reportedly <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/institutions-global-north-hoard-fossils-brazil-study-says">received bomb and arson threats</a>.</p>



<p>“This is a public science museum with school classes coming in,” Liston told Retraction Watch. “What I found most disappointing was there was no attempt by the people who were running the campaign to take responsibility for the more extreme aspects of it and disavow or disown them.”</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re seeing parallels with what Trump did on January 6,” Liston added. “I believe the buzzword used these days is ‘stochastic terrorism.’ And there&#8217;s that whole process where people are incited more and more to rage and anger.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Liston also argued in the now-withdrawn paper against using the term “scientific colonialism,” frequently invoked by Cisneros and others, to describe the <em>Ubirajara</em> case.</p>



<p>Cisneros, who was singled out in Liston’s paper along with <a href="https://en.dinolab.com.br/team">Aline Ghilardi</a> of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, also in Brazil, said he and his colleagues were “overthrowing a paradigm.”</p>



<p>“The old generations … think they can work like Indiana Jones, because Indiana Jones never gets a permit to work in another country,” Cisneros told us. “He just goes there and takes very valuable stuff and puts it in a museum in the Global North.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We found our voice on social media,” Cisneros said. “The fact is that we never had a voice. Each time we try to stop them stealing our fossils we are met with silence.”</p>



<p>“The case of the <em>Ubirajara</em> fossil is dividing our field because for the first time, we were able to say what these people have been doing for decades,” Cisneros said. “We <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898">published a study</a> that shows that hundreds of fossils have been acquired without legal justification by European institutions, especially in Germany.”</p>



<p>Cisneros said the now-retracted paper felt “very personal” and included several claims that weren’t referenced and so couldn’t be vetted. He did not complain to the journal about the article himself, he said, but knew others who had, including a professional society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I never read anything like that in my field,” Cisneros said, adding that he believed Liston was trying to push him and Ghilardi “out of academia.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghilardi did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/chicken-size-dino-furlike-mane-stirs-ethics-debate">Controversy</a> has trailed the 110-million-year-old dinosaur since it was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667120303736">first named and described</a> in 2020 by a team that did not include any researchers from Brazil. Many paleontologists – among them Cisneros and Ghilardi – argued the fossil was exported illegally, whereas the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, in Germany, which housed the specimen after purchasing it years earlier, claimed in a Facebook post that the German state of Baden-Württemberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naturkundemuseumkarlsruhe/posts/statement-zu-ubirajarain-den-letzten-stunden-haben-uns-viele-kommentare-zum-foss/4885874288106641/">was its “rightful owner.”</a></p>



<p>The legal and ethical questions swirling around the fossil eventually <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-second-extinction-retraction-deepens-legal-and-ethical-battle-over-rare-dinosaur">triggered a retraction</a> of the 2020 paper, as <em>Science</em> reported in 2021, leaving the species <a href="https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5254.3.10">without a valid scientific name</a>.</p>



<p>Why Liston’s paper, “Crying Ubirajara: Bad faith actors &amp; weaponizing outrage in post-Trump palaeontology,” was also retracted is not entirely clear. According to <a href="https://www.geocurator.org/fulltext/files/GC1464_geocurator_11_7_pp480-495.pdf">the retraction notice</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following a review by the Geological Curators Group Committee, this article was withdrawn online on 27th October 2023, prior to publication in print. The peer review process used in the preparation of this article was found to be in contradiction of the journal&#8217;s policies and guidelines. The author has been invited to resubmit on this topic to a future issue of Geological Curator.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s editor, Duncan Murdock of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, in the UK, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the COPE retraction guidelines (https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines) the article is “retracted” only as the most suitable status for what is actually a short-term situation. The author has been invited to resubmit a version of the article for a future issue of the journal, which is due for publication in the spring (Geological Curator, Volume 11, Number 9).</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Murdock did not answer an email asking what specifically had led to the retraction. However, Liston, who was a guest editor of the special ethics issue in which his paper appeared, said he began receiving emails from the journal about his paper only a few weeks after it was published. The emails had “a note of panic,” according to Liston, and inquired about the identity of the reviewers.</p>



<p>“At that point, I thought, yeah, this feels like it&#8217;s a retraction in search of a pretext,” Liston said. “There seemed to be an external pressure on the organization to retract it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Liston, he selected the two reviewers of his paper himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think [the journal] wanted to say that the process of me suggesting the names of the reviewers and sending it to the reviewers was problematic, although both the chair [of the Geological Curators Group Committee] and the editor had been fully aware that that&#8217;s what was going on in the months leading up to the publication coming back.”</p>



<p>He added: “It only became an issue later on when there was a problem.”</p>



<p>Liston said he believed that although the journal asked him to resubmit his paper, “fundamentally, they&#8217;re not comfortable in publishing it.” He has had interest from other journals, he said, and “if nothing else, I could put it on a preprint server.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was always aware that no matter how far along this might go, at some point it might get pulled,” Liston said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-bar-young-metal-stars">A bar of stars at the center of the Milky Way looks surprisingly young</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biography of our home galaxy may be due for some revisions. That’s because a bar-shaped collection of stars at the center of the Milky Way appears to be much younger than expected.</p>



<p>The bar is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">a prominent feature of our galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 6/25/21</em>). It spans thousands of light-years and links the galaxy’s spiraling arms of stars, making them resemble streams of water coming from a spinning lawn sprinkler. In computer simulations of the Milky Way’s evolution, the bar tends to form early in the galaxy’s roughly 13-billion-year lifetime. But the ages and locations of metal-rich stars suggest <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16993" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bar finished forming just a few billion years ago</a>, researchers report. The study, submitted November 28 to arXiv.org, is in press at <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Letters</em>.</p>





<p>“These metal-rich stars are basically like fossil records of ancient stars that are telling the story of our home galaxy,” says Samir Nepal, an astrophysicist at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany.</p>



<p>Stars with large proportions of metal elements are built from the remnants of stars that have since exploded, ejecting the metals they forged from lighter elements. Those spewed metals enrich the materials in the core of galaxies like the Milky Way, which is why a new generation of metal-rich stars can form only deep inside galaxies. The spinning bar at the center of the Milky Way then scattered some of those stars throughout our galaxy.</p>



<p>Using data from the European Space Agency’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-delivers-trove-data-revealing-secrets-milky-way">Gaia space telescope</a>, Nepal and colleagues reconstructed the development of the Milky Way bar through its influence on the distribution of metal-rich stars (<em>SN: 5/9/18</em>). They inferred the bar’s history, just as you might deduce where the batters stand in a baseball game by looking at the flight of the balls they hit, even if you can’t see home plate.</p>



<p>In tracking the ages of the metal-rich stars, the researchers identified a burst of star formation in the central part of the galaxy that petered out about 3 billion years ago. The downturn seems to mark the end of the Milky Way bar’s developmental phase, the researchers report. After that burst, they say, the inflow of new material into the bar probably dropped off substantially. That suggests the bar we see today is a stable feature that’s about 10 billion years younger than the galaxy as a whole.</p>



<p>The new insights about the metal-rich stars “are like the tip of the iceberg” of data coming from the Gaia telescope, says astrophysicist Cristina Chiappini, also with the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Assuming the revised age estimate of the bar is confirmed, future models of the galaxy’s evolution will have to account for why the bar developed so late.</p>



<p>The study has broader implications than correcting the history of our galaxy, says Ortwin Gerhard, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, who was not involved in the research. “The possibility of detailed observations of the motions and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way, particularly based on [data] from the Gaia satellite,” he says, means we can “expect to learn about the evolution of bars [in other galaxies] generally by studying the bar in the Milky Way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hedgehog-species-short-spikes">A new species of hedgehog stands out for its short spikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Initially mistaken for one of its close relatives, a group of small, spiky mammals in eastern China has now been identified as a new species: the eastern forest hedgehog.</p>



<p>Researchers first scooped up one of these dark spike balls in the province of Anhui in 2018. It looked like a Hugh’s hedgehog (<em>Mesechinus hughi</em>), a species typically found some 1,000 kilometers west. But the rogue hedgehog’s DNA didn’t quite match that of its westward relatives. So scientists collected six more individuals from scrublands and forests around Anhui and the neighboring province of Zhejiang for a closer look.</p>





<p>Comparing the physical appearance and DNA of these hedgehogs with the four known species in the <em>Mesechinus</em> genus confirmed <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/111615/element/8/87441/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the newly found hedgehogs are unique</a>, the team reports November 28 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. Officially named <em>Mesechinus orientalis</em>, the eastern forest hedgehog brings the total number of known hedgehog species to 19.</p>



<p>Kevin Campbell, a biologist at the University of Manitoba in Canada not involved in the work, was not surprised by the debut of a new hedgehog species in China. “It’s a very large landscape, it’s a very varied landscape,” he says. “In the last 10 years or so, there’s been a huge increase in the number of species recognized from that area.”</p>



<p>About as long as a pencil and weighing roughly as much as a can of soda, <em>M. orientalis</em> rivals <em>M. hughi</em> for puniest <em>Mesechinus</em> hedgehog. But <em>M. orientalis</em> is distinguishable from <em>M. hughi</em> by the shapes of a couple of its teeth and its skull near the temple. Eastern forest hedgehogs also boast the shortest spines of any species in the genus. Their black-tipped spines are a mere 1.8 to 2 centimeters long, about a half-centimeter shorter than <em>M. hughi</em>’s spines.</p>



<p>“The mammals of China, especially small mammals, have not been well studied,” says study coauthor Kai He, a mammologist at Guangzhou University in China. </p>



<p>For a long time, <em>Mesechinus</em> hedgehogs were thought to roam only northern China and nearby Mongolia and Russia. That changed in 2018, when scientists realized that a recently discovered group of hedgehogs living on Mount Gaoligong — thousands of kilometers southwest of other species’ stomping grounds — was a new species, <em>M. wangi</em>. </p>



<p>Finding a new <em>Mesechinus</em> species in eastern China has once again greatly expanded the known range of this genus. And taking a census of what small mammals live where, He says, is key to guiding wildlife conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">Why weight-loss drugs became more popular than ever this year</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, celebrity gossip, a national shortage and eyebrow-raising clinical trials made household names of weight-loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.</p>



<p>The buzzy drugs belong to a class of powerful medications that can manage blood sugar levels and drastically reduce body weight — a hot property that kicked them into the mainstream. This spring, even WeightWatchers got on board, acquiring a virtual clinic that offers prescriptions for the popular drugs.</p>



<p>The medications’ ever-expanding reach might explain why many people in the United States are having trouble filling prescriptions. From 2020 to 2022, the number of prescriptions for these drugs quadrupled — up to roughly 9 million in the final months of 2022, according to one analysis. In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration included both Ozempic and Wegovy on its drug shortages list.</p>





<p>And demand may continue to rocket up. Data from clinical trials and other studies suggest these drugs can improve cardiovascular health and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wegovy-ozempic-treat-addiction">perhaps even help treat addiction</a> (<em>SN: 8/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>The FDA approved Ozempic for type 2 diabetes in 2017, and now new, potentially more potent and easier-to-produce versions are in the pipeline, says Susan Yanovski, a physician and nutrition specialist at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Md. “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years now, and I have not seen this degree of excitement.”</p>



<p>It’s the first time doctors have had obesity drugs that work so well, she says, approaching weight-loss levels previously seen only with bariatric surgery. But, Yanovski cautions, “it’s still early days.”</p>



<p>Amid the hubbub, a fresh influx of clinical trial data has opened a Pandora’s box of questions. How exactly do the drugs work? Who should take them? For how long? What’s the full range of side effects? “We’ve got a lot of research to do,” Yanovski says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide belongs to a powerful class of drugs</h4>



<p>Ozempic is the brand name for the drug semaglutide; Wegovy, also semaglutide, has a higher maximum dose and is approved for weight loss. Semaglutide mimics a gut hormone, GLP-1, that’s secreted after people eat. When given a high dose weekly, people without diabetes can <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lose about 15 percent of their body weight</a>, on average, after nearly 16 months. Scientists think the drug acts on the body and the brain, making people feel full and muffling food cravings.</p>



<p>Yet semaglutide may have an even more dramatic action — saving lives, scientists suggested November 11 in Philadelphia at the American Heart Association meeting. Weekly injections of the drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-semaglutide-wegovy-heart-attack-stroke">lowered the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death due to cardiovascular disease</a> in some adults, Cleveland Clinic cardiologist A. Michael Lincoff reported (<em>SN: 11/15/23</em>). The trial targeted people who are overweight or obese who have high cardiovascular risk but not diabetes.</p>



<p>That’s important because it wasn’t clear until now that these patients would see heart benefits, says Tiffany Powell-Wiley, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda. The find “really opens up the number of patients that we can treat with semaglutide,” she says. Powell-Wiley notes, though, that no single drug — even a powerful one — can fix the many factors that lead to the development of obesity.</p>



<p>Still, pharmaceutical companies are racing to investigate new, improved relatives of semaglutide. Some of these drugs mimic multiple gut hormones rather than just one. One such molecule, tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro), mimics both GLP-1 and the gut hormone GIP. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes last year and for treating obesity in November, under the brand name Zepbound. The drug <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36857477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seems to cause even more weight loss than semaglutide</a>, Yanovski says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In demand</h3>



<p>Over the last few years, prescriptions for diabetes and weight-loss drugs  have skyrocketed in the United States. Semaglutide and a drug called liraglutide (approved in 2014) both mimic the gut hormone GLP-1. Semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) was approved to treat type 2 diabetes in December 2017 and for obesity (sold as Wegovy) in June 2021. Tirzepatide, which mimics GLP-1 plus the gut hormone GIP, was approved to treat type 2 diabetes (under the name Mounjaro) in May 2022.</p>

<p>Another drug in development could one-up even tirzepatide. Retatrutide simulates three gut hormones: GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. People treated with a high dose <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost an average of 24 percent of their body weight</a> after nearly a year of treatment, a small clinical trial reported this year.</p>



<p>The full roster of these drugs, what they do and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/12/new-weight-loss-drug-tracker-novo-nordisk-eli-lilly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where they stand in the approval process</a> makes for a dizzying array of information. But an assortment of options may pay off, Yanovski says. “We really need a variety of drugs … so that we can match the right treatment to the right patient.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">For some people, the benefits of weight-loss drugs outweigh the risks</h4>



<p>But like any medication, Yanovski cautions, these drugs come with side effects. Semaglutide can cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomachache and constipation, among other ailments. Large amounts of rapid weight loss can also spur gallbladder disease, a complication sometimes seen after bariatric surgery. And these medications aren’t melting away only fat. When people rapidly lose lots of weight, they can also lose muscle mass, a particular concern for older patients, Yanovski says.</p>



<p>As these drugs roll out into larger populations of people, rare side effects not seen in clinical trials will also emerge. One recent study found that people using semaglutide or a related drug for weight loss had <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2810542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal conditions</a>, including inflammation of the pancreas and bowel blockages, compared with people using a different type of weight-loss drug.</p>



<p>And patients will probably need to take these medications long term or risk gaining the weight back. “This is not a flaw in the medications; this is how medications work,” Yanovski says. If you stop taking cholesterol-lowering meds, for instance, your cholesterol may shoot up.</p>



<p>But the drugs’ high cost (Wegovy’s list price is about $1,350 per month and insurance coverage varies) puts even short-term use out of reach for many people. The cost can exacerbate health disparities and drive people to hunt for altered versions on the internet. Though these drugs may be cheaper, Yanovski says, they’re not FDA-approved and could be counterfeit.</p>



<p>She hopes to see people with obesity, particularly those with medical complications, gain better access to the approved drugs and in settings where they can be monitored by their doctors to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>



<p>Those without a true need for the drugs probably should avoid them, Yanovski says. They’re “serious medications for a serious disease,” she says. “I think the buzz that these are some kind of miracle cure for obesity, or that you should take these medications just because you want to lose that stubborn 10 pounds, is overhyped.”</p>

<p>Readers who have been with us for the long haul may remember we used to collect a catalog of our favorite <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/11/29/p-values-scientific-journals-top-ten-plagiarism-euphemisms/">euphemisms for plagiarism</a>. That list died with the demise of<em> Lab Times</em>, for which we used to write a regular column (although we did write <a href="https://www.egms.de/static/en/journals/mbi/2015-15/mbi000338.shtml">this piece</a> a bit later) – but the magazine’s passing did not mark the end of journals that speak with mealy mouths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest such euphemism to catch our eye comes from the <em>Journal of STEPS for Humanities and Social Sciences</em>, which in 2022 published a piece by a pair of authors in Iraq about trauma fiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.steps-journal.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=jshss">Trauma Reverberations: A Study of Selected Novels</a>,” appeared in 2022, and was written by Intisar Rashid Khaleel and Raed Idrees Mahmood, both of Tikrit University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the<a href="https://www.steps-journal.com/jshss/vol1/iss2/42/"> retraction notice</a>: </p>



<span id="more-128402"></span>

<p>But Masmoudi in an email told us the case was a matter of “flagrant plagiarism” – no mistake about it:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizards-snakes-horns-camouflage">Why do some lizards and snakes have horns?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Horns aren’t just for rhinos and cattle. A fair number of snake and lizard species have heads adorned with spiky, scaly accessories. But how the reptiles snag food may determine whether having horns is an asset or a liability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The overwhelming majority of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2023.0395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horned lizard and snake species lie in wait</a> and ambush their prey rather than chase it down, researchers report November 22 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. Horns and other protuberances potentially provide camouflage to largely static animals but could be costly to more active reptiles, possibly revealing the bearer’s presence to prey and predators alike, the scientists say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Squamates — lizards and snakes — have repeatedly evolved horns atop their heads, on their eyebrows and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nose-horned-dragon-lizard-lost-science-found">jutting out from their snouts</a> (<em>SN</em>: 6/9/20). Prior studies suggested these ornaments may have different functions, such as being used in courtship, defense or breaking up the body outline to evade detection. But Federico Banfi, a herpetologist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, and his colleagues wondered whether horns’ camouflage benefits still help animals that move around a lot when hunting. If not, or if horns hinder the animal’s movements, this might discourage the protuberances from evolving in more active species.</p>



<p>The team compiled previously published datasets that classified lizards and snakes as either sit-and-wait predators or active pursuers, yielding 1,939 different species with 175 that had horns — defined as projections of bone or keratin on the animal’s snout, eyebrows or head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team mapped the presence or absence of horns and the reptiles’ hunting style onto a previously published squamate evolutionary tree, finding the projections evolved independently about 69 times. Sure enough, horns were much more common in sit-and-wait predators than in their more active counterparts. Of horned squamates, 164 — 94 percent — were also relatively stationary ambush hunters, with just 11 — 6 percent — categorized as active predators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horns might be a boon for some species, but a burden in others, Banfi says. “Animals that need to move a lot may be disadvantaged by possessing large appendages over their heads. These might make them more conspicuous to prey and predators because a structure that enlarges their head and silhouette may render them more visible while moving.”</p>



<p>The idea makes sense, says Theo Busschau, an evolutionary biologist at New York University Abu Dhabi. Busschau and a colleague published findings in 2022 that linked habitat preferences with different horn types in vipers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If weird protuberances aren’t a cost to sit-and-wait predators, they might passively persist in a population for a long time, he says.</p>



<p>“Over evolutionary time, there may be selection for these projections to form horns that could increase an organism’s fitness by enhanced camouflage, defense or mate selection,” Busschau says. It’s important to consider the costs as well as the benefits when studying the evolution of a certain trait, and that there are trade-offs that might depend on an organism’s unique lifestyle.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in the few exceptions where prey-chasing species have horns, “the benefits of having horns may simply outweigh the potential costs experienced by other active foraging reptiles,” Busschau says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Banfi thinks there are plenty of opportunities to delve into why horns do or don’t appear in the animal kingdom. For instance, the viper <em>Cerastes cerastes</em> lays eggs that sometimes hatch a mix of horned and hornless offspring, and it’s not clear why. And some amphibians and invertebrates have hornlike structures, so researchers could test whether feeding strategies could be a factor there, too.</p>



<p>The work Busschau would like to see done is directly testing the hypothetical evolutionary trade-offs animals make with their horns. “So far, the potential advantages and costs of horns in reptiles are only hypotheses,” Busschau says. It won’t be easy testing all these ideas, he says, but it could help researchers find the evolutionary roots of this wild headgear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/verve-101-gene-editing-ldl-cholesterol-base-editing">A gene editing technique shows promise for lowering LDL cholesterol </a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHILADELPHIA ­</strong>—&nbsp;Ten patients enrolled in the experimental drug trial, and they were the sickest of the sick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All had a genetic disorder that cranks up levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Known as “bad cholesterol,” LDL cholesterol is infamous for clogging arteries. The patients’ disorder, called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, can lead to severe heart disease at an early age — and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their arteries had been bathing in high LDL cholesterol since birth. In several patients, even typical cholesterol-lowering drugs couldn’t get the levels “even remotely under control,” says Andrew Bellinger, a cardiologist and chief scientific officer at Verve Therapeutics, a Boston-based biotechnology company.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Now, his team has tried a new approach: a genetic medicine called VERVE-101 designed to turn off a cholesterol-raising gene. Using a kind of molecular pencil, the medicine erases one DNA letter and writes in another, inactivating the gene. A single genetic change. A single medication. A potential treatment that lasts a lifetime.</p>



<p>That’s the hope, anyway. Bellinger presented the results of a small clinical trial called heart-1 at the American Heart Association meeting in November. VERVE-101 successfully lowered LDL cholesterol, Bellinger reported. It’s the first time anyone has shown that a DNA spelling change made inside a person’s body could have such an effect. “We can achieve clinically meaningful LDL reductions with a single dose,” he said.</p>



<p>People with familial hypercholesterolemia have lifelong symptoms, so “this whole concept of ‘one and done’ is really amazing,” says Pam Taub, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the trial. These patients must take medications their entire lives. An infused drug like VERVE-101 — designed to alter a person’s DNA — could change treatment strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taub points out questions about VERVE-101’s safety. One trial patient had a heart attack. Another died due to cardiac arrest.&nbsp;But that death was not related to treatment, Bellinger said.</p>



<p>Moving forward, establishing VERVE-101’s safety is crucial, agreed Karol Watson, a cardiologist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA who wasn’t involved with the new work.&nbsp;Editing people’s DNA to lower their cholesterol “is a strategy that could be revolutionary, but we have to make sure it’s safe,” she said at the meeting. “You are changing the genome forever.”</p>



<p>Here’s what we know about four key aspects of the new medicine and its history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">VERVE-101 relies on a DNA-modifying protein called a base editor&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The composition of VERVE-101 is simple. It’s just two types of RNA molecules — molecular cousins of DNA — bundled inside a bubble of fat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infused into the bloodstream, the drug travels to the liver and slips into cells.&nbsp;One of the RNA molecules tells cells to build a protein called an adenine base editor. The other acts as a genetic GPS, guiding the editor protein to the correct stretch of DNA.</p>

<p>The technology is CRISPR 2.0.&nbsp;First generation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials">CRISPR/Cas9 tools act like molecular scissors</a>&nbsp;and can disrupt genes&nbsp;by snipping through DNA’s strands (<em>SN: 8/14/19</em>). Base editors are more like&nbsp;molecular pencils. They edit DNA by performing chemistry on an individual DNA letter, or base,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-crispr-gene-editors-can-fix-rna-and-dna-one-typo-time">rewriting one for another</a>, creating a new genetic sequence (<em>SN: 10/25/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Base editors actually change a&nbsp;sequence that you choose into a different sequence of your choosing,” says Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator David Liu, a chemist at&nbsp;Harvard University whose team&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invented the technology in 2016</a>.&nbsp;In the case of VERVE-101, that sequence is inside the&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;gene, which encodes instructions for manufacturing a protein that raises blood cholesterol levels. Just one edit in a precise location shuts&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;down.</p>



<p>Editing wraps up less than a week after the infusion, and the drug breaks down rapidly, Bellinger said. Both the fat bubble, called a lipid nanoparticle, and its RNA cargo degrade, and within a few weeks, VERVE-101 vanishes from the body. “The only thing that’s left is the DNA change you made to the&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;gene,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;is a tempting target for gene-editing therapy&nbsp;</h4>



<p><em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;has been a hot therapeutic target for the last decade or so, says Parag Joshi, a preventive cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who was not part of the trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers knew that some people have&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;mutations that switch the gene off. These people tended to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa054013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower levels of LDL cholesterol — and drastically less heart disease</a>, geneticist Helen Hobbs, an HHMI investigator at UT Southwestern Medical Center, and colleagues reported in 2006.</p>



<p>That landmark study pushed the field forward, Joshi says. Suddenly, scientists had proof that people could live healthy lives when&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;was inactivated. That made it “a very attractive drug target,” Joshi says. It suggested that disabling&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;would do no harm — and could even help, by lowering the risk of heart disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, the PCSK9 protein breaks down another protein called the LDL receptor. This receptor is one of the good guys; it keeps bad cholesterol in check by snatching it from the blood and transporting it into liver cells for disposal. Without enough LDL receptors, LDL cholesterol levels in the blood ratchet up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist and Verve’s CEO and cofounder puts it succinctly:&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>&nbsp;causes disease. “If you turn it off, all you get is health.”</p>



<p>Today, a few existing therapies target PCSK9, including injected antibodies or an RNA-based drug that shuts down production of the protein. Patients should take a daily statin pill to lower LDL cholesterol, Joshi says. But it’s often not enough.&nbsp;</p>





<p>And though the therapies are theoretically effective for people with familial&nbsp;hypercholesterolemia, Kathiresan says, “very few patients are actually on these medications.”</p>



<p>His team thinks that’s because the current approach is just too heavy a burden — asking patients to take daily pills or intermittent injections for decades. “That model doesn’t seem to be working,” Kathiresan says. “And that’s what we’re trying to fix.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Early VERVE-101 clinical trial results reveal potential benefits&nbsp;—&nbsp;and risks&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Kathiresan’s team gave a single IV infusion of VERVE-101 to 10 people with heterozygous familial&nbsp;hypercholesterolemia, most of whom had severe heart disease. In those who received the highest drug doses tested, blood levels of LDL cholesterol dropped sharply, by 39 to 55 percent. And the drop appears long-lasting, Bellinger said. For the patient at the highest dose, LDL cholesterol levels held steady for 180 days after VERVE-101 infused into the bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Steep reductions</h3>



<p>In a clinical trial with 10 participants, people who received the highest doses of VERVE-101 tested (green and purple dots) saw steep reductions in the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood.</p>

<p>Bellinger called the results “pretty much what we expected and planned,” given&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34012082/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team’s earlier results in nonhuman primates</a>. But the new patient data, though preliminary, places the drug on the precipice of something bigger. “This opens the door for an entirely new way to treat heart disease,” Kathiresan says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>VERVE-101’s utility will ultimately depend on its safety. During the trial, the team spotted some potential red flags. Four patients had minor reactions to the IV infusion, including headache and mild fever. But at the heart meeting, attention hummed over something more severe. A day after the infusion, one patient had a heart attack. Five weeks after the infusion, a different patient&nbsp;died when their heart suddenly stopped beating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That incident was probably caused by the patients’ underlying heart disease,&nbsp;Kathiresan&nbsp;says. That’s the conclusion reached by an independent data safety monitoring board that investigated the cases, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heart attack, however, may have been related to the treatment, because it happened so soon after dosing, the monitoring board determined. Kathiresan notes, though, that the patient had been experiencing chest pains prior to the study, something they didn’t mention to the study’s investigators.</p>



<p>These are “very, very sick patients,” says UCSD cardiologist Taub. For future trials with the drug, she thinks such patients should be excluded.</p>



<p>Kathiresan’s team is now planning to enroll patients with less-advanced disease. They’re also going to check for blockages in patients’ arteries, to try and avoid including people at extremely high risk of heart attack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright has-text-align-right"><blockquote><p>“This opens the door for an entirely new way to treat heart disease.”</p><cite>Sekar Kathiresan, Verve Therapeutics CEO and cofounder</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In 2024, the company plans to enroll more patients at the two highest doses to determine which dose to move forward. The researchers are also testing a second version of the drug, VERVE-102, which uses a different lipid nanoparticle. Depending on those results, Verve plans to move one of the drugs on to a larger clinical trial in 2025. And if successful in people with familial&nbsp;hypercholesterolemia, the company intends to expand to an even broader group of patients, including those without the genetic disorder.</p>



<p>Developing new medicines is a long road, Kathiresan says. It can take more than a decade for a drug to go from a concept to a medication that doctors can prescribe, he says. Verve started its&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>-editing project in 2018. Kathiresan says he hopes to have an approved medication by the end of the decade.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">VERVE-101 is one of several base editing drugs currently in clinical trials</h4>



<p>One potential side effect of gene-editing therapies is unintentional tweaks to DNA. VERVE-101 targets&nbsp;<em>PCSK9</em>, but what if it strays to a different spot in the genome, asks Anne Goldberg, an endocrinologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&nbsp;The technology “looks really interesting,” she says, “but we need more data.”</p>



<p>A DNA change at the wrong spot could put people at risk of developing cancer. With VERVE-101, Bellinger said, “we think that risk is very low.” Most of the company’s work, he said, goes into demonstrating that “we do not make edits elsewhere in the genome.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s base editors — including the one in VERVE-101 — are much improved since the early days of the technology, says Harvard’s Liu, who was not involved with the trial. They “have very high on-target editing efficiency while also having minimal off-target editing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, five other base-editing clinical trials targeting other diseases, like sickle-cell disease and leukemia, are ongoing. Liu is hopeful that the gene-editing agents will give patients “a completely new lease on life.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bellinger said his team thinks of VERVE-101 as a one-time procedure for health, like “molecular surgery without a scalpel.” In theory, it’s possible to reverse the edit made by VERVE-101, but it’s not what he and his colleagues envision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For&nbsp;cardiologist Donald Lloyd-Jones, who was not involved with the trial, the dream is to offer people with&nbsp;familial hypercholesterolemia&nbsp;a treatment that doesn’t rely on taking a statin pill every single day. A therapy like VERVE-101 “might be something they really consider as an option,” said Lloyd-Jones, of&nbsp;Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p>



<p>“If we get those safety data, if we get those efficacy data,” he said at the meeting, “I think this would be a very interesting approach to a lifetime fix.”</p>

<p>A journal that lost its impact factor and spot in a major index this year has made good on a promise to retract dozens of papers with “compromised” peer review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dgsgenetika.org.rs/publications/journals-genetika/"><em>Genetika</em></a>, a publication of the Serbian Genetics Society, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">did not receive an updated impact factor</a> this year after Clarivate, the company behind the closely-watched but controversial metric, identified signs of citation stacking, a practice in which authors or journals <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">seem to trade citations</a>. Clarivate also dropped <em>Genetika</em> from its Web of Science index for failing to meet editorial quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate’s actions followed a blog post by scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik about what she called the “<a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2022/09/15/the-iranian-plants-paper-mill/">Iranian Plant Paper Mill</a>, which included <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSJa5OCqYVVhSd10NN6mvI73Ra0Pfjwx3aMLwHtgGAI/edit?usp=sharing">31 papers</a> published in <em>Genetika</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128396"></span>



<p>Snežana Mladenović Drinić, the editor of <em>Genetika</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/17/journal-to-retract-papers-that-cost-its-impact-factor/">previously told Retraction Watch</a> the journal would retract “papers for which it was determined that the peer review was not done validly.” Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, also said <em>Genetika</em> had offered to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, in the hopes of salvaging their standing with Clarivate.</p>



<p>In its latest issue, <em>Genetika </em><a href="https://doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0534-0012/2023/0534-00122302791E.pdf">published a notice</a> retracting 31 articles and a corrigendum “due to evidence indicating that the peer review of this paper was compromised, using of frauted [sic] data, high number of unfitting citation, overoll [sic] general misconduct related to professional codes of ethics.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list largely overlaps with Bik’s, and includes five papers for which Clarivate had provided “evidence of inappropriate manipulation of citations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors and reviewers of the retracted papers, as well as “authors who misused the papers published in <em>Genetika</em> by citing them unjustifiably” will be blacklisted from publishing in the journal in the future, according to the notice. It stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would like to apologize [sic] authors, readers and all scientific community that we are having to make those retractions, and we will take all necessary steps to ensure our editorial and peer review processes keep pace with the evolving threat and advancements in scientific fraud.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Drinić and Milasin have not responded to our request for comment.</p>



<p>The five papers with manipulated citations all included M. Khayatnezhad as a coauthor. Khayatnezhad previously held a position in the environmental science and engineering department at the Islamic Azad University’s Ardabil branch in Iran, and also was managing editor of the university’s journal <em>Anthropogenic Pollution</em>. The journal now has a <a href="https://ap.ardabil.iau.ir/journal/editorial.board">different managing editor</a>, and an email we sent to Khayatnezhad’s university address bounced back. He did not respond to our request for comment sent to another address.</p>



<p>Update, 1600 UTC, 12/13/23: After this article was published, Khayatnezhad responded to our email. </p>



<p>&#8220;The claim that the citations are manipulated is very cruel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our mistake was choosing this publication, which made us not notice the things that might be wrong, and now the editor is retracting articles and publishing lies about us in order to correct and justify his mistake.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no escape from what has happened. And I declare that the weak editor and the Journal caused these incidents. Everyone sends an article, they print it, and this is the result.&#8221; </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-images-2023">The James Webb telescope took some stunning images in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This year, the James Webb Space Telescope celebrated its first full year of operation, during which it returned a treasure trove of images. And it’s just getting started.</p>



<p>Since it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first began sending pictures back</a> home in July 2022 from its location 1.5 million kilometers beyond Earth’s orbit, JWST has peered deeper in space and farther back in time than any previous telescope could manage (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). Hundreds of scientific papers have already been published based on JWST images, barely a year and a half into the telescope’s planned 10-year lifetime.</p>





<p>But JWST may end up having much more than a decade to study the cosmos. Thanks to a perfect launch, the mission was left with far more fuel to point the telescope than expected, astrophysicist Jane Rigby of NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in September at the First Year of JWST Science Conference in Baltimore. “Now we have more than 25 years of propellant.”</p>



<p>If the first 18 months of JWST science are any indication, the telescope could be ushering in a decades-long golden age for astronomy. Here&#8217;s just a few of the things JWST showed us in 2023.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A closer look at the nearest stellar nursery</h4>



<p>The swirling <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-stars-are-born">Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex</a> is a dusty delivery room packed with about 50 young stars comparable in size to our sun or smaller (<em>SN: 2/18/08</em>). These infants were born when gas and dust in the cloud condensed in quantities large enough for gravity to kick-start the fusion reactions that burn in the hearts of stars.</p>

<p>In an image that JWST collected of the stellar nursery in July, the very youngest stars are still ensconced in dark regions across the top and down the right. Infant stars announce themselves with jets of hydrogen molecules that appear as streaks of long wavelength infrared light, colored red in this depiction, that result when the new stars develop.</p>



<p>The JWST image is clear enough to reveal shadows around some of the stars that could be dusty disks like the one that encircled our sun when it was young. Those disks in turn are where planets are born. Our own sun started out in the same sort of stellar nursery 4.6 billion years ago.</p>



<p>At 390 light-years from Earth, Rho Ophiuchi is the closest stellar nursery to us. Because there are no stars between us and the nursery, JWST has a front row seat to let us see the birth and early lives of stars much like the sun.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Could it be twins?</h4>



<p>Glowing columns bracket what seems to be a young star that’s destined to grow to eventually rival our sun in size. The jets, designated HH 211, are about 1,000 light-years from Earth and embedded in the cloud of dust that bore the star. These columns are visible because the jets of gas that young stars emit in the early stages of their lives ram into the dust nearby at supersonic speeds.</p>

<p>The images of the jets captured with JWST’s infrared cameras have up to 10 times the resolution of any previous pictures of HH 211. Ripples along the center of the outflows hint that HH 211 may in fact be twins — a pair of young stars orbiting each other — instead of a lone star.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Watching the weather on a ringed ice giant</h4>



<p>Even in a brief, 12-minute exposure with JWST cameras, there are signs that it was a cloudy day in at least a few places on giant, icy Uranus. This view of the planet’s north pole, taken in February, is possible because Uranus is tilted on its side. The overhead perspective makes the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">faint inner rings</a> visible with unprecedented resolution (<em>SN: 9/23/22</em>). Other notable features include a pair of bright spots in the planet’s atmosphere that appear to be clouds, and a large, misty-looking polar cap.</p>

<p>The polar cap seems to form only as the orbit of Uranus exposes the north pole to the sun, and it fades away as the planet continues on its way. What the cap is, and why it’s present only when the pole faces the sun, is not yet clear. Future JWST studies and longer photographic exposures could solve the puzzle, along with giving us additional stunning views of the icy blue giant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Elements for life in the Orion Nebula</h4>



<p>Signs of chemicals crucial for the formation of life have turned up in the disk of dust around a star deep in a portion of the Orion Nebula known as the Orion Bar. Although too small to be visible in this image of the nebula that JWST captured in June, the disk surrounds a dwarf red star designated d203-506.</p>

<p>The cool, red star isn’t much like our sun, but it exists in harsh conditions similar to the ones that our sun probably experienced early in life, thanks to the radiation bathing it from young, hot stars nearby. JWST detected a carbon and hydrogen compound in the red star’s disk that suggests chemicals important for the development of life can withstand the intense radiation in stellar nurseries.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the radiation that many researchers thought would disrupt organic molecules may instead provide the energy needed to create the chemicals that are the building blocks of life.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Peering into the heart of the crab</h4>



<p>There is a small bright dot near the middle of the Crab Nebula in this JWST image released in October. The dot is a tiny, immensely dense neutron star that was left behind after a supernova explosion that appeared in Earth’s sky in the year 1054. The neutron star has intense magnetic fields that whip around as it spins, seemingly stirring up a smoky cloud.</p>

<p>The wispy, white features are not smoke, but radiation that results when the neutron star’s magnetic fields accelerate electrons to super high speeds, close to the speed of light. The fine structure in the nebula’s image shows curving white rows that mark the lines of the magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The Crab Nebula’s entire origin story is not yet clear, but the details that JWST’s infrared cameras provide, in conjunction with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsars-cosmic-rays-high-energy-universe-particles-light">images from the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories</a>, are helping astronomers to piece the Crab’s backstory together (<em>SN: 5/23/22</em>).</p>



<p>These five images hint at what we’re likely to see from JWST over the next quarter century of observations. “Trying to keep pace with the results coming from JWST can be a daunting and challenging task,” said astronomer Marc Postman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore at the September conference. “The sheer volume and diversity of discoveries are both exhilarating and challenging. And that&#8217;s precisely the kind of challenge we love to embrace.”</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The ways in which we perceive and engage with the world are influenced by internal bodily processes such as heartbeats, respiration and digestion. Cardiac activity can influence auditory and visual perception, and touch and sensory perceptions have been shown to be impaired during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle when blood vessels are briefly distended.</p>



<p>Esra Al of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Germany, and colleagues, wanted to understand whether there were changes in cortical and corticospinal excitability &mdash; the ability to respond to stimuli &mdash; across the cardiac cycle. 37 healthy human volunteers aged between 18 and 40 years received a series of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses &mdash; non-invasive short magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells &mdash; above the right side of the brain.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></p>



<p>Motor and cortical responses as well as heartbeats were measured during the pulses and the authors found that higher excitability was recorded during the systolic phase. These simultaneous recordings of brain activity, heart activity, and muscle activity, suggest the timing of heartbeats and their neural processing are linked to changes in the excitability of the motor system.</p>



<p>TMS is used in treatments for depression and recovery after stroke. The research raises questions about whether these could be fine-tuned to improve results, as well as contributing to a greater understanding of brain-body interactions in health and in disease.</p>



<p>The authors add, &ldquo;Intriguingly, this study uncovers a remarkable connection between the human heart and brain, revealing distinct time windows tailored for action and perception.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cop28-headlines-methane">COP28 is making headlines. Here’s why the focus on methane matters</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year’s United Nations’ annual climate summit, dubbed COP28, is making a lot of headlines — not something I would have found myself writing a few years ago.</p>



<p>One reason for COP’s higher profile is a growing sense of urgency to take stronger action to reduce humans’ fossil fuel emissions and mitigate the looming climate crisis. The world is nowhere near on track to meet the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement</a> — that is, reducing greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius of preindustrial averages by the year 2100 (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-heat-hottest-year-record-2023">2023 has been the hottest year on record</a>, people have been suffering through a barrage of extreme weather events, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">including heat waves</a>, droughts and floods, and 2024 is likely to break more temperature records (<em>SN: 12/6/23; SN: 7/19/23</em>).</p>





<p>The headlines emerging from COP28 have been a mix of pleasing, frustrating and bewildering. For example: It’s good news that 198 nations have ratified the Loss and Damage Fund, a formal acknowledgment by wealthy, high-polluting nations that they should help mitigate the rising costs of climate change faced by developing nations. But it’s frustrating that the pledges by the wealthy nations so far amount to just about $725 million, less than 0.2 percent of the annual climate change–linked losses faced by developing nations.</p>



<p>For me, one of the biggest questions related to those headlines pertains to methane. It feels unclear whether, on balance, there’s more good or bad news when it comes to emissions of that <em>second</em> most important human-caused greenhouse gas.</p>



<p>Methane is a powerhouse climate-warming gas, with about 80 times the atmosphere-warming potential of carbon dioxide. However, methane has a saving grace: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">It mercifully lingers for only about a decade in the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). Carbon dioxide can stick around for up to 1,000 years. Cutting methane emissions can mean its atmospheric concentration drops relatively rapidly.</p>



<p>The Global Methane Pledge, launched two years ago at COP26, may be gaining some momentum, but it still lacks the sign-on of key big-emitting nations. Then there’s the December 1 announcement by 49 oil and gas companies that they would reduce methane leaks from their infrastructure to “near zero” by 2030, which seems like a good thing on the face of it but has also been called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-corporate-greenwashing-environment-climate">greenwashing</a> (<em>SN: 11/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>And all of this policy wrangling is happening against a bizarre backdrop: a startling, puzzling, worrisome <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GB007875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharp increase in methane emissions</a> over the last decade — not from humans, but from natural sources, particularly wetlands.</p>



<p>To help me sift through the headlines and better understand all the news that’s seeping out, I talked with Euan Nisbet, a geochemist at Royal Holloway, University of London in Egham.</p>



<p>Methane “is rising very fast,” Nisbet says. “So fast it looks like the Paris Agreement is going to fail.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Countries are promising to cut methane emissions</h4>



<p>While the rise in natural methane emissions is worrisome, about 60 percent of current methane emissions into the atmosphere still comes from human activities. Methane doesn’t just <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abf9c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seep out of leaky oil and gas pipelines or get pumped into the air during coal</a> combustion. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">Agriculture, including ruminant animals</a>, are a big source (<em>SN: 5/5/22</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-landfills-are-belching-high-levels-climate-warming-methane">Landfills are another</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>That’s where the Global Methane Pledge comes in, promising a 30 percent cut in humans&#8217; emissions by 2030. The pledge was spearheaded in 2021 by the United States and the European Union, and so far, 150 nations have signed on. Most recently, Turkmenistan, which has sizable methane emissions, joined. So there’s hope: If everyone were to follow suit, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn0134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it really is possible to cut global methane emissions deeply</a>, bringing us much closer to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals, Nisbet argues in a Dec. 8 editorial in <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Still, many of the world’s biggest methane emitters, including China, India, Russia, Iran and South Africa, have not signed on to the pledge. China’s methane comes in large part from its coal combustion; India’s, from coal as well as waste heaps and biomass fires. And China alone currently releases an estimated 65 million metric tons of methane per year, more than double that of the United States or India, the next two biggest emitters.</p>



<p>With only seven years left before the 2030 deadline, meeting the global pledge’s methane reduction goals would be steep — but, Nisbet says, not impossible.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is methane rising?</h4>



<p>Since about 2007, the amount of methane emitted into Earth’s atmosphere has increased dramatically. About 60 percent of the methane currently emitted comes from human sources, but emissions from wetlands, likely as feedback to climate change, are helping to drive this rise. &nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Methane emissions have risen sharply in recent years</h5>

<p>There’s precedent for successfully making such steep cuts to methane in such a short time, he adds. During the 2000s, “there was a seven-year period where [the U.K. government] brought methane emissions down by 30 percent,” in large part by reducing emissions from landfills and gas leaks. </p>



<p>China has just released its own Methane Emissions Control Action Plan in November, alongside a joint commitment between China and the United States to take action on methane.&nbsp;That news sounds potentially promising, if not wholly reassuring, as the plan does not include a lot of concrete numbers, Nisbet says. </p>





<p>So, what about the oil and gas industry’s recent promise to address its leaky infrastructure? Such a promise also sounds positive on the face of it — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-locate-methane-ultra-emitters">leaky infrastructure</a> is definitely the low-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing humans’ methane emissions to the atmosphere (<em>SN: 2/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://priceofoil.org/2023/12/01/ogda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of scientific and environmental organizations</a> have signed an open letter in response. The letter suggests that the oil and gas industry’ promise is just greenwashing, “a smokescreen to hide the reality that we need to phase out oil, gas and coal,” the letter states. Furthermore, many oil and gas companies may <a href="https://jpt.spe.org/gas-companies-are-abandoning-their-wells-leaving-them-leak-methane-forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely abandon old, still-leaking wells</a> — effectively eliminating those leaks from their company’s emissions roster without actually stopping them.</p>



<p>That said, addressing the leaks does have to be done, Nisbet says. “I’d love to shut down the coal industry quickly, but I’m aware of the enormous social problems that brings. It’s a very difficult thing to nuance. You can’t go cold turkey. We’ve got to wind it down in an intelligent and collaborative way. The best thing to do is to stop the crazy leaks and venting.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Natural methane emission has been surging</h4>



<p>Plugging the leaks as soon as possible has taken on an increasing urgency, Nisbet says, because of a stark rise in natural methane being emitted to the atmosphere. Why this rise is happening isn’t clear, but it seems to be some sort of climate change–related feedback, perhaps linked to changes in both temperature and precipitation.</p>



<p>That natural methane emissions bump was also not something that the architects of the Paris Agreement saw coming. Most of that rise has happened since the agreement was signed. From 1999 to 2006, atmospheric methane had spent several years in near-equilibrium — elevated due to human activities, but relatively stable. Then, in 2007, atmospheric methane concentrations began to increase. In 2013, there was a particularly sharp rise, and then again in 2020.</p>



<p>Much of that increase seems to have come from tropical wetlands. Over the past decade, researchers have tracked shifts in methane sources by measuring carbon-12 and carbon-13 in the gas. The ratio of those two forms of carbon in the methane varies significantly depending on the source of the gas. Fossil fuel-derived methane tends to have higher concentrations of carbon-13 relative to carbon-12; methane from wetlands or agriculture tends to be more enriched in carbon-12.</p>



<p>The recent spikes in natural methane are eerily <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GB007875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminiscent of ice core records of “glacial termination” events</a>, times in Earth’s deep past when the world abruptly shifted from a glacial period to a period of rapid warming, Nisbet and others reported in June in<em> Global Biogeochemical Cycles</em>. Such glacial termination events are large-scale reorganizations of the ocean-atmosphere system, involving dramatic changes to the circulation of the global ocean, as well as to large climate patterns like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-may-make-australia-wildfires-more-common">Indian Ocean Dipole</a> (<em>SN: 1/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>“Is this comparable to the start of a termination event? It looks horribly like that,” Nisbet says. But “it may not be. It might be totally innocent.”</p>



<p>Right now, scientists are racing to understand what’s happening with the natural methane bump, and how exactly the increased emissions might be linked to climate change. But as we search for those answers, there is something that humans can and must do in the meantime, he says: Cut human emissions of the gas as much as possible, as fast as possible. “It’s very simple. When you’re in a hole, stop digging.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/generative-ai-chatgpt-safety">Generative AI grabbed headlines this year. Here’s why and what’s next</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask ChatGPT “Why is the sky blue?” and seconds later, it will tell you: “The blue color of the sky is primarily due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering,” which the chatbot goes on to explain in a textbook-like, six-paragraph response. Follow up with, “Explain like I am 5 and make it short, please,” and back will come: “The sky is blue because tiny things in the air make the blue light from the sun bounce around and come to our eyes.”</p>



<p>ChatGPT is a type of generative AI. It’s a computer model that taps into language patterns to predict the next words in a sentence, answering a user’s prompt with a humanlike response. The model is structured with many layers of interconnected nodes, vaguely inspired by neural connections in the brain. During a training period, the interconnected nodes ran through billions of pieces of writing scraped from the internet, learning patterns by changing the strength of different node connections. Other types of generative AI have been trained to make images, videos and more.</p>





<p>Released late last year, ChatGPT quickly captivated public imagination, raising the visibility of generative AI. More chatbots, such as Google’s Bard, followed. But amid the buzz, critics have warned of generative AI’s inaccuracies, biases and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chatgpt-ai-artificial-intelligence-education-cheating-accuracy">plagiarism</a> (<em>SN</em>: 4/12/23). And then in mid-November, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT and other generative AI models such as DALL-E 3, was fired, and then rehired days later. In response, most of the company’s board resigned. The upheaval sparked widespread discussion about rushing to commercialize generative AI without taking precautions to build in safety measures to ensure the technology doesn’t cause harm. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand how generative AI came to dominate headlines and what’s next, <em>Science News </em>spoke with Melanie Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute, one of the world’s leading AI experts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why was generative AI big this year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: We have had language models for many years. But the breakthrough with systems like ChatGPT is that they had much more training to be a dialog partner and assistant. They were trained on much more data. And they had many more connections, on the order of billions to trillions. They also were presented to the public with a very easy-to-use interface. Those things really were what made them take off, and people were just amazed at how humanlike they seemed.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Where do you think generative AI will have the greatest impact?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: That’s still a big open question. I can put in a prompt to ChatGPT, say please write an abstract for my paper that has these points in it, and it will spit out an abstract that’s often pretty good. As an assistant, it is incredibly helpful. For generative im- ages, systems can produce stock images. You can just say I need an image of a robot walking a dog, and it will generate that. But these systems are not perfect. They make mistakes. They sometimes “hallucinate.” If I ask ChatGPT to write an essay on some topic and also to include some citations, sometimes it will make up citations that don’t exist. And it may also generate text that is just not true.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Are there other concerns?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: They require a lot of energy. They run in giant data centers with huge numbers of computers that need a lot of electricity, that use a lot of water for cooling. So there is an environmental impact.These systems have been trained on human language, and human society has a lot of biases that get reflected in the language these systems have absorbed — racial, gender and other demographic biases.</p>



<p>There was an article recently that described how people were trying to get a text-image system to generate a picture of a Black doctor treating white children. And it was very hard to get it to generate that.</p>



<p>There are a lot of claims about these systems having certain capabilities in reasoning, like being able to solve math problems or pass standardized tests like the bar exam. We don’t really have a sense of how they are doing this reasoning, whether that reasoning is robust. If you change the problem a little bit, will they still be able to solve it? It’s unclear whether these systems can generalize beyond what they have been trained on or whether they are just relying very much on the training data. That’s a big debate.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What do you think about the hype?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: People have to be aware that AI is a field that tends to get hyped, ever since its beginning in the 1950s, and to be somewhat skeptical of claims. We have seen again and again those claims are very much overblown. These are not humans. Even though they seem humanlike, they are different in many ways. People should see them as a tool to augment our human intelligence, not replace it — and make sure there’s a human in the loop rather than giving them too much autonomy.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What implications might the recent upheaval at OpenAI have for the generative AI landscape?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: [The upheaval] shows something that we already knew. There is a kind of polarization in the AI community, both in terms of research and in terms of commercial AI, about how we should think about AI safety — how fast these AI systems should be released to the public and what guardrails are necessary. I think it makes it very clear that we should not be relying on big companies in which power is concentrated right now to make these huge decisions about how AI systems should be safeguarded. We really do need independent people, for instance, government regulation or independent ethics boards, to have more power.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What do you hope happens next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mitchell</strong>: We are in a bit of a state of uncertainty of what these systems are and what they can do, and how they will evolve. I hope that we figure out some reasonable regulation that mitigates possible harms but doesn’t clamp down too hard on what could be a very beneficial technology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dwarf-star-light-origin-life">How tiny red stars can test ideas about the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>A survey of small, cool stars is helping to narrow in on the conditions that might set the stage for life beyond our solar system.</p>



<p>A look at about 200 ultracool dwarf stars shows that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad3720/7457743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they lack sufficient ultraviolet light</a> intensity to have the potential to jump-start life, researchers report December 1 in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. That may initially seem to be bad news for finding signs of alien life on distant planets. But the diminutive stars could instead serve as test beds to determine what other conditions can create the chemical foundations of life.</p>





<p>Compared with our sun, the dwarf stars in the new study are minuscule, roughly the size of Jupiter and weighing about a tenth as much as the sun. They’re also among the most common types of stars. And because they’re cool and comparatively dim, it’s often easier to spot planets orbiting them than it is in the glare of large bright stars. Astronomers studying the tiny red star TRAPPIST-1, for example, found that it hosts seven Earth-sized planets, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star">three that may be within the star’s habitable zone</a>, where conditions are amenable to life (<em>SN: 2/22/17</em>).</p>



<p>For life to exist on a habitable planet, though, it must start somehow. One possibility is that UV starlight provides the energy needed to link together the hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and other atoms that make up the compounds that are precursors to life.</p>



<p>With that in mind, space scientist Antígona Segura and colleagues used the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/launch-tess-nasa-boost-search-exoplanets">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> to measure the amount of UV radiation — among other things — emitted from 208 comparatively nearby ultracool dwarfs within 130 light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). The stars they studied do emit UV light, as our sun does, and many produce bursts of UV when they let off flares. But overall, the UV energy the small stars release is too low to forge the chemicals needed to kick-start life, the team found.</p>



<p>The dearth of UV light doesn’t necessarily quash hopes of finding life around such stars. “UV is an energy source for prebiotic chemistry that we can measure, and that is why we focused on it,” says Segura, of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. “But there are many other energy sources, like cosmic and stellar particles, and particles, radiation and heat produced by radioactive decay, to name a few.”</p>



<p>Ultracool stars might be useful to discover whether something other than UV light can get life going. “We should search for life on the planets that have the least [UV] activity, where we can know with confidence that UV-driven prebiotic chemistry cannot happen,” says Paul Rimmer, a University of Cambridge astrophysicist who was not involved in the study. “If we find evidence of life on these [types of] planets, this will show that there are other paths to life.”</p>



<p>Also, Segura notes, sources of energy that could start life can also make planets less habitable for more complex life-forms. “We cannot currently say which [effects] would prevail. The best approach now is to study case by case and wait for more observational constraints, like for the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system.”</p>



<p>If astronomers eventually find life on planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs, it will confirm the potential for UV-free origins of life. But, Rimmer says, if it turns out that there are no signs of habitability on planets around the many small, dim dwarf stars we see, that would lower estimates of the likelihood of finding life outside our solar system. Either way, future surveys of ultracool dwarf stars could give researchers a better handle on the possible prevalence of extraterrestrial life in the universe.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Mahsa Aliakbarzadeh will talk about her work in the talk entitled &quot;Rehabilitation Robotics Using Cerebellar Controller&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every
year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke
patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance
with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is like learning new motor
skills, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict
the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning. Rehabilitation robotics has shown
promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance.
However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge
to date. I will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is to optimise robotic
rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout
vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular
structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm.</p>

<p>After bankrolling archeological work on a prehistoric site discovered during construction, a state department of transportation has successfully lobbied to retract an article about the researchers’ findings officials said were “published prematurely.”</p>



<p>The whole process was “a bit of a surprise” for the paper’s co-authors, said <a href="https://about.illinoisstate.edu/glmill1/">Logan Miller</a>, one of the authors and an archeology professor at Illinois State University. He and lead author David Leslie both told Retraction Watch they stand by the article’s findings, but declined to comment further about the retraction.</p>



<p>Their research began in 2019, when the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) wanted to replace a bridge in the town of Avon. When construction workers started digging into the old bridge’s foundations, however, they discovered thousands of ancient objects from the Paleoindians, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/archeological-time-periods.htm">earliest known people</a> to live in New England. CTDOT temporarily halted the work and contracted an archaeology firm to excavate the site.</p>



<span id="more-128387"></span>



<p>This January, two archeologists, including the researcher who oversaw the excavation, published an article in Taylor &amp; Francis’ <em>PaleoAmerica</em> detailing a perforated rock pendant found there. The article, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20555563.2022.2157930">Early Paleoindian Personal Adornment: An example from the Brian D. Jones Site in Avon, Connecticut</a>,” has not been cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a push from CTDOT, the journal retracted the article this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20555563.2023.2279406?src=recsys">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The article was not authorized by the relevant authorities responsible for the site and artifacts recovered. The authors apologize for this oversight and therefore, they have agreed to the retraction of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Taylor &amp; Francis said “checking permissions” is not part of the peer review process, so the issue was not caught before publication. He also said the retraction would not bar the authors from submitting work to Taylor &amp; Francis journals in the future.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for CTDOT confirmed the agency pushed for the retraction. He said in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The results and interpretation of the site were published prematurely. The materials uncovered are still in labs being tested. Since all stakeholders did not have a chance to review and provide comment, and interpretations were not yet completed, CTDOT asked for the retraction. A final report [is] expected to be completed by the end of next year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson declined to identify the “stakeholders” who were not able to review the article, and also declined to comment on whether the articles’ findings were faulty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leslie was previously a senior archeologist with Archaeological and Historical Services, the firm CTDOT hired to excavate and analyze the site. He now works at Heritage Consultants, another company CTDOT contracts with. After finishing the excavation, he co-wrote an initial <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20555563.2019.1709147?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">research brief</a> published in <em>PaleoAmerica</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>If the findings hold up, Miller says they could have <a href="https://avonhistoricalsociety.org/paleo-indian-site/">significance beyond Connecticut</a>. According to the retracted article, archeologists consider this excavation to be the oldest site in southern New England. Radiocarbon dating analyses suggest that the excavated objects and materials are 12,500 years old, from what is called the Paleoindian period. Humans first appeared in the archeological record in North America during this time as the last of the glaciers retreated and the ice age ended. The pendant could be the oldest that archeologists have found on the continent, according to the article.</p>



<p>Much of the data contained within the retracted article remains publicly available via a <a href="https://www.avonctlibrary.info/2023/08/unearthing-history-2023-virtual-lecture-series/">webinar series</a> from the Avon Historical Society. CTDOT declined to comment on why these presentations and the 2020 publication were approved while the 2023 article was retracted.</p>

<p>The <em>British Medical Journal </em>has retracted an article that found UK households bought 10% less sugar in the form of soft drinks after the government started taxing the manufacturers on the sugar in their products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the paper found an error in their analysis when following up on the work, and republished a <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/12/e077059">corrected version</a> – with less flashy results – in <em>BMJ Open</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original article, “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n254?ijkey=cf279d743123316067f62a7fe9ee0fd4e058fb9e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">Changes in soft drinks purchased by British households associated with the UK soft drinks industry levy: controlled interrupted time series analysis</a>,” appeared in March 2021. It has been cited 84 times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, as well as by media outlets and by <a href="https://bmj.altmetric.com/details/101653850/policy-documents">policy documents</a> for the UK government and World Health Organization. </p>



<span id="more-128390"></span>



<p>In May 2022, <a href="https://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/people/jean-adams/">Jean Adams</a>, the paper’s corresponding author and a professor of dietary public health at the University of Cambridge, posted a “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n254/rr-0">rapid response</a>” to the online version of the paper alerting readers to the issue the authors had found:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the process of conducting additional analyses exploring the impact of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) on purchasing of drinks and confectionary at around 2 years post implementation we have identified that an error was made in the analyses reported in this paper. We are working with the editorial teams at both BMJ to ensure a corrected version is published as soon as possible. In the meantime we urge caution in citing the results of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, a year and a half later, <em>BMJ</em> published a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2705">retraction</a>, and also <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2707">pulled an editorial</a> that had run with the original publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors themselves identified the problem and alerted the journal and readers about inaccuracies arising from the way in which the data were prepared for analysis. Correcting the error changed the findings of the paper. The reduction in sugar intake per household was less than previously reported, and an increase in the volume of purchased drinks was found. The journal judged that the policy implications of the paper were affected by these changes and did not think that correction of the paper would be the appropriate course of action.</p>



<p>We thank the authors for their cooperation throughout this investigation, The BMJ’s statistical editor, and the three external experts who provided post-publication advice to the journal on this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adams provided a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdOxijHIv04qFZRnBYuDzPkPPPx_juQe4iR5byaztjQ/edit?usp=sharing">comment</a> from the authors that went into further detail:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>During preparation for the original analysis, a weighting variable was incorrectly calculated. This variable was also redundant to the analysis replicating a second weighting variable. </p>



<p>…</p>



<p>Most of the results in the paper are impacted by the correction – some by a negligible amount, others more substantively. Overall, the estimate of change in purchasing of sugar from all soft drinks combined at 1 year post implementation of the levy reduces from -30g (or -10%) per household per week to -8g (or -3%) per household per week. Alongside, the estimate of change in volume of soft drinks purchases increased from no change to a 189ml (or 3%) increase per household per week.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adams told us the authors “have made substantial attempts not just to correct the record through working with the BMJ and BMJ Open, but also to let relevant colleagues know.” She said they had alerted all corresponding authors of papers that cited the original, hosted a briefing for non-profits focused on diet and obesity in the UK, and notified UK government officials working on topics related to the tax. The authors also updated their funders and scientific steering group “throughout the process,” Adams said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our question why it had taken a year and a half for the retraction and republished paper to appear, Adams said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The timeline was mostly driven by the BMJ. There were at least two extra peer review processes – one to help inform their decision over whether this could be a correction or a retraction with republication; and then another of the corrected paper submitted to BMJ Open.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A BMJ spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have no other comment to add other than this was a complex case that required a re-analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Adams if she had any advice for other researchers who find themselves in a similar situation. She said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think the key thing I’ve learnt (remembered) is to remain humble and that everyone makes mistakes. Making mistakes is to be expected. What matters is that when we find them, we own up to them and fix them. I found <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/publishing-and-editorial-issues/corrections-and-version-control.html">this guidance</a> from ICMJE helpful, particularly “honest errors are a part of science.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spanish-horses-indigenous-south-american-societies-european-settlers">Spanish horses joined Indigenous South Americans’ societies long before Europeans came to stay</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunter-gatherers in southernmost South America integrated horses with Spanish pedigrees into their societies around 400 years ago, long before Europeans occupied that region, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Analyses of horse remains uncovered at Chorrillo Grande 1, a site in Argentina’s Patagonian region, indicate that locals raised and ate transatlantic equines by the early 1600s, say archaeozoologist William Taylor of the University of Colorado Boulder and colleagues.</p>



<p>Spaniards reached south-central South America around 1536 but moved north after a few years, leaving behind horses and other livestock. Patagonian hunter-gatherers incorporated <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk5201" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk5201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing numbers of horses into their way of life</a> a century or more before Europeans settled the region permanently in the mid-1800s, Taylor’s group concludes December 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Related findings indicate that offspring of horses brought by Spaniards to Mexico in 1519 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/native-americans-spanish-horses">reached Indigenous people in North America by the early 1600s</a>, before those groups encountered Europeans (<em>SN</em>: 3/30/23).</p>



<p>Excavated horse remains at Chorrillo Grande 1 consisted of three partial leg bones and six teeth. DNA from these finds identified three domestic horses, one male adult and two female juveniles, the scientists say. Radiocarbon dating of horse specimens, food crusts on unearthed pottery pieces and other finds places people there starting between 1599 and 1653.</p>



<p>Fractures and burned patches on limb bones suggested that the two female horses were butchered for food. Europeans in Patagonia during the 1800s wrote about the consumption of mare’s meat and blood by local Tehuelche hunter-gatherers.</p>



<p>Horses quickly assumed many roles in Native American cultures, Taylor suspects. Other historical documents describe groups across southern South America herding horses, riding horses to hunt other animals, using horses in ceremonies and making items such as tents and stringed instruments out of horse products.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-crispr-therapy-sickle-cell-fda">The first CRISPR therapy approved in the U.S. will treat sickle cell disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>U.S. patients with sickle cell disease now have a novel treatment option: the first-ever CRISPR-based therapy.</p>



<p>On December 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-gene-therapies-treat-patients-sickle-cell-disease?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the gene-editing therapy</a> for use in patients age 12 years and older. In addition to offering hope of relief for people with severe forms of the painful blood disorder, the treatment, called Casgevy, is the world’s first to genetically tweak cells using the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">Nobel Prize–winning molecular scissors</a> CRISPR/Cas9 (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>Another gene therapy for sickle cell disease, called Lyfgenia and developed by biotech company bluebird bio, based in Somerville, Mass., was also approved December 8.</p>



<p>Getting a green light for the first CRISPR-based medicine is exciting, says David Altshuler, chief scientific officer at Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which developed the drug in a joint venture with CRISPR Therapeutics, a company in Cambridge, Mass. But the fact that the drug fills an unmet need for underserved patients is “more compelling to me, personally, than the fact that it’s CRISPR.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 people in the United States</a>, most of them Black or Latino, have sickle &nbsp;cell disease. It is caused by a genetic defect in hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Unlike typical blood cells that are bendy enough to slip through blood vessels, sickled blood cells are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-sickle-cell-disease-esrick-genetics">inflexible and get stuck</a>, restricting blood flow and causing debilitating pain (<em>SN: 2/1/22</em>). People with severe forms of the disease can be hospitalized multiple times a year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a new treatment option for sickle cell disease can give patients a “new lease on life,” says Kerry Morrone, a pediatric hematologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. People with the disease often miss school, work or special events due to excruciating pain. “The potential that this therapy could alleviate symptoms for patients is very exciting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At an FDA advisory committee meeting on October 31, several clinical trial participants given Casgevy recounted how it changed their lives, including Victoria Gray, the first sickle cell patient to enroll in the trial.</p>



<p>Gray has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-virus-crispr-editing-disease">previously described bouts of pain</a> that felt like being struck by lightning and getting hit by a train at the same time (<em>SN: 10/20/23</em>). Now pain-free, she is able to enjoy time with her family, Gray said at the meeting. </p>



<p>Jimi Olaghere, another participant in the trial, told a similar tale. Before the treatment, “sickle cell disease dominated every facet of my life,” he said. “Hospital admissions were so regular that they even had a bed reserved for me.” Now, Olaghere is free of pain and able to be present for his children. “Gene therapy has given me the ability to take full control of my life,” he said. “I can chase to the proverbial sunset and write novels and even dance in the rain without a care in the world.”     </p>



<p>There are few existing therapies for sickle cell disease, which include taking drugs like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-urea-showed-promise-sickle-cell-treatment">hydroxyurea</a> or undergoing bone marrow transplants (<em>SN: 12/17/20</em>). But hydroxyurea doesn’t work for everyone, and transplants require a genetically matched donor, usually a sibling. Less than 20 percent of people with sickle cell disease have a matched sibling.</p>



<p>Casgevy is like a transplant, but instead relies on a patient’s own cells. Using CRISPR, the treatment alters the genetic blueprint of bone marrow cells that give rise to blood cells. The edited cells <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials">make fetal hemoglobin</a>, a type normally made by fetuses and young babies that doesn’t make red blood cells sickle and gum up vessels (<em>SN: 8/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>Patients first receive chemotherapy to wipe out existing bone marrow cells so the new ones, which are edited in a lab, have a chance to thrive in the body. After editing, the cells are given back to the patient through an IV. Both steps require hospitalization. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In a clinical trial, 29 out of 30 patients given Casgevy and followed for at least 16 months didn’t have pain crises for at least a year, Vertex vice president of clinical development William Hobbs said at the FDA advisory committee meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The treatment isn’t without risks. Chemotherapy, for instance, can raise the risk of blood cancer and cause infertility. And in the short-term, chemotherapy kills immune cells, putting patients at higher risk dying from infections.</p>



<p>For some patients those risks may pale in comparison to the prospect of a year without immense pain, says Morrone, who is also director of the Sickle Cell Program at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore. Others may want to wait and see what the outcomes are. “I think that’s fair, because it’s not without any risk.”</p>



<p>At the Oct. 31 meeting, advisors to the FDA also <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/cellular-tissue-and-gene-therapies-advisory-committee-october-31-2023-meeting-announcement-10312023#event-materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed the potential for unintended edits</a>, or “off-target effects.” An analysis by Vertex found no evidence of such unwanted changes in treated patients, although researchers have identified a rare <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01257-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variation in the DNA of some people</a> that could, in theory, be an accidental target. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unknown whether changing that accidental target would have consequences for patients, but researchers say it’s unlikely because that stretch of DNA isn’t involved in a protein’s structure or function. Nor is the protein made from that genetic code found in blood cells. Overall, the 14-member committee agreed that the benefits of the treatment were clear and the off-target risk is small, but that additional research would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another concern is that the therapy is expensive, perhaps as much as $2 million per patient. But health care costs for sickle cell patients are also high over their lifetime, Morrone says. The health care community needs to consider ways to ensure equity for patients — including in Africa, where the highest burden of disease is — who have long not had the same resources as patients with other conditions with far more treatment options. “There’s not a value on suffering,” she says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>On November 16, officials in the United Kingdom became the first to sign off on Casgevy’s use in <a href="https://crisprtx.com/about-us/press-releases-and-presentations/vertex-and-crispr-therapeutics-announce-authorization-of-the-first-crispr-cas9-gene-edited-therapy-casgevy-exagamglogene-autotemcel-by-the-united-kingdom-mhra-for-the-treatment-of-sickle-cell-disease-and-transfusi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sickle cell patients as well as people with beta-thalassemia</a>, a blood disorder in which the body doesn’t make enough hemoglobin. The FDA will decide by March 30 whether the CRISPR therapy can also be used to treat beta-thalassemia by March 30.</p>

                <p><em>Scientists discover a way to prevent cell death, but how will this affect treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s disease? </em></p>

<p>A recent study published in Nature aimed to unravel the relationship between Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and neuronal loss. The study highlighted the primary driver behind neuronal death in Alzheimer's: necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This process occurs during the development of AD when neurons are exposed to amyloid plaques and tau tangles - two hallmark features implicated in AD. </p>

<p>This newfound research not only provides insight into the intricacies of Alzheimer's but also hints that there may be potential to target specific pathways and genes in new therapeutic approaches. </p>

<p><strong>A new model: From mice to humans</strong></p>

<p>While prior studies hinted at the mechanisms of cell death in AD, this study underscores the limitations of past models as the pathology was trigged though external interventions and therefore, unable to demonstrate the natural pathology in humans. Building on an established xenotransplantation model, the researchers proposed a new model: transplanting human neurons into a mouse brain engineered to develop amyloid plaques, allowing for greater exploration of AD pathology over time. </p>

<p>Remarkably, the model revealed that amyloid plaques alone were insufficient to induce Alzheimer's-like pathology in mouse neurons. This emphasised a human-specific vulnerability, as transplanted human neurons exhibited AD features in the presence of amyloid pathology, where the control mice did not. This suggests a distinctive susceptibility of human neurons to changes associated with AD.</p>

<p><strong>Decoding gene expression: What is MEG3?</strong></p>

<p>Through gene expression analysis, the researchers identified that the long non-coding RNA, MEG3, was strongly expressed in human neurons in response to amyloid plaques. The upregulation of MEG3 was a key finding, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathological processes associated with AD.</p>

<p><strong>Potential avenues for treatment</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the study highlights the road for several exciting potential treatments:</p><ul>
  <li>Reducing the levels of MEG3 led to the prevention of cell death, suggesting the potential to target MEG3 expression. </li>
  <li>Necroptosis is an active area of drug development in other conditions like cancer and ALS, so may hold potential for repurposing or developing new inhibitors specific to AD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></p>

<p>While the discovery of MEG3 and its role in necroptosis provides a promising direction for AD research, the journey from discovery to effective human treatments is complex and involves rigorous testing and validation. Realistic hope exists, but successful translation will require continued research, collaboration, and careful clinical development. Additionally, advancements in our understanding of AD and the development of targeted therapies will likely be incremental, involving a combination of approaches to address the multifaceted nature of the disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-quantum-mechanics-physics-theory">A maverick physicist is building a case for scrapping quantum gravity</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rift runs deep through the heart of physics. The general theory of relativity, which describes gravity, clashes with quantum physics. In an effort to seal that physics fissure, untold numbers of physicists have spent their careers working to build a theory of quantum gravity.</p>



<p>But one physicist is championing a radically different path. Jonathan Oppenheim thinks that gravity might be fundamentally classical, meaning it isn’t quantum at all. It’s an unconventional idea, to say the least.</p>





<p>“When we started, maybe 99 percent of our colleagues thought we were crackpots and that’s now down to maybe 70 percent,” quips Oppenheim, of University College London.</p>



<p>All known forces except gravity are formulated in terms of quantum physics. The prevailing view is that gravity will need to assimilate with its quantum colleagues. But gravity is different, Oppenheim argues. While other forces evolve within a landscape of spacetime, gravity is the warping of spacetime itself. So, Oppenheim says, “it is pretty unclear that it should have a quantum nature, in my view.”</p>



<p>Physicists have devised several “no-go” theorems that seemingly forbid a classical theory of gravity. Such theorems highlight inconsistencies, apparently fatal to the idea, that arise when classical gravity is applied to quantum particles. But it’s possible to get around those prohibitions by <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding some randomness</a> to the way that spacetime bends in response to quantum particles, Oppenheim reports December 4 in <em>Physical Review X</em>.</p>



<p>Consider the famous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-quantum-theory-particle-wave-double-slit-experiment">double-slit experiment</a> of quantum physics (<em>SN: 5/3/19</em>). Particles are sent toward a detector, separated by a barrier with two slits in it. When those particles arrive at the detector, they create a stripy pattern called an interference pattern. That pattern arises because, in quantum physics, the particle isn’t constrained to pass through one slit or the other. Instead, it can exist in a superposition, taking a quantum combination of both possible routes. If a scientist makes a measurement to determine which slit the particle passed through, that pattern disappears.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="624" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C624&#038;ssl=1" alt="An illustration of a double slit experiment, showing light shining on a barrier with two slits, producing an pattern of light and dark stripes behind the barrier" class="wp-image-3133909" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?resize=417%2C383&amp;ssl=1 417w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?resize=490%2C450&amp;ssl=1 490w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?resize=203%2C186&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/120623_ec_quantum-gravity_inline.jpg?resize=632%2C580&amp;ssl=1 632w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133909">When particles, in this case particles of light called photons, are sent toward a barrier with two slits in it, the particles produce an interference pattern (stripes) due to quantum effects.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133909">Dorling Kindersley/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If a standard classical picture of gravity were correct, it would be possible to measure the gravitational field of that particle so precisely that you could determine which slit the particle went through. This possibility would destroy the interference pattern, even without actually doing the measurement. Because scientists do observe interference patterns in the lab, that’s a big blow for a standard classical theory of gravity.</p>



<p>But the randomness baked into Oppenheim’s theory means that, instead of a particle having a determined gravitational field, the field fluctuates. That means, unlike for the standard version of classical gravity, it’s not possible to determine which slit a particle went through by precisely measuring its gravitational field. Particles can pass through the slits in a superposition, and the interference pattern is saved, restoring the possibility gravity could be classical.</p>



<p>Experiments can test this theory by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43348-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searching for evidence of those random gravitational fluctuations</a>, Oppenheim and colleagues report December 4 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. “Essentially, you very precisely measure the response of a mass to a gravitational field,” says study coauthor Zach Weller-Davies, who completed the work at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.</p>



<p>This is not the first time scientists have proposed a way to make classical gravity comport with quantum physics. But Oppenheim has been “leading a renaissance,” says physicist Vivishek Sudhir of MIT. Sudhir <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hopes to test the theory</a> with another type of experiment, measuring the correlations between the motions of two masses that interact gravitationally, he and a colleague report September 16 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>However, the theory has features some physicists might find unsatisfying. For example, the randomness involved means that the theory is not reversible: Unlike other theories, there’s no way to start from the endpoint of an interaction and trace its steps backward.</p>





<p>Still, even some quantum gravity believers think that the work has merit.</p>



<p>“The reason why this work is interesting for me is not really because I would believe that gravity is classical,” says Flaminia Giacomini of ETH Zurich. The result, she says, is interesting regardless of whether gravity is found to be classical or quantum. That’s because, in order for an experiment to confidently proclaim that gravity is quantum, scientists need to understand the possibilities for classical gravity. “Only in that way will we be able to prove in a strong way that gravity is not compatible with a classical description.”</p>
