<p>An academic editor at Wiley who <a href="https://archive.fo/05wC1">vowed</a> to “uphold publication ethics” is being investigated by the company for allegedly publishing three of his papers twice, in violation of journal policies, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471595323001920">One</a> of the duplicates, which appeared last year in <em>Nurse Education in Practice</em>, an Elsevier title, has already been slated for retraction, according to emails we have seen. The other offending articles were published in Wiley journals.</p>



<p>The editor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-joseph-berdida-0960281b2/">Daniel Joseph Berdida</a>, is a nurse and faculty member at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, the Philippines. He joined <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jonm/editors/">the editorial board</a> of Wiley’s <em>Journal of Nursing Management </em>four months ago, <a href="https://archive.fo/05wC1">announcing on LinkedIn</a> that he would “be serving with integrity and uphold publication ethics.”</p>



<span id="more-129110"></span>



<p>After being confronted about the duplicate publication by Roger Watson, editor-in-chief of <em>Nurse Education in Practice, </em>Berdida acknowledged his transgression, explaining he had been “on health leave” for the past eight months and “a breakdown in communication” with his research assistant had “led to the current situation.”</p>



<p>“I fully acknowledge my responsibility in this matter,” Berdida wrote in a March 13 email. “If it is within your discretion, I would appreciate it if you could consider retracting the manuscript from your journal, given the circumstances.”</p>



<p>But Berdida had made the same excuse to one of the Wiley journals, and Watson was unconvinced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As with all violations of publication ethics, this is a most unfortunate set of duplications,” he told us. “It is doubly unfortunate for the author that the editors-in-chief of three of the publications involved are very close colleagues and regularly consult one another for advice. In this way we were able to tie the three incidences of duplication together. Let’s hope there are no more.”</p>



<p>The three duplicate articles are:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471595323001920">The mediating roles of moral courage and moral resilience between nurses’ moral distress and moral injury: an online cross-sectional study</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-023-01873-w">Moral distress, moral resilience, moral courage, and moral injury among nurses in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mediation analysis</a>.”)</li>



<li>“<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.16526">Nurses&#8217; professional values and competency in Saudi Arabia: A structural equation modelling approach</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1322769623000380">Structural equation modelling of ethicomoral values and competence of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.”)</li>



<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12946">Safety climate, quality of care, adherence to and compliance with standard precautions among nurses: Structural equation modeling</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12960">Nurses&#8217; safety climate, quality of care, and standard precautions adherence and compliance: A cross-sectional study</a>.”)</li>
</ul>



<p>On March 20, Watson wrote to Berdida:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is to inform you that Elsevier will be retracting your article in Nurse Education in Practice and due to the fact that we are aware of further duplications in other journals we are not satisfied with your response. Under these circumstances we consider that it is necessary to inform your dean.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mark Hayter, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Clinical Nursing</em>, in which <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.16526">one</a> of the duplicate papers appeared, confirmed his publication was “involved in this matter,” adding, “It is currently being investigated by the Wiley publication ethics team.”</p>



<p>Berdida has not responded to our request for comment. The dean of his university’s College of Nursing, Rowena L. Escolar Chua, declined to comment, explaining, “I do not know the full story and the matter is still being investigated.”</p>

<figure id="attachment_13538" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13538" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 178px"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13538" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Nasonia.png" alt="" width="168" height="96" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13538" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig.1 Brink et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epigenetic changes, based on dynamic DNA methylation patterns, have been consistently associated with aging processes. However, much about aging is currently based on two model organisms, Drosophila and C. elegans, that lack detectable DNA methylation. This study introduces Nasonia vitripennis, the jewel wasp, as an innovative model for the epigenetics of aging. Like current model organisms, Nasonia is easy and cheap to keep in a laboratory, has a short, characterized life cycle, and a sequenced genome. In addition, it features a functional DNA methylation system, although it has not been studied in the aging process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To fill the gap, the authors measured for the first time its methylome using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing followed by methylation analysis. They identified several sites that are age- and sex-specifically methylated and they constructed an epigenetic clock containing 19 sites correlating epigenetic changes and chronological age. Contrary to mammalian aging, in Nasonia DNA methylation increases with age; females, generally living longer than males, display lower methylation levels as they age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there is no direct correspondence between epigenetic clocks in Nasonia and humans, some intriguing functional overlaps exist, delivering Nasonia a first success as a model organism. Only time will tell if the jewel wasp can help suggest potential anti-aging interventions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-13543" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food.png" alt="" width="177" height="118" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food.png 421w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px" />Spain has one of the highest prevalence of obesity in Europe, mainly affecting lower class people. Socio-economic inequalities regarding eating habits and obesity are linked to the influence of advertising on food preferences and consumption. In this study, the exposure to advertising of foods and drinks is measured using a remote control device among 1590 Spanish children and adolescents, and crossed with the nutrient content profiles defined by the World Health Organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The results show an average of 10 commercials received per day, with most food and drink commercials being about unhealthy products and occurring within the evening, the peak child-audience time in Spain. The exposure of lower class participants to unhealthy products was double compared to higher social ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The observed exposure to unhealthy food and drink advertising is accounted for by the absence of regulation in Spain: there is nothing more than a voluntary code of conduct on food advertising targeting under-12 children, and it does not regulate the nutrient profile of the advertised products nor the broadcasting frequency. A recently proposed statutory regulation has been opposed by food and advertising industries, while civil society organizations are concerned not only to protect Spanish children from exposure, but also to reduce health-related social inequalities.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_13542" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13542" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 185px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-13542 size-full" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/needle-1.png" alt="" width="175" height="126" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13542" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig.1 Reynoso-Mejia et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Metal surgical devices such as trocars can generate metal artifacts in interventional procedures guided through computed tomography, used for example in biopsies. This makes the detection and visualization of target elements more difficult, which is a problem especially in operations where precise positioning is essential. Recently, specific proprietary algorithms have been proposed for metal artifact reduction, but these may modify the non-artifactual image data while processing the artifact area and are not always available for real-time application, required in interventional imaging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors investigate the use of a 0.5 mm silver filter to reduce metal artifacts The proposed method is based on the already known capacity of silver, similar to tin, to harden the X-ray beam, increasing the effective beam energy. A number of parameters were evaluated at different locations and different beam energies on an anthropomorphic phantom, describing image quality and the significance of the artifact along the trajectory of the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study shows that the use of a silver filter can significantly reduce metal artifacts, improving the visibility and the correct location of target structures without changing the overall image quality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Higher risks of complications during and after pregnancy are associated with inadequate prenatal care, often rooted in systemic factors such as institutional racism, and social and economic inequities. Equity, conceptualized as the absence of differences in access and use among population groups, should be the ultimate goal of consistent health policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This umbrella review, including 68 quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews, aims to explore barriers and facilitators of equity in prenatal care. While the first authors of the systematic reviews were mainly from the UK, Canada and US, those of the studies included in those reviews were mainly from Africa and Asia. Although patterns are not always generalizable, similar determinants were found across countries and contexts, with pregnant women belonging to socially disadvantaged groups experiencing difficulties in accessing or receiving care in a wide range of prenatal services. Individual and social factors such as education level, socioeconomic status, rigidity of traditional gender roles led to a greater risk of adverse outcomes and lower utilization of care. Discrimination related with race, ethnicity, culture, language and religion was more common in North America, Europe, and Oceania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a global perspective suggests the need to overcome barriers implementing specific interventions to favor inclusive access to health services. This includes awareness: the authors report that, ironically, the majority of studies did not define equity nor use any conceptual framework.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Visualization of risk, although it seems trivial, is a hard task. To be effective, it should simplify complex information, be intuitive, and take into account people’s beliefs and experiences. For example, regular breast cancer screening offered at the population-level can cause false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. According to the experts, the benefit-harm trade-off might be improved by screening women at high risk more frequently than women at medium risk. However, the idea of potential harms in preventive health can be counterintuitive and women in lower risk categories may experience anxiety or feelings of unfairness due to a lower screening frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this participatory study, women’s perspectives are investigated to develop an effective quantitative and qualitative visual strategy to best inform on risk categories and breast cancer risk-based screening. The involved women wanted to understand their assignment to a certain risk category, preferably visualized in an icon array, and to get advice on risk reduction and self-examination; there was a general misconception that most risk factors are modifiable, while women tended to be unaware of breast density as a risk factor. Therefore, the resulting visual emphasized that risk is given by a combination of factors, including breast density. Similarly, the presented information sheets, reviewed by a board of experts, communicated risk to answer counterintuitive questions and reassure concerned women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> This work is a successful example of how non-specialists can help improve communication in the context of preventive health.</span></p>

<p>Earlier this year, a group of lecturers in Malaysia received a WhatsApp message from a colleague who had made a disturbing discovery. </p>



<p>The colleague, who wished to remain anonymous for this story, was looking through Google Scholar and noticed their name, and many others from their department, repeatedly appeared alongside that of an unfamiliar author: Kumba Digdowiseiso, dean of the economics and business faculty at Universitas Nasional in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>



<p>“We didn’t even know who this person was,” said Safwan Mohd Nor, an associate professor of finance at the university, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, adding that he was “extremely angry” when he first found out his name had been used. </p>



<span id="more-129106"></span>



<p>Nor received unwanted bylines on four papers published in journals not indexed by Clarivate’s Web of Science. The journal editors have not responded to requests for comment. “It seems that this is like fraud or predatory journals,” Nor told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least 24 staff at the university have been unwittingly added to the list of authors on the dean’s papers, Nor said, citing an internal survey documenting the extent of the issue that faculty have not made available despite several requests. Digdowiseiso has been in contact with one lecturer at the university and told Retraction Watch that the matter has been resolved, but many of the staff’s names <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/837/1024">still remain</a> <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/784/950">published online</a>.</p>



<p>The university’s Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Development, where the affected staff are based, declined to comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Digdowiseiso has published at least 160 papers in 2024 alone, according to his Google Scholar profile, which casts a wider net for publications than other indexing services such as Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dean had visited the Malaysian university last year, according to the deputy dean of Academic and Student Affairs, Azwadi Ali. Ali said Digdowiseiso met with management to discuss student mobility, guest lectures and potential research collaboration. “But we did not know that this might happen,” Ali said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to Nor, Digdowiseiso did not meet with the faculty lecturers and a collaboration was never agreed upon. “He just came to visit and suddenly we noticed our names in those papers,” Nor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His name has since been removed from one of the papers, but the <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/784/950">remaining three</a> <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/837/1024">still list Nor</a> <a href="https://radjapublika.com/index.php/IJEBAS/article/view/1334">as an author</a>. “I have never been involved in any of these papers, never consented to the use of my name without my direct research involvement, and never collaborated with Kumba Digdowiseiso or his co-authors my whole life,” Nor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that some of the staff’s names have been removed from the main page of the paper, but remain in the PDF versions and are still indexed by Google Scholar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nor, Ali and Fahirah Syaliza Mokhtar, another lecturer in the faculty and the university’s legal advisor, said they have attempted to contact Digdowiseiso but have not received a response. Mokhtar requested that he “ensure that our names would be retracted from the article, and that the article should be retracted from the journal,” she told us. “If [Digdowiseiso] wants to proceed with the journal publication, we have no problem with that, but we want to ensure that our names have been retracted from the journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali said Digdowiseiso is in contact with Jumadil Saputra, one of the lecturers at the Malaysian university, who has not responded to our requests for comment. “When we asked him to retract our names, he actually replaced the names with [Saputra’s],” Ali said. Saputra is listed as an author on six publications alongside Digdowiseiso since the start of 2023, according to his Google Scholar profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nor said Saputra told him Digdowiseiso is in the process of deleting the names. “Our names, however, are still there in the system, and deleting them later does not change the fact that Kumba Digdowiseiso has committed a serious academic offence,” Nor wrote in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our questions, Digdowiseiso wrote that the matter was “already resolved” between the faculties, but did not respond to follow-up questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s weird, many of our names are still used illegally and displayed in those journal websites and Google Scholar,” Nor said of Digdowiseiso’s response. “Also our faculty is planning to organize a meeting with him, so how come he claimed the issue is resolved?”</p>

With the constant increase in the use of data for both digital health and research purposes, ethics and data privacy are important consideration in this increasingly digital world. Matters such as the implications for future generations of storing genetic information, transparency when it comes to consent, human bias when handling data and considerations on benefits versus risks of storing certain types of information are some examples. Solutions for and conversations about cyber security and local storage vs online databases come into play.</p>
<p>The Collection <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/BEDP">Bioinformatics ethics and data privacy</a> welcomes submissions on new computational approaches, tools, and databases to address issues and open questions in bioinformatics ethics and data privacy, including anonymization, encryption and data deposition.</p>
<p>In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal SDG 16, which seeks to promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies, this collection emphasizes the importance of respecting and upholding the right to privacy and access to information.</p>

<p><em>Toxicologic Pathology</em> – a Sage title – has issued expressions of concern for six papers that were among the subjects of an investigation by Azabu University that concluded in November 2022.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01926233241238763">expression of concern</a>, dated March 7, 2024, includes a list of the six articles and reads:</p>



<span id="more-129101"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Toxicologic Pathology</em> was contacted by the author, Shin Wakui, requesting retraction of these articles. Despite multiple attempts at gaining further information on the reasons for retraction, we have not received anymore communication regarding this case.</p>



<p>This expression of concern will remain in place until further evidence is provided to Sage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The university <a href="https://www.azabu-u.ac.jp/important/2022/1124_40217.html">issued</a> a <a href="https://www.azabu-u.ac.jp/important/files/kouhyoubunsyo221124.pdf">report about the misconduct findings</a> in November 2022, which Lemonstoism, author of<a href="http://blog.goo.ne.jp/lemon-stoism"> World Fluctuation Watch</a>, sent us at the time and which we forwarded to Sage once we saw the expressions of concern. The university investigated 31 papers, of which at least <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWakui%252c%2bShin">two have been retracted</a>.</p>



<p>The authors did not share that report when they contacted the journal in November 2023, a Sage spokesperson told Retraction Watch. “At this point it’s too soon to say how the report might impact any future action with the article,” Sage told us.</p>



<p>Wakui’s Azabu email address bounced, and we were unable to find other contact information for him.</p>



<p>Here are the six papers:</p>

<p>A 2022 paper in <em>Cureus</em> on causes of cancer around the world is under investigation by the journal following inquiries by Retraction Watch prompted by a reader’s email.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/109423-causes-of-cancer-in-the-world-comparative-risk-assessment-of-nine-behavioral-and-environmental-risk-factors#!/">Causes of Cancer in the World: Comparative Risk Assessment of Nine Behavioral and Environmental Risk Factors</a>,” shares a title and figures with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673605677252?via%3Dihub">2005 paper in <em>The Lancet</em></a>. It also “follows the Lancet one on a sentence-by-sentence level while using tortured phrases,” an anonymous tipster told us.</p>



<p>As we’ve noted elsewhere in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">report on the team that developed the phrase</a>, “Tortured phrases are what happens to words that get translated from English into a foreign language, then back to English — perhaps by a computer trying to generate a scholarly publication for a group of unscrupulous authors.”</p>



<span id="more-129078"></span>



<p>Graham Parker, <em>Cureus</em>’ director of publishing and customer success, told us to his knowledge,  “the journal has not been contacted with any concerns regarding this article. Now that we are aware of a concern, we will examine both articles in question to see if any action is required.”</p>



<p>Neither Khizer K. Ansari, the corresponding author of the <em>Cureus </em>paper and a student at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Wardha, India, nor Majid Ezzati, the corresponding author of&nbsp; the article in <em>The Lancet</em>&nbsp; and a professor at Imperial College London, responded to requests for comment.</p>

                <p><strong>Wanting to go to a conference but worried about the expense? Final-year PhD student, Naomi Thorne, shares all of the places you can apply for funding, from the conference organisers to Biotech companies. Happy conferencing!</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Conferences are a fantastic opportunity for early-career researchers. It’s an opportunity to share your work with like-minded scientists, expand your network by meeting academics and hear directly from experts in your field. Not to mention, there are great opportunities to socialise with other PhD students: eating, drinking, exploring and enjoying some time away from the lab. However, they can be pretty expensive! Many conference trips cost upwards of £300, and that’s just for the registration. Factoring in transport and accommodation, my trip to the Quality Control in Life Processes conference in Frankfurt, Germany, cost a little over £1000. It’s a</span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> lot</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> of money, and the cost can be really off-putting when it comes to planning a conference trip. Thankfully, this financial barrier can be broken down by organisations that offer travel grants and bursaries for early-career researchers. As a final-year PhD student, who has secured funding from several different sources for my conference trips, I wanted to share the best places I’ve found to apply for funding. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>1 - Your university</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the first places I checked was my university itself. Many institutions have funding available, either to all PhD students or on an application basis. Where I am studying, at the University of Southampton, the School of Biological Sciences offers one £250 bursary to all PhD students during their candidature. This was not readily advertised though – speak to your supervisor, as well as other PhD students, about opportunities like this, as they can be a very easy way to get some funding. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>2 - Your PhD funder</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another good place to check is your PhD funding body. It is a good idea to visit their website or speak directly to trustees to see if they offer funding to current candidates. Of course, this will depend on who your project is funded by, but charities in particular may have money set aside specifically for these occasions. Those that operate on a smaller scale, with a lower number of students, are often very keen to support the students they have, so it is definitely worth asking.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>3 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Conference organisers</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Often, the conference organisers offer a bursary scheme that you can apply for at the time of registration. Last year, I received a bursary for the Wellcome Trust conference on Trafficking Pathways in Neurodegeneration which covered 50% of the conference fee. They are usually awarded based on early-career status and the quality of the abstract submitted, with priority given to those giving a poster presentation or talk. There are usually a limited number too – there were about 10 at my conference – so make sure you get in early. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>4 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Societies</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Scientific societies are another great place to find travel awards, but you usually have to be a member for at least a year in order to apply for them. Knowing this, I would say it is worth getting a membership early on in your PhD, so that you have the year of membership behind you by the time you want to attend a conference! Some universities will even pay for one society membership for their students, so check their policy on this before you sign up. Sometimes societies offer funding for any conference, but often they are limited to that society’s flagship event, for example the British Neuroscience Association has a bursary scheme which is specifically for the Festival of Neuroscience. Some examples of societies with such schemes are listed below: </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Royal Society of Chemistry</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Royal Society of Biology </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Company of Biologists (BSCB)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">British Neuroscience Association </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Physiological Society</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">British Pharmacological Society </span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>5 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Charities</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Some larger charities have travel awards available to early-career researchers, but they, understandably, want the conference you attend to be related to their work and research interests. They often require you to write up a report about the conference afterwards, which is a fair task in return for the money! For example, you can apply to Guarantors of BRAIN, as long as your work and conference is related to the field of neuroscience.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>6 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Biotech companies</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Finally, scientific and biotech companies are a good place to look. Many of them now offer travel grants which you can apply for, though they are a bit more selective; they have a small, set number of winners. Most of them judge this by looking at your conference abstract, though BioLegend asks you to explain how their products have enabled your work. I was lucky enough to win a £400 award from BioLegend last year after I wrote 200 words on how I used their antibodies in my immunofluorescence staining. It was definitely the quickest application I made for funding! Examples of companies with travel grant competitions are listed below:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://Antibodies.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Antibodies.com</span></span></a></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">BioLegend</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hello Bio </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Proteintech (conference-specific)</span></span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>There are a few important things to remember when it comes to applying for funding, so I will leave you with a few quick tips:</strong></span></span></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Always check the dates</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – some travel awards only open at certain times of the year, but run out quite quickly. Make a note of these time periods to make sure you don’t miss out.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Don’t leave it too late</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – it will take time for people to get back to you, and you usually can’t apply for a conference you’ve already attended.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>You can apply to more than one source</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – don’t just wait to hear back from one place; apply to several! You can always withdraw an application if you source the money elsewhere.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Some places grant money more than once</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – many places have a one-time policy on bursaries, but some don’t, so it’s important to check this if you have applied before but are heading to another conference. For example, Guarantors of BRAIN allows a maximum of three awards per person, but only one per year.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Don’t be disheartened if you don’t get the first ones you apply for </strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">– some of these awards can be really competitive! There were several that I didn’t win or hear back from, but you just have to keep going.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Check the terms of each funding application</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – some places require you to have an accepted abstract for a conference, but others only require proof of registration.</span></span></p></li>

<p>An Elsevier journal has issued just over 100 expressions of concern for papers published by a group of researchers led by the French microbiologist Didier Raoult, who also notched a new retraction – <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dRaoult">his tenth</a> – in a separate publication.</p>



<p>As we and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/08/journals-retract-six-didier-raoult-papers-for-ethics-violations/">have reported</a>, Raoult’s work during the COVID-19 pandemic drew intense scrutiny from data sleuths, most notably Elisabeth Bik – whose critiques, which extended beyond his COVID studies, were met with vicious online trolling and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01430-z">legal complaint</a> filed by Raoult himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations prompted an ethics investigation by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products into Raoult’s research during his tenure at the <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/">IHU Méditerranée Infection</a>, in Marseille, which he led between 2011 and his retirement as director in 2022. That inquiry <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/actualites/inspection-a-lihu-mediterranee-infection-et-a-lap-hm-lansm-saisit-a-nouveau-la-justice-et-engage-des-poursuites-administratives">found</a> “serious shortcomings and non-compliances with the regulations for research involving the human person.”</p>



<p>The 101 expressions of concern come for papers Raoult and his colleagues published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=New%20Microbes%20and%20New%20Infections&amp;cid=312001&amp;qs=Expression%20of%20concern"><em>New Microbes and New Infections</em></a>. Here’s an example of one of the EoC’s, for “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297516000044">Genome sequence and description of Anaerosalibacter massiliensis sp. nov.</a>,” which Raoult’s group published in March 2016:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding potential non-compliance with Elsevier’s publishing ethics policies regarding the appropriate conduct of research involving human participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is investigating the concerns as detailed in the recent Publisher’s Note [1], including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier’s policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the journal can reach a conclusion, it will take any action that is deemed necessary. If the journal determines that it cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion with the information available to it, a further notification will be published to update the community.</p>

<p>That publisher’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297523001154">note, which posted last November, reads</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been raised about a number of articles authored by researchers affiliated with Aix-Marseille Université IHU &#8211; Méditerranée-Infection, Marseille that have been published in New Microbes and New Infections (NMNI). The substance of these concerns relates to the articles’ adherence to Elsevier’s publishing ethics policies and the appropriate conduct of research involving human participants.</p>



<p>New Microbes and New Infections, supported by Elsevier’s Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics (RI&amp;PE) Centre of Expertise, has launched an investigation into these allegations, following due process outlined by the Committee On Publication Ethics (COPE) by confidentially consulting with the authors and, where necessary, liaising with the institution where the studies took place.</p>



<p>We have appointed Dr. Jim Gray, Consultant Microbiologist at the Birmingham Children’s and Women’s Hospitals, U.K. in the role of independent Publishing Ethics Advisor, to support the investigation.</p>



<p>If necessary, corrections will be made to the scientific record when the investigation into each article is completed, in accordance with the journal’s Publishing Ethics policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other researchers <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">found issues</a> with the ethics approvals of 456 studies published by researchers affiliated with the IHU Méditerranée Infection, including “248 [that] were conducted with the same ethics approval number, even though the subjects, samples, and countries of investigation were different.”</p>



<p>Raoult also had nearly 50 papers in PLOS journals <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/plos-flags-nearly-50-papers-by-controversial-french-covid-researcher-for-ethics-concerns/">subjected to expressions of concern for ethical issues</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>The new retraction involves a 2017 paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> titled “Culturomics and Amplicon-based Metagenomic Approaches for the Study of Fungal Population in Human Gut Microbiota.” According to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-58471-3">the notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Editors have retracted this Article.</p>



<p>After publication of this paper concerns about ethical oversight of this study were brought to the attention of the Editors. The paper cites approval from an institutional ethics committee in France, but samples used in this study were also sourced from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Niger. The Authors were not able to provide documentation of approval from ethics committees in these countries, or of compliance with local regulations regarding the use of such samples in research.</p>



<p>Stéphane Ranque, Esam I. Azhar, Muhammad Yasir, Asif A. Jiman-Fatani, Didier Raoult, and Fadi Bittar disagree with the retraction. Ibrahim Hamad and Hervé Tissot-Dupont did not reply to the correspondence from the Editors.</p>
