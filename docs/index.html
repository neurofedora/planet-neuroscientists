              <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/zbaszyn/">Zbąszyń</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> invented the heliotrope for long-distance surveying in 1821. Just a year later, he proved that least squares regression provided the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLUE estimator</a> for data with uncorrelated Gaussian errors (with mean zero and equal variance). The heliotrope tool and the least squares method allowed Gauss to perform a geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover by triangulation between 1821 and 1825, an unprecedented accomplishment at the time.</p>

<p>Gauss&#8217; approach was scaled up massively by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a>, who in 1838 published an epic triangulation based survey of East Prussia and parts of Russia in <a href="https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/view/bsb10000711?q=Fuchsberg&amp;page=14,15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gradmessung in Ostpreußen und ihre Verbindung mit Preußischen und Russischen Dreiecksketten</a>. His work included understanding for the first time how to calculate the standard error of the mean (which led him to introduce <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/bessels-correction-and-the-dangers-of-moocs/">Bessel&#8217;s correction</a>), providing an important assessment of how errors in individual measurements during triangulation contributed to overall errors from the least squares procedure. The scale of his survey (~3x Hanover) was arguably also the first use of statistics for big data. Bessel may have been the first ̶m̶a̶c̶h̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶r̶n̶i̶n̶g̶ AI disruptor in history. And he did it not from silicon <em>valley </em>but from Königs<em>berg</em> (now Kaliningrad).</p>

<p>Bessel&#8217;s work enabled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Germany" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completion of the first cross-country rail line linking a Western European capital to an Eastern European capital</a>. The rail line, between Berlin and Warsaw, was completed in 1848 and was a quantum leap after the first national <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig%E2%80%93Dresden_railway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-distance rail between Leipzig and Dresden</a> in the Kingdom of Saxony was completed in 1839. At ~500km, Berlin-Warsaw was much longer than any previous international crossings. The distance was long enough that Bessel was able to use his triangulation to show that the earth is an oblate spheroid (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the method dates to 1825</a>) and in 1841 he established the ellipsoid major and minor axes <em>a = 6377397.155 m, b = 6356078.962822 m</em>. His accuracy was amazing; the WGS84 modern world geodetic system from 1984 is almost the same with <em>a = 6378137.0 m, b = 6356752.30 m</em>. As of 2010 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_ellipsoid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bessel ellipsoid</a> was still the geodetic system of choice in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>The Berlin-Warsaw line of 1848 crossed the Prussian-Russian border near the Prosna river, west of the town of Łowicz, which is just under 100km west of Warsaw. Warsaw at the time was part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Poland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Congress Poland</a> formed at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, although by the mid 19th century the territory was fully under Russian administration ruled directly by the Tsar. The border moved in 1919 as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treaty of Versailles</a> after World War I, when a new Polish Republic was established. At that time the border crossing on the Berlin-Warsaw rail line shifted to the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C4%85szy%C5%84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zbąszyń</a> (a medieval Polish name for the town, which the Germans had renamed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C4%85szy%C5%84">Bentschen</a> when the town came under Prussian control in 1793).</p>

<p>In the 19th century Zbąszyń was what today we might today call a &#8220;multicultural town&#8221;. <a href="https://sztetl.org.pl/en/towns/z/779-zbaszyn/99-history/138313-history-of-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out of a population of ~1,300 in 1833, there were 336 Jews</a> (~25%), about 35% Germans, and approximately 40% Poles. In other words, there were more Poles than Germans, but Poles were a minority with respect to Jews and Germans. The percent Jewish population in Zbąszyń, which dates back to at least 1437 when it is known that a Jew named Palto sued a nobleman for failure of repaying a loan, peaked in the early 19th century. The reasons for a decline in Jewish population over a century were manifold, but a major factor was antisemitism, including regular blood libels and pogroms in neighboring cities of which a partial list is <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom_w_Warszawie_(1805)#:~:text=W%201805%20roku%20Bo%C5%BCe%20Cia%C5%82o,zakaz%20opuszczania%20dom%C3%B3w%20przez%20starozakonnych." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the &#8220;forgotten&#8221; Warsaw pogrom in 1805</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Gda%C5%84sk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pogroms in Gdańsk in 1819 and 1821</a>, <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/kalisz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Kalisz pogrom of 1878</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_pogrom_(1881)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Warsaw pogrom of 1881</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Łódź pogrom of 1892</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cz%C4%99stochowa_pogrom_(1902)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Częstochowa pogrom in 1902</a>, and the <a href="https://mjhnyc.org/blog/devastation-destruction-the-1906-bialystok-pogrom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Białystok</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siedlce_pogrom">Siedlce</a> pogroms in 1906.

<p>One couple that emigrated was Zindel Grynszpan and Rivka Grynszpan, who <a href="https://www.porta-polonica.de/en/atlas-of-remembrance-places/story-herschel-grynszpan?singlepage=yes&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lived in Dmenin near Radomsko just south of Łódź</a>, and moved to the city of Hanover in the Kingdom of Hanover, Prussia in 1911. The Grynszpans started a family in Hanover and eventually had six children, although only three survived into adulthood. The youngest was a boy named Herschel Feibel born in 1921. The Grynszpans were never German citizens; after the Polish Republic was established in 1919 they were recognized as Polish citizens, since they had been born in what was deemed in 1919 to be Polish territory (although in the 19th century Radomsko was part of the Russian empire). Herschel was born in Hanover, but due to the <em>jus sanguinis</em> principle of the German Citizenship Law which came into effect in 1914 (citizenship by descent, not birthplace), he was a Polish, not German, citizen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">On the 28th of October, 1938, the members of the Grynszpan family, along with thousands of other Polish Jews living in Germany, were deported via train to Zbąszyń, the town that happened to be the border town on the Berlin-Warsaw line. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The conditions of this deportation were horrific. <a href="https://www.jmberlin.de/en/max-karp-polenaktion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deportation notices technically gave 24 hours to leave but many individuals were deported minutes after receiving a knock on the door</a>, and were not allowed to bring much more than the clothes on their back. How this came about is a sad and sordid story. On March 31, 1938, a Polish law came into effect that revoked the citizenship of Poles who had lived abroad for more than five years. This law was enacted specifically to prevent Jewish Poles from returning to Poland after the Anschluss, i.e. the German annexation of Austria on March 12, 1938. On the 9th of October Polish authorities added a regulation that required passports issued outside of Poland to receive a special consular stamp in order to be valid. In other words, Polish Jews were being stripped of their citizenship. This served as a pretext for German authorities to kick Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostjuden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ostjuden</a> (eastern Jews) out of Germany, and in what has come to be termed &#8220;Polenaktion&#8221;, they proceeded to dump Polish Jews, many of whom had just been rendered stateless, at Zbąszyń. Below are two first-hand accounts of what the deportation and arrival in Zbąszyń was like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-left">Your parents were&nbsp;Ost Juden&nbsp;[East European Jews]. Was your family involved in the expulsion to Zbąszyń?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I am so surprised that nobody mentions this, which happened on the 28th of October, 1938, ten days before the&nbsp;pogrom. In our Jewish school the boys were praying in the morning. The girls didn’t have to, but they had to prepare breakfast for the boys to eat after praying. It was the turn of my friend and I to make the tea and we had to be at school at 7:00 instead of 8:00. I was already dressed and ready to leave the house when I heard knocking at our door. When I opened the door, two tall policemen were standing at the door. They asked, “Where are your parents?” I told them they were asleep. “Wake them up, you are going to Poland.” I answered, “What? What do I have to do with Poland? I was born in Germany.” He said, “Take me to the bedroom of your parents.” They both went into their bedroom and put on the light and said, “Get up. You are going to Poland.” My mother thought it was a bad dream. They said, “Don’t ask questions, you are going to Poland.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">My father thought there was a problem with his income tax returns. My mother told me to wake up my 16-year-old brother. My parents asked why they were going to Poland – could they take something with them? The policemen said, “You are going to such a cultural land.” (When Germans talked about Poland they said “dirty Poles”). “No,” he said, “don’t take anything with you.” My father phoned his brother and asked him to take the keys to our apartment. He asked my father, “What have you done?” My father answered, “Nothing.” My aunt came and took the keys but when she got home, the police were in her house, and they really were sent immediately to Poland. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I will never forget my neighbor. She was a widow. She was wearing her nightgown, had hastily put on her overcoat and was carrying a little handbag. When I asked her why she wasn’t dressed, she told me the police didn’t give her time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We were taken and crammed in to the gymnastics hall of the Jewish school. We saw all the people we knew from the neighborhood who were of Polish origin. My father had very high blood pressure and he couldn’t breathe. He called a doctor who said, “This man has to go hospital, he can’t be transported.” My brother said, “We will never see you again. We will be in Poland and you will be in Germany.” Every half hour a bus came to take the people to the railway station. My mother didn’t want to push, so we took the next bus and as we got in people were pushed in with us. We were all standing and that way we arrived at the Leipzig railway station. On the way, one woman became crazy. They took us to a siding where they take animals, horses and cows. There were soldiers with bayonets standing every ten meters to make sure we didn’t run away. So you see, at 7:00 in the morning I was a student, and at 5:00, I was a criminal. It was terrible (<a href="https://www.motl.org/yad-vashem-interview-with-miriam-ron-witness-to-the-events-of-kristallnacht/">source: Yad Vashem interview with Miriam Ron</a>)</p>

<p>My dear ones!<br><br>You have probably already heard of my fate from Cilli. On October 27 of this year, on a Thursday evening at 9 o’clock, two men came from the Crime Police, demanded my passport, and then placed a&nbsp;deportation&nbsp;document before me to sign and ordered me to accompany them immediately. Cilli and Bernd were already in bed. I had just finished my work and was sitting down to eat, but had to get dressed immediately and go with them. I was so upset I could scarcely speak a word. In all my life I will never forget this moment. I was then immediately locked up in the Castle prison like a criminal. It was a bad night for me. On Friday at 4 o’clock in the afternoon we were taken to the main station under strict guard by Police and SS. Everybody was given two loaves of bread and margarine and was then loaded on the freight cars. It was a cruel picture. Weeping women and children, heart-breaking scenes. We were then taken to the border in sealed cars and under the strictest police guard. When we reached the border at 5 o’clock on Saturday afternoon we were put across. A new terrible scene was revealed here. We spent three days on the platform and in the waiting rooms, 8,000 people. Women and children fainted, went mad, people died, faces as yellow as wax. It was like a cemetery full of dead people. I was also among those who fainted. There was nothing to eat except the dry prison bread, without anything to drink. I never slept at all, for two nights on the platform and one in the waiting room, where I collapsed. There was no room even to stand. The air was pestilential. Women and children were half dead. On the fourth day help at last arrived. Doctors, nurses with medicine, butter and bread from the Jewish Committee in&nbsp;Warsaw. Then we were taken to barracks (military stables) where there was straw on the floor on which we could lie down&#8230;.<br><br>H.J.

<p class="has-text-align-left">In total, around 17,000 Polish Jews living in Germany were deported and left stateless on the Polish border; about 8,000 of those arrived in Zbąszyń. Herschel Grynzspan was not with the rest of his family when they arrived in Zbąszyń, as he had left for Paris in 1936. The story of how Herschel arrived in Paris is briefly as follows: his family had intended for him to emigrate to British Mandate Palestine, but he was refused entry by the British for being too young. His parents therefore decided that he ought to emigrate to Paris instead, where they expected he could find refuge with an uncle and aunt (he was 14 in 1935). He eventually left for Paris, albeit his entry to France was illegal because he had no financial support and it was illegal for Jews to take money out of Germany by the mid 1930s.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">On the 3rd of November, 1938, just five days after the arrival of his family in Zbąszyń, Herschel received a postcard from his sister Berta detailing their plight. While the Germans had discarded thousands of Jews in Zbaszyn, Poland was unwilling to accept them into the country. The Jews at the border were therefore effectively stateless and unwanted, squeezed into a border town where they were dumped in horse stables, a flour mill, military barracks, or left to sleep outside in fields. Emanuel Ringer, a social worker who went to Zbąszyń to help wrote the following on December 6, 1938 (<a href="https://www.jewishgen.org/blog/?p=the-zbaszyn-tragedy-a-town-without-pity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full letter here</a>):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-left">&#8220;Jews were humiliated to the level of lepers, to citizens of the third class, and as a result we are all visited by terrible tragedy. Zbąszyń was a heavy moral blow against the Jewish population of Poland. And it is for this reason that all the threads lead from the Jewish masses to Zbąszyń and to the Jews who suffer there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear Hermann [German rendering of Herschel]!<br><br>You will surely have heard of our great misfortune. Let me describe what happened. On Thursday evening, rumours were circulating that all Polish Jews were to be expelled from a city. Even so, we found them difficult to believe. On Thursday evening at&nbsp;9, a policeman came to us and told us that we should go to the police station with our passports. All together, as we were, we went to the police station accompanied by the policeman. We found almost our entire district gathered there. A police car immediately took us to the city hall. Everyone was taken there. No-one told us what was going on. However, we could see what they had in mind.</p>



<p>Each one of us was handed an expulsion order. We were told we had to leave Germany before the 29th. We were no longer allowed to return home. I begged them to allow me to go home to at least collect a few things. I then left for home, accompanied by a policeman, and packed the most important items of clothing in a suitcase. That’s all that I was able to save.</p>



<p>We don’t have a single penny on us. [&#8230;] I’ll tell you more next time</p>



<p>Love and kisses from us all</p>



<p>Berta</p>

<p>The letter left Herschel distraught and desperate, and his first instinct was to send all his savings to his family. He ended up arguing with his uncle over this plan, and he was persuaded not to do it, due to the low likelihood that the money would make it to his family. Just two days later, on the 6th of November, Herschel departed his uncle&#8217;s house announcing he would not return, slept in a hotel, and the next morning, at 9:30am on November 7th, 1938, managed to enter the German embassy in Paris by pretending to have to deliver an important message. Upon entering the office of diplomat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_vom_Rath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ernst vom Rath</a>, he shot him. He had bought the gun that morning on his way to the embassy.</p>

<p>The same evening that vom Rath died, the 9th of November, 1938, <a href="https://holocaust.georgia.gov/kristallnacht" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Goebbels gave a speech inciting violence against Jews</a> and instructing party officials not to to restrict anti-Jewish riots. Later that night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Heydrich</a> <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/nazi-telegram-instructions-kristallnacht-november-10-1938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a teletype</a> from Berlin to Gestapo and police office instructing police not to interfere with demonstrators acting against Jews, telling them to target only Jewish businesses and synagogues, ordering the seizure of Jewish property and instructing fire brigades to let synagogues burn.</p>



<p>That night and the following day <a href="https://www.pogromnovember1938.co.uk/viewer/">More than 1,200 synagogues and prayer halls were burned and/or destroyed across Germany</a> and two hundred or so more in Austria. Jewish cemeteries and schools were desecrated. Thousands of Jewish businesses were looted and sacked. Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. 91 Jews were murdered. The next day <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goebbels-kristallnacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goebbels wrote in his diary</a> &#8220;This is one dead man who is costing the Jews dear. Our darling Jews will think twice in the future before simply gunning down German diplomats.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Jewish cemetery in Zbąszyń is today a patch of grass. It was desecrated in 1939, although some of the grave remnants were still there at the end of World War II. Those remains were razed to the ground and liquidated completely in the 1970s. Now, a small memorial stone from 1992 commemorates what the lawn once was. It asks that one honor the site. I visited the place last week on September 13, 2025 and found it to be littered with broken glass bottles and beer cans. While cleaning up the trash I wondered about the futility of the act.</p>

<p>The Gryzbowski brothers were Jews who owned a <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/gallery/zbaszyn">flour mill in Zbąszyń</a> that they used to house some of the Polenaktion Jews. Two Stolper stones mark the last place they lived in the town. The Polish inscription underneath Rafał Grzybowski&#8217;s name translates to &#8220;helped the deported during the Polenaktion, deported to the Kutno-Konstancja camp, murdered&#8221;.</p>

<p>In 1939, several months after their internment, some of the Jews in Zbąszyń started to be allowed to leave farther east into Poland. Like Rafał Grzybowski, the vast majority of them were almost certainly murdered. Kristallnacht was a prelude to the holocaust, which was a genocide in many acts with many actors. The Nazis found eager partners among the Poles, as evident already in the <a href="https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/45926/1/Antisemitism%20in%20Eastern%20Poland%20H%C3%B3lmfr%C3%AD%C3%B0ur%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Bjarnveig.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Białystock</a> and <a href="https://www.jhi.pl/en/articles/anniversary-of-the-jedwabne-pogrom,3752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedwabne</a> pogroms of 1941 (this <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/complicity-of-poles-in-the-deaths-of-jews-is-highly-underestimated-scholars-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history is being erased today</a>). 90% of the Jews in Poland were murdered in the holocaust, amounting to 3 million souls.</p>

<p>The Nazis relied on the high-precision geodetic surveys they had throughout the war. When US Army Major Floyd Hough entered Aachen, the first German city to fall to the Allies, on October 21st, 1944,<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/untold-story-secret-mission-seize-nazi-map-data-180973317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> he found a treasure trove of German maps</a> bundled for evacuation, evidently left behind by German soldiers as they undertook a hasty retreat. The surveys were immediately useful to the Allies, helping artillery units on the front improve their targeting. </p>

<p>But it was the Red Army that liberated Zbąszyń during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula%E2%80%93Oder_offensive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vistula-Oder offensive</a> in January 1945. By the time they arrived there was no longer a Jewish community in Zbąszyń and there has not been one since. More than five centuries of a Jewish community erased by the German-Polish antisemitic vise that squeezed its Jews to death.</p>

<p>To guard against identity theft, academic publishers have been using institutional email addresses to verify authors and reviewers are who they say they are. Now, however, findings appearing in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04024">a preprint</a> last month on arXiv.org suggest bad actors have found a way to breach this defense – and are routinely doing so.</p>



<p>From a pool of thousands of reviewer profiles set up as part of AI conferences in 2024 and 2025, staff at the nonprofit<a href="https://openreview.net/"> OpenReview</a>, a platform connecting authors with reviewers, found 94 profiles involving fake identities. In all but two cases, the impostors had used “round-trip-verified” email addresses belonging to the domains of “reputed” universities, the authors write. (The remaining two used &#8220;.edu&#8221; domains of defunct institutions.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impersonating someone else using an institutional email address “adds another layer of challenge in the detection” of bad actors, said first author<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/"> Nihar B. Shah</a> of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who also sits on OpenReview’s board.</p>



<span id="more-132868"></span>



<p>Shah told us a presenter at the<a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/"> International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication</a> earlier this month had encouraged greater reliance on institutional emails to help combat paper mills. The new findings suggest “that is not entirely foolproof and so we should try to use multiple different ways together for identity verification.”</p>

<p>Fraudsters already try to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/15/more-details-on-the-bmcspringer-retraction-ring-an-impersonated-reviewer-speaks/">impersonate reviewers</a> to make sure articles they or their accomplices wrote get favorable reviews. Other forms of identity theft are also<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9867-x"> a growing threat</a> to academia. Researchers may find their names on<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/"> papers they never wrote</a>, or<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"> entire journals may be hijacked</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/my-journal-was-hijacked-an-editors-experience/">swindling authors</a> into paying for useless publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create a fake institutional email, fraudsters rely on institutions allowing members and visitors to create email aliases, according to the preprint.</p>



<p>“The dishonest researcher gained access to an email of a trusted institution, and created email alias(es) resembling someone else at that institution. Alternatively, the dishonest researcher may ask a co-conspirator at another institution to create such an alias,” the authors write.</p>



<p>Once an email address was secured, the impostor then signed up to review using the other person&#8217;s identity, they add.</p>



<p>Embedded in the review system, “the dishonest researcher under this fraudulent identity attempts to get assigned to review papers authored by their true identity. This can sometimes be accomplished by expressing interest in reviewing the paper during bidding. This may alternatively be accomplished by increasing their perceived suitability as a reviewer for the paper by carefully tuning the false reviewer profile or some text in their own paper.”</p>



<p>Some impostors created multiple fake reviewer profiles, the authors note, or teamed “up with another dishonest researcher to favorably review their co-conspirators&#8217; work in exchange for some quid-pro-quo.”</p>



<p>Nobody knows how common identity theft is in academia. Among thousands of legitimate reviewers, the 94 fake profiles are “a relatively small number,” said<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/bio.html"> Andrew McCallum</a> of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, an author of the preprint and the creator of OpenReview. “But of course, even one case is very concerning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a joint interview, <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/people/hylke-koers/">Hylke Koers</a>,&nbsp; chief information officer of the International Association of Scientific, Technical, &amp; Medical Publishers, or STM, and his colleague <a href="https://richard.northover.info/">Richard Northover</a>, product manager for identity and access at STM, welcomed the new findings from OpenReview.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re very specific about some of the scenarios through which institutional email addresses can still be used for fraudulent purposes,” Koers told us. “I think there&#8217;s a call to action for publishers there, but also for research institutes and other parts of the research community to all step up and be much more vigilant about these kinds of scenarios.”</p>



<p>As we wrote in May in<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/19/researcher-identity-verification-framework-stm-author-editor-reviewer/"> a Q&amp;A</a> with Koers, <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/new-digital-identity-framework-aims-to-strengthen-research-integrity-in-scholarly-publishing/">new guidance</a> from the trade organization “suggests identifying “good” and “bad” actors based on what validated information they can provide, using passport validation when all else fails, and creating a common language in publishing circles to address authorship.”</p>



<p>Northover, who also worked on the recommendations, emphasized the need to make individual risk assessments and not be “so restrictive that you would exclude many legitimate scholars from participating.”</p>



<p>“You don&#8217;t go from &#8230; nothing to everybody needing to provide their retina scan and fingerprints,” he told us. “One example of something that you can use instead of, or as well as, institutional email addresses, would be<a href="https://info.orcid.org/interpreting-the-trustworthiness-of-an-orcid-record/"> ORCID with trust markers</a>,” independently verified information such as institutional affiliation and publication record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shah and McCallum said they believe identity theft is happening across different academic fields, with certain ways of picking referees – asking authors for suggestions or relying on open calls, for instance – being particularly ripe for abuse.</p>



<p>Based on his experience with AI conferences, Shah said he estimates about one in 200 reviewer profiles could be fake. Given that reviewers and authors are increasingly being paired using artificial intelligence, he added, developers “should make sure that the AI is far more robust to any kind of gaming.”</p>



<p>As to the 94 fake profiles in OpenReview’s system, they “were all blocked before they could do any real damage,” Shah told us.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="785" height="485" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132899" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg 785w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-300x185.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-768x474.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Oday A. Al-Owaedi</figcaption></figure>



<p>A professor of physics in Iraq was permanently dismissed last week after a government investigation found he orchestrated a massive fraudulent publishing scheme involving hundreds of thousands of dollars paid into his bank account by unwitting researchers, documents obtained by Retraction Watch show.</p>



<p>The scam included a deal between a prominent association of Iraqi academics and a predatory publisher, as well as the creation of a fake journal website and bogus acceptance letters purporting to be from reputed journals.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ministerial-order-with-translation_Redacted.pdf">ministerial order</a> dated September 9 and obtained by Retraction Watch, the physicist,<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0721-0409"> Oday A. Al-Owaedi</a>, who also goes by several other names, defrauded “researchers by collecting money from them under the pretext of publishing their papers in reputable international journals as promised, while in fact falsifying and forging publication in fake websites.”</p>



<span id="more-132898"></span>



<p>The document also stated Al-Owaedi falsified “the scientific content of research papers, knowingly, by inserting his name and his scientific works as references in these allegedly published papers.”</p>



<p>An Iraqi scholar close to the matter told us “hundreds” of budding researchers had been caught in the scam. That has put their careers at risk, because master’s and Ph.D. students in Iraq <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf">are required to publish papers</a> in indexed journals before they can obtain their degrees, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>“Many graduate students and researchers relied on these conference acceptances for thesis defenses, academic promotion, publication requirements, or graduation,” the source added. “Now, they face academic uncertainty or setbacks due to decisions beyond their control.”</p>



<p>We contacted Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to confirm Al-Owaedi’s termination, which has not been officially announced, and ask if the ministry will take steps to help the victims. We have not heard back. The order permanently removes Al-Owaedi from his position at the University of Babylon in Hilla, a public institution, adding that he committed “acts that render his continuation in state service harmful to the public interest.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Al-Owaedi nor his former employer responded to requests for comment. But on September 17, the day after we emailed him about the evidence we had obtained, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/oday.aljubory/posts/pfbid0MBvpX82ffYUHbwnwxYttvuYNnu3GaVjGA1Hh6zGUFFuH5uc1sHrRFHr1uGMsbH1Ml"> announced his dismissal</a> on Facebook (in Arabic) and said he was “innocent of the charges” against him. Al-Owaedi is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/prof.odai.jubori?rdid=btNiLLLlxjY0lFLo&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F17JQR2KLQE%2F"> also a politician</a> and is running in Iraq’s parliamentary election in November.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Al-Owaedi’s publishing scheme centered on<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250917134132/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> a conference that was organized by a prominent association</a> of Iraqi academics and was slated to take place in Baghdad this month. According to its website, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250912213012/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> 7th International Conference of the Iraqi Academics Syndicate for Sciences</a> (ICIASS-2025) offered participants a chance to publish their research in<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp"> AIP Conference Proceedings</a> or one of several “highly respected and peer-reviewed journals from renowned Dutch publishing house Elsevier.” (In correspondence we obtained, AIP Publishing denied having “an agreement in place to publish the proceedings of this conference.”)</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="758" height="926" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132884" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg 758w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier-246x300.jpg 246w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A message from Telegram shows El-Owaedi claimed he made a deal with Elsevier to publish hundreds of papers.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In messages posted to the conference’s now-deleted Telegram group, Al-Owaedi, who chaired the organizing committee for the event, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg">claimed he had made a deal with Elsevier</a> to publish hundreds of papers at discounted prices.</p>



<p>Authors were required to pay “publication fees” after receiving a preliminary acceptance notice from the conference, but before publication, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Telegram_Al-Owaedi.jpg">Al-Owaedi explained</a>. These fees varied by journal, but typically amounted to US$650 – or some $100 more than<a href="https://shafaq.com/en/Economy/Iraq-s-average-salary-ranks-modest-globally-eighth-in-Arab-world"> Iraq’s average monthly salary</a> – according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supporting-journals.pdf">a list the conference supplied</a> of more than two dozen journals from Elsevier, AIP and another publisher.</p>



<p>After payment, the works would be sent to “the publishing house,” which would edit it and submit it to one of the journals on the list, Al-Owaedi wrote.</p>



<p>In reality, the ”publishing house” referred to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> Acadia Pulse</a>, which in May <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Contract-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">signed an agreement</a> with Al-Owaedi to assist his organization in publishing a “total of 400 academic papers in peer-reviewed Scopus Q2 indexed journals.”</p>



<p>Acadia Pulse<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916111616/https:/acadiapulse.org/resources/"> describes itself</a> as a New York-based “international consultancy offering students, researchers, and corporations the opportunity to publish in PubMed and Scopus indexed journals.” But no records of a business called Acadia Pulse exist in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s<a href="https://www.edgarcompany.sec.gov/servlet/CompanyDBSearch?page=main"> EDGAR company database</a>. Meanwhile, the operation’s website has<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/"> several hallmarks of a full-fledged paper mill</a>, such as<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> promising</a> ”guaranteed publications in our flagship journals.”</p>



<p>One of these “flagship” publications is the <em>International Journal of Scientific Studies and Qualitative Research</em>, which<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916112638/https:/www.ijssqr.org/about-us"> lists as its editor-in-chief</a> Gunnar Möller.<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/466/m%C3%B6ller-gunnar"> A physicist at the University of Kent</a> in the UK, Möller told us he had never heard of the journal.</p>



<p>The company did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acceptance-emails-from-IAS_Redacted.pdf">emails</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A-proof-of-payment_Redacted.pdf">bank receipts</a> we obtained, authors at the conference were required to pay the publication fees directly into Al-Owaedi’s personal bank account. In at least one case, the required payment – 950,000 Iraqi dinars, or about US$725 – exceeded the “publishing cost” provided in the journal list by more than US$50.</p>



<p>On July 8, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1613437808723201/permalink/24006494742324188/?rdid=i01arQxgVcbZ95Ls"> announced on Facebook</a> that the first research from the conference had been published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Vocational Behavior</em>. He included what he described as a link to the paper:<a href="https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR4RLJMmnFLy3SymurdrUkj4bvluMMPbdQmDDH2kVjuNYhcH_Y9lvStV1RhJ4A_aem_KO7ezPppFRm5d1G4dabv8g"> https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213</a>. When the link was still functional (we archived it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250908083304/https:/links-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213">here</a>), it sent readers to a near-perfect sham version of the journal’s website. The site displayed a complete article, titled “Holland&#8217;s Characteristics of personality Traits and Their Influence in Impression Management” and written by two real Iraqi scholars.</p>



<p>But the Digital Object Identifier link was forged – real DOI prefixes<a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/doi-basics"> always start with “10,”</a> not “11” – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Sultani-Al-Saidi-fake-publication.pdf">the paper</a> had never been published. We reached out to the two authors, but one told us he was sick and the other never replied.</p>

<p>Similarly, some authors began receiving purported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fake-acceptance-letter_Applied-Mathematics.jpeg">acceptance letters</a> from the journals, as well as what appeared to be login information allowing them to access Elsevier’s Editorial Manager system to track their submissions, according to videos we have seen.</p>



<p>But Elsevier told us the letters had not been issued by their publications, adding, “The matter is still under investigation, but so far, we have no evidence that Editorial Manager was compromised.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The ministerial order dismissing Al-Owaedi states he handed over the money received from the researchers to his wife, “without authorization from the [Iraqi Academics Syndicate] and without disclosure thereof.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi Academics Syndicate has not responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>In his September 17 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A32yxmqPa/">Facebook</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1C93mL4p8U/">posts</a>, Al-Owaedi stated the money he received had “been transferred by the conference to the publishing company.” As proof, he attached pictures of two purported bank transaction slips listing amounts of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-1.jpg">$54,000</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-2.jpg">$150,000</a>, respectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Letters-from-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">Correspondence</a> from Acadia Pulse addressed to “Iraqi Universities” suggests the forgery did not go unnoticed, and the company attempted damage control through obfuscation.</p>



<p>In a section titled “Reasons Why Journals Declare Acceptance Letters Fake and Papers Non-Existent,” a letter signed by a “Henry Davis” stated, “Journals have strict terms and conditions that authors must follow. One of these is that authors must not contact the journal directly before publication. If an author violates this condition, the journal may deny any connection to the manuscript because such contact undermines the confidentiality of the editorial process and affects their business model.”</p>



<p>Another message addressed questions about the strange DOI prefix of the forged conference publication. “We would like to clarify that the assignment of DOI prefixes is entirely determined by the respective journal or publisher,” the letter stated. ”Each publisher is registered with CrossRef (or another DOI registration agency) and may receive a different prefix based on their allocation.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity said some students had not been awarded their degrees because they presented the fake journal acceptance letters at their thesis defense.</p>



<p>“There have been attempts to blame students and researchers for making payments or not recognizing the fraud,” the source told us. “This is unfair. The participants received what appeared to be formal, official conference acceptance letters. They were acting in good faith, based on institutional trust, and should not be penalized for the failure of oversight bodies.”</p>



<p>The source also criticized the government for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICSAI-2025-Al-Owaedi-chair-of-preparatory-committee_arabic.jpg">making Al-Owaedi chair</a> of yet <a href="https://www.icsai-2025.alzahu.edu.iq/#">another conference</a> organizing committee two weeks after the investigation against him began, and for keeping the probe under wraps while conference participants continued submitting papers and paying publication fees to the physicist.</p>



<p>“This delay directly enabled the harm done to researchers and students,” the source said.</p>

<p>The publisher Taylor &amp; Francis is investigating concerns raised on PubPeer about a paper claiming to find DNA contamination in COVID-19 vaccines beyond regulators’ recommended amounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move comes as the U.S. body tasked with making recommendations for vaccine use is scheduled to consider the safety of COVID-19 shots, and two of the study’s authors say their findings will be discussed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517">paper</a> at issue was published September 6 in the journal <em>Autoimmunity</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title. Scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick soon posted concerns on PubPeer, which he forwarded to the ethics department of the publisher. </p>



<span id="more-132874"></span>



<p>On September 8, Laura Wilson, Taylor &amp; Francis’ Head of Research Integrity &amp; Ethics, thanked Patrick for raising the concerns and said the company would “investigate in accordance with the COPE guidelines and our Editorial policies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher added a pop-up notification to the article to alert readers to the ongoing investigation after we asked if they would do so. Taylor &amp; Francis <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/25/publisher-adds-temporary-online-notifications-to-articles-under-investigation/">began using such notices</a> last year.</p>



<p>Jennifer McMillan, a spokesperson for Taylor &amp; Francis, confirmed the publisher’s Ethics and Integrity team “are aware of the comments made on PubPeer and are investigating the article in question.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the investigation is in its very early stages we cannot make any further comment,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paolo Casali, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/iaut20/about-this-journal#editorial-board">editor-in-chief</a> of <em>Autoimmunity</em>, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 19, a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf">meeting</a> of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will include presentations on “COVID-19 vaccine safety.”<br><br><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi">Retsef Levi</a>, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge and chair of the ACIP <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/our-work/index.html#heading-uuf6nwjsay">work group</a> on COVID-19 vaccines, will introduce the session. The work group’s activities include reviewing and summarizing “gaps in the existing knowledge regarding potential impurities (e.g., DNA contamination and endotoxins) in existing immunization products and their health impacts to inform immunization recommendations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Study coauthor Kevin McKernan of the Beverly, Mass.-based company Medicinal Genomics said in <a href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/dna-contamination-entered-into-the">a Sept. 14 post</a> on Substack he had been “contacted by the ACIP committee to go over our paper.” A <a href="https://x.com/JesslovesMJK/status/1965925999968919815">post on X</a> by another coauthor, independent researcher Jessica Rose, stated the committee will be considering their paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her own Substack <a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/new-published-study-shows-theres">post</a>, Rose wrote Senator Ron Johnson (R &#8211; Wisconsin) had submitted the study as evidence in a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations September 9.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also included a prediction: “they will try to retract our work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The authors of the paper — Rose, McKernan, and David J. Speicher of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada — describe using two different methods to measure the amount of DNA remaining in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna due to their <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Production">manufacturing processes</a>. Speicher, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McKernan was also an author on a July <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202507.2155/v1">preprint</a> about “Synthetic mRNA Vaccines and Transcriptomic Dysregulation” that was withdrawn on Sept. 11 after sleuths <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2025/07/25/preprint-claiming-that-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cause-transcriptomic-dysregulation-is-deeply-flawed/">Elisabeth Bik</a> and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/07/28/no-mrna-vaccines-do-not-cause-transcriptomic-chaos/">Reese Richardson</a> documented problems with the manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using one method, fluorometry, the authors of the <em>Autoimmunity </em>paper said they found amounts of DNA in all their samples of various vaccine lots that were higher than guidelines from the U.S. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/characterization-and-qualification-cell-substrates-and-other-biological-materials-used-production">Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/biologicals/documents/trs_978_annex_3.pdf">World Health Organization</a> recommend. Using the other method, qPCR, they said three samples were over the limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, Patrick, who uses the pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#1">pointed out</a> that the regulators’ recommendations were set for qPCR tests, not fluorometry. “Applying that regulatory threshold to fluorometry values is misleading, since regulators do not recognize fluorometry as the standard,” he wrote. Fluorometry also picks up mRNA, <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/addressing-misinformation-about-excessive-dna-mrna-vaccines">according to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration</a>, so it does not correctly measure DNA amounts in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In subsequent comments, Patrick also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#2">questioned</a> the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/16/exclusive-journal-bans-drug-safety-database-papers-as-they-flood-the-literature/">use of data</a> from the FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and the appropriateness of several of the documents the authors cited. One <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517#references-Section1">reference</a> consisted of <a href="https://www.porthedland.wa.gov.au/council-meetings/special-council-meetings/special-council-meeting-11-october-2024/247/documents/attachments_scm_11102024.pdf">the attachments</a> to a meeting agenda for the town council of Port Hedland, Australia, which included a report referencing a 2023 preprint from the paper’s coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the questionable references Patrick identified, Retraction Watch found the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/chemistry-manufacturing-and-control-cmc-information-human-gene-therapy-investigational-new-drug">FDA guidance</a> the researchers cited was issued for gene therapies, and explicitly stated it “does not apply to vaccines for infectious disease indications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other commenters on PubPeer added technical critiques of the paper as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea how this paper could have made it through peer review,” Patrick told us. “Sadly, we almost never find out what happens behind the scenes.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.</p></blockquote>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>You can read the request for information<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-138.html"> here.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Proposed Policy Options</h3>



<p>We recognize NIH&rsquo;s aim to maximize the value of taxpayer funds and increase the efficiency of research funding. However, the proposed approach of capping or limiting allowable publication costs will not achieve this goal and risks creating unintended consequences. To advance NIH&rsquo;s mission, enabling open science should be at the core of any policy consideration, particularly increased transparency and access to all research outputs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Article processing charge (APC) caps are not an effective cost control mechanism. A fundamental driver of journal choice is the research assessment system, not author cost sensitivity. The current research assessment and incentive systems rely on numbers: the number of articles published and the Journal Impact Factor (or journal names/&rsquo;prestige&rsquo;), contributing to a hypercompetitive environment that rewards quantity and prestige (or falsely equates it with quality). Data, code, protocols and other important outputs are not shared and valued to the same extent as articles, and researchers who make them accessible are by and large not rewarded. To address the fundamental issue, efforts such as<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27520/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-us-academic-institutions"> </a><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-u-s-academic-institutions-a-workshop">Rethinking Researcher Assessment and Incentives at U.S. Academic Institutions</a> should be supported.</li>



<li>Per-unit pricing models, such as APCs, entrench inefficiencies. Models that tie value to &ldquo;per article&rdquo; charges restrict flexibility, discourage sharing of diverse outputs (data, code, protocols) and embed the article as the primary research artifact of value. NIH should instead support models that move beyond articles and beyond APCs and reinforce open science.</li>



<li>Imposing caps will likely encourage publishers to set publishing fees at the maximum allowable level, rather than reduce costs. This risks replicating the <a href="https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/31330/1/CBP-8151%20_Redacted.pdf">experience of capped higher education tuition fees in the UK</a>, where nearly all institutions charged the maximum allowable amount. This will further fuel a research &ldquo;volume business&rdquo; as publishers continue to push for article growth, increasing profits and exacerbating the existing pressure on researchers to publish. The article growth economy is unhelpful for science, unhelpful for openness and entrenches the article as the primary valuable research artifact.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A better alternative would be to fund institutions and libraries to secure open access publishing services, enabling system-level efficiency and reducing reliance on APCs and APC-driven models. These funds should be considered in tandem with the considerable institution and library spend already allocated to paywalled publication access via subscriptions.</li>
</ul>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s proposal to limit allowable publishing costs should also be evaluated against the Nelson memo&rsquo;s stated aim to &ldquo;provide free, immediate (without embargo), and equitable access to research that is federally funded.&rdquo; to avoid unintentionally hindering its aims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sum, rather than capping costs at the article level, NIH should encourage research assessment reform and collective funding to support business models that incentivize openness and quality across all outputs. Such approaches more closely reflect the values of transparency, accessibility, and equity that define open science.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Available Evidence Related to Publication Costs and Proposed Options</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Distribution of research spending. Roughly 80% of scholarly publishing expenditure remains in subscription access; only 20% supports open access fees. Yet that 20% unlocks more than 50% of publications for open availability (<a href="https://www.deltathink.com/news-views-market-sizing-update-2024-has-oa-hit-a-peak">DeltaThink</a>). Focussing only on cost management via APCs and associated caps risks pushing research back behind paywalls, raising total costs for taxpayers. While preprinting is proposed as a solution to this <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/07/theres-more-to-research-than-citations-understanding-knowledge-sharing-practices-with-open-science-indicators/">uptake remains low</a> and they are not routinely reviewed.</li>



<li>Limitations of preprints without review<strong>.</strong> PLOS supports preprints because they have the potential to accelerate the dissemination of new research. However, while valuable, preprints are not a substitute for peer-reviewed outputs. These limitations highlight that, without appropriate funding, preprints remove an important element of research validation. PLOS&rsquo;s <a href="https://plos.org/gates-foundation-partnership/">own experiment </a>shows that preprint review has associated cost and requires funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Evidence on open access value. Studies show open access articles are read, downloaded, and cited more. PLOS analysis of<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/"> French Open Science Monitor data</a> demonstrated an 8.6% citation increase for OA articles, with additional benefits for data, code, and preprint sharing.</li>
</ul>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s reliance on DOAJ averages for setting APC limits raises important questions. It is not clear whether NIH-funded researchers typically publish in the journals analyzed, whether they meet NIH quality and licensing criteria, or whether they publish at sufficient scale. The approach appears to work backwards from what the average journal in DOAJ charges, rather than reflecting the actual costs of the services NIH seeks to support. Not all DOAJ journals, for example, offer the required CC0 license, and standards vary significantly. Using this as the sole basis for policy may risk undervaluing quality and integrity.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Peer Review Compensation</h3>



<p>Peer review is an essential part of the research process, but paying reviewers directly creates unintended consequences and perverse incentives:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unintended consequences<strong>.</strong> Compensating reviewers could increase publication costs overall (publishers may pass on costs) and risk lowering quality if reviewers accept assignments outside their expertise to earn payments.<br></li>



<li>Better alternatives. Recognition of peer review as a core part of research activity is more effective. Reviews should be published (with consent) and credited to reviewers, making them visible in research assessment exercises.<br></li>



<li>Transparency. Peer review should, where possible, be conducted transparently and shared in line with open science goals. Transparent peer review strengthens accountability and ensures reviewers receive recognition for their contributions. See PLOS&rsquo; commentary on<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/what-we-learned-by-publishing-peer-review-history/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/">publishing peer review history</a>.<br></li>



<li>Evidence<strong>.</strong> The<a href="https://publons.com/community/gspr"> Publons Global State of Peer Review (2018)</a> shows that recognition and career incentives have a greater impact on efficiency than direct payments.<br></li>



<li>Training. Investment in peer reviewer training demonstrably improves review quality. NIH support for recognition and training would be a more sustainable policy direction.</li>
</ul>



<p>Promoting recognition of peer review aligns with the principles of open science: transparency, accountability, and equitable credit for contributions beyond the published article. See PLOS&rsquo; commentary on<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/acknowledging-reviewers/">peer review recognition</a>.</p>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s calculation ($1,000 extra per article) underestimates the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2024/">cost</a> of multiple review rounds and undervalues the seniority of many peer reviewers. This calculation risks creating unrealistic expectations and confusion in implementation.</p>



<p>And consideration must be given to the overall costs of publishing which extend beyond peer review. Essential services include research integrity checks, assessment of methodological rigor, editorial oversight, production, dissemination, and long-term archiving. Any cost framework that focuses too narrowly risks overlooking these necessary quality assurance and stewardship functions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Publishing Best Practice</h3>



<p>The NIH&rsquo;s proposed policy risks reinforcing a narrow focus on the article as the sole marker of academic and research value. This undermines the benefits of an open science ecosystem, which recognizes the importance of diverse outputs such as data, code, protocols, and preprints as integral to transparency and progress. In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.2006">&ldquo;Rethinking how we publish to support Open Science&rdquo;</a>, we discuss the need to move beyond the article and beyond the APC:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Beyond the article<strong>.</strong> Ascribing both academic and economic value only at the point of article publication entrenches legacy costs and discourages the sharing of other important outputs. Evidence such as the<a href="https://www.digital-science.com/resources/portfolio-reports/state-of-open-data-2024-special-report/"> <em>State of Open Data 2024: Special Report</em></a> shows that lack of credit remains a primary barrier to wider data sharing.<br></li>



<li>Alignment with open science<strong>.</strong> Business models should incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research, not just the article&rsquo;s Version of Record. PLOS has been moving away from APC-based <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/community-action-publishing/">business</a> <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/global-equity/">models </a>since 2021, including through our project to <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">redefine publishing</a> &ldquo;Beyond the Article and Beyond the APC.&rdquo; PLOS supports the position that for open science practices to be adopted widely, research outputs must be linked, discoverable, and credited in their own right, not just the article Version of Record.<br></li>



<li>Benefits of openness. A knowledge-sharing ecosystem based on open science principles increases visibility, collaboration, and efficiency. Studies including an<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04021-w"> assessment of Springer hybrid journals</a> and<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/"> data from the French Open Science Monitor</a> demonstrate citation and usage advantages for open access and for practices such as sharing data, code, and preprints.</li>
</ul>



<p>Incorporating best practices ensures that taxpayer investment supports high-quality, trustworthy, and openly available science across all research outputs, not simply the cheapest or most traditional option. PLOS regularly shares updates on publishing innovations on our<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/"> blog</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Other Comments</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Implementation timeline. NIH&rsquo;s proposed effective date of January 1, 2026 leaves only three months after the consultation for preparation. By contrast, UKRI had a multi-year consultation and implementation timeline for their new OA policy. NIH should extend the timeline to allow institutions and researchers to adapt.<br></li>



<li>Extended consultation<strong>.</strong> Given the potential scale of impact, NIH should allow more time to gather feedback, engage stakeholders, and avoid confusion among researchers.<br></li>



<li>Systemic reform. The fundamental challenge is not APC pricing but the academic credit system. Reforming research assessment, such as <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-u-s-academic-institutions-a-workshop">through initiatives by the National Academies</a>, would be more effective at controlling costs and incentivizing openness.<br></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> NIH&rsquo;s goal to maximize taxpayer value will not be met by APC caps. A more effective approach is to support systemic reform in research assessment, enable collective funding mechanisms, and promote publishing practices aligned with open science, research integrity and transparency. PLOS urges NIH to adopt policies that advance the mission of <strong>open science for all</strong>, ensuring taxpayer-funded research is widely accessible, equitable, and maximally beneficial to society.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/09/the-promise-and-perils-of-ai-use-in-peer-review/">The promise and perils of AI use in peer review</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Renee Hoch, Head of Publication Ethics, PLOS</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is having an outsized influence on many industries, including scholarly publishing. The theme for this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://peerreviewweek.net/">Peer Review Week</a> explores how we can rethink Peer Review in the AI Era. Publishers like PLOS are carefully considering how AI can enhance peer review without undermining research integrity.</p>



<p>The current standard in the scholarly publishing community is that authors may use generative AI (genAI) in preparing submissions, (with some caveats; see this <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools">COPE position statement</a> and the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies">PLOS policy</a>). However, there are tight reins on AI use in peer review. Many journal policies specify that editors and reviewers must not upload submission content to genAI tools, and some either forbid genAI use in peer review altogether (e.g. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/page/peer-review-science-publications">Science</a>), or allow select AI use cases, such as to translate or edit one&rsquo;s own review comments (e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-AI-in-peer-review">PLOS</a>, <a href="https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/tools-and-resources/review-confidentiality-policy.html">Wiley</a>).</p>



<p>Why this different standard? Policies restricting or prohibiting AI in peer review mitigate risks that genAI use by editors or reviewers could introduce, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Breach of confidentiality for unpublished content and sensitive data</li>



<li>Loss of rigor and specificity in the assessment process</li>



<li>Fraudulent misrepresentation of genAI outputs and peer review contributors</li>



<li>Enablement &amp; acceleration of peer review manipulation (e.g. by paper mills)</li>
</ul>



<p>It may then seem paradoxical or even hypocritical that journals and publishers are exploring options for in-house AI usage in peer review. A key difference between in-house use (by journal staff) and external use (by academic editors and reviewers) is that a journal can deploy in-house tools in a controlled technology environment that protects data security, so that confidential content is not ingested into training sets which affect other users&rsquo; outputs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When data security measures are in place, AI can help improve the consistency with which journals enforce their standards and policies. For example, AI can detect and produce review reports querying issues such as incomplete, unverifiable, or retracted references, problematic statistical analyses, and non-adherence to data availability and pre-registration requirements. Human reviewers are inconsistent in the degree to which they address these types of issues which can directly impact integrity and reproducibility.</p>



<p>Although there are several good use cases for AI in <em>supporting</em> peer review, humans remain indispensable for providing rigorous content assessment. Whereas genAI detects and averages preexisting content, humans innovate and evaluate. We introduce new ideas and perspectives, bring creativity, curiosity, and intellect, and are able to synthesize, contextualize, interpret, and critique based on knowledge that spans multiple domains. In short, machines are a long way from being able to replicate human cognition, and so humans can engage in peer review and scientific discourse in a way that machines cannot. In practical terms, this means that people can identify issues that would not be evident to a machine reader or algorithm, and which can be crucial to scientific validity and integrity.</p>



<p>With that said, moving toward a hybrid human+AI peer review model could mitigate known pain points in peer review, including the heavy burden peer review places on academics and longer-than-ideal peer review timings. If AI covers technical aspects of the assessment, then perhaps we can use fewer reviewers to cover aspects of peer review that require uniquely human executive functioning capabilities. As a proof-of-concept for this model, a talk at the 2025 Peer Review Congress discussed a &lsquo;Fast Track&rsquo; peer review offering by NEJM AI in which decisions are issued within one week of submission based only on the editors&rsquo; evaluation of the manuscript and two AI-generated reviews.</p>



<p>While one-week turnaround times are enticing, there are several reasons to include at least two human experts in peer review, whether as editors and/or reviewers. Authors and articles benefit from evaluations reflecting different (human) perspectives; it often requires multiple individuals to cover the subject matter and methodological expertise needed for a rigorous assessment. Importantly, having two or more humans involved in peer review also increases the likelihood that any major scientific and integrity issues will be identified, and lends greater credibility overall to publications and journals. It also affords a degree of protection for authors, journals, and the broader community against issues that could compromise peer review, such as personal biases, competing interests, poor quality assessments, and unethical (mis)use of peer review for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI era may be here to stay, and publishers and researchers will continue to explore its uses, but caution and careful consideration must be given in every step of the peer review process. And, at the end of the day, it will never replace a person&rsquo;s expertise and judgement.</p>
