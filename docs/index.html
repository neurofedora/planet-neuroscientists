<p>What would you do if you discovered your name in a list of experts on sex robots despite having never studied sex robots?&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was the situation for one rather panicked researcher who reached out to us in late September after discovering his name among several singled out in a review article for the “greatest number of published works” on sex robots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Published in February in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, the bibliometric analysis of the field aimed “to provide a clearer understanding of the issues surrounding sex robots,” the original article stated.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133090"></span>



<p>The article included a list of the 10 authors who the paper claimed published the most articles on sex robot research. Of those, seven are robotics researchers who don’t study sex robots. The remaining three are a cardiologist, a prosthodontics professor and a researcher who we could not find proof exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher who contacted us was keen to get the paper, which he called “defamatory,” retracted. While we typically prefer to name sources, and credit any investigative work, we’re honoring his desire to distance himself from the paper and are therefore omitting his name — and the identities of the others named in the article — from our story so as not to increase the chances a search or AI tool will forever associate his name with “sex robots.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher first alerted <em>HHSC</em> to issues with the paper in late September, according to emails we have seen. The journal, published by Springer Nature, temporarily <a href="https://archive.is/BCq4H">took the article page down</a> on September 26. </p>



<p>“Given the context, access to the paper was removed as soon as we had undertaken an initial assessment,” Gino D’Oca, the chief editor of <em>HHSC</em>, told us. In a similar move earlier this year, Springer Nature <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">removed a link</a> to a book containing nonexistent references before restoring a retracted and watermarked version days later. The publisher confirmed at the time that removal from the website is part of the retraction process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the issues the researcher identified were discrepancies between the dataset, which contains a list of over 1,000 papers from journals indexed in Web of Science, and the authors’ claims. For example, the authors said <em>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</em> had published 30 papers on sex robots. Our search of the journal yielded no results, and the researcher who contacted us said the journal appeared just once in the authors’ dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher who contacted us had also reached out to someone who does study sex robots, who “confirmed that the paper is fake,” he said. Both researchers, and at least five others, contacted the journal directly to request the retraction, according to a document we have seen.</p>



<p>The journal issued a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-06061-7">retraction notice</a> on October 7, stating the analysis “employed inappropriate search terms and formulas, affecting the resulting reported data on the research field, including individual authors and journals.” The text of the original article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04430-w">has been removed</a> from both the website and the PDF.</p>



<p>D’Oca told us <em>HHSC </em>is looking into other work by one of the corresponding authors, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6900-8831">Shen Liu</a>. Liu is a psychology researcher at Anhui Agricultural University in Hefei, China, who authored&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7">another paper</a> in the journal&nbsp; purporting to use the <a href="https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/0d874150-b039-11ee-be97-f5a41b2eeb6e">same</a> <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UMDR3Y">dataset</a> as the now-retracted article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Liu nor co-corresponding author Na Zhang, also at Anhui, responded to our multiple requests for comment via email. The authors agreed with the retraction, according to the notice.</p>



<p>Other issues we spotted include a network analysis of authors that includes three “brought together by their mutual focus on robot-assisted radical cystectomy,” and others who perform nephrectomies. While these bladder and kidney surgeries are robot-assisted, they are unrelated to sex robots. The review also cites at least one work that does not exist and whose only other mention is in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7">another article</a> by Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For their analysis of journals publishing sex robot research, the authors use the term “Influential Factor (IF)” instead of “Impact Factor,” describing the term as a “paramount metric for evaluating scholarly impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>

                <div id="primary" class="col-md-8 col-xl-9 content-area">
<p>arXiv, along with openRxiv, has released its response to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Request for Information (RFI) on Maximizing Research Funds by Limiting Allowable Publishing Costs.</p>
<p>The NIH <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/nih-director/statements/nih-establish-new-policies-allowable-publication-costs">intends to establish new policies</a> limiting allowable publishing costs in an effort to maximize the value of each research grant, allowing NIH grantees to utilize as much of their grant funds as possible for research activities, rather than publishing costs.</p>
<p>To inform future policy options, the NIH undertook two analyses of recent publishing costs, and in September of 2025, the NIH solicited responses from the research community and the public at large to comment on their analyses of  <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-138.html">proposed options for limiting costs.</a></p>
<p>arXiv believes that the simplest way to make sure that the research funds provided by US taxpayers are dedicated to research activities would be to require NIH-funded authors to share articles as preprints on non-profit preprint servers such as arXiv (computational and physical sciences), bioRxiv (biological sciences), and medRxiv (health sciences) before submitting to journals. An important additional benefit would be the immediate availability of the research without the long delays associated with journal publication (typically around one year).</p>

<p>A soil scientist who resigned from several journals in 2017 after being linked to manipulated citations has been appointed to the editorial board of a journal copublished by Elsevier and China Science Publishing &amp; Media.</p>



<p><em>International Soil and Water Conservation Research</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-soil-and-water-conservation-research/about/news/prof-artemi-cerda-appointed-as-editorial-board-member-of-international-soil-and-water-conservation-research">announced in April</a> that Artemi Cerdà would serve as an editorial board member, describing him as a “renowned researcher” in the field of soil erosion and land management. The appointment comes eight years after Cerdà, of the University of Valencia, in Spain, was found to have manipulated citations in favor of his own work and journals with which he was associated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Cerdà has not responded to our questions about his appointment, a spokesperson for Elsevier acknowledged Cerdà’s history but defended the decision, writing that researchers “grow into their roles through participation and learning.” The spokesperson continued:</p>



<span id="more-133078"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[The] Editors believe it is reasonable to consider individuals for roles based on current willingness to uphold standards and accept the journal’s ethical policies, rather than excluding them indefinitely for past actions.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Prof. Cerdà was invited to join the editorial board following a nomination and review by the Editors-in-Chief, due to his recognized expertise in soil and water conservation, strong alignment with the journal’s scope, and ongoing scientific contributions. While past misconduct from nearly a decade ago is taken seriously, he has demonstrated the necessary commitment to standards, and the journal has a strict monitoring plan in place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsevier declined to elaborate on what the “strict monitoring plan” involves, citing confidentiality.</p>



<p>As a “safeguard,” Cerdà will not handle any final manuscript decisions, only conducting reviews and providing editorial recommendations, Paige Chyu, the executive editor of <em>International Soil and Water Conservation Research</em>, told us in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe that protecting the integrity of the scholarly record must be balanced with a framework that allows redemption and learning, under strict oversight,” she wrote, adding that to their knowledge, no policy prevents individuals with prior misconduct from serving in editorial roles at other journals. </p>



<p>“[A]fter a decade, scientists who demonstrate a willingness to reform should be given an opportunity to re-enter the editorial community to constructively contribute to the community,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal made the appointment despite Cerdà’s role in a citation scandal involving several journals. In early 2017, the European Geosciences Union <a href="https://www.egu.eu/media/filer_public/07/79/07798eae-e4e4-48f2-a9d0-6b8ce0110302/egu-copernicus-report-about-citation-stacking.pdf">began looking into</a> an anonymous report about an alleged citation cartel among its soil science journals. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/17/editor-resigns-two-journals-considerable-citation-boosting-attempts/">As we reported at the time</a>, an unnamed editor stepped down from two EGU journals, <em>SOIL </em>and <em>Solid Earth</em>, for manipulating citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/24/editor-steps-journal-investigates-citation-irregularities/">EGU later named Cerdà</a> as the only culprit, finding that in 41 reviews for which he had served as a topical editor, he had suggested more than 600 extra references, mostly to his own work or papers from <em>Land Degradation and Development </em>(<em>LDD</em>)<em>, </em>where he was editor-in-chief. On another 38 manuscripts on which he was a reviewer, he had suggested authors include more than 400 extra references, most to <em>LDD</em> papers.  </p>



<p>While the authors didn’t add all the suggested references, Cerdà’s actions drove <em>LDD</em>’s impact factor up from 3.1 to 8.1 within a single year. At the time, the case was the catalyst for <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/elsevier-investigates-hundreds-peer-reviewers-for-manipulating-citations">Elsevier to question thousands of reviewers</a> and their suggested citations in a broader analysis. </p>



<p>Cerdà also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">resigned</a> from the editorial board of <em>Geoderma</em>, and stepped down from his leadership position at <em>LDD</em>. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/24/ousted-editor-speaks-not-manipulate-citations/">Cerdà has defended his actions,</a> telling us he did not force authors to include his suggested citations. “I suggest to read – not to cite – other work,” he told us at the time. </p>



<p>At <em>Geoderma</em>, an Elsevier journal, 13 articles he reviewed were published with a total of 83 “unwarranted” citations — 75 of which he was either the coauthor of the paper or was an editor at the journal where the cited paper was published, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706118305123">according to a 2018 editorial</a>. The then-editor-in-chief Jan-Willem van Groenigen wrote Cerdà would no longer be considered as a reviewer, author or editor at the journal “for the foreseeable future” and “will only be allowed to take on these roles once we are convinced that there will be no repeat of the misconduct.” He encouraged other editors to take similar action.</p>



<p>Groenigen, speaking in a personal capacity, told us he believes the quality of a journal is a reflection of its team. A “history of scientific conduct (or misconduct) should therefore be an important criterion,” he said. Groenigen noted Cerdà’s history of conduct is “readily accessible,” including in our coverage.  </p>



<p>The University of Valencia listed Cerdà <a href="https://www.uv.es/uvweb/uv-noticias/es/noticias/siete-cientificos-universitat-valencia-mas-citados-del-mundo-ranking-/universidad-stanford-1285973304159/Novetat.html?id=1286401271265&amp;plantilla=UV_Noticies/Page/TPGDetaillNews">among its most highly cited scientists</a> in 2024. On PubPeer, anonymous commenters are still questioning his publication record, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E6A53C85CA18D4B0D3A48959F1720E#0">flagging</a> what they describe as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EB4A1CCA6358A37415522019481CD6#0">“extensive, irrelevant and bizarre”</a> citations in two recent papers he coauthored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A high-ranking official at Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research has earned six<a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHayder%2bA%2bDhahad"> retractions</a> over the past two years for issues including citation stuffing and “suspicious” authorship changes after articles were accepted.</p>



<p>Both practices are<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/top-tips-on-identifying-citation-misconduct"> warning signs of a paper mill at play</a>. At least two of the official’s retracted works appeared in<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220717113131/https:/www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-energy-storage/special-issue/10MKCTKWGV7"> a special issue</a> edited by<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/"> an academic</a> who has been<a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/"> accused of being part of authorship-for-sale networks</a>.</p>



<p>But<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-hayder-abed-dhahad-5511b4200/"> Hayder Abed Dhahad</a>, Iraq’s<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/navbar/agents"> deputy minister for scientific research affairs</a>, who was a corresponding author on two of the articles and a coauthor on the rest, told us the “retractions were not due to fabricated results or research misconduct on my part.” He added that “as a public figure currently involved in national projects,” he had been the target of “politically motivated campaigns aimed at damaging my reputation.”</p>



<span id="more-133059"></span>



<p>The six retracted papers were published in 2022 in <em>Fuel</em>, the <em>Journal of Energy Storage </em>and <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements,</em> three Elsevier titles <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/08/23/maybe-stop-accepting-submissions-herr-prof-dr-sauer/">marred</a><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/04/02/karimipour-saga-i-setting-boundaries/"> by</a><a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224"> paper mill products</a>. That same year, scientific sleuth<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/"> Alexander Magazinov</a> began flagging the articles on PubPeer for having irrelevant citations.</p>



<p>In one case, Magazinov<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/71E9770C2FB7BDED47BAE13381B0B4?utm_source=Firefox&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Firefox"> highlighted a passage</a> in<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X22005904?via%3Dihub"> a paper</a> whose corresponding author was Dhahad: “The use of numerical methods is common among researchers in various fields [55–59],” the paper stated. “Numerical methods have greatly contributed to the spread of studies among researchers [60–64].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the sleuth, the two sentences served no other purpose than introducing extraneous citations, eight of which were to papers by Yu-Ming Chu, a <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/entities/publication/author/ur.015403022055.21">highly cited</a> researcher at Huzhou University in China. Chu has earned <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dYu%2bMing%2bChu">several retractions</a> for fake peer review and suspicious authorship changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That paper, along with a second on which Dhahad was one of two corresponding authors, appeared in a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220717113131/https:/www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-energy-storage/special-issue/10MKCTKWGV7"> special issue</a> in the <em>Journal of Energy Storage</em> that was later <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23023472">investigated due to concerns</a> “about the integrity and rigor of the peer-review process.” As we reported in 2023, Magazinov has linked one of the guest editors of the special issue, Iranian scientist Masoud Afrand, to<a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/"> a paper mill operation</a> in relation to another special issue that cited him more than 130 times. Magazinov has also <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/08/23/maybe-stop-accepting-submissions-herr-prof-dr-sauer/">criticized</a> the <em>Journal of Energy Storage</em>’s special issue in a blog post.</p>



<p>The article’s<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X2401538X"> retraction notice</a>, from July 2024, referenced Magazinov’s PubPeer comments. It also stated the editor-in-chief of the journal had “discovered suspicious changes in authorship between the original submission and the revised version of this paper,” for which the authors could not offer a satisfactory explanation.</p>



<p>Dhahad called the journal’s decision to pull his paper “an excellent example of the unfair and illogical retraction of scientific work” and also disputed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/71E9770C2FB7BDED47BAE13381B0B4?utm_source=Firefox&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Firefox">Magazinov’s allegations</a> on PubPeer. The research cited in the two sentences Magazinov highlighted were “well-established works in numerical and computational methods that form the foundation of applied engineering simulations,” Dhahad said. “Their inclusion is both logical and necessary, as they provide the theoretical framework, mathematical justification, and validation approaches for the numerical simulations applied in our study.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dhahad offered detailed comments on the relevance of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dhahad-email-1.pdf">each of the references</a>. In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dhahad-email-2.pdf">subsequent email to us</a>, he also said the author changes had been “processed transparently through Elsevier’s Editorial Manager system” and “reflected a responsible adjustment to ensure that the final list of authors accurately represented those who intellectually and practically contributed to the research outcomes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Until now, we have not been given any clear explanation” for the retraction, the deputy minister added. “It is also important to emphasize that the paper underwent a rigorous peer-review process, as shown in the attached reviewers’ email below, and no objections were raised regarding this section or these citations during the evaluation.”</p>



<p>But the peer review process may have been compromised. A retraction notice for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21012329">the first paper</a> in the special issue, written by a researcher in Saudi Arabia, stated “the acceptance of this article was based upon the positive advice of reviewer reports from reviewers who were closely linked to the Guest Editors. The citations included in the paper benefited some of the Guest Editors, namely Nader Karimi [9 citations] and Masoud Afrand [7 citations].”</p>



<p>An email <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dhahad-email-1.pdf">from the journal</a> Dhahad forwarded to us suggests the same could be true of his paper: One reviewer quoted in the correspondence requested the addition of five references, three of which had Afrand’s name in the author list (Afrand’s frequent coauthor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mb5rpgkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Arash Karimipour</a> was an author of all five). Two of the references were added to the manuscript.</p>



<p>Dhahad’s paper also contained several references to work by another <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/entities/publication/author/ur.010571010173.84">top-cited</a> author in China, Changhe Li of Qingdao University of Technology, whose research is <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22yu-ming+chu%22+and+%22changhe+li%22+and+%22citation+magnets%22">often cited together with Chu’s</a>. Li and Dhahad were co-corresponding authors on<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X22009136"> another retracted paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Energy Storage</em>’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23023472">problematic special issue</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2175947">a comment</a> on one of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=masoud+afrand">our stories about Afrand</a>, sleuth Maarten van Kampen called Li a “canary in a coalmine … to detect citation plantations.” According to the sleuth, references to Li’s work frequently appear out of context and in papers containing tortured phrases, a sign authors may have used paraphrasing software to camouflage plagiarized content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dhahad’s other retractions are related to similar problems. A notice in <em>Fuel</em> from August, for instance, stated the authors had<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236125006726"> added 35 references after their original submission</a> and changed the author list without telling editors. That paper also<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/466490A11516B66D633FBAC5AB6B36"> cited Li’s work heavily</a>, as Magazinov pointed out on PubPeer, and the journal agreed the inappropriate references “could amount to potential citation stuffing to the benefit of certain researchers.”</p>



<p>Magazinov told us the frequent, out-of-context citations to Li’s work suggest Dhahad’s papers originated from Iranian paper mills. “Iraqi ’scholars’ do a lot of article shopping in one neighboring country,” Magazinov said, referring to Iran.</p>



<p>In addition to the retracted papers,<a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+Hayder+A.+Dhahad"> dozens of the deputy minister’s other articles</a> have also been flagged on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Dhahad, who also<a href="https://me.uotechnology.edu.iq/en/hayder-abed-dhahad/"> is a professor and vice president for scientific affairs and higher education studies</a> at the University of Technology in Baghdad, said the retracted “works were produced within collaborative research teams, and I was not solely responsible for all aspects of authorship or submission. In some cases, changes or issues arose at the level of co-authors or during the journal process itself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His international collaborations – with authors from China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, India and Tunisia – began in 2019, Dhahad said, when he and Hadi Ghaebi, a <a href="https://academics.uma.ac.ir/profiles?lng=en&amp;Id=655">mechanical engineer at the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili</a> in Iran, established a “research partnership” between their two institutions. The efforts later “grew into a multinational research team,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dhahad-email-2.pdf">Dhahad told us</a>. Several of Ghaebi’s works have been flagged on PubPeer for <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Hadi+Ghaebi%22">containing allegedly irrelevant citations</a>.</p>



<p>Dhahad emphasized that research integrity is “one of our primary goals in the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Iraq” and highlighted the ministry’s work to prevent the country’s scholars from publishing in predatory journals.</p>



<p>Corruption reportedly<a href="https://raseef22.net/article/1098674-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82"> is rampant</a> in Iraq’s higher education system. Last month, we wrote about a<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/05/yasser-fakri-mustafa-iraq-mosul-university-dean-paper-mills-retractions/"> dean at a university there who had been linked to paper mills</a> and a physics professor who<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/19/exclusive-iraq-physicist-oday-al-owaedi-fired-ministry-publishing-scam/"> orchestrated a publishing scheme</a> to defraud junior scientists of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Insiders say the problems are rooted in a tough dilemma facing the struggling nation’s researchers: On one hand, the country spends critically little on research, with an R&amp;D expenditure of<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=IQ"> just 0.04 percent</a> of its gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. On the other, master’s and Ph.D. students<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf"> are required to publish articles</a> in indexed journals to obtain their degrees.</p>



<p>“You are pushing those people to fake research,” said an Iraqi university scholar who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. “They can&#8217;t collect data with no money.”</p>



<p>Another academic, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed, telling us, “the scientific research budget is 0.0%, yet Iraqi research output appears explosive. Most legitimate research is funded out of academics&#8217; and students&#8217; own pockets, while the rest consists of fake publications from papermillers and other falsifications.”</p>

<p>When measuring the properties of a particular material, you want to make sure your sample is as clean as possible. But sometimes a well-intentioned effort to purify can make things worse.</p>



<p>Just ask Lindsay Greer, a professor of materials science at the University of Cambridge. He and his colleagues discovered measurements they reported in 2022 were actually an artifact of a cleaning agent used to prepare their sample.</p>



<p>Greer became aware of the issue during unsuccessful attempts to replicate his lab’s discovery of magnetic properties in an alloy their collaborators had made. Instead, they found oxidation from a cleaning product had contaminated their original results. The error led to a retraction, a declined grant, a commentary describing their troubleshooting — and a story about science working as it should.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133031"></span>



<p>“I have given several scientific talks that included our retraction story,” Greer said of the paper, which was retracted in December 2024. “Audience reaction has been uniformly positive.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202416229">now-retracted paper</a>, published in 2022 in <em>Advanced Science</em>, described the unexpected discovery that a fabricated material had desirable magnetic properties, indicating the presence of an alloy called tetrataenite. Materials with these properties typically include rare-earth metals, which can be costly and environmentally damaging to obtain. The new material did not contain these elements, so it seemed like it “might be a long-sought route to high-performance magnets without rare-earth content,” Greer told us.</p>



<p>The findings the researchers reported “were entirely accidental,” Greer said. “We were looking for good mechanical properties, not good magnetic properties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/182">News</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/researchers-find-possible-replacement-for-rare-earth-in-magnets">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk/new-approach-to-cosmic-magnet-manufacturing-could-reduce-reliance-on-rare-earths-in-low-carbon-technologies/">press releases</a> touted the discovery of the alloy’s magnetic properties as a new way to make tetrataenite, dubbed a “cosmic magnet.” The group applied for a patent on the material and a grant from the European Union to fund their efforts to optimize its magnetic properties.</p>



<p>“While awaiting a decision on that funding,” Greer said, he had members of his lab who were not on the original paper test new, related materials. However, they found “absolutely no evidence” for the component of the material responsible for the magnetic properties. They tested a new batch of the original material made in a different lab and a sample from the original, and did not find this component in either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greer told us once the lab was unable to replicate the original results with the original material, he contacted the journal to begin the retraction process, declined the EU grant funding, and stopped pursuing the patent on the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further studies in Greer’s lab revealed what caused the original incorrect results — a surface oxide induced by a cleaning procedure, Greer told us. “Ironically, trying to use the best ‘cleaning’ of the sample had achieved the opposite!”</p>



<p>The original article has been cited 19 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including three citations since its retraction on Dec. 18, 2024. Greer does not have any other retracted papers.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>Advanced Science</em>, told us, the “authors’ willingness to flag errors that potentially undermine their findings, as was the case here, in order to correct the record, is a healthy part of the research and publishing process.”</p>



<p>The researchers who discovered the contamination issue wrote a commentary describing their attempts to replicate the original findings. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202408796">The paper</a>, titled “Reinterpretation of report of tetrataenite in bulk alloy castings,” was published in <em>Advanced Science</em> around the same time as the retraction notice for the original paper.</p>
