<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/science-of-law.png"><img decoding="async" width="153" height="198" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/science-of-law.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131889"/></a></figure></div>


<p><em>Editor’s note: We asked Elsevier to respond to some of the findings in this post. In response, a spokesperson told us they will now remove the journal from Scopus. See Elsevier’s response <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?p=131884">in this story</a>.</em></p>



<p>I received a letter recently pointing me to a questionable journal indexed in Elsevier’s Scopus database. Scopus indexes many problematic and even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/18/journal-hijackers-still-infiltrate-scopus-despite-its-efforts/">hijacked</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">journals</a>, but this case is the most outrageous I have seen to date.</p>



<p>Scopus indexed <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL"><em>Science of Law</em></a> in July 2024. According to its profile in the database, the journal is published by the “Editorial Team of SoL.”  However, “the editorial team” and many <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL/about/editorialTeam">members of the editorial board</a> are fake names and that such individuals do not actually exist. For example, the three editors listed — Alessio Miceli from the University of Alabama School of Law, Anita Steinberg from Wichita State University, and Jeffrey Robinson from McGeorge School of Law — do not have author profiles in Scopus. The universities themselves do not have anyone with these names in their directories. </p>



<span id="more-131886"></span>



<p>The 60-plus members of the editorial<strong> </strong>board are<strong> </strong>also most likely fake. Jakub Muchlinski, Sofia Vermeulen and Caspian Magliveras can’t be found in Scopus because such an author probably doesn’t exist.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZ3lJe7bVP5xnmPSusYIGk9uuPQ_VVGlpUzBobYetisrJ9uNeds2neX3ZKHxt0VGQb6cU1P5JR8zyVjAIgb_MVsKTpEDb5AEgOhdTbkTXFvS58NMgKnJFcE7WMEXvB2nxehrAl?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of the journal’s profile in Scopus</figcaption></figure>



<p>In reality this journal’s publisher is <a href="https://onlinesciencepublishing.com/">Online Science Publishing</a>, which publishes 12 more journals, all of which can be identified in Crossref.<em> Science of </em>Law<em> </em>charges a publication fee of $780 USD.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdje56Wud0pTG1vC51Gxpnkis8HSA9sVrgU7uvuOUivi5mAH9J1fyh7-u2UrYemzpNAy4TxqSAsSBOt4x9Msii5bLbQrQqYXUGum65QXr8wz8JWqPkUMcOKv2ks1xR8CYPYsYSXKw?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of journals published by Online Science Publishing, according to Crossref.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another red flag for the journal is the anonymous registration of the website domain legal-science.com in December 2023 with GoDaddy. Anonymous registration is a common practice among fraudulent journals.</p>



<p>The timeline raises further concerns. How could a journal with a domain registered in December 2023 be indexed in Scopus in July 2024, when Scopus requires at least two years of regular publication for newly launched journals before indexation? (They did remove that <a href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-content-policy-and-selection-changes?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rule</a> in August 2024, after this journal was indexed.)&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEd9nZLfYtt_fHeo3vX4tGy_Z5oHNoIzK6_-BW54rCcXHtGj6jBOe2X62TKluaYshuLbkQ9akji57j3LRtz2eUbRExWgvzw_tMtnS8Gd8PHWmBrfzPZIsu57CSUSVU8npBLkpF0w?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt="" style="width:300px"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of the web domain registration details</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The likely answer: The journal backdated the archive and filled it with papers that are probably fabricated and “authored” by nonexistent researchers for issues starting in 2021 through the second issue of 2024 to demonstrate its continuous and regular publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that is hard to verify because the full text of articles is not freely accessible, which is very typical for problematic journals. For example, hijacked journals also have a fake archive that you can access only with a “subscription.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the papers from these issues are currently indexed in Scopus. And, according to the database, some of these papers cite others in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe0jVSFYO2f6X4oZV_-GKntdgR0AhSdXy7AXilUOMbGhvB0TuvVlOAvNvhu8VXgMnSFSvSJ-zPvgG-WE1DK12rDw_IfCWCjs0JXgywCRoD8SYKY6xOv_jNjsx2UOqzeug5lbUYk?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Louis Vieillard can’t be traced at Paris Dauphine University. There are no other papers written by a Louis Vieillard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the papers published before Scopus indexed the journal are likely fake, the third issue of 2024 most likely consists of real submissions. However, many published papers also have red flags. For example, there are collaboration anomalies, such as multiple affiliations per paper, a sign of paper mill production.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This case is shocking. It demonstrates that Scopus,<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus"> “the world&#8217;s largest, comprehensive and trusted academic database</a>,” can’t be trusted due to vulnerabilities in the evaluation processes and a lack of ability to identify fraudulent publishers. This is a very evident case of a fake journal that should have been immediately rejected during the evaluation process. This case demonstrates the failure of evaluation by the Content Selection and Advisory Board and content control in Scopus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also shows that fraudsters now don’t need to buy a journal indexed in Scopus to publish problematic papers, as happened with many journals like <em>Migration Letters</em> and <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em>. It is enough to create a fake journal with a fake editorial board and a fake archive to be indexed in one of the leading databases.</p>



<p>The experience of recent years shows that fraudulent publishing has increased, together with paper mills and fake, predatory or hijacked journals. Such bad practices are legitimized by indexing databases, and the lack of quality integrity control will lead to a decrease in trust in data quality.</p>



<p>To respond to the threats of fraudulent publishers, the databases collecting the scientific record must have an in-house research integrity board to identify bad actors. It should include research integrity experts who would proactively identify patterns of problematic journals, fraudulent publishers that hunt for journals indexed in bibliographic databases, hijacked and predatory journals. Without that, it only incentivizes fraudulent activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsevier has removed a journal from its Scopus database after Retraction Watch inquired about its review process for the journal, whose editorial board lists fake names and digital fingerprint shows other red flags.</p>



<p>Scientific sleuth Anna Abalkina uncovered several issues with <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL/index"><em>Science of Law</em></a>, which she details <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?p=131886">in a post published today</a>. Besides editors and editorial board members who cannot be verified and don’t seem to exist, the journal’s history doesn’t match its publication record, early articles show signs of fabrication, and its publisher data in Scopus doesn’t match that in Crossref. Despite this, Scopus added the journal to its index last year. </p>



<p>To understand how these problems could have evaded reviewers at Scopus, we asked Elsevier if Scopus staff verifies editorial board members when vetting journals, and if they assess the quality and validity of articles in journals before adding them to the index.</p>



<span id="more-131884"></span>



<p>A statement from an unnamed Elsevier spokesperson indicated that as a result of our inquiry, the company will remove the journal from the database. That statement reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for raising these serious concerns regarding the current content of Science of Law, which we share.</p>



<p>Science of Law was accepted for inclusion in July 2024, following Scopus’ rigorous <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/content/content-policy-and-selection#1-title-evaluation">evaluation processes</a>, including review of the listed Editors, policies, and publication and citation record.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the journal information and content on which acceptance was based have since been changed or removed, and the journal no longer meets Scopus’ standards for quality and integrity.</p>



<p>We have therefore taken the decision to immediately discontinue coverage of new content from Science of Law. We are also taking the exceptional step of removing all previous content.</p>



<p>Maintaining the integrity of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of paramount importance to us. This case will be used to inform our continuous efforts to review and refine Scopus’ (re)evaluation processes.</p>

<p>We write plenty of stories about lengthy investigations and long wait times for retractions. So we are always glad when we can highlight when journals act in a relatively timely fashion.</p>



<p><em>The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences, </em>published by Wiley on behalf of Kaohsiung Hospital in Taiwan<em>,</em> seemed to exhibit some urgency after a sleuth raised concerns in December 2024 about a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/kjm2.12145">2019 paper</a> with problematic figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sleuth, who has asked us to remain anonymous but goes by “Mitthyridium jungquilianum” on PubPeer, had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A72CF2F90D79EF7A7965D41B3203A4">pointed out similarities</a> between the 2019 paper and another article by different authors, <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/2682/text/">published in <em>Oncotarget</em></a> in 2014. One figure from each work was “more similar than expected” to each other, Mitthyridium wrote, citing ImageTwin.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131878"></span>



<p>Although Mitthyridium wasn’t the first to raise concerns on PubPeer — a separate comment in 2021 drew parallels between the <em>Kaohsiung</em> article and a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcb.27204">retracted 2018 paper</a> from a separate journal — the sleuth sent their concerns to the journal on December 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails we have seen, the journal responded two days later requesting a formal report. After the sleuth refused to provide one, the research integrity office at Wiley told the sleuth on January 4 they were investigating the paper. The journal and publisher retracted the article three months later, on April 8. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/kjm2.70030">retraction notice</a> cites images that were “found duplicated in other articles published earlier elsewhere, and in some cases representing a different scientific context.”</p>



<p>The article has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us there was no particular reason the retraction happened so quickly. “We did not expedite this investigation, rather, consider the timing quite standard for an investigation of this size,” the spokesperson said. They also noted the authors did not respond to inquiries, which could have helped the process move faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past year, the journal has retracted two other articles, one for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/kjm2.70009">data issues</a> brought up by authors and one for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/kjm2.12945">data duplication</a>. The journal of Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan, it was formerly published by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-kaohsiung-journal-of-medical-sciences">Elsevier</a>; the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-kaohsiung-journal-of-medical-sciences">website</a> notes it was transferred “back to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/24108650/homepage/society">the society</a>” as of 2019, at which time Wiley partnered with the university to publish it. </p>



<p>The journal aims to “promote clinical and scientific research in the medical sciences in Taiwan, and to disseminate this research to the international community,” according to their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/24108650/homepage/overview">mission statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gong-En Tang, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment. Tang’s <a href="https://journals.lww.com/sjga/fulltext/2020/26040/lncrna_neat1_modulates_sorafenib_resistance_in.5.aspx">most recent paper</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Gongen-Tang-2134150065">appears to have been</a> published in 2020. It lists their affiliation as Linyi Central Hospital in China. Tang does not have an ORCID profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BA02CA5304B95166E3F3B322809CC">PubPeer comment</a>, Rui Wang, the co-corresponding author of the article in <em>Oncotarget</em>, said similarities between his work and later papers “obviously indicate that the images … were copied from our paper.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clarivate_Logo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="914" height="273" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clarivate_Logo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131873" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clarivate_Logo.jpg 914w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clarivate_Logo-300x90.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clarivate_Logo-768x229.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Clarivate will no longer include citations to and from retracted papers when calculating journal impact factors, the company <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/blog/journal-citation-reports-2025-addressing-retractions-and-strengthening-research-integrity">announced today</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change comes after <a href="https://www.editage.com/insights/why-you-should-not-use-the-journal-impact-factor-to-evaluate-research">some have wondered</a> over the years whether citations to retracted papers should count toward a journal’s impact factor, a controversial yet closely watched metric that measures how often others cite papers from that journal. For many institutions, impact factors have become a proxy for the importance of their faculty’s research.</p>



<p>Retractions are relatively rare and represent only 0.04% of papers indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science, according to the announcement. But the overall <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">retraction rate</a> has risen recently, to about 0.2%, which, along with a decrease in the time it takes to retract papers, motivated the policy change. <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/people/nandita-quaderi/">Nandita Quaderi</a>, the editor-in-chief of Web of Science, said in the announcement the policy would “pre-emptively guard against any such time that citations to and from retracted content could contribute to widespread distortions in the [journal impact factor].”</p>



<span id="more-131868"></span>



<p>Clarivate publishes impact factors annually in its Journal Citation Reports. The impact factor represents the number of citations in a given year to works published in a journal in the previous two years, divided by the total number of citable items published in those previous two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting with the 2025 Journal Citation Reports, Clarivate will exclude citations to and from retracted articles in the numerator, “ensuring that citations from retracted articles do not contribute to the numerical value of” the impact factor, the announcement stated. Retracted articles will remain in the article count for the denominator, “maintaining transparency and accountability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This decision makes intuitive sense but could incentivize against retraction,” bibliometrics expert <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Reese Richardson</a> said. By keeping retracted items in the denominator of the equation, “this deepens the impact that any given retraction will have on a journal’s [impact factor],” he told us. He said he also wonders “how many journals will actually see a substantial reduction” in impact factor as a result of the change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quaderi told us Clarivate would stop counting citations once the paper is retracted, but would keep those that occurred before. The company will continue to use the <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch Database</a> to flag retracted papers in indexed journals, which it has done since 2022.</p>



<p>Clarivate typically releases the annual Journal Citation Reports in late June. The JCR incorporates information from impact factors to assess the overall standing of its indexed journals. The company also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">suppresses impact factors</a> for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/12/journal-retracts-31-papers-bans-authors-and-reviewers-after-losing-its-impact-factor/">journals</a> with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">abnormal citation behaviors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quaderi told us this change would not impact a researcher’s h-index, another metric that measures citation behavior and productivity. In other words, when Clarivate calculates h-index, it won’t remove retracted papers – or citations to those papers – from the calculation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/08/11/is-it-time-for-a-retraction-index/">In 2011</a>, Arturo Casadevall and Ferric Fang, who is now a member of our parent nonprofit’s board of directors, showed using the Retraction Index that journals with higher impact factors tended to have more retractions, for unclear reasons.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="653" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-1024x653.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131864" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-1024x653.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-300x191.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-768x489.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction.png 1078w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">One of several retraction notices noting &#8220;the existence and nature&#8221; of a company couldn&#8217;t be confirmed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since March of last year, Elsevier has pulled around 60 papers connected to companies in the Caucasus region that don’t seem to exist. The retraction notices attribute the decision to suspicious changes in authorship and the authors being unable to verify the existence of their employers. Online sleuths have also flagged potentially manipulated citations among the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the retracted papers appears to follow an identical pattern, based on the details given in the retraction notices. First, a solo author submits a paper and claims to be affiliated with a company that doesn’t appear in any business registries. During the revision process, the author adds several other authors to the paper — including new first and corresponding authors, despite no clear contribution to the original work. This behavior <a href="https://www.escienceediting.org/journal/view.php?number=314">is typical of</a> paper mills and authorship-for-sale schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked by the editors, the original authors are unable to explain why they added the additional authors, nor validate the “nature” or “existence” of the companies they were claiming an affiliation with, according to the retraction notices.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131863"></span>



<p> The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZ3Bw927zex1a8W6GvxX3KANp3azPhArZwl1fWHi7Bw/edit?gid=0#gid=0">papers linked to these companies</a> seem to be largely published in Elsevier journals, with a few exceptions. A spokesperson for the publisher said they discovered “unauthorized authorship changes” during the review process. That prompted a wider investigation across multiple journals, the spokesperson said. &#8220;Many of the issues which subsequently came to light were in papers that had already been published.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elsevier does allow authors to be added during the revision process, under certain conditions. <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/behind-the-byline-identifying-and-addressing-authorship-changes">According to a December 2024 guide</a>, any changes to authorship before a paper is accepted should be approved by the editor and accompanied by a written explanation. The guide states authors are “now required” to submit a form for editorial consideration to change authorship, but when that form became a requirement is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Dozens of papers are linked to ‘Sun-life’ or ‘Sunlife’ company, and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670725001374">one instance</a> “Sun-light.” The company is purportedly headquartered in Baku, Azerbaijan, although <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018584">one article</a> bases it in Bangkok, Thailand. Several authors claim to be affiliated with the departments of electrical engineering, solar energy, or stomatology – a field related to dentistry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither business name appears to be on any Azerbaijani corporate listings, but a website for the company briefly appeared online. A domain was registered in March 2024, around the time that <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/03/01/schneider-shorts-1-03-2024-remember-why-we-work-on-cancer/">‘For Better Science’ began raising questions</a> about the papers, and of the first retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website’s meta description says the company is a “leading force” in the renewable energy sector, and that it was founded in 2015. But the domain status is pending delete, meaning whoever owns the domain has not renewed the purchase, and the link no longer seems to connect to any content. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240902061822/http://sunlife-pv.com/">archived snapshot</a> of the website shows a paragraph referring to an American non-profit organization that’s unrelated to Sunlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A similar pattern appears with “Arian company,” claiming to be based in Yerevan, Armenia. That name can be found among legitimate Armenian businesses, but they are hospitality or jewelry businesses, not ones involved in scientific research. In one case, a submitting author named Ashk Fars claimed an affiliation with Sunlife in Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484721011422">in 2021</a>, and then to Arian company in Armenia <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319925009292">in 2023</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544223030748?via%3Dihub">“Yerevn Company”</a> the same year. No contact information or online presence could be found for Fars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander Magazinov, a Kazakhstan-based software engineer known for uncovering suspicious papers, has looked into these companies, commenting on dozens of the articles on PubPeer highlighting the fake affiliations. While Magazinov said the first retraction was independent of his findings, he later contacted Elsevier about the papers linked to Arian Company, prompting the publisher to ask him for evidence the company was fake.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19sC1DbvVQoy1aJJlQSb6DsbJgOjjtOHlG8xgF8QgDn4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">In his research</a>, he has spotted another affiliation he presumes to be fake: &#8220;Solar Energy and Power Electronic Co.,&#8221; which claims to be based in Japan but is also listed in cities across Turkey and in Germany. None of these papers have been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nasrin Eghbalian appears at least five times as the submitting author and was the only person affiliated with the ghost companies who had a listed email address. In February 2024, Eghbalian <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A53816914619B7BE862A766738E64B#0">responded to a PubPeer inquiry</a> about the nature of Sunlife. He claimed the company is active in research projects and renewable energy projects, but that it had stopped operating, even though the company’s website was registered a month after his comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The research activity of this company is closed and we are not be able to contact with the related manager. We used the valid affiliation due to the collaboration with this company. Now, if there is serious concern about this affiliation, please remove it. Regards, Authors</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked for proof of the company’s existence, Eghbalian declined to provide proof publicly:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As you know the employees in a private company doesn&#8217;t have accessibility for the company details. To solve the mentioned problem, I have contacted with all managers in the company who I was familiar with them. Fortunately, I get some information from this company. But, to have more details, I can not send them in public pages. Please send me your email for further communications and clarifications.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eghbalian did not respond to a request for comment to the listed email address, and doesn’t appear to have a verifiable online presence. Nor do any of the other authors who had initially submitted the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors added to the papers during the revision stage are affiliated with institutions in China. Nearly all of these authors’ names appear just once among all the retracted papers, whereas the authors who initially submitted the work published several papers each. None of the new corresponding authors have responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Retraction Watch has written about some of the journals that published papers from with the sham company affiliations. At least eight papers appear in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=%22journal+of+cleaner+production%22"><em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em></a>, which has previously been flagged for large numbers of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">self-citations</a>. At least nine of the papers appear in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/21/elsevier-retracting-26-papers-accepted-fake-reviews/#more-53130"><em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em></a>, which has come under scrutiny for publishing papers with fake peer reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from authorship concerns, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7E40F1302E65AB7667D0B6A2B57DBF#0">one PubPeer commenter mentioned</a> possibly manufactured citations. Many of the retracted papers cite Oveis Abedinia from the Zenith Sustainable Energy Institute in Iran. In an email to Retraction Watch, Abedinia asked us not to name him in this story and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have no connection to the authors or the journals involved, and I was not aware of these papers citing my work. I have never used or supported any citation-increasing services, and I strongly oppose any unethical citation practices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Update, May 15, 2025: The fourth paragraph of the story was updated with comment from an Elsevier spokesperson to clarify why authorship issues found during the review process affected published papers.</em></p>

<p>[Strasbourg, 14 May 2025] The &ldquo;<a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">How Equitable Is It?</a>&rdquo; tool, designed to assess the equity of scholarly communication models, has been officially launched today in its updated version following a comprehensive review of community feedback. Originally introduced as a beta version in September 2024 at the OASPA conference, this refined version of the tool incorporates significant improvements based on input from across the scholarly publishing ecosystem.</p>



<p>Developed by a <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/moving-away-from-apcs/">multi-stakeholder Working Group</a>, comprising <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/beyond-article-based-charges-working-group-established/">librarians, library consortia representatives, funders and publishers</a>, and convened by <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, the tool aims to provide a framework for evaluating scholarly communication models and arrangements on the axis of equity<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Key enhancements</strong></p>



<p>The revised tool offers enhanced guidance for users and clearer definitions of equity indicators, across the seven core assessment criteria:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to Read&nbsp;</li>



<li>Publishing immediate Open Access&nbsp;</li>



<li>Maximizing participation&nbsp;</li>



<li>Re-use rights&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pricing and fee transparency&nbsp;</li>



<li>Promoting and encouraging open research practices: data and code&nbsp;</li>



<li>Promoting and encouraging open research practices: preprints and open peer review</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Community-driven improvements</strong></p>



<p>From September 2024 through January 2025, the Working Group collected extensive feedback from stakeholders who tested the beta version. This collaborative approach ensured that the tool&rsquo;s updated version addresses practical challenges faced by institutions, library consortia, funders, and publishers in evaluating equity within scholarly communication models and arrangements.</p>



<p>The tool, which was inspired by the &ldquo;<a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/howopenisit/">How Open Is It?</a>&rdquo; framework, is targeted at institutions, library consortia, funders and publishers, i.e. the stakeholders either investing or receiving funds for publishing services. It offers users the opportunity to rate scholarly communication models and arrangements across seven criteria:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Kiley, Head of Strategy at cOAlition S and co-Chair of the Working Group, stated: <em>&ldquo;We are grateful to everyone who provided feedback during the testing period. Their insights have been instrumental in refining this tool to better serve stakeholders in making informed decisions when investing or receiving funds for publishing services while seeking equity&rdquo;.</em></p>



<p>Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development &amp; Sales at PLOS, added: <em>&ldquo;With this updated release, we&rsquo;re delivering on our promise to create a practical tool that reflects diverse stakeholder perspectives. The refinements made based on community feedback have strengthened the tool&rsquo;s ability to assess equity across different publishing models and arrangements.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p>Anna Vernon, Head of Research Licensing at Jisc, commented: <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been using the &ldquo;How Equitable Is It?&rdquo; tool to understand how agreements can broaden participation in scholarly publishing. The clearer framework of the updated version will further allow institutions to make more nuanced assessments of how their resources can best support equitable knowledge dissemination.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p><strong>How the tool works</strong></p>



<p>Based on the above-mentioned criteria, the &ldquo;<a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">How Equitable Is It?</a>&rdquo; tool prompts users to consider to what extent the model (and associated funding flow) they are assessing facilitates (or restricts) equitable participation in knowledge sharing. Users score each criterion on a scale from &ldquo;least equitable&rdquo; to &ldquo;most equitable,&rdquo; receiving an overall equity score upon completion, along with a summary of their responses.</p>



<p>Rather than prescribing outcomes, the tool empowers users to exercise their judgment in rating models against equitable criteria, with no pre-populated data shaping evaluations.</p>



<p>The &ldquo;How Equitable Is It?&rdquo; tool is available at <a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool</a>. A detailed description of the revised criteria and their definitions can be accessed at: <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HowEquitableIsIt_Framework_criteria_definitions.pdf">Framework_criteria_definitions.pdf</a></p>



<p><strong>Future development</strong></p>



<p>The Working Group remains committed to the ongoing development of the tool, with plans to gather implementation case studies and establish a community of practice around equity assessment in scholarly communication. Users of the tool are encouraged to share their experiences at info@coalition-s.org.&nbsp; The Group will review this feedback and publish annual updates as appropriate.</p>
