              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/handwriting-brain-connections-learning">Handwriting may boost brain connections more than typing does</a></h4>

              
                <p>Writing out the same word again and again in cursive may bring back bad memories for some, but handwriting can boost connectivity across brain regions, some of which are implicated in learning and memory, a new study shows.</p>



<p>When asked to handwrite words, college students showed increased connectivity across the brain, particularly in brain waves associated with memory formation, compared with when they typed those words instead, researchers report January 26 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. The finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting’s benefits and could give fodder to laws that implement handwriting curricula, such as the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently enacted California law requiring the teaching of cursive</a> in grades 1 through 6.</p>



<p>The new study shows that “there is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting as opposed to typing,” says Ramesh Balasubramaniam, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Merced who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Plenty of previous research has shown that handwriting improves <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-0663.82.1.159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spelling accuracy</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154193120905302218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory recall</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceptual understanding</a>. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives individuals more time to process the material and learn.</p>



<p>In the new study, psychologists Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel, both at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, recruited students from the university and stuck electrodes on their heads. The researchers asked the students to type out or handwrite in cursive with a digital pen a word that appeared on a computer screen. Sensors in a cap recorded electrical brain activity while participants carried out each task.</p>



<p>Then the scientists looked for coherence, which is when two brain areas are active with the same frequency of electrical waves at the same time. This parameter can reveal the strength of functional connectivity among different regions across the brain.</p>



<p>With handwriting, the researchers saw increased activity, specifically in low frequency bands called alpha and theta, not only in the expected motor areas due to the movement but also in others associated with learning. These low frequency bands have previously been shown to support memory processes. When the team compared the two tasks, they realized that handwriting — but not typing — increased the connectivity across parietal brain regions, which are involved in sensory and motor processing, and central ones, many of which are involved in memory. These findings suggest that there are distinct processes of brain activation happening while a person types or writes.</p>

<p>“Even when the movements are very similar, the activation seems much, much higher in handwriting,” Balasubramaniam says. “It shows that there&#8217;s more involvement of these brain regions when you’re handwriting, which might give you some specific advantages.”</p>



<p>The researchers posit that this boost of stimulation facilitates learning because these particular waves between these areas are implicated in <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30294-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory formation and encoding</a>.</p>



<p>Because the team did not test whether participants remembered the words, it’s not yet clear how exactly the increased activity impacts learning, says psychologist Kathleen Arnold of Radford University in Virginia. “[The study] warrants some follow up to see what exactly is causing those connectivity differences and whether or not they reflect learning outcomes.”</p>



<p>Balasubramaniam also notes that it’s possible the differences in brain activation are merely due to the unique movement required to type or write. “But that said, we&#8217;ve got to start somewhere, and these are the first results to actually show that these two things have different brain activation patterns.”</p>



<p>And although handwriting may help with learning processes, typing is often easier, faster and more practical. Students and teachers alike should therefore consider the task at hand to inform their decision to handwrite or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help retain information better while typing out an essay may be easier.</p>



<p>Despite the need for more studies to determine the optimal learning strategy, experts say that handwriting shouldn’t be left behind in the digital age. “[Schools] need to bring in more writing into curriculum design,” Balasubramaniam says.</p>



<p>Van der Meer agrees. “[Writing is] so good for [young] brains, so we shouldn&#8217;t use [this generation] as guinea pigs to see how their brains end up without any handwriting,” she says. “And it&#8217;s important for them to be able to at least write a grocery list or a love letter. I really think that that is important for us humans.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-ends-mission">NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter officially ends its mission on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>After nearly three years, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter, the first spacecraft to undertake a powered flight on another world, has ended its mission. Officials at the agency confirmed on January 25 that the history-making quad-copter has sustained damage to one of its rotor blades and is no longer capable of flying.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we knew this day was inevitable, it doesn&#8217;t make it any easier,&#8221; said Lori Glaze, NASA&#8217;s planetary science division director, during a news conference on the status of the quad-copter.</p>



<p>Many on the Ingenuity team are already thinking back fondly on the mission&#8217;s many accomplishments. &#8220;[For] a helicopter that&#8217;s overperformed the way that this has, I don&#8217;t think you can really mourn it and be sad,&#8221; says Håvard Fjær Grip, the  mission&#8217;s chief pilot and an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<p>Ingenuity — Ginny to its friends — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">hitched along with NASA’s car-sized rover Perseverance</a> as the rover landed on Mars in February 2021 (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). A few months later, the small helicopter spun its rotor blades, climbed into the thin Martian atmosphere, rose to a height of three meters, and took a picture of Perseverance during its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">first test flight</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>).</p>

<p>The aerial robot vastly outperformed its initial expectations, which was to fly a handful of times over 30 days. The idea was to demonstrate flight was possible on Mars, and then ground itself. Ingenuity instead undertook a total of 72 flights, traveling 14 times farther than planned and logging more than two hours of total flight time. During its travels, the helicopter did far more than fly<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">: It became part of the science mission</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>). Ingenuity made 3-D elevation maps of its surroundings, went places that Perseverance couldn’t get to, and scouted potential sites for the rover’s scientific observations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingenuity helped scientists discover that, unlike on Earth, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-two-sound-speeds-laser-helicopter">speed of sound in Mars’ atmosphere</a> depends on pitch, likely due to its carbon-dioxide rich nature (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>). It also demonstrated the ability to autonomously choose landing sites, clean itself after dust storms, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">snap tons of amazing photos of the Martian landscape</a>, often including its own shadow (<em>SN: 4/19/22</em>).</p>



<p>On January 19, NASA reported that <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1748883252604236281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ingenuity briefly lost communications</a> with the Perseverance rover as it was descending during its 72nd flight. While contact was soon restored, the small helicopter suffered damage from the fall that has permanently grounded it.</p>



<p>There was a moment of sadness when the team first received images that confirmed damage to the helicopter, said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity&#8217;s project manager. &#8220;But that was very quickly replaced with happiness and pride and a feeling of celebration for what we&#8217;ve pulled off.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-ant-lion-dinner-trees-ecosystem">How an invasive ant changed a lion’s dinner menu</a></h4>

              
                <p>How did the ant steal the lion’s dinner? This isn’t the beginning of one of Aesop’s Fables. It’s the finding of a new study showing how the disruption of one tiny mutual relationship on the African savanna has big impacts on the food web — all the way to the lion’s den.</p>



<p>When big-headed ants (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>) invade the savanna, they kill off native acacia ants (genus <em>Crematogaster</em>), robbing local whistling thorn trees of their valiant defenders against hungry elephants. Without ants to bite them, the elephants rip up the thorn trees, opening up the grassland, which makes it harder for lions to catch their preferred zebra meals. Lions end up hunting buffalo instead. The findings, published online January 25 in <em>Science</em>, show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg1464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invasive species’ effects can be very indirect</a> — and suggest that changes in different low-level mutualisms might also echo up food webs in other ecosystems.</p>



<p>Over the past 15 years or so, wildlife ecologist Jake Goheen and his colleagues at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya, have been studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants">how acacia ants protect whistling thorn trees</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/10</em>). When an elephant tries to eat the tree, “ants swarm up inside its nostrils and bite from the inside out,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>The scientists were also examining what the lions in the conservancy eat as part of a separate study. “One of the things that we found … was that lions are much more effective, they&#8217;re more successful with their hunts in areas where tree cover is high,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>But what happens when tree cover is suddenly low? To find out, Goheen and his colleagues collared six lionesses from the local prides to track their activity and kills. The team also set up experimental plots where big-headed ants had invaded, and where the native ants still held sway.</p>



<p>The big-headed ant arrived in the conservancy between 2002 and 2005, Goheen says. “We think it probably was imported on produce,” brought into the houses or tourist camps in the area. The invading insects kill local acacia ants wherever they find them. And other studies have shown that without defending ants, pachyderms tore down the thorn trees five to seven times more often.</p>

<p>In the new study, the scientists could have used drones or satellite images to study tree cover, but “we don’t have that kind of money,” Goheen says. Instead, the researchers tracked their collared lions, and then got down on hands and knees near the lions’ recent kills, using a range finder to measure the openness of the area. Areas with big-headed ants, the team showed, had 2.67 times higher visibility than areas without — meaning that lions could see farther, but so could their prey.</p>



<p>Lions relied on the cover of trees to pounce on hapless zebras nearby: Where visibility was low, the probability of a zebra kill was 62 percent. But when visibility was high, the lion’s chance of taking down a zebra dropped to only 22 percent.</p>



<p>Over the three years of the study, zebra dinners decreased from 67 percent to 42 percent of lion kills. But the lions didn’t go hungry. Instead, they went for beef. Buffalo kills increased from zero to 42 percent of kills over the study period. It’s a risky diet, Goheen says. Buffalo “are big and feisty,” and lions hunting buffalo are more likely to be injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study shows that “the disruption of a mutualism can have cascading effects on other species in the community,” says Emilio Bruna, a plant ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “Those effects can be unexpected and indirect.”</p>



<p>It’s a clue, Bruna says, that ecologists should be looking out for other pairs like the acacia ant and the thorn tree, where a single special relationship is a foundation for an ecosystem and a single anthill could cause a savanna-wide shift in who is eating who.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/organisation-in-your-phd">Organisation in Your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Rachel McKeown shares her learned experience of the importance of organisation and timekeeping, whilst completing a PhD, and how to ensure you maintain a good work/life balance.</strong></p>
<blockquote>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same...</blockquote>
<p>When thinking about the skills required to take on a PhD, there are a lot of buzzwords that crop up over and over. Determination, teamwork and critical thinking are common themes you’ll encounter in any major project. </p>

<p>One of the most valuable assets for any PhD candidate, that might not come to mind so quickly, is the ability to organise. This doesn’t just refer to the planning of your project, but also planning how to ensure that you remain in the best frame of mind throughout. When I was an undergraduate student, I had a strong grasp on the former, but a much more tenuous sense of the latter. I had a handle on how to keep track of multiple overlapping deadlines, churning out essays never a day late, but the toll the course took on me was far greater. I couldn’t engage my mental ‘brake’. On starting my postgraduate studies, I was resolute that I would extend my organisational capacity, finding ways to build my own defences as I set out to face my greatest academic battle thus far. Here are a few lessons I have picked up along the way related to organising my work, and my life around it.</p>

<p><strong><u>Control your calendar</u></strong></p>

<p>The day-to-day life of a PhD student often differs significantly to the undergraduate lifestyle, with the independence and freedom allowing you to break free of the rigidity of a structured course. There are a few fixtures that can’t be shuffled, such as weekly lab group meetings but, by and large, your time is yours to arrange. This can be a little overwhelming to anyone who is used to living life according to a timetable. However, flexibility is your friend, if you’re willing to embrace it. </p>

<p>Without a one-size-fits-all workday, find a schedule that best matches your rhythm. Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night? Personally, I’m the type who likes to get the hands-on lab tasks out of the way first, pushing admin and desk tasks to later in the afternoon to give me time to reflect with a freshly brewed mug of tea. Some of my lab mates prefer to meander into work a little later in the day and let the coffee machine work its magic, before slowly ramping up their productivity throughout the day. We all get our work done in the way that suits us.</p>
<blockquote>Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night?</blockquote>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shift your general patterns around either. I’m certainly guilty of trying to turn a blind eye to the impact of the changing seasons. In the summer I can rise well before 7AM, head out for a run and still make it to the lab before 9AM. Writing this piece in January, I already dread the call of tomorrow’s pre-dawn alarm, knowing the energetic barrier I will face to leave my duvet and brace for the predicted sub-zero journey to work. When the sun rises after I do, the weariness permeates throughout the day. Interestingly, one day this week, an alarm-setting mishap turned out to be a blessing in disguise as, waking up naturally an hour later to sunlight trickling through my curtains, I went about my day with a little extra spring in my step. I was more alert, more focused and far more productive. I’ll be making a note of this to battle the winter blues. </p>

<p><strong><u>Keep on track</u></strong></p>

<p>I may be doing a PhD in neuroscience, but sadly I am far from unlocking any memory-related superpowers. With a relentless barrage of tasks, from setting up an experiment, preparing for a meeting or replying to an all-important email, it is all too easy for a few to slip by uncompleted. This isn’t so bad when the job is trivial, but a crucial deadline sneaking up on you is much more unpleasant and is best avoided. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_0a6c1796f9d84d208e6fe162a9649b4e~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_262,h_405,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>The way I try to get around this is based on an old adage my mum used to say – if you need to remember something, write it down. The written word is far less fickle than my memory. In today’s technocentric society, there are many digital tools out there that will get the job done, but as an Apple convert, the in-built Reminders app is my daily lifesaver. I use it to log anything and everything that I need to get done, neatly partitioned into sections for PhD work, general life and University societies I’m involved with, in particular the running of Bluesci, the University of Cambridge science communications platform. The seamless synchronisation between my laptop, phone and watch means I’m never far away from checking my uncompleted tasks. I’m trying to get into the habit of inputting tasks as soon as they pop into my mind – as soon as I accepted writing this piece, it went straight into 				      <em>Reminders.</em></p>
<p>Reminders, along with a handy alert for a week’s time to make sure I had a first draft in place. Though, tying my work responsibilities to my everyday tech does run the risk of struggling to disengage and fully relax, which I’ll come to shortly.</p>
<blockquote>The written word is far less fickle than my memory.</blockquote>
<p>For setting daily goals, I take a more traditional approach and instead rely on my trusty notebook. At the start of each day, I take a few moments to write a list of everything that I want to accomplish by the time I come to winding down. Let me tell you, the satisfaction that comes from seeing a full set of ticks at the end of the day is a real motivational boost, like receiving a shiny gold star from a teacher when you were little. Rather than pushing myself to complete a task, I feel the pull of this self-imposed incentive. This has worked wonders for my short-term productivity as I give myself a real-time pat on the back.</p>

<p><strong><u>Balancing act</u></strong></p>

<p>PhDs are notorious for consuming your time in ways you don’t initially expect. This is sometimes part of the package you sign up for, and the sense of reward from looking at the horde of precious data you’ve just acquired more than makes up for it. However, I’ve found more insidious ways that work has tried to extend into other aspects of my life. In the early days, I found myself trawling through (likely unimportant) papers late into the night, just for the sake of feeling productive, when I should have been resting. Sapping my energy like this wasn’t sensible as I pushed myself too hard without need, bringing myself dangerously close to the burnout I so wanted to leave behind. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_e05111d76f4e4d4fa64396950c6c81f6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_393,h_723,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>I have developed a curated calendar system, again using Apple Calendar as a personal choice, where I enter all of my work commitments colour-coded in red. These could be practical lab experiments, or desk-based work, such as writing up experimental notes, preparing a presentation and analysing data. This lets me plan a few days into the future, or sometimes even weeks, so that my project keeps its momentum. If something takes more time than I initially budgeted for, then I update the calendar retrospectively for the increased working hours and may use this to set aside a little extra time for myself on other, less demanding days. For example, on days I prepare hydrogel substrates for neuron culture, I’m typically working constantly in the lab for an extra two to three hours, so ending my work day an hour earlier later in the week, to catch the last of the winter daylight, doesn’t incur quite so much guilt as it used to in my undergraduate days. </p>
<p>								                   <em>Midweek calendar – work by day and relax by  </em>The red blocks need a healthy counterweight in 			          <em>evening.</em></p>
<p>the form of green blocks, representing my social and recreational activities. Recurring ones include gym sessions, quiz nights with my friends or simply taking a walk along the river to the tune of my latest favourite podcast - sometimes to expand my scientific scope (e.g. <em>New Scientist Weekly)</em>, or sometimes to completely depart from it to broaden my interests (I’m currently flitting through the centuries by listening to <em>The Rest is History</em>). When the red and the green are in harmony, my routine is much more sustainable and burnout is kept at bay. Seeing my week ahead in full colour-coded glory has both aesthetic appeal and practical benefit.</p>

<p>There also must be time set aside for a complete detox. When the holiday season hits, rest and recuperation become the priority. In a mastery of self-kindness, give yourself the gift of completely tuning your mind out of experimental mode – those projects will still be waiting upon your return, and you’ll be more refreshed to take them on. You might even be able to see a problem in a new light or pick up on a small, but crucial, detail that previously remained under the radar. I’m writing this having just returned from Christmas break, where I fully immersed myself in quality family time and tackling the seemingly never-ending stack of unread novels I’ve been meaning to get to. Any emails that cropped up during this time were syphoned off into the Reminders app for the first day back. </p>

<p><strong><u>Master your toolset</u></strong></p>

<p>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same, so what works for one person may not work for another. This is why it’s important to take the time to play around with organisational approaches and find a system that’s fine-tuned to the way you work. It takes a little effort and a little self-experimentation, but harnessing this skill in your PhD toolkit is one you will be grateful for further down the line. As the thesis write-up dawns upon me, it’s time to engage my own organisational toolset to face it. But first, it’s time to put a big red tick next to ‘Complete first draft of blog’…</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasicrystal-einstein-tile-hat-shape">A predicted quasicrystal is based on the ‘einstein’ tile known as the hat</a></h4>

              
                <p>The “hat” wowed mathematicians. Now the shape is shaking up physics.</p>



<p>In 2023, mathematicians reported that the 13-sided tile was the first known “einstein.” That’s a shape that can perfectly cover an infinite plane — no gaps or overlaps — but can do so only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">without a repeating pattern</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>Now, scientists have predicted the properties for a two-dimensional material based on the hat. It’s a quasicrystal, a material that is orderly like a crystal, but in which the arrangements of atoms don’t repeat. Intriguingly, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/33074Yb3Ufa1478fd33b049723e53c7a8d73f77b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hat-based material shares properties with graphene</a>, a crystalline material, the researchers report in a paper to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s got lots of properties that we associate with quasicrystals, but then it acts strangely like crystals,” says physicist Sinéad Griffin of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the research. “It’s a really fun study.”</p>



<p>Previously, mathematicians needed more than one shape to cover an infinite plane in this nonrepeating way, known as an aperiodic tiling. Some earlier aperiodic tilings have connections to real-world materials. Penrose tilings, based on sets of two tiles discovered in the 1970s by mathematician Roger Penrose, look like a 2-D slice through a quasicrystal. Such quasicrystals have been found in meteorites and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">atomic bomb test debris</a>, in addition to being made in the lab (<em>SN: 5/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>So scientists wanted to know what a material based on the hat tiling might be like. Physicist Adolfo Grushin and colleagues calculated the properties of electrons in a 2-D material in which atoms sit at the hats’ vertices.</p>



<p>To characterize a material, scientists can look at the relationship between the energies of its electrons and their wavelengths. (According to quantum physics, electrons travel through materials as waves; the wavelength denotes the size of those waves.) In this energy–wavelength relationship, the researchers found striking similarities between the hat quasicrystal and graphene, a 2-D crystal of carbon.</p>



<p>That’s because many of the vertices of the hat tiling fall along a hexagonal grid like that of graphene, says Grushin, of Institut Néel of CNRS in Grenoble, France.</p>



<p>The fact that the hat tiling is made up of a single tile shape, rather than multiple shapes, also helps explain how it straddles the worlds of crystals and quasicrystals. The use of a single tile means it’s closer to being periodic than other aperiodic tilings, without actually repeating.</p>



<p>Unlike graphene, however, the hat material is chiral, which means that the electrons would behave differently if you were to flip the material as if reflected in a mirror. In a real material, that chiral property might affect how light interacts with the substance, for example, by rotating the light’s polarization, the orientation of its electromagnetic waves.</p>



<p>More interesting features popped up when the researchers investigated what would happen if the material were placed in a magnetic field. In the hat tiling, a fraction of the hat tiles are mirror images of the others. Electrons, specifically those with zero energy, became trapped around the flipped hats at certain values of magnetic field. “We found it quite beautiful that this happens,” Grushin says.</p>



<p>Although the material is entirely theoretical for now, the researchers proposed some ways that the material could be brought to reality. For example, scientists could manually place molecules on a surface in a pattern matching the hat tiling. That would be the ultimate hat trick.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-outbreak-influenza-panzootic-galapagos">A bird flu outbreak is sweeping the globe. Its long-term effects are unclear</a></h4>

              
                <p>As I step among poop-covered rocks toward the plateau of a small island in the Galápagos, a part of me rejoices. Not only am I about to see the archipelago’s famed blue-footed boobies for the first time, but the sight of guano everywhere, and birds to make fresh batches, serves as a reminder: The ongoing avian influenza outbreak has not yet ravaged this picturesque place.</p>



<p>Ghostly, leafless Palo Santo trees and saltbushes sprinkle the island, surrounded by boulders in varying shades of red-tinged black and brown. White splotches of guano splattered on rocks are hard to miss against this arid landscape on North Seymour Island in November, the tail end of the dry season. The poop’s sources are similarly difficult to overlook.</p>



<p>The island is known for hosting a large colony of magnificent frigatebirds (<em>Fregata magnificens</em>), some of which hang suspended in the air above tourists’ heads as we disembark from a dinghy and scramble up the rocky path. As I admire the birds’ fabulous red throat sacs — which males inflate like balloons to attract females — I hope that none deposit excrement on my head.</p>

Juveniles have white heads.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135310">Erin Garcia de Jesús</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A short walk along a dusty trail brings us to, in my opinion, the stars of the show, blue-footed boobies (<em>Sula nebouxii)</em>. The dopey looking birds show no sign of fear even as we cluster around their nests eagerly snapping photos.</p>



<p>That I had the chance to visit these birds on North Seymour at all — amid all their poop — was a relief after traveling more than 5,000 kilometers for a vacation in Galápagos National Park. Just two months before, at the end of September, news broke that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/deadly-avian-flu-reaches-galapagos-islands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadly avian influenza had reached the archipelago</a>.</p>



<p>The virus’ presence posed a grave threat. The islands are home to birds like the Galápagos penguin that are found nowhere else in the world. National park and government officials closed some islands to tourists to protect endemic seabirds — an understandable tactic that left me selfishly thinking about the possibility of not getting to see iconic birds up close. To track the virus, “we have eyes watching the whole archipelago,” wildlife veterinarian Gustavo Jiménez-Uzcátegui of the Charles Darwin Foundation told <em>Science </em>in September.</p>



<p>The concern is warranted. Outside the Galápagos, the global bird flu panzootic has been destructive. (Panzootics are the animal equivalent of human pandemics.) It’s unclear why the archipelago has so far escaped the worst of avian influenza, Jiménez-Uzcátegui told me when we met in the island town of Puerto Ayora. Also unknown are the effects the outbreak could permanently imprint on bird populations and the ecosystems that they’re a part of around the globe.</p>



<p>“Most people have no idea that we are in the middle of a wildlife emergency, an animal pandemic, and that this may be the nail in the coffin for some species,” says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, who studies avian influenza. “It’s very concerning.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bird flu has killed millions of animals</h4>



<p>While the viral variant behind the outbreak <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06631-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged in Europe in 2020</a>, the outbreak itself didn’t take off until late 2021. Since then, avian flu has likely killed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">millions of wild birds</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). In Peru, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723003737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of wild birds</a> have died. Places like <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/12/23-0330_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.05.574233v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> have documented tens of thousands of deaths. In the United States, roughly 9,000 wild birds have <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive for avian flu</a>, some of which were reported after being killed by hunters.</p>



<p>In October, bird flu <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/first-confirmed-cases-of-avian-influenza-in-the-antarctic-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Antarctic region for the first time</a> when unexplained mortality of brown skuas on Bird Island was pinned on the virus.</p>



<p>But birds aren’t the only animals in the flu’s crosshairs. “If you can imagine thousands of dead birds, you can imagine how this is an ‘all day buffet’ for scavengers,” Wille says. Avian predators all over the world, including bears and foxes, have tested positive. Marine mammals such as seals and sea lions that swim with or eat infected birds have experienced mass die-offs. In the Arctic, a polar bear died in October after contracting the virus. And on January 11, researchers confirmed that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/bird-flu-found-mammals-near-antarctica-first-time-scientists-say-2024-01-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elephant and fur seals in South Georgia</a>, a sub-Antarctic island, had been infected.</p>



<p>By the time of my trip in mid-November, fears of birds dying en masse in the Galápagos hadn’t yet come to fruition. To date, there have been just 34 confirmed flu infections in red- and blue-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, frigatebirds and tropicbirds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="331" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline2.jpg?resize=680%2C331&#038;ssl=1" alt="Researchers dressed in full-body biohazard suits swab the anus of a black bird.

Thirty-four birds have tested positive since the virus was first detected in September.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135311">Galápagos National Park Directorate</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That the global outbreak is happening at all is a chapter in a predictable story, says Nichola Hill, a disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. And the virus’s incursion into some mammals is “absolutely on track with being the worst-case scenario you could have imagined for this.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The flu’s long-term effects remain unclear</h4>



<p>Researchers have long understood that avian influenza viruses — which normally cause mild disease in waterfowl like ducks — can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flu-flies-coop">turn deadly after spreading and evolving</a> on poultry farms (<em>SN: 9/2/05</em>). Close relatives of the virus responsible for the ongoing panzootic have been “simmering away” in Eurasia for more than a decade, Hill says. “And now in the last three years, it’s had major consequences for wildlife.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, researchers are focused on documenting the sheer scale of avian and mammalian deaths. “We will probably not know the true extent of this for years to come,” Wille says. The ripple effects on ecosystems will likewise take years to unravel.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Death rates vary among bird species. Waterfowl such as ducks are key spreaders of bird flu and have at least some built-in protection from the virus. Because their immune systems have coevolved with influenza viruses, the animals have a “head-start on immunity” compared to other animals, Hill says. Meanwhile, birds like bald eagles and red-tailed hawks that don’t have such a long history with influenza are “just getting hit really hard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That disparity has Hill wondering how long it might take for infections to become less deadly, as wild birds develop immunity against the virus. Her lab aims to explore how birds’ immune systems have coevolved with avian flu, including which parts of the immune response are crucial for preventing the virus from running rampant and causing death in some species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of now, Wille says, there are no signs that the panzootic is slowing down. But there are glimmers of hope.</p>



<p>In October, researchers announced <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-condors-vaccine-avian-influenza-65e27a0751666eee0e3ab3b82ae18251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some early results from a bird flu vaccine trial</a> in California condors. After 10 birds had received two doses of the vaccine, six of them had antibody levels high enough to provide at least partial protection against death. “If it works, it demonstrates that we may be able to limit the impact on highly endangered species,” Wille says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Climate may be protecting the Galápagos</h4>



<p>Why avian flu has been less “aggressive” in the Galápagos compared with most everywhere else — and whether it will stay that way — remains a big question, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says. But he has one intriguing hypothesis.</p>



<p>“The unique difference from the other parts [of South America], like Peru, Ecuador,” he says, “is the habitat.”</p>

<p>Flu in both people and birds <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">tends to largely be a cold-season disease</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>). Last year, El Niño <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/230706-ElNino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Galápagos</a>, bringing warmer than average waters to the islands’ part of the Pacific Ocean. Normally, the climate pattern reduces the marine food supply, affecting many of the animals that swim in the waters around the islands. The more moderate temperatures may have also made it harder for avian flu to spread, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says.</p>



<p>Piecing together the relationship between the local climate and influenza infections could help determine if Jiménez-Uzcátegui’s hunch is correct. He and his team also hope to examine the immune systems and genetics of birds that call the archipelago home. For now, though, researchers and officials continue to keep an eye out for influenza on the islands.</p>



<p>On the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s easy to center humans in worries about infectious diseases, especially because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic">influenza outbreaks can be devastating</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). But my visit to Galápagos National Park — a truly special place for nature lovers — underscored that wild birds around the globe are enduring the worst flu outbreak yet. And despite small signs of hope in these iconic islands, the virus’s impacts could reverberate for years to come.</p>

<p>A journal quietly retracted two papers after a six-month Retraction Watch investigation linked them, and two of the journal’s editors, to the Indian paper mill iTrilon.</p>



<p>Based in Chennai, iTrilon hawks authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals.” The company, whose website disappeared following <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">our exposé</a> in <em>Science</em>, claims to have connections at journals that allow it to guarantee acceptance of many of its papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two retracted papers – “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beniwal-et-al.-2023.pdf">Evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of citral nanoemulsion on Alzheimer’s disease-type dementia in a preclinical model: The assessment of cognitive and neurobiochemical responses</a>” and “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lorenzo-et-al-2023-quercetin.pdf">Therapeutic effects of quercetin-loaded phytosome nanoparticles in a preclinical model of Parkinson&#8217;s disease: The modulation by antioxidant pathways and BDNF expression</a>” – had both been put up for sale by iTrilon before they appeared last year in the non-indexed journal <a href="https://lifeneuro.de/"><em>Life Neuroscience</em></a>. </p>



<p>We published the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">matching</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Quercetin-Neuro-Life.jpg">ads</a> last week in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">a companion piece</a> to the <em>Science</em> article that linked a professor and dean at a university in Spain to several iTrilon papers. The dean, <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a> of Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, acknowledged paying the paper mill, but said he thought the money was meant to cover article-processing charges. He has since taken down <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/dionisio-lorenzo-lorenzo-villegas-9562463a">his LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>



<span id="more-128640"></span>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, Nasrollah Moradikor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016053222/https:/georgianeuroscience.com/nasrollah-moradikor/">International Center for Neuroscience Research</a>, in Tbilisi, Georgia, confirmed the journal had pulled Lorenzo’s two papers, although it has not issued retraction notices.</p>



<p>“Today, I asked our managing editor and told them about Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, his article retracted from our journal website [sic],” Moradikor wrote in a January 22 email to Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>But as we reported in <em>Science</em>, Moradikor was the corresponding author of the paper about Alzheimer’s disease, which was touted by iTrilon after being accepted by the journal and just two weeks before publication. As such, he should have known about author additions.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-2.jpg">a WhatsApp exchange</a> about the paper, iTrilon’s scientific director,<a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww"> Sarath Ranganathan</a>, described it as “a collaborative research carried out at Georgia [sic]. Authors from any country are allowed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moradikor, who stopped answering emails in October after we told him we were interested in discussing “your work as an editor and your connection with iTrilon,” now denies any links with the paper mill.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m shocked, that you mentioned me and Dr. Indranath Chatterjee [a coauthor on the Alzheimer’s paper] on this News,” he wrote in his email. “We don&#8217;t have any relation with Itrilon and Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas in Spain.”</p>



<p>But last autumn, Chatterjee gave<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seminar-chatterjee-moradikor-itrilon.jpg"> a talk</a> on scientific publishing organized by iTrilon and the International Center for Neuroscience Research, as we reported in <em>Science</em>. And in an October interview, Chatterjee, who is also an editor at <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, said Lorenzo had been involved in the work for the Alzheimer’s paper “mostly like for the supervising and also kind of reviewing and like checking the paper and the manuscript are properly written or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked how he had met Lorenzo, Chatterjee said, “Actually, like, you know, it was in connection with the International Center for Neuroscience, not with me.”</p>

Could cats be the solution? At the same time, many humane societies have more cats to rehome than they can manage. Could lonely older adults be the solution?</p><p>Researchers at the University of Georgia and Brenau University developed a novel program where older adults were paired with a foster cat coming from a local humane society, with the opportunity to adopt. A Human-Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI)-funded feasibility study explored the impact of this program on the older adult participants and the cats. Researchers explored how fostering a shelter cat could impact loneliness and well-being in older adults living alone. They also wanted to learn if these older adults would be more likely to adopt their foster cat after common barriers, such as pet deposit fees, were paid by the study. Could it really be a win-win situation?</p><p>The study enrolled adults aged 60 and older living alone and without any pets. Participants completed health surveys before placement with cats and completed follow-up surveys at 1-month and 4-months post-placement. Participants could choose to adopt their foster cat any time between 1- and 4-months post-placement. If participants chose to adopt their foster cat, the study paid the adoption fee, and a 12-month post-placement survey was completed.</p><p>Findings from the study revealed that loneliness scores significantly decreased at the 4-month mark after the cat fostering began. A similar 4-month improvement that approached statistical significance was observed for mental health. However, at the 12-month follow-up, loneliness scores were no longer statistically significant. The researchers suggest that these one-year reports were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a substantial proportion of older adults experiencing elevated levels of loneliness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alexis Winger and Ambi</h2><p>Alexis states that before she got Ambi, “<em>I lived alone, and the loneliness was becoming oppressive. Ambi has brought an end to oppressive loneliness. There are still times when I am away from people too long, when I have no one to talk to and lonelines settles in, but then Ambi settles into my lap or just runs through the room, and I am not alone. Ambi has brought me smiles, laughter, responsibility and love</em>.”</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="476" height="638" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Picture1-3.jpg" /></figure><div><blockquote><p>The day that Alexis picked out Ambi at the Athens Area Humane Society to foster.

Almost all (95.7%) of study participants decided to adopt their foster cat at the completion of the study. Dr. Sherry Sanderson, the team lead and Associate Professor at the University of Georgia’s College of Veterinary Medicine, noted: “Our results show that by removing some perceived barriers to pet ownership, including pet deposit fees, pet adoption fees, pet care supplies and veterinary support, we can not only help older adults live healthier, happier lives but we can also encourage the fostering and adoption of shelter cats into loving homes”.</p><p>Dr. Kerstin Emerson, a Gerontologist in the College of Public Health’s Institute of Gerontology, Health Policy &amp; Management at the University of Georgia, and an investigator from the study states, “In May of 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General stated that loneliness and isolation is an epidemic in this country, and their report placed an emphasis on the urgent need for a cure.” Dr. Don Scott, a Geriatrician and Campus Director of Geriatrics and Palliative Care from the Augusta University-University of Georgia Medical Partnership and also a researcher from the study, added, “The ill effects of loneliness and social isolation, particularly for older adults, are well-documented, and more strategies are needed to improve health outcomes for this population.” The investigators from this study plan to do a larger scale study. The hope is when an older adult seeks to prevent or ward off loneliness and isolation, they will collaborate with a support team prepared to explore feline companionship as part of an individualized holistic approach to care, and there will be programs in place and funding available to support this new approach to treating loneliness in older adults.</p><h2>Judith Atkins and Bashi</h2><p>Judith is semi-retired from nursing, but she still provides nursing care to some of the residents in the Senior Living Residence that she lives in. When recently asked what Bashi means to her, Judith sent back the following reply:</p><p>“He (Bashi) has been a comfort to two of my neighbors. While providing nursing care to a resident who was in hospice care, Bashi stayed with her until she died. I also took him to visit a resident with cancer and breathing problems when I went to visit. I also took Bashi to the nursing home to visit two people I took care of there.”</p><p>Judith went on to say, “He still enjoys catching balls and batting them into the hall closet, continues to steal straws from my drinks and claims all boxes. Best of all, he still likes my left shoulder to put his head on to make sure his world is okay. At night at times, I find him asleep on a pillow by my head. His love of people is unlimited, and he will try and go in any apartment with the door open to be loved on by strangers. He escapes into the hall to force me to exercise chasing him, and needless to say he is always the winner.”</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-5.jpg" /></figure></div><blockquote><div><p>Judith was ready to enroll in the study just days before the Pandemic occurred, and the Foster Cat Study was shut down for six months.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aquifers-losing-water-climate-change-overuse">Many but not all of the world’s aquifers are losing water</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s precious stash of subterranean freshwater is shrinking — and in nearly a third of aquifers, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06879-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that loss has been speeding up in the last couple of decades</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 25 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>A one-two punch of unsustainable groundwater withdrawals and changing climate has been causing global water levels to fall on average, leading to water shortages, slumping land surfaces and seawater intrusion into aquifers. The new study suggests that groundwater decline has accelerated in many places since 2000, but also suggests that these losses can be reversible with better water management.</p>



<p>It’s the first effort to synthesize global-scale groundwater data collected on site, rather than assessed by satellite. Previous studies have quantified the scope of global groundwater loss by analyzing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-earths-groundwater-basins-run-deficits">data collected by a pair of NASA satellites known as GRACE</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/15</em>). But while satellites can scan the entire globe, some of the nuance of water loss — and recovery — in regional aquifers can be hard to detect from space, the researchers say.</p>



<p>To assess how groundwater is changing in aquifers, hydrologist Scott Jasechko of the University of California, Santa Barbara and colleagues analyzed water level data collected since 1980 in about 170,000 monitoring wells around the globe. Those wells offer glimpses into the state of almost 1,700 of the world’s largest aquifer systems.</p>



<p>Using the well data, the team identified where groundwater loss was most quickly accelerating. In 12 percent of the aquifers the team studied, water levels are now dropping by more than half a meter per year. And in 36 percent of the aquifer systems, the water level is dropping by a tenth of a meter per year. The fastest declines were detected in some of the world’s most arid regions, including central Chile, Iran and the western United States.</p>

<p>But there are signs of hope, the researchers say. In some areas, groundwater levels have begun to climb in the last two decades, even after shrinking at the end of the 20th century. Those recoveries are probably due to changes in regional water management. Groundwater losses from an aquifer in Thailand’s Bangkok basin, for example, reversed this century thanks to regulatory measures that include charging fees on groundwater pumping and licensing wells. The Abbas-e Sharghi basin of Iran, meanwhile, is now recovering after water was diverted to the basin from a large dam in the west of the country.</p>



<p>These reversals suggest that “long-term groundwater losses are neither universal nor inevitable,” the team says.</p>



<p>The results are also important for understanding discrepancies between GRACE data and local observations of groundwater levels, which have long been a thorn in the side of water management, says environmental scientist Li Xu, who was not involved in the study. Studies like this can be a big help in identifying where and why those discrepancies occur, he says, and “will definitely contribute to creating a global baseline for sustainable groundwater management.”</p>



<p>By identifying hot spots that need the most urgent attention, this work also helps highlight which parts of the world are most at risk of involuntary human migration due to water shortages, says Xu, of the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Institute for Water Security in Saskatoon, Canada. “Water is the key trigger for human migration or displacement worldwide, and those populations in low- and middle-income countries and in dry regions are most vulnerable.” Identifying those regions most at risk could lead to timely policy interventions, he says, “especially cross-border [aquifers] that could further increase the risk of armed conflicts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lawn-sprinklers-suck-water-physics">What happens when lawn sprinklers suck in water? Physicists answer that quirky question</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicists are fascinated with heady puzzles, from the nature of space and time to how the universe came to be. But spinning lawn sprinklers? Yes, that too.</p>



<p>A new experiment provides an answer to a quirky physics quandary popularized by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1980s. The puzzle centers on a style of sprinkler that works by squirting water out the ends of an S-shaped tube. The sprinkler spins away from the escaping water due to conservation of angular momentum. That much is straightforward.</p>



<p>But what happens if you stick the sprinkler in a tank of water and have it suck the water in? The question seems simple. But complex fluid flows and subtleties of momentum conservation have led different physicists to argue that it should either spin in the opposite direction as it does when operated normally, or not move at all. Different experiments likewise clashed.</p>



<p>So applied mathematician Leif Ristroph and colleagues gave it a whirl. “It ended up being one of the hardest problems our lab has ever worked on,” says Ristroph, of New York University. The team performed experiments with a painstakingly crafted transparent sprinkler, alongside mathematical calculations that backed up their measurements. The device floats in a tank of water to reduce friction, an effect that confounded earlier experiments. When run in reverse, the sprinkler <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/bd07eYb2Ma914376272d01f749b26c02e305d7e13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed spins the opposite </a>way, the researchers report in a paper accepted to <em>Physical Review Letters.</em> Further experimentation revealed why.</p>



<p>Whereas the normal sprinkler spews jets of water outward, in the reverse operation, jets form within the sprinkler itself. These jets stir up vortices, observed using lasers to illuminate microparticles added to the water. Importantly, the jets and their vortices aren’t symmetrical. When the jets collide in the sprinkler’s middle, they continue at an angle, suggesting they made a glancing collision, rather than hitting head-on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This high-speed video shows fluid moving inside a sprinkler as it sucks in water (made visible by laser-illuminated microparticles). As the water enters the sprinkler, two jets form and collide at glancing angles, forming four asymmetric vortices. In this part of the study, the sprinkler was fixed in place, rather than being allowed to rotate. But when released, the jets’ momentum sends the sprinkler spinning in the opposite direction of a normal sprinkler that spews water out, solving a longstanding physics puzzle.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s because, even though the arms of the sprinkler are perfectly aligned, the internal jets aren’t. The trip through the curved arms displaces the flow of water in each jet. That asymmetry sets the sprinkler rotating backward to conserve angular momentum.</p>



<p>The sprinkler puzzle’s solution just demanded a spritz of insight.</p>

<p>The journal a publication ethics watchdog threatened with sanctions for taking years to retract articles will pull four more related papers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last July, the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE) sent a warning letter to Elsevier regarding 10 papers by Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, who hold positions four and six on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> of retractions, that the publisher had said it would retract three and a half years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/10/exclusive-cope-threatens-elsevier-journal-with-sanctions-for-clear-breakdown-before-seven-retractions/">reported previously</a>, seven of the papers were retracted from <em>Journal of the Neurological Sciences</em> in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting on COPE’s letter to Elsevier, the publisher has decided to retract the remaining three articles, plus a letter regarding one of the retracted papers, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. </p>



<span id="more-128635"></span>



<p>Andrew Grey, a professor at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who first contacted the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em> about concerns with Sato’s papers in 2017, told us the move is “a good outcome for publication integrity, albeit long overdue. I am sure we will never know what happened to cause the absurd delay.”</p>



<p>Elsevier has not responded to repeated requests since January 12 for comment about these four upcoming retractions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">work of Grey and colleagues</a> Alison Avenell and Mark Bolland to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/09/analysis-casts-doubt-on-bone-researchers-body-of-work/">expose problems</a> in Sato’s research has led to more than 120 retractions, but in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2023.2295996">recent analysis</a> they found publishers have yet to assess nearly a third of the papers about which they have raised concerns. Yesterday, Science published a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/whistleblowers-flagged-300-scientific-papers-for-retraction-many-journals-ghosted-them">detailed report</a> on the saga to date. “Retractions come slowly—often years after complaints arise, if at all—in part because journals may defer to institutional investigations, which can be slow, unreliable, or absent,” Science noted. “Journals’ decisions also lack transparency.”</p>



<p>In June 2020, after Elsevier hadn’t acted on his concerns and Grey sought help from COPE, the publisher said it would retract the 10 papers he had flagged. When it still <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/23/an-elsevier-journal-said-it-would-retract-10-papers-two-years-ago-it-still-hasnt/">hadn’t years later</a>, and had apparently stopped responding to COPE’s inquiries, the organization sent Elsevier a warning letter stating that the journal’s behavior was “inconsistent with the standards that we expect from COPE members.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher subsequently retracted seven of the articles, but in a January 12, 2024 email seen by Retraction Watch, Mihail Grecea, a senior expert in publishing ethics at Elsevier, wrote that COPE’s letter hadn’t included “a detailed enough ‘Summary of concern’ which would grant for retraction” of three of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey informed Grecea that Kurume University had recommended retracting one of them for authorship misconduct, and the other two articles shared coauthors with that paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“More broadly, 119 of Dr Sato’s publications have now been retracted,” Grey wrote. “Why should readers have any confidence that any of his remaining publications are reliable? In the absence of robust evidence of reliability, they should all be retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He requested Elsevier also retract a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022510X98003116">letter</a>, “Reply to Davie and Sharp: different mechanisms of bone metabolism between patients with stroke and with spinal cord injury,” that Sato and his coauthors had written in 1999. Grey wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It refers to the now-retracted paper J Neurol Sci 1998;156:205–10, and cites 7 other retracted papers (refs 5-11) by the Sato research group.</p>



<p>It is rather clearly not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grecea responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given the rather scarce evidence regarding the three papers in the document provided by COPE, I tried to contact myself the Kurume University and the Futase Social Insurance Hospital (both listed by the three papers as the affiliations of the authors of the three papers).</p>



<p>Kurume University has responded at the end of December and I am currently working on the three retractions. I would estimate the 3+1 retractions to appear online around the end of this month.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybees-italy-steal-pollen-bumblebees">Some honeybees in Italy regularly steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees rely on plant pollen as a protein-packed food source. And some are even willing to steal from other bees to get it.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing has been seen before, in the United States. But now, researchers in Italy have also observed honeybees <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-023-01049-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatching pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a>. The observations, published December 21 in <em>Apidologie</em>, are among the most extensive documentation of bee-on-bee larceny to date.</p>



<p>On a summer trip in 2019 to Mount Antola, in the northern Italian region of Liguria, independent naturalists Tiziano Londei and Giuliana Marzi, both based in Milan, recorded video of what they thought were honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) trying to push bumblebees off the flower of a woolly thistle (<em>Cirsium eriophorum</em>). A closer look at the video, however, revealed that this wasn’t a case of competitive harassment — it was a full-blown robbery. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a honeybee steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mPE17Qci1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thieving honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) snags pollen off the body of a red-tailed bumblebee (<em>Bombus lapidarius</em>). Because honeybees aren&#8217;t good at collecting pollen from woolly thistle, the bumblebees — which get pollen stuck on their hairy bodies — appear to be too good a target to pass up. This behavior, previously seen in several areas in the United States, has now been observed in Italy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As red-tailed bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em> <em>lapidarius</em>) scrounged around the flowers for nectar and pollen, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollen-hitches-ride-bees-all-right-spots">pollen grains stuck to their hairy bodies</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/17</em>). Londei and Marzi witnessed honeybees shamelessly snagging this pollen for themselves. The thieves tended to target male bumblebees slightly more than females, as the males appeared less bothered by the pilfering (though even females didn’t react aggressively).</p>



<p>“Honeybees are well-known as pollen pigs,” says Avery Russell, a biologist at Missouri State University in Springfield who was not involved in the study. So stealing pollen from the bodies of bumblebees, he says,&nbsp;&#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like a far stretch.”</p>



<p>To see how common the criminality is, the researchers went back to the scene twice in the following three years and also observed bees at two other sites about 25 kilometers away. Honeybees at these other sites were not seen stealing from bumblebees, but bees at the first site continued their larcenous ways year after year. For instance, honeybees collected pollen from only three of the 31 flowers the researchers observed in 2021, but stole from 28 of the available 66 bumblebees.</p>



<p>Scrutinizing the differences between these sites, the researchers suspect honeybees resort to theft in areas where pollen is hard for them to get from flowers (the honeybees struggled to collect pollen from the woolly thistle), but where there are plenty of other bees around.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing by honeybees has previously been observed only in North America, first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25083029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Kansas</a> and then later in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25084015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-kansas-entomological-society/volume-78/issue-2/0406.15.1/Quantifying-a-Rare-Event--Pollen-Theft-by-Honey-Bees/10.2317/0406.15.1.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>. Discovering the behavior in Italy suggests this may be a global crime spree. Russell says it would be nice to next learn whether pollen theft negatively impacts bumblebees, or the flowers they pollinate. He’s also curious if other bee species ever steal pollen, too. “We do notice that in the hive, bumblebees will nibble on each other&#8217;s pollen baskets,” he says.</p>

The application of microfluidics in the biomedical field covers many different aspects, including sensing, cell manipulation and micropumping. These devices also serve as tissue/organ culture platforms. The concept of organ-on-a-chip allows such complex systems to be reproduced in a smaller and simpler platform, holding massive potential for the study of intercellular communications as well as an alternative to animal models. Micropumps find applications as drug delivery systems, as well as being a fundamental component of microfluidic devices. These are but a few examples of the potential these technologies hold in the biomedical field.</p>

<p>Two assistant professors at universities in the United States are coauthors of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/10/926">a review</a> that appears to have been advertised for sale by the Indian paper mill iTrilon, a Retraction Watch investigation has found.</p>



<p>One of the professors, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-yuguang-ph-d/bio-20503555">Yuguang Liu</a> of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is also guest editor of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors/special_issues/GFBCFF9AIQ">MDPI special issue</a> in the journal <em>Biosensors</em> in which the review was published last year. The other professor, <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/directory/faculty/ajeet-kaushik.php">Ajeet Kaushik</a> of Florida Polytechnic University, in Lakeland, sits on the <a href="https://archive.fo/a1LuB">editorial boards of<em> Biosensors</em></a> and several other titles from MDPI, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature and other publishers.</p>



<p>An MDPI representative said Liu, who declined an interview request, had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the paper. Meanwhile, Kaushik acknowledged his work on the article had sprung from a LinkedIn message from a researcher in India who, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>, has been offering co-authorship in return for help getting his articles published.</p>



<p>“This is sad,” Kaushik told us by email, adding that he had not seen “any red flags” when he agreed to collaborate on the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I contributed to this review article as an ethical co-author,” he said. “I am making it clear that my role in this article does not have any involvement of money or other exchange offers.”</p>



<p>The paper’s link to iTrilon became apparent during a six-month Retraction Watch investigation for <em>Science</em> that found <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">paper mills had taken to bribing journal editors</a> to ensure publication of their articles. Based in Chennai, iTrilon sells authorship of “readymade” scientific papers and gets them published through a network of editors with whom it claims to be working. The company’s <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">website</a> was taken down following our story.</p>



<p>As we reported in a companion piece to the <em>Science</em> article, papers advertised last year by iTrilon <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">buoyed the research output</a> of <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a>, a professor and dean at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, Spain. Lorenzo acknowledged paying the company.</p>



<p>The review in <em>Biosensors</em> is one of the six papers Lorenzo coauthored in 2023 that could be linked to iTrilon. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Colorectal-diagnostics-review.jpeg">matching ad</a> was posted in July and referred to a “review article” about “diagnostics for colorectal cancer,” to be submitted to a journal “indexed in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science” with an impact factor above 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These details are all consistent with the review, “Current Status and Emerging Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening and Diagnostics,” which was submitted to <em>Biosensors</em> on August 29.</p>



<p>But Giulia Stefenelli, chair of the scientific board of MDPI, said the publisher was not investigating the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is important to note that establishing a direct link between the articles and the content advertised by the cited platform is not an easy process. The titles of the articles and the number of authors do not immediately correlate with the published material. Should we receive further evidence that clearly distinguishes the relationship to the publications unequivocally, we will proceed to initiate an official investigation,” Stefenelli told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Liu, who is a corresponding author of the review, did not agree to an interview. But she said in an email that she was “unaware” of the iTrilon ad matching the paper and that “I don’t think it’s related to my paper or the special issue on MDPI.”</p>



<p>We were unable to find contact information for the review’s first author, <a href="https://archive.fo/k1ctn">Shreya Singh Beniwal</a> of Lady Hardinge Medical College, in New Delhi. Beniwal was also first author of <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">a research article</a> coauthored by Lorenzo, which unequivocally matched a previous <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">ad from iTrilon</a> and has now been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the authors came to collaborate on the review is only partly clear. A LinkedIn message from last spring reveals <a href="https://archive.fo/ktZCO">ArunSundar MohanaSundaram</a>, an assistant professor at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, in Chennai, and co-corresponding author of the review, had been proffering author slots on manuscripts to researchers who could help get them published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m ready to offer ‘co authorship’ if you could review the work and support me as an EDITOR in reputed journals,” MohanaSundaram, who has coauthored several papers advertised for sale by iTrilon, wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arunsundar-contacting-researchers-on-linkedin-2.jpg">the message</a>, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>. He did not respond to repeated emails.</p>



<p>MohanaSundaram, Lorenzo and Beniwal came up with the idea for the review article, according to the statement on author contributions.</p>



<p>Kaushik said he had not heard of iTrilon until we reached out to him. But he acknowledged being contacted by MohanaSundaram:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes, I was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-message-from-Arunsundar-to-Ajeet-Kaushik.png">approached by Dr. Arun on LinkedIn</a> but at the beginning of this REVIEW ARTICLE. Then this paper moved forward by email exchanges. The similarity Index was acceptable, and all figures were either self-designed or with the permission. So, I did not see any red flags. I was involved in this article due to my credentials in the field of biosensors and nanomedicine.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kaushik added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please note, that I am a young scholar and working hard to make a good name based on clean and ethical research. I generally want to help, but such incidents are centaily aletrs, and I will be more careful and reserv in the future [sic].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presently, I am seeing some of the approaches (so-called shortcuts) to get easy or sponsored publications. BUT, I do not like and support such approaches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both Mayo Clinic and MDPI emphasized that Liu had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the manuscript.</p>



<p>“The paper’s scientific review, revision, and submission process was handled by an Assistant Editor, Mila Opacic, not Dr. Liu,” Andrea Kalmanovitz, director of Communications &#8211; Media Relations at Mayo Clinic, said in an email. She did not reply to follow-up questions about how Liu had come into contact with far-flung authors linked to paper-mill articles.</p>



<p>According to Stefenelli at MDPI:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The article was accepted by the Section editor-in-chief of &#8220;Nano- and Micro-Technologies in Biosensors,&#8221; to which the Special issue belongs, Prof. Michael Thompson. In accordance with MDPI editorial procedure, Guest Editors are completely excluded from the peer-review process and decision-making stages for articles submitted by themselves and their colleagues. The MDPI procedure seeks for an independent assessment by a member of the Editorial Board for all cases of conflict of interest (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17">https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17</a>).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kaushik, who is a member of the editorial board for the same section of the journal, said he had not been involved in any editorial decisions regarding the review article, nor in the selection of the journal.</p>



<p>Update, 1/24/24, 0930 UTC: </p>



<p>In an email received after this story ran, MohanaSundaram denied any ties to iTrilon and the ads matching his papers. “I am shocked to see your news article which portrays that I am involved in the insane paper mill business. I am strongly against such unethical practice which is a threat to the research fraternity and the society,” MohanaSundaram told us. “I never came across any such Advertisements and I don&#8217;t have any relationship with iTrilion [sic] or any such paper mills.”</p>



<p>He added that he was “always open to research collaborations” and that “For some papers, I feel that higher level of expertise (beyond my capacity) may be required to improve the quality of the manuscript. In such case, I may have approached some editorial board members or experts.”</p>



<p>“My intention is that Editorial board members from good journals have a great experience and expertise, hence they can guide in the best way to match the top notch quality of good journals and the trends in current and advanced research,” MohanaSundaram said. When these individuals made “significant contributions” to his papers, he said, “they &#8220;ethically&#8221; become a leader/corresponding author of the paper in due course of preparation of the final manuscript.”</p>



<p>“Hence, to state that I don&#8217;t have any objections in such ethical grounds, I sometimes mentioned regarding authorships in the initial communications”, MohanaSundaram told us.</p>

                <p>Access to raw scientific data enhances understanding, enables replication and reanalysis, and increases trust in published research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vitality and utility of research data has made Open Data a central tenet of Open Science, second only to publishing under an Open Access license. For that reason, governments, funders, and publishers increasingly recommend <em>or even require</em> data sharing, and readers have come to view Open Data as a hallmark of quality research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purpose-built data repositories are the most effective, stable, and discoverable way to share research data&mdash;which means more attention and impact for research. In fact, articles that link to data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">25% higher citation rate</a> than articles that do not share data, or share only in Supporting Information files.</p>



<p>Repositories also make it easier to claim academic credit for data collection and curation, by assigning a unique identifier, like a DOI, and enabling authors to link their <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;m using my own data or someone else&rsquo;s, having access to the data in a repository means that I know which version to use and refer to. This has been really useful as I don&rsquo;t waste time looking through files and folders on my own computer as I can just click on the DOI and go straight to the data. This also means I don&rsquo;t have to bother anyone else to get the data or spend time magnifying graphs and approximating the values of the data points in order to reuse someone else&rsquo;s findings (yes I really did this with an article published back in the 1980s!)&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/palm-plant-flowers-fruits-underground">This first-of-its-kind palm plant flowers and fruits entirely underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Palm trees are often associated with Hollywood Boulevard and tropical resorts, but their relatives in the palm family Arecaceae can come in many different shapes and sizes. And one shuns the limelight to an almost absurd degree — the new-to-science <em>Pinanga subterranea </em>palm grows its flowers and fruit entirely underground.</p>



<p>“We knew immediately that it’s a really odd palm,” says Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a botanist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Richmond, England.</p>



<p>Malaysian botanist Paul Chai first noticed the palm growing in Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, on the island of Borneo, in the late 1990s. However, Kuhnhäuser says, Chai lost all his photographic evidence for the enigmatic plant during flooding in Kuching, the capital of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. In 2018, Chai told Kuhnhäuser and other botanists visiting Borneo about the lost palm over breakfast. The team embarked on a multiday trek to reach the sanctuary and found, to their surprise, that the underground palm was actually abundant.</p>



<p>Growing anything other than roots underground is rare, but examples can be found across the plant kingdom. South-central Africa is home to an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/suffrutex-grasslands-in-southcentral-angola-belowground-biomass-root-structure-soil-characteristics-and-vegetation-dynamics-of-the-underground-forests-of-africa/90BDAA37B8FE9518441FBC997F1803B8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“underground forest”</a> where many plants flower aboveground but grow woody material below; a Bornean pitcher plant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pitcher-plant-underground-new-species-carnivorous">buries its traps</a> under the soil (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>). In fact, plants across 33 different families have been found to conceal flowers or fruits underground, but burying both is exceedingly rare. Besides the underground palm, “there&#8217;s only one other plant in the world that does this,” Kuhnhäuser says, “and that&#8217;s some tiny orchid genus called <em>Rhizanthella</em> in Australia.”</p>



<p>Just because the palm is new to science doesn’t mean no one knew it existed. “Several local people, especially Indigenous ones, knew the palm,” says Cibele de Cássia Silva, a botanist at the University of Campinas in Brazil who was not involved with the research. The local people not only had names for it, but some dig up and eat the inconspicuous palm’s fruit as a snack. For Cássia Silva and Kuhnhäuser, this highlights the importance of not only engaging with Indigenous knowledge but also including that knowledge in scientific papers.</p>

<p>The biology of the palm is also fascinating. Getting flowers pollinated and seeds dispersed is often vital for plants, so how does a plant pull it off underground? The palm may rely at least partially on self-pollination, and Cássia Silva suspects that beetles may be able to move pollen between plants even belowground. The researchers also saw wild pigs digging up its fruits, which means the animals could help the palm spread its seeds through feces. The team <a href="https://kew.iro.bl.uk/concern/articles/de820e60-4c53-44d8-921e-d95f554181d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the plant</a> in the fittingly named journal <em>Palms</em> in June 2023 and reported on <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.10393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unique biology</a> around the same time in <em>Plants, People, Planet</em>.</p>



<p>Kuhnhäuser’s Kew colleague Sidonie Bellot is now working on unraveling the relationships between the underground palm and its relatives, which will help reveal the steps the palm took to reach its subterranean lifestyle; many of its relatives live close to the ground anyway, so going all the way under may not have been that large of a leap.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Mohammad Tayaraninajaran will talk about his paper &quot;A probabilistic meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm for image multi-level thresholding&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which
causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged many countries. To curb the
effect of the pandemic requires the development of low-cost and rapid tools for detecting
and diagnosing the patients. In this regard, chest X-ray scan images provide a reliable
way of detecting the patients. One limitation, however, is the need for experts to analyse
the images and identify the cases which can be a burden, when a large number of images are
to be processed. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract rapidly, from the
X-ray images, the regions in which there exist indications of COVID-19 infection. To
identify the regions, image segmentation is required which is performed in this paper with
a novel optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm uses probabilistic
representation for the solutions. To improve the optimization process, we propose a
diversity preserving operator. For multi-level image thresholding via optimization
algorithms, different fitness functions have been proposed in the literature. In the
proposed method in this paper, we use three fitness functions to benefit from the
advantages of all. A fitness swapping scheme is proposed which swaps between the fitness
functions in the optimization process. Also, a diversity preserving operator is proposed
in this paper which compares the individuals and reinitializes the similar ones to inject
diversity in the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of COVID-19
benchmark images and experimental analysis suggest better performance for the proposed
algorithm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periwinkle-snail-live-birth-evolution-reproduction">These snails give live birth, and it’s the babies that may do the labor</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oddball minority of animals that don’t lay eggs includes a tough little snail called a rough periwinkle.</p>



<p>Unlike mammals giving birth to kittens and fawns and helpless little humans, this tidal-zone snail has switched to live birth relatively recently.&nbsp;Its newcomer version of birthing offspring into the world without an eggshell is…. different: These periwinkle moms give birth multiple times a day. And unlike humans, it’s probably not the mom but the babies who do the hard labor.</p>



<p>Egg-laying periwinkle relatives have a jelly gland that creates a goo-protected mass of eggs outside the mom’s body. But in <em>Littorina saxatilis</em>, the gland has evolved into a make-do womb, or brood pouch<em>.</em> Eggs still form there, but stay inside mom’s body until after they hatch, says evolutionary ecologist Kerstin Johannesson of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.</p>



<p>Mom can have up to a few hundred embryos at various stages of maturation in the gland. When birthing the mature ones, “if she starts to push, also the ones that are not ready will probably come out,” Johannesson says. As a long-time observer of the snails, she doubts that the moms push at all. The little periwinkles may crawl out of their mother’s body and into the world on their own.</p>



<p>When ready to leave the mob in the brood pouch, each baby snail first scrapes a hole in its own transparent eggshell-like covering, “like a hatching bird,” Johannesson says. Then babies must find the exit from mom’s body. “How they find it, we do not know,” she says, “but maybe they can feel the smell of fresh saltwater coming from the outside through the hole.”</p>



<p>The live birth of these snails fascinates Johannesson and others because the species probably developed the ability in the last 100,000 years or so. That’s just an evolutionary eyeblink, really.</p>



<p>When comparing rough periwinkles with two close sister species (<em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. compressa</em>)<em>, </em>the only reliable visible difference that shows they are separate species is the quirk of live birth.</p>



<p>It was glass German Christmas ornaments that helped evolutionary biologist Sean Stankowski clarify just how strong a species barrier separates live bearers from egg-laying sisters. The glass ornaments, made to be filled with chocolates and dangled on a holiday tree, worked well as passion chambers for pairs of snails, one partner from a live-bearer species and one from an egg-layer. (Considering mollusks in general, this had the kink of pairing males with females rather than the normal two hermaphrodites lining up for mutual sperm delivery.)</p>



<p>In the glass ornaments, some of the pairs mated. But Stankowski, of the University of Sussex in England, and colleagues found no viable offspring, a sign the partners are separate species, in this case with strong separation. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hybrids-reveal-barriers-successful-mating-between-species">Ability to make babies is one way to think about defining a species</a>, but far from the only way (<em>SN: 10/31/17</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ornaments were just a tiny part of some seven years of intense research, mostly genetic exploration, that let Stankowski, Johannesson and colleagues explore how an egg-laying lineage gave rise to such a consequential change as live birth. &nbsp;Both <em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. saxatilis</em> live in the drown-dry craziness of rocky tidal zones, but the egg-layers stay mostly in northern Europe and Russia. The live-birth species, however, has spread farther around Europe and added the northern Atlantic coast of North America to its range. Because <em>L. saxatilis</em> hitchhikes well, it now lives in San Francisco Bay and the canals of Venice.</p>



<p>Yet live birth doesn’t look as if it came from some big dramatic genetic change. Instead, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences built up bit by bit</a>, from changes in some 50 regions in the snail’s genes. None of these seems more influential than any of the others, the team reports January 5 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Giving the eggs more protection might explain the species’ success, the researchers say, even though the newborns emerge from their moms looking vulnerable and only half a millimeter long. You can feel them between your fingers “like grains of sand,” says Johannesson. “They simply creep out of the mother’s pocket, and quite often you can see them crawling around on her shell.” Mom may not help her offspring emerge, but she can provide their first breakfast: diatoms and bacteria ready to be scraped off her shell. Nom-nom!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire editorial board of a sociology journal has resigned after they say that the publisher, Springer Nature, installed new editors-in-chief without consulting the board &#8212; but Springer Nature says they tried unsuccessfully to engage the board on planning going back at least five years.</p>



<p>In December 2023, senior editors of the journal, <em>Theory and Society</em>, learned Springer Nature “had opted for a ‘completely different view’ of the journal going forward,” according to a message shared on a listserv for the American Sociological Association and published on the <a href="https://scatter.wordpress.com/2024/01/10/questions-for-the-new-theory-society-editorial-board/">blog Scatterplot</a>. The 10 senior editors subsequently resigned, they told their colleagues, but didn’t offer additional details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 4, the journal’s corresponding editors also resigned, according to a resignation letter shared with the sociology listserv. The corresponding editors cited Springer Nature’s decision to replace Janet Gouldner, the former executive editor (and widow of the journal’s founding editor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/obituaries/alvin-gouldner-60-a-radical-sociologist-dies-of-heart-attack.html">Alvin Gouldner</a>), without consulting the rest of the editorial board. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128611"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Springer Nature’s unyielding position on this was a clear violation of our profession’s academic norms and standards and was fundamentally at odds with the spirit of the journal. Given our long service and dedication to the journal, we were extremely disappointed that at no point in the publisher’s effort to install a new Executive Editor was a single one of the Senior Editors (nor, to our knowledge, any of the Corresponding Editors) consulted regarding their vision for the future of the journal. Additionally, their attempts to have input into the process of selecting new leadership for the journal were repeatedly rebuffed. We are unaware of any other publisher handling its relationship with an editorial board in such a dismissive fashion.</p>



<p>For us, this is not only about Theory and Society, but more broadly, the precedent of for-profit owners of academic journals unilaterally installing their selected editors. At stake here is how much control we academics are willing to give to for-profit publishers who have so much influence over our professional trajectories on the one hand and rely on our uncompensated labor on the other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mass resignation is the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a>, as academic researchers increasingly see themselves at odds with for-profit journal publishing companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Krauss, Publishing Director for Humanities, Social, Behavioural and Health Sciences at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have spent a number of years assessing the journal, including the authors’ experience of the journal, and considering whether its scope reflects changes in the discipline.&nbsp; Feedback from researchers suggested that the field was becoming more interdisciplinary, although the scope of the journal remained unchanged.&nbsp; We also received a sustained volume of correspondence from submitting authors over this time which expressed deep concerns regarding turnaround times for their submissions. We concluded that it was necessary to reduce turnaround times and to develop the journal to better serve our authors and the wider research community.</p>



<p>The decision to appoint a new Editor in Chief was not made lightly or without consultation. We recognise and are grateful for the many years of distinguished leadership of the journal by Dr Janet Gouldner, who had held the post since 1981. Discussions with Dr Gouldner regarding the need to find a successor, including whether one could be found from within the then Senior Editors, took place over several years but were unsuccessful. We also raised the issue of succession planning with five of the senior editors in 2019 in person, but they were unwilling to enter into discussions on the subject. Regretfully, eventually a decision had to be made to press ahead with appointing a successor with an editorial vision that reflected our shared goals for the journal.</p>



<p>We began working with the new Editors-in-Chief to recruit a new Editorial team after we received a letter of resignation from the previous Corresponding Editors. We are looking to internationalise and diversify the editorial board pool over the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The two new editors in chief, Kevin McCaffree, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Texas in Denton, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_H._Turner">Jonathan Turner</a> of the University of California, Riverside, have published a “<a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11186/updates/26605018">Statement of Goals for Theory and Society</a>,” subtitled “The Troubled State of Sociology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In it, they wrote that “a monoculture of critical approaches utterly dominate” their discipline, “and, though often well-intentioned, this monoculture is undermining sociology’s professional legitimacy.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is an unacceptable state of affairs and calls for a theory journal devoted to scientific sociological theorizing. Theorizing in sociology has always been eclectic, and we will continue this tradition, but what’s needed is a platform to unify these perspectives into a broad but disciplined scientific perspective. Theory and Society is now one of these platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new editors also promised “drastically shorter turnaround times for submitted papers,” special issues, and new article formats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many sociologists criticized the statement on X (formerly named Twitter):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh look the journal was taken over by people who want to push back against ideological research via their own very specific ideological view of science.<br><br>Even from a practical perspective this thing stinks. Good luck making those changes with no support.<a href="https://t.co/H8MmHBYaLL">https://t.co/H8MmHBYaLL</a></p>&mdash; Dr. Tom Mueller (@JTomMueller) <a href="https://twitter.com/JTomMueller/status/1745244803531497875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One called the change in leadership a “coup”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The coup at Theory &amp; Society is complete. After the ed board resigned, the 2 editors handpicked by Springer installed a new board entirely comprised of cognitive scientists, social psychologists, org sociologists, sociobiologists, b school profs, &amp; folks into evolutionary theory <a href="https://t.co/1sEewWJz7C">pic.twitter.com/1sEewWJz7C</a></p>&mdash; Zachary Levenson (@grundrza) <a href="https://twitter.com/grundrza/status/1745260866155499874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>“Everyone knows that the review times were a bit crazy,” <a href="https://x.com/bhbradlow/status/1744369940025446902?s=20">wrote another sociologist</a>, “but that is surely no justification for this attack on intellectual independence by a for-profit publisher. This is a major loss.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2024/01/12/jonathan-turner-is-the-new-co-editor-of-theory-and-society-and-his-latest-diatribe-wont-surprise-you-at-all/">a blog post</a>, a sociologist at the University of Maryland described a recent paper by Turner as “a White-male-grievance monument to laziness and entitlement.”</p>



<p>“For both the way Springer handled it, and because of Turner’s attitude and the journal’s stated mission, I won’t be submitting to or reviewing for the journal (which, granted, I have yet to ever do, anyway), and suggest others follow suit,” Philip N. Cohen wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">McCaffree told Retraction Watch he’d been invited to interview for the position. He said he was told “that turnaround times needed to be shortened and that the publishing vision needed to be more scientific, less political and more interdisciplinary.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then we just got to work. The decision to remove the old board was made before I was asked to interview.</p>



<p>We do want to see the field improve along the lines suggested above, but that&#8217;s it. We don&#8217;t have any deeper agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, with any widescale shift in a journal&#8217;s board and direction, some people will be upset. Others will be intrigued and motivated. But, frankly, Jon and I do not answer for Springer;&nbsp; their decision to change direction was theirs to make and – also – had the old board not resigned in a huff, we would have been happy to have many of them continue to serve.&nbsp; But, they did resign, and we respect that decision. Our only focus now is on finding and platforming the best sociological theory we can find.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turner told us he’d also been invited to edit the journal. He expected to “keep at least some of the board to sustain that part of the journal&#8217;s long-term tradition but add new members to reflect our desire to broaden the scope of theoretical approaches appearing in the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher, Turner said, “simply eliminated some [of] the board at the very time we were beginning to ask some to remain.” He and McCaffree have tried to bring some former board members back on, and recruit new members “that have a critical perspective,” he said, but they have refused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides assembling a new board, the incoming editors-in-chief are focused on going through a backlog of submissions, some over a year old, Turner said, to decide whether to send them out for review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turner said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I remain surprised and saddened about the reaction of the board that consisted of many fine scholars. I don&#8217;t quite see why they are so upset but I cannot do much to change their minds in what appears to be an attempt, I guess, to punish Springer. For Kevin and me, we just need to keep the journal going as editors; and, at least on my part, I am simply ignoring the controversy and hope that when our first issues come out, everyone will see that the journal is meeting its mission to publish theories relevant to understanding the organization of human societies.</p>

<p>Zulfiqar Habib, dean of computer science at COMSATS University Islamabad, in Pakistan, was appalled when he discovered part of a former PhD student’s dissertation had been published in a scientific journal.</p>



<p>After all, the former student, Kurshid Asghar, had been dead for more than a year by the time the manuscript was submitted to <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, a Hindawi title. And Habib knew none of Asghar’s coauthors had contributed to the research, which Habib had supervised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was both shocking and unbelievable,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-128607"></span>



<p>Habib decided to share his concerns with Roberto Di Pietro, chief editor of <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, in which <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/4270776/">the paper</a> had appeared in September 2021. What followed was a strange and opaque investigation, which Wiley, Hindawi’s parent company, now says had “some limitations” and is being revisited following Retraction Watch’s inquiry.</p>



<p>In a December 2021 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.pdf">email</a> to Di Pietro, Habib wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>May I have your attention on a very serious issue about academic fraud. A group of people has illegally published a research paper in your esteemed journal by stealing a chapter of PhD thesis … This paper is copied from Chapter 6 of PhD Thesis of Dr. Khurshid Asghar after his death without the consent and knowledge of his PhD supervisor (Dr. Zulfiqar Habib) and co-supervisor (Dr. Muhammad Hussain).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A research integrity specialist at Hindawi wrote back to inform Habib that, according to the authors, Asghar had shared his work with them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>And while Dr Asghar wrote the original draft, they contributed to the article by editing this original draft with Dr Asghar prior to submission and then answering the reviewers comments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors were willing to add Habib to the author list, the Hindawi specialist said. But Habib demurred. Instead, he asked to see “documentary evidence” proving the authors weren’t just trying to “hide academic fraud and justify plagiarism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In subsequent emails, the specialist told Habib the authors had submitted documentation for their claims but Habib couldn’t see it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… as you are not conducting an official investigation into this allegation of research misconduct, we cannot share the evidence provided by the authors with you without the consent of all parties. We cannot obtain Dr Asghar&#8217;s consent and he is a party within the documentation provided.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Di Pietro chimed in to note that he found Zulfiqar’s point of view “quite reasonable” and suggested starting “an appropriate level of investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in June 2022, Hindawi shut down the case. As the research integrity specialist wrote in an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2.pdf">email</a> to Habib:</p>



<p><em>We have received notification that you have contacted COMSATS University Islamabad to request a formal investigation into the authorship of the article:</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi, Khurshed Asghar, Umar Draz, Amjad Ali, Madallah Alruwaili, Yousef Alhwaiti, Saad Alanazi, M. M. Kamruzzaman, &#8220;Image Splicing-Based Forgery Detection Using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Edge Weighted Local Binary Patterns&#8221;, Security and Communication Networks, vol. 2021, Article ID 4270776, 10 pages, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4270776</p>



<p>We have received the report from the committee formed to investigate this issue in which it was found that the article by Siddiqi et al. did not plagiarise other works. Given the outcome of the investigation, we are now closing this complaint.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>COMSATS University Islamabad did not reply to requests for comment. Nor did <a href="https://sa.linkedin.com/in/dr-muhammad-hameed-siddiqi-8317021b">Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi</a>, the paper’s first author, nor <a href="https://www.uosahiwal.edu.pk/depart-hod/information-technology">Umar Draz</a>, its corresponding author. </p>



<p>But in an email, a spokesperson for Wiley told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of some limitations with the initial investigation and have re-opened the case. We will be reaching out to the parties involved to outline next steps and to ensure that an appropriate outcome is reached as promptly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They later added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We revisited the case as a result of this inquiry, and have decided to reopen it.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-largest-shark-fossil-long-body">Megalodon, the largest shark ever, may have been a long, slender giant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The largest shark discovered to date — the monstrous <em>Otodus megalodon </em>— may have been a sleek, long-bodied leviathan.</p>



<p>A fresh look at the extinct predator’s fossilized remains suggests <a href="https://doi.org/10.26879/1345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its body was many meters longer and possibly more slender than previous reconstructions</a>, researchers report January 22 in <em>Palaeontologia Electronica</em>. The findings may offer better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">insights into the biology and lifestyle</a> of megalodon, including how fast it swam or what it ate (<em>SN: 6/27/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reconstructing what ancient, extinct animals looked like when they were alive is challenging, even when complete fossilized remains are available. But reconstructing megalodon is much harder. Like all sharks, the giant had a cartilaginous skeleton that preserves poorly relative to bone. It is mostly known from teeth and many meters of fossilized, cartilaginous vertebrae, with the rest of the skeleton remaining a mystery.</p>



<p>Traditionally, modern great white sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) have been used as a model for megalodon’s body shape. That’s because great whites are the largest predatory sharks alive today and great whites and megalodons are categorized in somewhat closely related families.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 reconstruction</a> that extrapolated from great whites caught the attention of Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and his colleagues. That study based its reconstruction on the cartilaginous vertebral column of purported megalodon remains housed in a Belgian museum. Adding together all the vertebrae end-to-end revealed a body length of over 11 meters. But Shimada and his colleagues noticed that older work on that same specimen from the 1990s had calculated the entire animal’s length as about 9 meters. That work was based on the diameters of the vertebrae and how those scale with size in great white sharks, which tops out at around 6 meters long.&nbsp;But the 2022 study still assumed megalodon was more or less great white-shaped, Shimada and his colleagues argue.</p>



<p>In their reassessment of the Belgian megalodon specimen’s vertebral column and the 2022 reconstruction, Shimada and his team question relying on the shape of great white sharks to build our view of megalodon. Megalodon’s vertebral column is relatively thin compared with the sturdier vertebrae that support the beefy brawn of great whites, makos and other modern relatives, the team notes. The researchers offer a new interpretation: Because such a small vertebral column would make more sense in a longer, leaner body shape, megalodon may have been built more like a bus than a van.&nbsp;Overall, it may have been an even bigger predator than researchers thought, Shimada says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study was “a major learning moment for both myself and many other scientists in that we need to take a broader perspective when reconstructing extinct animals, especially megalodon,” says coauthor Phillip Sternes, an organismal biologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>A slender body may mean that megalodon wasn’t as powerful a swimmer as great whites are. This matches recent research from Shimada and his colleagues on the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2023.2211597?src=recsys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of a megalodon scale</a> that suggested the shark was a slow cruiser capable of short bursts of speed.&nbsp;This shift in body shape may hint at how it ate or how much it ate, says paleontologist Dana Ehret of the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, who was not involved in either work.</p>



<p>“When working with extinct species, especially ones that don&#8217;t have any close living relatives today, we do our best by estimating what they may have looked like or how they behaved but it is never exact,” he says.</p>



<p>The new study takes an interesting approach, says vertebrate paleontologist Michael Gottfried, but the researchers still rely on great white sharks as a model in some ways, like on patterns of the size of vertebrae in different parts of the shark’s body. Gottfried and his colleagues were the researchers who measured and reconstructed the Belgian specimen as roughly 9 meters long in the 1990s. He says he isn’t sure how accurately the vertebrae can be added up to a total length, because many of the vertebrae are incomplete or fragmentary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, we are still speculating on body form and many other aspects of megalodon,” says Gottfried, of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Additional fossil material from the head and fins would be crucial for understanding how the giant shark looked.</p>

<p><strong>Happy leap second!</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/happy-leap-second"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 12, 1974</p>



<p>A “leap second” has been invented … to keep time signals used by navigators in step with the actual motion of the Earth. The latest leap second was celebrated New Year’s Eve at the stroke of midnight Greenwich Mean Time, when around the world … radio stations added an extra “beep” to their hourly time signals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Time is running out for the leap second. In 2022, metrologists <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to abandon the timekeeping quirk</a> by 2035. Unlike the leap year, which occurs every four years, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/leap-second-helps-us-reality-time">the leap second is deployed</a> whenever clocks need adjusting due to variations in Earth’s spin causing slight changes in the length of a day. Global officials have inserted a leap second 27 times since 1972. But satellites and other tech that rely on the precise time kept by atomic clocks <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leap-or-not-leap">can glitch when the clocks are adjusted</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/06, p. 248</em>). Scientists have suggested using a leap minute instead, which would require atomic clocks be reset once every 50 years or so.</p>

<p>New findings from a survey of psychology researchers show <a href="https://osf.io/pv7e2">nearly half of the respondents have encountered unethical authorship practices</a> in studies they have been involved in.</p>



<p>Researchers in Belgium surveyed more than 800 people involved in psychological research about their experiences with gift and ghost authorship, as well as the use of explicit authorship guidelines at their institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost half said they had witnessed gift authorship on more than one occasion – in other words, the respondents saw someone listed as an author when they had made little or no contribution to a paper. Ghost authorship –  excluding someone from a paper when they have made a significant contribution – was far less common, with fewer than one in five of the respondents reporting that they had dealt with the phenomenon. Since the authors used a convenience sample, the data show signs of authorship misconduct in psychology, but don’t tell the whole story. </p>



<span id="more-128594"></span>



<p>Gert Storms, a professor of psychology and educational sciences at KU Leuven, and an author of the paper, which was posted to the OSF Preprints server on December 11, says the science community pays little attention to inappropriate authorship compared with other misconduct, and the questionable practice goes largely unchecked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms says the manuscript of the survey’s results has been desk rejected three times. One editor cited concerns about informed consent. For that reason, the authors decided not to share the data openly, they said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These findings should be known,” Storms says. “I’m not concerned about getting it published in a way that gives me ‘a new publication with my name on it’. At my age, I just don’t care for that. It is the message.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms himself has witnessed several instances of undeserving bylines. Early in his career, somebody was given a byline on a paper Storms published even though they had made no contribution to the paper apart from applying for grant money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the survey did not ask respondents why they believed the authorship misconduct occurred, Storms says the practice is advantageous for the perpetrators. “It will affect research to a large extent because it determines how much research money and grants people get, who gets hired, who is kicked out of the race and so on,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift authorship in particular helps researchers accumulate publications to their name – crucial to academic recognition for those pressured by the ‘publish or perish’ culture in academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I see CVs where people have one paper every eight or nine days, what should one think about this?” Storms says.&nbsp; “Who has an idea that is worth putting on paper, and who contributes substantially to things that can be published every eight or nine days? That is simply impossible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other research on questionable authorship practices indicates a much higher prevalence of gift and ghost authorship in the biomedical field compared with psychology. One study of biomedical researchers reported 75% of respondents had <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32958486/">experienced the addition of an undeserving author</a> to a paper they had worked on. The same survey found that more than 30% of respondents had encountered a ghost author – a practice that may be more frequent in a field with regular industry collaboration, Storms says. In some fields, “it&#8217;s simply better for the credibility of the findings that [some authors] are not mentioned,” he says. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Authorship criteria vary between institutions. The <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/standards-disclosures">American Psychological Association’s authorship standards</a> state that “substantial scientific contributions” warrant authorship of a paper; the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines</a>, which are widely adopted by scientific journals, recommend authors should also draft or revise the work, in addition to having contributed substantially to the paper, among other criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Defining what is a substantial contribution can lead to debate,” says Steven De Peuter, a staff member of the Research Coordination Office at KU Leuven and an author of the paper. A recent study has <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198117">shown researchers often don’t agree</a> with what is enough of a contribution to deserve authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new survey, each respondent was asked a series of questions about a paper they had recently published. When authorship guidelines – such as those developed by the APA or ICMJE – were not used to decide who should be an author on the paper, respondents were more likely to think that the decision was unfair. Likewise, if the respondents’ research setting did not encourage any authorship guidelines, they were more likely to believe the final authorship decisions weren’t a fair reflection of contribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the main point is that people need to be willing to discuss what the criteria are,” De Peuter says. “That also helps incredibly to establish an atmosphere of fairness and openness.” He also notes that authorship disputes often are a symptom of a pre-existing conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines that require writing for authorship tend to exclude members of the research group&nbsp; with less tangible roles. For example, under ICMJE guidelines, “if I&#8217;m just a brilliant engineer who figured out how to get my machine to do the new trick, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily qualify me for authorship,” says Alex Holcombe, a professor of psychology at the University of Sydney and expert in authorship issues. “We&#8217;re stuck in a system that is not set up for indicating who did what.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contributorship – a system that categorizes each person’s contributions to a paper – is a more transparent approach, Holcombe argues. He backs the classification system CRediT, or the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">Contributor Roles Taxonomy</a>, which includes roles such as software and visualization, as well as the more traditional roles of writing,conceptualization and funding acquisition. Thousands of journals have already adopted the system, but it exists alongside the traditional system of authorship and is not yet routine across the research landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorship misconduct has been relatively overlooked compared with other types of research misconduct, Storms says. In the 1980s, William Bevan, then president of the American Psychological Association, said decisions about authorship, like those about sex, should “have a degree of intimacy about them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have the impression that the same attitude is still present in psychology,” Storms says. “And that&#8217;s really a shame.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-photo-galaxy-eht">Astronomers have snapped a new photo of the black hole in galaxy M87</a></h4>

              
                <p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-2" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-2"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-3" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-3">Heads up space</span></span> fans: A new picture of the supermassive black hole lurking in the galaxy M87 just dropped.</p>



<p>The new image looks a lot like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the previous, headline-grabbing shot</a> revealed in 2019 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). The main difference is that the brightest spot around the black hole <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/01/aa47932-23/aa47932-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted counterclockwise by about 30 degrees</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>. This is probably due to material sloshing around in the black hole’s accretion disk as it gets consumed.</p>



<p>But other aspects have not changed. A bright ring and the black hole’s shadow appear almost exactly the same size as before. This helps confirm that M87’s black hole is the type predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity and not some more exotic or unexpected variety, says astrophysicist Lia Medeiros of Princeton University.</p>



<p>“In science, it&#8217;s always really important to do the same or similar experiments multiple times,” Medeiros says. It helps “make sure you&#8217;re not fooling yourself, and that your results are reproducible.”</p>



<p>Medeiros is part of an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, which used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">a network of radio telescopes around the globe</a> to zoom in on M87’s heart, about 55 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Previously, all images from the EHT — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">those of the supermassive black hole in our own galaxy’s center</a> — used data taken in 2017 or earlier (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). The new picture is the first to incorporate observations from 2018.</p>

<p>In the interim, the EHT team added another telescope to their collection: the Greenland Telescope in northwestern Greenland.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enigma-pulsar-companion-mass-ticks">Astronomers are puzzled over an enigmatic companion to a pulsar</a></h4>

              
                <p>Circling around a pulsar in our galaxy is a mysterious entity that is either a very heavy neutron star, one of the lightest black holes ever discovered, or an exotic and never-before-seen quasi-stellar object.</p>



<p>The new finding comes from the MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa, which carefully monitored 13 millisecond pulsars in a dense cluster of stars 40,000 light years from Earth. These pulsars are a type of neutron star that quickly spin, rotating in fractions of a second, while sending out powerful beams of radiation like a cosmic lighthouse.</p>



<p>For some pulsars, those beams flash past our planet with a regularity that rivals an atomic clock. By hunting for tiny variations in the beams’ arrival on Earth, researchers can deduce the existence of anything perturbing the pulsar’s motion.</p>



<p>The ticks of one particular pulsar, known as PSR J0514−4002E, revealed that it has an invisible companion <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg3005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing between about 2.1 and 2.7&nbsp;times the mass of the sun</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 19 <em>Science</em>. That potentially makes it too heavy to be a neutron star, astronomer Ewan Barr of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and colleagues say. Neutron stars are thought to collapse into black holes once <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">they reach around two to three times the sun’s mass</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/22</em>). But because nobody knows exactly where that dividing line rests, nor precisely what happens once this limit is reached, the researchers can’t definitively say what this object is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers have discovered a handful of similar entities before, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object">one found using the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors</a> in 2020 (<em>SN: 6/23/20</em>). Barr and colleagues speculate that this new object formed when two lighter neutron stars crashed together. By studying the pulsar ticks more closely, the researchers hope to determine the hidden entity’s true nature and use it to probe matter in similarly extreme objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disease-microbes-inject-proteins-cells">How disease-causing microbes load their tiny syringes to prep an attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Swallow the wrong microbe, and you might end up in the hospital with a needle or two in your arm — and plenty of itty-bitty bacterial needles poking at you from the inside. That’s because many bacteria that make us sick use microscopic, syringelike structures to inject our cells with proteins that wreak havoc from the inside. Now, researchers have shown how these microbes load their nanoscale needles with proteins.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-4" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-4">Tracking individual proteins</span> as they jittered around inside living bacteria revealed the microbes use a shuttle bus–like system to load their syringes: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01545-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttle proteins travel random paths within the microbes’ interiors</a>, grabbing cargo destined for injection as they go and dropping it off at the syringes, scientists report January 3 in <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. Knowing how these bacterial needles work could help scientists learn how to disrupt them — or commandeer them for medical applications, like using bacterial needles to inject cancer cells with targeted drugs while leaving healthy tissue unscathed.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-5" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-5">Shuttling proteins to</span> the syringe is “a really novel molecular mechanism that was not known before,” says microbiologist Andreas Diepold of the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg, Germany.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-6" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-6">Under the microscope,</span> the syringelike structures, called a type-III secretion system, look like hollow needles just wide enough for a single unfolded protein to slither through, Diepold says. A microbe’s entire surface might be covered in such needles, giving the bacterium the look of a sinister little pincushion. Scientists know the protein structure of these nanoscale needles quite well. But “we don’t know the basic question of how they recruit whatever is injected,” he says.</p>

Schraidt <em>et al</em>/<em>PLOS Pathogens</em> 2010</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Previous studies suggested that a ring of proteins at the base of the secretion system, where it attaches to the bacterial cell membrane, might act something like a sorting platform that grabs target proteins and loads them into the syringe. But that work wasn’t done in living cells, says microbial geneticist Kelly Hughes of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Other studies in live cells, including recent work by Diepold and his colleagues, hinted that the components of the sorting platform might not stay put at the bases of the syringes. Instead, they might wander around the gel-like jumble of fluids, proteins and other biological bits enclosed within a bacterium’s cell membrane, picking up and dropping off target proteins as they go — like shuttle buses.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-9" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-9">The new study</span> put the shuttle-bus idea to the test by using fluorescence microscopy to track the movement of individual sorting platform proteins in <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em>, a stomach bug that lurks in undercooked pork. Maps of the proteins’ paths show them wandering random, zigzag paths through the cells. And experiments with mutant <em>Y.</em> <em>enterocolitica </em>that lack injectable proteins revealed that the shuttle-bus proteins move more quickly in the mutants — without any injectable targets to bind to, the shuttle-bus proteins don’t get weighed down by cargo and can diffuse faster through the cells. This showed that the sorting platform proteins don’t just wander; they also pick up passengers along the way.</p>



<p>“What I loved about this paper was that it was all set in vivo,” in living cells, Hughes says. “You get these beautiful pictures. And you know, a picture&#8217;s worth a thousand words.”</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-11" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-11">Unraveling more of</span> the outstanding mysteries surrounding these microscale needles will make it easier for scientists to throw a wrench in these machines,&nbsp;or to tinker with them. This type of secretion system, one of a handful of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-molecular-syringe-cells-microscopy">different types of needles bacteria have at their disposal</a>, is widespread across different species of bacteria, Diepold says, so they’re good targets for new types of antibacterial drugs (<em>SN: 3/30/22</em>).</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-12" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-12">They’re also promising</span> tools for medicine and biotech, Hughes says. But as much as they look like medical syringes, bacterial syringes work differently — and scientists still don’t know exactly how bacteria push proteins through their needles. It’s also unclear how the proteins that load up the needles recognize their targets. “We want to understand the riddle of how these systems work,” Diepold says. “We want to understand which solutions evolution came up with to allow bacteria to infect us.”</p>

<p>Last year, a professor and dean at a university in Spain suddenly began publishing papers with a multitude of far-flung researchers. His coauthors, until then exclusively national, now came from places like India, China, Nepal, South Korea, Georgia, Austria, and the United States.</p>



<p>How these unlikely collaborations began is not entirely clear. But a six-month Retraction Watch investigation, part of which is published here as a companion piece to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.zrjehzt">a longer article</a> appearing today in <em>Science</em>, suggests an unsavory possibility: The dean, <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a> of the faculty of health sciences at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, bought his way onto the papers – something he partly admits.</p>



<p>At least six of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240108094859/https:/scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=RJ_3_sYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">the seven journal articles</a> Lorenzo published last year had been previously advertised for sale by the Indian paper mill <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">iTrilon</a>. Based in Chennai, this underhand operation sells authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals,” according to a WhatsApp message its scientific director, <a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww">Sarath Ranganathan</a>, sent to prospective clients last summer. Ranganathan also claimed to have connections at journals that allowed him, in many cases, to guarantee acceptance of the manuscripts he would send their way.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128588"></span>



<p>With academics across the globe under constant pressure to publish, paper mills have flourished, offering clients an easy, if unethical, way to pad their publication lists. Heightened media attention has followed. One of the most prominent cases to come to light is that of Spanish chemist Rafael Luque, a <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=aAjK-qAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">prolific and highly cited</a> researcher, who last year was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">suspended without pay</a> for 13 years by the University of Córdoba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During our investigation for <em>Science</em>, which focused on how paper mills have infiltrated the academic publishing industry, evidence emerged suggesting Lorenzo was a frequent customer of these shady middlemen, whose articles are often plagiarized or contain fake data. Among Lorenzo’s coauthors on the iTrilon papers were several journal editors and other university professors.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The first time Lorenzo’s name appeared alongside international coauthors was July 20, 2023, on <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">a study</a> exploring whether a compound derived from citrus fruits might protect against Alzheimer’s disease. Two weeks earlier, a young researcher visiting his parents in India had received a WhatsApp message from iTrilon. The paper mill touted an “original research article” that had already been accepted and would be published shortly in the non-indexed journal <em>Life Neuroscience</em>. Several author slots were available for anywhere between $290 and $400, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">according to the ad</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-zadey">Siddhesh Zadey</a>, now a PhD student at Columbia University, was intrigued. Posing as a naïve medical student, he inquired about the fifth author slot on the article and was told it was on “hold for another client.”</p>



<p>When the paper appeared online two weeks later, the fifth author was Lorenzo, who is also president of his university’s bioethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reached by phone in October, Lorenzo said as far as he recalled, he had offered his services to a company that was “looking for collaborators, mainly translators and reviewers,” on LinkedIn. Asked if the company’s name was iTrilon, he said, “Yes, I guess so.”</p>



<p>For the Alzheimer’s paper, which described a series of experiments in rats, Lorenzo said he did “the revision and edition [sic].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He acknowledged making a payment in relation to the manuscript, but said he believed it was meant to cover the journal’s article-processing charges (APC). As stated on <a href="https://archive.fo/I32CM"><em>Life Neuroscience</em>’s website</a>, however, articles submitted in 2023 and 2024 “will not be subject to” such charges.</p>



<p>A professor of neuroscience at a university in the United States said Lorenzo’s paper contained “several warning flags,” such as a lack of “critical experimental details,” “elementary” statistical errors, and unlikely histograms that always showed “a perfect monotonic decrease or increase” across experimental conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is highly improbable,” said the expert, who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the case.</p>



<p>Nasrollah Moradikor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016053222/https:/georgianeuroscience.com/nasrollah-moradikor/">International Center for Neuroscience Research</a>, in Tbilisi, Georgia, the paper’s corresponding author and a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016050925/https:/neuroscirn.org/editorial/">high-level editor</a> at <em>Life Neuroscience,</em> did not agree to be interviewed. He has published other studies in the past that contain the same type of basic errors and improbable results, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4087/4/1/6">one in the MDPI title <em>NeuroSci</em></a><em>,</em> according to the neuroscience expert.</p>



<p>Another one of Lorenzo’s coauthors – Indranath Chatterjee, a professor of computer science at Tongmyong University, in South Korea, and also an editor at <em>Life Neuroscience</em> – denied knowledge of any advertising for the paper. As reported in <em>Science</em>, Chatterjee gave a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seminar-chatterjee-moradikor-itrilon.jpg">talk last autumn</a> on scientific publishing organized by iTrilon and the International Center for Neuroscience Research.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lorenzo did not reply to follow-up emails this year asking about his other iTrilon papers, which include:</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Among the dean’s coauthors on two of the advertised papers is <a href="https://archive.fo/7L44K">Paula Lamo Anuarbe</a>, an associate professor at the International University of La Rioja, also in Spain. Lamo did not reply to repeated requests for comment, but an administrator at her institution was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-10-05/spanish-university-administrator-and-colleagues-linked-to-factory-producing-fraudulent-scientific-studies.html">linked to paper mills</a> last year.</p>



<p><a href="https://drarifulhaque.com/">Ariful Haque</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at Yan&#8217;an Hospital Affiliated to Kunming Medical University, in China, who coauthored the paper on bioinks, said he and the other authors were “a team that works together and is concerned about global public health challenges.”</p>



<p>“I have not come across any adverts by iTrilon or any other organization for the selling of authorship in journals,” added Haque, who is an associate editor of Cell Press’ <em>Heliyon Surgery</em>, an assistant editor of Elsevier’s<em> Journal of Orthopaedics</em>, and an editor of Elsevier’s <em>Medical Reports</em>. “I want to clarify that I am strongly against collaboration with paper mills or unethical authoring techniques.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, one of Haque and Lorenzo’s coauthors, <a href="https://archive.fo/ktZCO">ArunSundar MohanaSundaram</a> of Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, the city were iTrilon is based, appears to be using authorship as a bargaining chip to boost his chances of getting published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last May, the month before Zadey was contacted by iTrilon, MohanaSundaram sent him a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arunsundar-contacting-researchers-on-linkedin-2.jpg">message on LinkedIn</a> requesting Zadey’s “valuable support as an EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER” for “almost completed” papers on neuroscience and public health. (Zadey is not a member of any editorial boards.)</p>



<p>“I’m ready to offer ‘co authorship’ if you could review the work and support me as an EDITOR in reputed journals,” MohanaSundaram wrote. “Or maybe through bearing APC charges for papers, if you could support also I will offer authorship.”</p>



<p>MohanaSundaram did not respond to repeated emails, and it is unclear why he targeted Zadey. But a paper from last year of which MohanaSundaram and Lorenzo appear as coauthors, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405857223000633#sec7">Female house surgeon stabbed to death: High time for a multi-pronged action plan to prevent and manage violence against Health care workers</a>,” relied on <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lansea/article/PIIS2772-3682(22)00080-4/fulltext">work</a> Zadey and a colleague had published earlier in <em>The Lancet Regional Health – Southeast Asia.</em></p>



<p>“They used our work but they don’t cite us,” Zadey said. “Clearly this practice of trading authorships is costing researchers like me who put in the work because these folks won’t care about reading enough or citing appropriately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zadey didn’t find an iTrilon ad matching the article about the stabbed surgeon, but he said it may have been posted before he joined iTrilon’s WhatsApp group at the end of June last year. “The authors, the journal, the topic, and most importantly the way it’s written, it fits right into everything else that I’ve seen.”</p>



<p>Update, 1/19/24, 1345 UTC: Giulia Stefenelli, chair of the scientific board of MDPI, which published two of the papers in question, told us the publisher understands &#8220;the gravity of the concerns,&#8221; but: &#8220;At this time, there is no ethics investigation related to the articles mentioned. We appreciate your diligence and invite you to provide us with any other evidence or information that would support an official investigation. It is important to note that establishing a direct link between the articles and the content advertised by the cited platform is not an easy process. The titles of the articles and the number of authors do not immediately correlate with the published material. Should we receive further evidence that clearly distinguishes the relationship to the publications unequivocally, we will proceed to initiate an official investigation. I have included MDPI&#8217;s ethics department in this communication to raise awareness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last spring, the <em>Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science</em> published a provocative paper stating that left-handed mothers in Singapore treat their LGBTQ+ children better than do right-handed moms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Except the paper, “<a href="https://journaljesbs.com/index.php/JESBS/article/view/1216">Left-Handed Mothers and LGBTQ+ Child Acceptance in Singapore: Exploring the Link through Early Life Rejection,</a>” was fake, a sting, designed to cast shade on anti-gay science proliferating in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data were fabricated, and so were the authors, Jin Rabak and Hen Guai Lan. Their purported employer, Simisai University? A bogus institution with a name concocted for laughs: in Singaporean English, “simisai” means “what the shit.” </p>



<span id="more-128553"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Retraction Watch has covered many <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/07/25/may-sting-another-journal-prank-good-overlook/">sting operations</a>. Most of them involve a scientist <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/27/a-closer-look-at-the-chocolate-with-high-cocoa-content-hoax/">submitting fake data</a> for publication so they can expose predatory journals that host junk science to collect publication fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the person behind the sting, Teo Yu Sheng, is a Singaporean activist who founded a website and company called Heckin’ Unicorn that celebrates queerness. Inspired by comedian John Oliver’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/john-oliver-fake-health-care-sharing-ministry-1234782577/">fake church</a>, Teo created a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10453038">fake paper</a> he <a href="https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/anti-lgbtq-fake-science-is-spreading-in-singapore">hoped would help discredit bad-faith arguments</a> from American conservatives that Singaporeans were using to advocate for a ban on same-sex parenting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two papers <a href="https://thembeforeus.com/study-studies-same-sex-parenting/">cited</a> in these arguments had been published in the <em>Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science</em>. So Teo, a self-described “science nerd,” hatched a plan.</p>



<p>“I was just reading up on all of the things that people were citing as evidence that queerness is wrong or bad,” he told Retraction Watch. And then he got the idea to submit a fake paper to the journal, “Just to prove that it&#8217;s just bullshit, that anyone can send random shit and it&#8217;s gonna get published.”</p>



<p>Teo says he wrote the manuscript in three days. After edits from friends, he sent it to the journal on March 5, according to emails obtained by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine days and a $140 fee later, the journal published the article with minimal changes and no questions about the data, methodology or the authors’ background. The only significant change: the journal had revised the paper’s submission date from March 5 to January 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teo was furious:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to publish anything without caring whether it&#8217;s true or not, but it&#8217;s another thing to actively lie. They said that they received it in January. Unless they have a time machine, that’s just impossible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M. B. Mondal, the journal’s publisher, said the date change was a “typo-error by the proof editor.” She says that the journal retracted the article several months later on October 16, 2023:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We became aware of the problem of the fake paper from different internet forums/blogs around the last week of September 2023. Exact date I can not remember. After careful review by the expert committee, the article was retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mondal declined to elaborate on what “careful review” meant. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper is no longer available on the journal’s website, and its abstract has been replaced with the sentence, “This article is Retracted.” </p>



<p>However, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87096F90F125A71845BC34EF14BA64#">flagged</a> the article’s retraction in December, at which point the abstract read, “This article is under investigation.” When asked what the journal was investigating two months after the retraction, Mondal also declined to comment. (The journal’s publisher, ScienceDomain International, has previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/16/hydroxychloroquine-push-scooters-and-covid-19-a-journal-gets-stung-and-swiftly-retracts/">come under scrutiny</a> for publishing suspect science.)</p>



<p>Teo learned the paper had been retracted from the PubPeer notification; the journal had not communicated with him about the retraction. He published videos and a <a href="https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/anti-lgbtq-fake-science-is-spreading-in-singapore">lengthy article</a> in September describing his fake paper and its problems, as well as discussing why the articles he sought to undermine were also scientifically flawed. He admitted that he has no formal scientific training, but was taught how to analyze scientific papers in school.</p>



<p>Teo says his lack of expertise make the journal’s flimsy standards all the more damning: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It took <em>nine</em> days to get it published. It took me on and off about a year to research and write down why the science was wrong. So that gives you a sense of how quick it is to turn out rubbish and get it published, and how much more difficult it is to go through the details and explain why something doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s significantly more difficult to debunk false information than it is to create conspiracy theories of fake scientific evidence or knowledge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-tun-oxidation-suspended-animation">Here’s how tardigrades go into suspended animation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers have discovered a molecular sensor that tells tardigrades it’s time to toughen up.</p>



<p>The tiny eight-legged animals, also known as water bears or moss piglets, are nearly invincible when dormant. When times get tough, the microscopic invertebrates curl into a ball called a tun. They pull in their legs, jettison water, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-bears-glass-all-full">turn their insides to glass</a>, and slow their metabolism to imperceptible levels (<em>SN: 12/16/15</em>). In that state, tardigrades are able to withstand completely drying out, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-space-travel-survival-humans">trips into space, X-rays </a>and other extreme insults, but aren’t entirely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-survival-shot-gun-crash-landing-planet">bulletproof</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/22; SN: 6/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Tardigrades aren’t extremophiles, they’re extremo-tolerant,” says Derrick Kolling, a chemist at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va.</p>



<p>Chemical changes called oxidation to the amino acid cysteine <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trigger the tun state</a>, Kolling and colleagues discovered. Reversing that oxidation process brings tardigrades out of dormancy, the team reports January 17 in <em>PLOS One</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have long wondered what prompts tardigrades’ entry and emergence from the tun state, says Hans Ramløv, a comparative physiologist at Roskilde University in Denmark who was not involved in the study. Knowing that cysteine oxidation is the key is “inspirational,” but also, “it is a little bit irritating for myself, because I have always claimed that the transformation was passive, and now I can see that it is definitely not passive.”</p>



<p>The finding helps explain some aspects of water bear biology, and perhaps that of other organisms that go into suspended animation, when metabolism drops to nothing and the animals are essentially dead, Ramløv says. For instance, tardigrades have very high metabolism when they emerge from dormancy. That may be because they are actively reversing cysteine oxidation and repairing damage caused by oxidation, he says. But a fundamental question remains. “It obviously does not explain how you can stop metabolism and die and restart metabolism and live.”</p>



<p>The project came about “on a whim,” Kolling says. “We were curious about tardigrades. They&#8217;ve been in the news quite a bit.” So he told his lab, “tardigrades are easy to get. Let&#8217;s get some and let&#8217;s put them in an instrument we have here.” That instrument was an EPR spectrometer. Scientists use it to study atoms and molecules that have unpaired electrons.</p>



<p>Using the instrument, Kolling and colleagues saw that as <em>Hypsibius exemplaris</em> tardigrades entered the tun state, levels of superoxides shot up. Superoxides are molecules of oxygen that have had an electron added, leaving one electron unpaired and ready to react with other atoms and molecules. The unstable chemicals, sometimes called reactive oxygen species or free radicals, can damage proteins and other components of cells.</p>



<p>But superoxides can also be used to send signals, says Leslie Hicks, a chemist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her lab teamed with Kolling’s to decipher what was happening to the tardigrades. One of the researchers’ first steps was to expose tardigrades to a type of stress they wouldn’t normally encounter.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s throw hydrogen peroxide at the bears and see if they can form tuns as a result of that stress,” Hicks recalls telling her colleagues. The team tested various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, a powerful oxidizing chemical. Sure enough, the tardigrades went into tun mode in dilute hydrogen peroxide. Removing the hydrogen peroxide woke the water bears up again. That told the researchers that oxidation was an important signal for entering and leaving dormancy.</p>



<p>Drilling down further, Hicks and colleagues examined oxidation of cysteine, one of the amino acids that make up proteins in living things. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide or other unstable chemicals can cause chemical changes to cysteine, some reversible and some not. In turn, those changes can alter the structure and enzyme activity of proteins.</p>



<p>Blocking cysteine oxidation prevented tardigrades from forming tuns triggered by exposure to high levels of salt or sugar, the team found. Blocking cysteine oxidation also wiped out the tardigrades’ ability to survive freezing, although the resilient little animals don’t form tuns when frozen. That suggests that cysteine oxidation may be an important player in all the water bears’ survival mechanisms, Hicks says.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t test drying, says Kazuharu Arakawa, a systems biologist at Keio University in Fujisawa, Japan, not involved in the study. He’s curious to find out whether other species of tardigrades that can tolerate drying without forming tuns also rely on oxidation. Oxidation may be important for other species unrelated to tardigrades, too, Arakawa says. For instance, other researchers have shown that oxidation is important for some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567724923000892?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midges to survive drying out</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-museum-exhibit-survival-environment">A new exhibit invites you into the ‘Secret World of Elephants’</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of years, over a dozen species of proboscideans, the group that includes mammoths, mastodons and elephants, roamed landscapes as varied as Arctic tundra and African savannas. Then, around 11,700 years ago, as the last ice age waned and human hunting picked up, this number dwindled to just three: the Asian elephant, the African forest elephant and the African savanna elephant — all of which are now endangered.</p>



<p>Losing elephants comes with a far-reaching and underappreciated impact, warns “<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/secret-world-elephants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret World of Elephants</a>.” The exhibit, now on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, explores that impact, as well as what modern science is revealing about elephant minds and bodies.</p>



<p>As ecosystem engineers, modern elephants transform their environments. Because these herbivores are so big, they eat a lot, poop a lot and travel far to graze, dispersing mounds of viable seeds far and wide. The beasts also trample fields, making room for a diversity of plants, and dig enormous water holes that other animals use too. In North American grasslands, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-mammoths-competed-other-animals-and-lost">the departure of mammoths</a> and other large herbivores homogenized the land, covering rich landscapes with slow-growing plants and invasive weeds (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 22</em>), says curator Ross MacPhee, a mammalogist at the museum.</p>



<p>The loss is cultural too. Though the exhibit is small, it’s packed with displays focusing on how elephants shape — or have been incorporated into — our lives. The animals appear in early cave drawings and in religious stories. (This connection hasn’t always benefited elephants, though, as humans have trained them as war steeds and circus performers.)</p>



<p>The exhibit aims to rekindle our connection with elephants by emphasizing that they, too, are smart and social creatures. They can recognize themselves in mirrors, a potential sign of self-awareness, and can use tools. Videos in the exhibit show elephants playing with and comforting one another. By pressing buttons on an interactive board, visitors can also hear calls that appear to convey fear, affection and annoyance.</p>



<p>Much of the exhibit’s appeal comes from its exploration of how elephants differ from us. The animals, for instance, hear not just with their ears but also with their feet, picking up on the subtle vibrations of the ground beneath them. They also have a superior sense of smell, with more smell receptor genes than even dogs. And it’s hard to fathom that the average adult male African elephant consumes some 150 kilograms of food every day.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/secret-world-elephants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret World of Elephants</a>&#8220;</h3>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Now Open</h5>



<p>American Museum of Natural History | New York City</p>
</div>



<p>It’s amazing to see all that researchers can glean from what the animals leave behind. Chemical analyses of tusks, for instance, can reveal what an elephant ate and where it traveled during its lifetime. DNA samples, meanwhile, show unexpected evolutionary connections between elephants and animals that look nothing like them, including aardvarks and tenrecs.</p>



<p>By including grand visuals and tactile elements, the exhibit is appealing to visitors of all ages. During my visit, a group of schoolchildren admired a life-size model of an elephant and stroked a replica of the creature’s wrinkly skin. I ran my fingers along the ridges of a fossilized mammoth tooth and better understood how they served as a tool for grinding up tough grasses.</p>



<p>Overall, the exhibit sparks both curiosity and alarm. “If we don’t act quickly,” a sign states, “elephants could be gone before we ever truly get to know them.” The exhibit’s curators hope that “The Secret Lives of Elephants” inspires visitors to help stave off the animals’ extinction.</p>



<p>Supporting local nonprofits that protect elephant habitats is one way individuals can help, the exhibit suggests. Another is to abstain from purchasing ivory or other elephant products. Although it is illegal to sell ivory in the United States, the European Union and China, a thriving black market fuels rampant poaching, on such a scale that some elephants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskless-elephants-evolution-poaching">may be evolving to lose their characteristic tusks</a> (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 15</em>). </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-dogs-wag-tails-communication-evolution">Some mysteries remain about why dogs wag their tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to tail wagging among dogs, some questions still hound researchers.</p>



<p>We know that domesticated dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) use their tails to communicate — with other dogs as well as humans — and even what various types of wags mean, researchers note in a new review of the scientific literature. But <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2023.0407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t know why dogs seem to wag more</a> than other canines or even how much of it is under their control, ethologist Silvia Leonetti and colleagues report January 17 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“Among all possible animal behavior that humans experience in everyday life, domestic dog tail wagging is one of the most common,” says Leonetti, who is now at the University of Turin in Italy. “But a lot of dog behavior remains a scientific enigma.”</p>



<p>So Leonetti and her colleagues pored through previous studies to figure out what elements of tail wagging are understood and which remain mysterious. They also hypothesized about the behavior’s origins: Perhaps tail wagging placates some human need for rhythm, the researchers suggest, or maybe the behavior is a genetic tagalong, a trait tied to others that humans bred into domesticated dogs.</p>



<p>“People think wagging tail equals happy dog. But it&#8217;s actually a lot more complicated than that,” says Emily Bray, an expert in canine cognition at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not involved with the work. Understanding why dogs wag their tails is important partly from an animal welfare perspective, she says, as it could help dog owners read their pups’ cues better.</p>



<p>One main thing that researchers know about tail wagging is that it’s used predominantly for communication instead of locomotion, like a whale, or swatting away bugs, like a horse. Wagging also means different things depending on how the tail is wagged, such as its height or side-to-side movement.</p>



<p>For example, when the tail wags more to the right, the researchers say, it typically means the dog is interested in a stimulus or wants to approach something. But when it wags more to the left, it signals uncertainty or wanting to withdraw<em>. </em>When wagged low and near the legs, it’s a sign of submission or insecurity. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/wag-dog-when-left-vs-right-matters">Dogs can interpret and react differently</a> to these varied wags (<em>SN: 11/1/13).</em></p>



<p>But for such a ubiquitous behavior, questions abound. One gap is how much tail wagging is under dogs’ conscious control, the team reports. Several studies have also observed that dogs wag their tails more than other canines, particularly compared with their closest relative, the wolf (<em>C. lupus</em>) — but scientists don’t yet know why.</p>



<p>One idea is the domesticated rhythmic wagging hypothesis, Leonetti and colleagues suggest. Scientists know that humans’ brains respond positively to rhythm, and because tail wagging is a rhythmic behavior, the authors suggest it could be that humans consciously or unconsciously preferred dogs that wag more.</p>



<p>Or the domestication syndrome hypothesis could be at work. It’s an existing theory that unintended, genetically linked traits can pop up when specific traits are bred for through domestication. Perhaps, the researchers propose, the canine characteristics that humans found desirable to breed for — such as temperament — might be genetically linked to tail wagging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Tom Reimchen isn’t so sure about either hypothesis. He’s skeptical that domestic dogs do wag their tails more than other canines. More research is needed to compare tail wagging between nondomestic canine species and the epigenetic influences behind&nbsp; canids’ tail wagging, says Reimchen, of the University of Victoria in British Columbia.</p>



<p>Leonetti, who did the work while at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, Netherlands, says a multidisciplinary approach would be helpful in future tail wagging research, for example combining neurology, cognition and physiology. Because the domestication process was also an evolutionary process — one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-domestication-origin-mythology-history">humans were involved in</a> — studying dog behavior and their wags could reveal something about us too, she says (<em>SN: 9/7/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It “can shed light not only on our understanding of dog behavior, but also we’ll then understand something about human psychology.”</p>
