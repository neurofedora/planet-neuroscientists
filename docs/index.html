<p>In June of last year, Salvador Pineda received an email from a researcher at Zhejiang University in China informing him one of his articles had been plagiarized. </p>



<p>The researcher pointed Pineda to a paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014206152100418X?via%3Dihub">A robust optimization method for optimizing day-ahead operation of the electric vehicles aggregator</a>,” which appeared in Elsevier’s <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems</em> in November 2021. The article, by researchers at the University of Lahore, Pakistan, contained several figures copied from Pineda’s 2020 paper “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9122589">An efficient robust approach to the day-ahead operation of an aggregator of electric vehicles</a>,” as well as similar text.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/info/113635/salvador-pineda-morente/">Pineda</a>, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Málaga in Spain, immediately wrote to the journal’s editor-in-chief, who said he’d retract the article, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Yet the article remains intact, more than a year later, with the publisher blaming the delay on staffing changes at the journal.</p>



<span id="more-129880"></span>



<p>“We are feeling extremely frustrated and cannot understand why it is taking so long to retract such a clear case of plagiarism,” Pineda told us.</p>



<p>A week after Pineda’s email, Vladimir Terzija, editor-in-chief of the <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,</em> told Pineda and several other researchers the journal would retract three papers for plagiarizing their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The corresponding author of the plagiarized papers accepted his mistake and expressed a strong apology, promising that something like that will never happen in future [sic],” Terzija wrote in emails we have seen. Terzija declined our request for comment.</p>



<p>Ubaid ur Rehman, the corresponding author mentioned by Terzija, last year lost <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dur%2bRehman%252c%2bUbaid">two papers </a>for plagiarism in a Springer journal. “As other plagiarized authors have informed me, papers in other journals [by ur Rehman] were retracted immediately” after the editors received concerns, Pineda said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other papers Terzija promised to retract as well as Pineda’s are &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522001326">A robust vehicle to grid aggregation framework for electric vehicles charging cost minimization and for smart grid regulation</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061521005974">Optimal power management framework for smart homes using electric vehicles and energy storage</a>&#8221; All three articles remain intact in the journal.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In June, one year after Terzija promised the retractions, Pineda <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7208434135948763136/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%2C7208515850205569024%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287208515850205569024%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%29">posted on LinkedIn</a> asking fellow researchers for advice on the unresolved situation. Following that post, ur Rehman emailed Pineda to say he had also requested retraction of the paper and was unaware of the “many plagiarism rules.”</p>



<p>“As a young and immature member of the academic community I would like to ask you to please delete this post, I accept that I made mistake [sic] and I ensure you I have a deep regret on this thing, however your LinkedIn post is highlighting this matter on social media which is highly damaging for me,” ur Rehman told Pineda. Ur Rehman did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>“We are aware of these papers and the retraction process is indeed underway,” a spokesperson for Elsevier said, adding, “journal staffing developments presented some delays.”</p>



<p>We’ve previously covered many cases of journals taking a while to act, including a bioinformatics journal that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/02/one-year-later-bioinformatics-journal-with-unclear-leadership-yet-to-retract-plagiarized-article/">failed to retract an article</a> following a year of requests from the aggrieved author and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/03/two-years-ago-an-author-asked-a-journal-to-withdraw-a-paper-it-still-hasnt/">a 2020 request for retraction</a> over falsified data. Both of those papers still have not been retracted.</p>



<p>“It is deeply disappointing to see that some scientific journals disregard both the integrity of science and the efforts of those who contribute honestly to the field,” Pineda said.</p>

<p>Sage has retracted 467 articles from the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems</em>, a title it took on when it <a href="https://group.sagepub.com/press-releases/sage-grows-research-portfolio-by-acquiring-ios-press?_gl=1*1ol2wiz*_gcl_au*Mzc3MDgzNTM5LjE3MjQzMjE2OTg.*_ga*MTg4Mjc2NDY3MS4xNjQ5MTUxMTc3*_ga_60R758KFDG*MTcyNDMyMTY5OC4yMjUuMC4xNzI0MzIxNjk4LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;format=amp">acquired IOS Press</a> last November for an undisclosed sum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher “launched a thorough investigation” into the journal in April, according to a spokesperson, after the indexing company Clarivate “informed us about concerns relating to the quality of some of the journal’s content.”</p>



<p>“The investigation found that the peer review process for some articles was inadequate, leading to the retraction of these articles,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor in chief, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/langari-reza.html">Reza Langari of Texas A&amp;M</a> University in College Station, resigned on June 16 “due to differences of opinion on how to proceed” with Sage’s investigation, he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129899"></span>



<p>In Langari’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Langari-comment.pdf">comments to us</a>, he said submissions had grown significantly in recent years because of growth in the AI field, which the journal covers, reaching 10,000 last year. The journal implemented a prescreening process and rejected over 80% of submissions, he said, “some of which were clearly manufactured by paper mills or else using AI tools.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time pressure and lack of responses from reviewers sometimes shifted decisions about manuscripts to associate editors, Langari said. When he didn’t trust an editor, “I would summarily remove them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He speculates complaints from editors he removed or “disgruntled authors” he’d placed on an “internal blacklist” of nearly 1,000, or the large number of submissions to the journal, may have contributed to Clarivate flagging the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Langari called Sage’s decision to retract over 450 articles “presumably due to short review periods or limited reviews,” a “rather drastic measure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The decision to remove so many papers from my perspective may not have been entirely warranted,” Langari said. He was not involved in the final decision. “I do appreciate the fact that they did not unduly blame myself, the editorial board and the authors in their retraction notices,” he said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sage paused publication of new articles in the journal when it began investigating, and will continue the pause while moving the management of the journal in-house, according to the spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At Sage, we believe in the power of the academic record and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/31/guest-post-a-look-behind-the-scenes-of-bulk-retractions-from-sage/">importance of taking corrective action</a>, when necessary, as we work to hold all our journals to high quality standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s profile page on Clarivate’s website states indexing for the title in Web of Science is “on hold” while the company re-evaluates its content “according to our selection criteria.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Clarivate removes the journal from Web of Science, the company will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which makes it a less attractive venue for researchers to publish their work. Universities and other institutions use metrics about citations, as counted by indexes such as Web of Science, in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions, meaning researchers who previously published in the journal also may <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">pay a price</a>.</p>



<p>Clarivate did not give the journal an impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in 2020</a> over concerns about “citation stacking,” also known as participating in “citation cartels” or “citation rings.” In 2021, IOS Press <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">retracted nearly 50 articles</a> from the journal for citing “literature sources that have no relation to the subject matter of the citing article,” according to the <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219218">notice</a>. (Langari acknowledged this episode as one “mishap” in his 21-year tenure as editor in chief, which he said involved “special issues guest edited by presumably trustworthy individuals.” Afterwards, the journal focused on regular submissions and stopped producing special issues “unless done under our control.”)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage was aware of issues with the journal before acquiring IOS Press, the publisher’s spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For any new journal we take on, we use our resources to make sure we’re publishing at a high standard and in accordance with COPE. If there are any issues with specific journals then we’ll take corrective action as needed.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219433">retraction notice</a> for the articles cites “inadequate” peer review, and states, “we have no evidence to suggest authors were involved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Publisher acknowledges the anonymous volunteers on PubPeer whose observations complemented our internal investigation,” the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PubPeer user “Rhipidura albiventris” commented on several of the now-retracted papers to point out <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/18B36861E90E10465F1191F1A84D85#2">flaws in the calculations</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/46E62E22CE258B29DF0EDC469E5342">question the relevance of citations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Even more papers have been flagged via the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, a project of sleuth <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> which uses various detectors to spot bad practices in academic papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Cabanac, the PPS has identified 11 articles in the journal with <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:24::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">tortured phrases</a>, nonstandard wording of common phrases that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">seem to be written by computers</a>. None of these flagged papers appears in today’s retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PPS “Feet of Clay” detector, which identifies articles that cite retracted work, has flagged <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">674 papers</a> in the journal, not all of which have been retracted in this batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s retractions “will feed the Feet of Clay even more,” Cabanac told Retraction Watch, once the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a>, which uses the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch Database</a>, now part of Crossref, receives information about them from the metadata providers. “We&#8217;ll need to assess the domino effect.”</p>



<p>“Chain retractions” may be necessary if authors referenced the now-retracted papers with the “‘<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6605F48422547546E0F5DA03E028A5">citation plantation</a>’ technique,” Cabanac said, referring to <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24896">over-citation</a> of particular authors, even for unrelated topics. “I&#8217;m curious to see which journals will be ‘contaminated’ the most…”</p>

<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>retracted an article for plagiarized images after questioning the motives of the researcher who said her images were taken.</p>



<p>The researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, first emailed <em>Cureus,</em> an open-access journal <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-acquires-cureus/23793592">Springer Nature acquired</a> in 2022, on August 1. She said she noticed images in the October 2023 paper, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/193997#!/">Pediatric Acute Dacryocystitis and Orbital Cellulitis With Concurrent COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report</a>,” came from a lecture she posted online and later removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The images used in this article were edited and presented under a fabricated clinical scenario” and had been used without her permission, the researcher wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch. She requested the journal retract the article. She also provided what she said were her original images, which were replicated in Figure 1 of the paper, and copied the corresponding author of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129846"></span>



<p>That author, <a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/602975-ahmed-a-abdelaziz">Ahmed A. Abdelaziz</a>, of&nbsp; Dallah Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, responded and said the researcher’s allegation was correct. First author <a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/602982-saleh-h-ghulaysi">Saleh Ghulaysi</a> (often spelled “Ghulaisi” by colleagues), a medical student at Jazan University in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, was “unable to provide an answer regarding the source of the image,” Abdelaziz wrote. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I had reviewed the materials provided by Saleh and trusted that they were legitimate. However, it is now evident that Saleh not only failed to provide accurate and verifiable information but also intentionally misled the co-authors and myself. Given the severity of Saleh&#8217;s misconduct, I believe the case report should be retracted, and all authors, including myself, should be held accountable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ghulaysi disputed that he was responsible for the image. “All my research project have been peer reviewed and answered correctly and conducted ethically,” he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/147558-prateek-s-harne">Prateek Harne</a>, an associate editor at <em>Cureus</em>, said in an email reply to the anonymous researcher on August 4 the “images are copied.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The paper should be retracted, and the authors should be flagged,” Harne wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/5">Graham Parker</a>, director of publishing at <em>Cureus</em>, told the researcher the journal’s investigation would take four to six weeks. In emails we received, the researcher questioned this timeframe, asking if six weeks was “really needed just to check that the published images are identical to the ones I sent you, and to confirm that they only replaced the color annotations?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am not sure I understand your demand for urgent action?” John Adler, the editor-in-chief of the journal, told the researcher in an email. He said her “efforts to go around our process, and to apply added pressure both puzzles and even concerns me that there might be another secondary agenda at play.” He urged her to “sit back and let our process play out over the next 1-2 weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a follow-up email, the researcher said she was copying us on the thread and “hoping that you act more seriously with scientific fraud.” Parker called the statement “insulting and offensive to the efforts of our small staff.” He then said: “you do not have the journal&#8217;s permission to share any communications with them,” referring to our organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we reached out to Parker, on August 14, he emailed the researcher and said he considered her actions to be a “breach in confidentiality” and “it may in fact constitute a violation of copyright law for which you could be help [sic] legally liable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/193997-pediatric-acute-dacryocystitis-and-orbital-cellulitis-with-concurrent-covid-19-infection-a-case-report/retraction#!/">retracted</a> the article the same day, citing images that were “plagiarized from an online lecture” and the authors’ inability to “verify authenticity of the patient data upon request.”</p>



<p>On August 15, Parker responded to our email saying the journal was “investigating this case carefully and have now retracted the paper due to plagiarism and concerns regarding the authenticity of the case data.”</p>

<p>A journal that lost its impact factor in June is in the midst of a cleanup operation, issuing nearly 140 retractions so far this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass retractions began over a year after sleuths <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a> and <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> first raised concerns about the presence of suspicious citations, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a> and undisclosed use of AI in the journal’s articles. </p>



<p>Cabanac and Magazinov have now flagged <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:3::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">1,850 articles</a> from the journal, Springer Nature’s <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>(<em>ESPR</em>)<em>,</em> with the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener, which </a>looks for evidence of bad practices in academic papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129849"></span>



<p><a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">Most of the flagged articles</a> ran afoul of the “Feet of Clay” detector, which looks for articles that cite retracted material. The <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a> makes use of the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, which is now part of Crossref.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 100 papers contained <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:24::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">tortured language</a>, nonstandard phrases which are sometimes the result of a rewriting extension called <a href="https://spinbot.com/">SpinBot</a>, Cabanac told us. Cabanac said the “tortured phrases” label applies only to articles with five or more occurrences to avoid false positives. “This means that a lot of <em>ESPR </em>articles are not shown,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the March 2019 paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-019-04752-8">Environmental factors affecting the frequency of road traffic accidents: a case study of sub-urban area of Pakistan</a>” states “3000 individuals kick the bucket” from road traffic accidents, rather than saying “people die,” Cabanac <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BEC3AE440265F8853400FA3556D702?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">pointed out</a> on PubPeer. The authors also used the phrases “monetary misfortunes” instead of “financial damages” and “creating nations” in place of “developing countries.” The paper was retracted in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mnsuam.edu.pk/index.php/f-members-d-a">Hafiz Mohkum Hammad</a>, the corresponding author on the article and a researcher at Muhammad Nawaz Shareef University of Agriculture in Punjab, Pakistan, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other papers seem to have been drafted with undisclosed use of AI, as was the case for the September 2023 paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-29672-6">Revitalizing our earth: unleashing the power of green energy in soil remediation for a sustainable future</a>.” Section 3 of the paper ends in the phrase “Regenerate response,” a button in ChatGPT that generates text, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/06/signs-of-undeclared-chatgpt-use-in-papers-mounting/">previously reported</a>. “Did the authors copy-paste the output of ChatGPT and include the button&#8217;s label by mistake?” Cabanac asked in his <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83DCF77815DC61C4ED6DCD88847EC4?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comment</a> calling out the mistake. The paper was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34165-1">retracted</a> in July, but the notice does not mention undisclosed AI use as a reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Kangyan Li, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In November 2022, Magazinov contacted the journal’s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.ism.u-bordeaux.fr/actualites/dr-philippe-garrigues">Philippe Garrigues</a>, a CNRS researcher based in Bordeaux, France. He called out <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.365">a paper</a> published in a different journal for which “more than a quarter of its total” citations came from <em>ESPR.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Should we suspect that referees or editors of Environmental Science and Pollution Research engage in citation extortion? Please check. No doubt your journal needs a major cleanup,” Magazinov said in the email.</p>



<p>In a follow-up email to Garrigues the next day, Cabanac introduced himself, and said the “issues Dr. Magazinov sent are really concerning; I believe they should be taken seriously.”</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/06/signs-of-undeclared-chatgpt-use-in-papers-mounting/">As previously reported</a> by Retraction Watch, Garrigues assured Cabanac the journal was taking action. “This is not over,” he wrote in French.</p>



<p>In April 2023, after no further responses from Garrigues or the journal, Cabanac alerted the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> (COPE) about “20+ papers with tortured phrases” in the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An officer from COPE emailed the journal and Springer Nature to ask if the journal was looking into the matter, and what the current status of the follow-up was.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/tim-kersjes/16338950">Tim Kersjes</a>, a research integrity advisor for Springer Nature, responded, saying the “journal and the publisher are still investigating and reviewing the matter as part of a larger investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kersjes also said the publisher would inform Cabanac “once we have made a determination for postpublication corrective action.” That was the last Cabanac heard from the journal, although COPE followed up several times in June 2023, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit frustrating when you’re pouring so many efforts in pro bono and you don’t even get feedback from the publisher,” Cabanac told us.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Since February 2024, the journal has retracted 136 papers by our count. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34599-7">most recent retraction</a> came August 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/chris-graf/16338700">Chris Graf</a>, research integrity director at Springer Nature, told us the retractions “are the result of ongoing investigations by our research integrity unit, which have also been informed by concerns raised externally.” He also said the papers were retracted for a variety of reasons, and “the use of LLMs [large language models] has not been identified in all cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identical <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34165-1">retraction notices</a> have been issued for many of the articles:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An investigation by the publisher found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references, containing nonstandard phrases or not being in scope of the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Clarivate, which calculates impact factors for journals based on citations to papers, did not give <em>ESPR </em>an updated version of the closely watched metric this year. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">At the time</a>, a representative for Springer Nature said they were “disappointed” by that decision and would investigate Clarivate’s concerns regarding the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is currently marked as “on hold” on the Clarivate website, which says “[c]oncerns have been raised about the quality of the content published in this journal” and that it is being “re-evaluated” and could be removed from the Web of Science index altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Mendelsohn, the editor-in-chief of the <em>Climate Change Economics,</em> blamed “too many citations” from <em>ESPR </em>for the suppression of his journal’s impact factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/new-research-integrity-tools-using-ai/27200740">Springer Nature recently announced plans to use</a> AI tools to detect AI-generated content and problematic images. When we asked about these tools, Cabanac said he’d be “happier” if the publishers would “hire more research integrity staff and trained them properly,” and if editorial board members were “picked more carefully.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graf also told us Springer Nature was “updating the Editors and Editorial Board” of the journal “to ensure a focus on research integrity and robust manuscript handling, and instituting a stricter special issue protocol, supported by our research integrity unit.”</p>



<p>Cabanac said he thought journals undergoing investigation should at least post a disclosure statement to warn researchers who plan on submitting to the journal. Without such a statement, he said, “most potential authors won&#8217;t know about the journal&#8217;s history and they are entitled to feel misled.”</p>

<p>A journal of the UK-based Biochemical Society is retracting 25 papers after finding “systematic manipulation of our peer-review and publication processes by multiple individuals,” according to a statement provided to Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The batch of retractions for <em>Bioscience Reports</em> is “​​the first time that we have issued this many retractions in one go for articles that we believe to be connected,” managing editor Zara Manwaring said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As academic publishing grapples with its <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">papermill</a> problem, many firms are retracting articles by the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/20/deplorable-imaging-journal-to-retract-nearly-80-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">dozens</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/02/sage-retracts-more-than-200-papers-from-journal-for-compromised-peer-review/">hundreds</a>, or even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">thousands</a> after discovering <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">foul play</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Bioscience Reports</em> already had retracted 20 papers this year, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dBioscience%2bReports">our count</a>. The latest batch means the journal’s yearly total will surpass 2023, when it pulled 32 papers, and the year before, when it pulled 26.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129875"></span>



<p>The total this year will approach the journal’s previous high of 51 retractions in 2021. The previous year, an anonymous PubPeer user <a href="https://thebiochemistblog.com/2021/05/06/papermills-in-bioscience-reports/">flagged more than 50&nbsp; articles</a> with image issues (described on <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/06/19/society-journal-biochemical-reports-ravaged/">For Better Science</a>), and the journal began <a href="https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/41/5/BSR20211016/228578/A-new-chapter-for-a-better-Bioscience-Reports">a reckoning</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the beginning of this year, the editorial office of Portland Press, the Biochemical Society’s publishing subsidiary, received an anonymous accusation of misconduct against an author with three articles in <em>Bioscience Reports</em>, according to the publisher’s statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editorial office started investigating the papers, as well as the authors’ links to other articles as co-authors or peer reviewers, and identified 22 more “that we believe to have been compromised.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher found duplicate submissions of the same manuscript, unusual author email addresses, multiple submission accounts linked to the same email addresses, high levels of similarity and similar presentation of data between manuscripts by different authors, different authors suggesting the same peer reviewers for their manuscripts, and other “suspicious patterns” described in the Committee on Publication Ethics’ <a href="https://publicationethics.org/sites/default/files/publication-process-manipulation-cope-flowchart.pdf">document</a> on systematic manipulation of the publication process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors of the journal contacted all the authors with their findings, and received seven responses contesting the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the extent of the issues identified in these papers, it was agreed that the responses from the authors rebutting our findings were unconvincing,” the publisher stated. “As the integrity of all 25 articles remain compromised in the view of the Publisher and Editorial Board, we have now proceeded with retracting the articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has emailed the corresponding authors of each paper requesting comment. We received some “address not found” messages, but no responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 25 articles, which originally appeared between 2017 and 2020, have nearly the same retraction notice, differing only in whether the authors disagreed with the retraction or didn’t respond to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/44/8/BSR-2019-0126_RET/234848/Retraction-Resveratrol-attenuates-inflammation">notices</a>, such as the one for “<a href="https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/37/2/BSR20160582/82866/Long-term-load-duration-induces-N-cadherin-down">Long-term load duration induces N-cadherin down-regulation and loss of cell phenotype of nucleus pulposus cells in a disc bioreactor culture</a>,” includes the <a href="https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/44/8/BSR-2019-0126_RET/234848/Retraction-Resveratrol-attenuates-inflammation">full list</a> of retracted articles and states: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article is one of twenty-five publications being retracted from Bioscience Reports at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Board following receipt of a notification from a reader, alerting the Editorial Office to suspected misconduct in three of these articles.</p>



<p>Following this notification, the Editorial Office has investigated the three articles in question, and identified links to a further twenty-two publications with compromised peer review, duplicated images and authorship concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles have been cited more than 450 times collectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After learning of its papermill problem in 2020, <em>Bioscience Reports</em> <a href="https://publicationethics.org/news/guest-editorial-tackling-paper-mills">changed</a> its submission and peer review policies to require authors to submit raw data for Western blots and at least one author to provide their current institutional email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The batch of articles retracted today were all submitted and accepted before those changes, Manwaring said.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging is only an indirect readout of neuronal activity via fluorescence signals. To estimate the true underlying firing rates of these neurons, methods for &#8220;spike inference&#8221; have been developed. They are useful to denoise calcium imaging data and make them more interpretable. A few years ago, I developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">CASCADE</a>, a supervised method for spike inference based on deep networks. I have been been <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">updating and maintaining CASCADE</a> ever since, and this maintenance work has been a starting point for several collaborations and friendly interactions during the last years (for example, check out this recent preprint on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.17.603957v1">spike inference from spinal cord neurons</a>).</p>

<p>Originally, the CASCADE algorithm was trained on a ground truth database that consisted primarily of recordings with GCaMP6. However, how will the algorithm perform on new indicators like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05828-9">GCaMP8</a>, with its much faster rise times? To address this question, I now trained CASCADE models on GCaMP8 ground truth and evaluated whether these models performed better than previous models. The short answer is &#8211; the retrained models performed clearly better:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently in the process of dissecting this improvement: Is it due to differences in rise times, different non-linearities or other differing properties of the two indicator families? The results of these analyses turned out to be more fascinating than I expected and therefore take more time to understand and analyze, but I&#8217;m planning to have this analysis written up within the next 3-6 months.</p>



<p>In the meantime, however, feel already free to use the new CASCADE models specifically trained with and for GCaMP8 &#8211; they really make predictions better! (And please only apply these models to GCaMP8 data; the previous models are still better for anything with GCaMP6!)</p>



<p>You will find the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Pretrained_models/available_models.yaml">new models for CASCADE</a> as usual in the list of available pretrained models. For example, instead of the GCaMP6-trained model <code>Global_EXC_30Hz_smoothing25ms</code>, indicate the GCaMP8-trained model <code>GC8_EXC_30Hz_smoothing25ms_high_noise</code> to infer spike rates with the <code>predict()</code> function of CASCADE.</p>



<p>A technical note: These models are pretrained on all available GCaMP8-ground truth, mixing together GCaMP8f, GCaMP8m and GCaMP8s. This procedure results in more robust models due to the larger ground truth database, but absolute inferred spike rates are slightly biased due to the different spike-event fluorescence amplitudes for the three indicators (-30% underestimate for GCaMP8f and GCaMP8m, +60% overestimate for GCaMP8s). In the near future, CASCADE will also include models specific for each of those indicators. These models will probably be slightly less robust but will provide less biased spike rates. However, if you are not specifically interested in very precise absolute spike rates, I would for now recommend the general GCaMP8 models that are already available. They are not only robust and very powerful but also provide a good rough estimate of absolute spike rates.</p>

<p><em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> has retracted a controversial 2023 paper on the incidence of long COVID in children after the authors discovered a raft of “coding” errors in their analysis that greatly underestimated the risk of the condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article – a research letter titled “Post–COVID-19 Condition in Children” – was written by a group of researchers in Canada led by Lyndsey Hahn, of the University of Alberta, in Edmonton. It has been cited eight times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, and garnered <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/154354403">significant attention</a> on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/incidence-of-long-covid-strikingly-low-in-children-alberta-researchers-find-1.6975858">mainstream</a> and social media sites, including by critics who said the authors fatally botched the definition of long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the authors, the incidence of long covid in kids was “strikingly low”, occurring in just 0.4% of young patients. Symptoms of infection in kids typically resolve within two weeks, they added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But those reassuring findings hinged on several errors in the analysis that made the incidence of long COVID in children look less than a third of what the researchers should have reported.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129866"></span>



<p>Per the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2822489">retraction notice</a>, signed by senior author <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/searchresults?author=Piush+J.+Mandhane&amp;q=Piush+J.+Mandhane">Piush Mandhane</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Since publication, we have identified methodological (analytical) errors in our original report that impacted our estimate of the prevalence of post–COVID-19 condition (PCC) in children and adolescents and our reported associations between pre- and post–COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One coding error led to the miscategorization of children for whom data were missing to be considered asymptomatic. Another error led to the exclusion of 15 children because of a mistaken date cut-off.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In addition, we originally reported a study sample of children between 8 and 13 years of age. We subsequently identified participants with COVID-19 (cases) who were recruited between 1 and 7.49 years and 14.5 and 19 years of age. These participants were included in the original PCC analysis. We had concluded that the incidence of PCC was 0.4% (1/271). In correcting these errors, we found that the incidence of PCC was 1.4% (4/286).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers also identified coding errors affecting their analysis of symptoms before and after infection, and in the duration of fevers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In correcting these errors, we found that pre–COVID-19 headache, fever, and fatigue were associated with post–COVID-19 symptoms of the same. However, pre–COVID-19 cough, rhinitis, and sore throat were not associated with post–COVID-19 symptoms of the same.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice concludes with an apology to the readers and editors of the journal, and states all seven authors agreed with the decision to retract the work.</p>



<p>Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta Health Law Institute – which you may recognize as the same university as the authors of the article – was co-author of a January 2024 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814314">letter to <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em></a> pointing out several flaws in the Hahn paper. Murdoch told us he and his colleagues were glad to see the retraction. With a caveat: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No, this does not address the concerns we raised, these are in fact additional errors! Dr. Mandhane&#8217;s retraction note chalked it up to coding errors, which certainly seem to exist, but there is no mention of the basic errors in the manuscript we laid out in our letter, such as changing the definition of PCC between the Introduction and Methods as I discuss in an&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BlakeMMurdoch/status/1752105777136066715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old tweet thread</a>. Also, the study authors’ response letter to us seemingly attempted to claim they used components of a definition of long covid that was not published until after the study was completed. …</p>



<p>Perhaps the authors are attempting to save face by focusing on the coding errors rather than the egregious and obvious methodological problems, such as claiming to use the WHO definition of PCC but then inventing their own.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mandhane did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>The retraction is the latest of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">more than 400</a> involving papers about COVID-19, by our count.</p>

<p><em>There once was a drug named Krebiozen;</em></p>



<p><em>It came from below the horizon.</em></p>



<p><em>It used to be said, by patients now dead,</em></p>



<p><em>Now what do we put our reliance on?</em></p>



<p>&#8211;Limerick attributed to University of Illinois president George Stoddard and University of Illinois provost Coleman Griffith, both of whom would lose their jobs over Krebiozen</p>



<p><em>It is a story that resonates with the present: A 1950s cancer treatment hoax that showed &#8220;charges of conspiracy, elitism, and un-Americanism directed against the educational, scientific, and medical establishment are nothing new; neither is uncritical news coverage of what turns out to be quackery.&#8221; We&#8217;re pleased to share an adapted excerpt from Matthew Ehrlich&#8217;s </em><a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p088117">The Krebiozen Hoax:&nbsp; How a Mysterious Cancer Drug Shook Organized Medicine</a><em>, out today. </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On March 26, 1951, one of America’s most respected scientists called a meeting at Chicago’s Drake Hotel to make a dramatic announcement: he and a Yugoslavian refugee doctor had found a drug that showed great promise in treating cancer. The scientist was Andrew Ivy, vice president of the University of Illinois (U of I) and designated spokesperson for medical ethics at the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg. Time magazine had gone as far as to pronounce him “the conscience of U.S. science.” Ivy’s Yugoslavian collaborator was Stevan Durovic, said to have discovered the new drug in Argentina after the Nazis forced him to flee his homeland. The drug itself was called Krebiozen, a name that was supposed to connote “cancer suppressor” or “regulator of growth.”</p>



<span id="more-129854"></span>



<p>Krebiozen’s unveiling electrified people around the world. Cancer sufferers and their loved ones deluged the U of I with thousands of calls and messages begging for the drug. One doctor opined that “Krebiozen may be one of the greatest, if not the greatest” discoveries in medical history. But other representatives of organized medicine were immediately suspicious. Virtually none of them had ever heard of Stevan Durovic or his brother Marko, who had followed Stevan to Chicago to promote Krebiozen. Stevan had never published in a scientific journal. The Durovics refused to reveal even to Andrew Ivy precisely how the drug was made, other than that it involved stimulating the immune systems of horses and extracting their blood. Rather than using the conventional means of announcing a new scientific discovery&#8211;through academic venues subject to rigorous peer review&#8211;Ivy had staged the equivalent of a product launch, inviting prominent politicians from Chicago and downstate Illinois along with wealthy benefactors and members of the press. Moreover, although Ivy denied any advance knowledge of it, that meeting had been promoted through a sensational news release: “The battle of medical science to find a cure for cancer achieved its realization today.” Within months, the American Medical Association (AMA) announced that its review of patient case histories had shown Krebiozen to be worthless; later, U of I president George Stoddard asserted that there was no such thing as Krebiozen.</p>



<p>Ivy and the Durovics fought back. They accused the AMA of conspiring with powerful business interests to kill Krebiozen after failing to seize control of it. Illinois lawmakers, some of whom despised Stoddard because of his liberalism and seeming highhandedness, began a lengthy set of hearings on the conspiracy charges and the state university’s possible complicity in suppressing the drug. Stoddard and U of I provost Coleman Griffith were ousted from their administrative posts. In the following years, the controversy spread beyond Illinois as groups formed across the country championing Krebiozen. Movie star Gloria Swanson raised money for the drug; environmentalist Rachel Carson took the medicine to try to fight her cancer. Pro-Krebiozen demonstrators (some wearing badges saying, “I need Krebiozen to live!”) were arrested outside the White House and bodily hauled out of federal offices. Along with members of Congress, they lobbied fiercely for what they called a “fair test” of the drug. Nevertheless, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which had just been granted expanded powers, declared that Krebiozen did nothing to stop cancer. Ivy and the Durovics were indicted on charges of defrauding people who had paid nearly ten dollars per ampule of the drug. After a nine-month trial in Chicago that ended in early 1966, the defendants were acquitted, with the verdicts tainted by accusations of jury tampering. Then Krebiozen sank back below the horizon, to be replaced by other unproven remedies purported to treat cancer and other medical ills.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Krebiozen saga shows that charges of conspiracy, elitism, and un-Americanism directed against the educational, scientific, and medical establishment are nothing new; neither is uncritical news coverage of what turns out to be quackery. And Krebiozen was in fact quackery: it displayed all the characteristics that historian James Harvey Young identified as being typical of medical fraud. Krebiozen’s sponsors exploited the fear of painful surgery and radiation to promote a nontoxic wonder remedy that they maintained was the scientific key to treating cancer. They insisted that the full details of the drug’s composition and production were a business secret. Proponents of the drug frequently compared Andrew Ivy to Louis Pasteur and other visionaries whose scientific breakthroughs were initially scorned by mainstream medicine. Krebiozen’s backers also charged that the AMA had conspired to crush the drug, charges similar to those previously leveled by such cancer quacks as Norman Baker and Harry Hoxsey. Evidence suggested that after Stevan Durovic was unable to win support for a hypertension medicine that he called “Kositerin,” he rebranded the exact same concoction as a cancer medicine called “Krebiozen”&#8211;a rebranding to adjust to circumstances. The medicine was advertised via such means as a pulp magazine trumpeting the miraculous results that cancer patients had experienced: “Doomed to die&#8211;they still live!” The drug’s supporters declared that they stood for health-care freedom, continually vexing the AMA, the FDA, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In time, according to bank records introduced at the fraud trial, Krebiozen became a multi-million-dollar enterprise.</p>



<p>The Krebiozen story was not bereft of good intentions or good ideas. Before his involvement with the drug, Andrew Ivy was the last person whom anyone would have compared with the likes of Baker or Hoxsey. Instead, he was much more like Linus Pauling, the later proponent of vitamin C as a cancer therapy. Ivy was widely acknowledged as a distinguished scientist with impeccable academic credentials. Few people suggested that he promoted Krebiozen just to get rich, in contrast with Stevan Durovic, who would be accused by the US government of extracting a vast sum of money out of the country and depositing it into overseas accounts. Ivy always would insist that he wanted only to get an impartial test of the hypothesis that he said he had developed out of the existing scientific literature: that people carried within them a natural cancer inhibitor, most likely a hormone produced by the reticuloendothelial system. (Krebiozen’s supporters said that cancer patients needed the drug to manage their conditions just as diabetics needed insulin to manage glucose levels.) Subsequent cancer research has suggested that in some ways, at least, Ivy was on the right track. Scientists have discovered the existence of tumor-suppressor genes. Studies have linked insulin and other hormones to the metabolism of cancer. And one of the most promising new areas of research and treatment&#8211;immunotherapy&#8211;harnesses the body’s natural defenses against cancer.</p>



<p>What is more, Krebiozen users were not all hapless dupes. Many of them had felt abandoned by mainstream medicine or, as in the case of Rachel Carson, had been misled by their doctors about the gravity of their conditions. For them, Krebiozen seemed a rational choice. “I’m not expecting miracles,” said Carson of Krebiozen. “As far as I’ve been able to learn it will do no harm, so what do I have to lose?” If people subsequently decided that the drug did not work for them (as turned out to be the case with Carson), they simply could stop taking it. Other cancer patients and their loved ones were convinced that Krebiozen was the one thing keeping them alive.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the end, though, Krebiozen turned out to be a hoax, regardless of whether it was planned as such. The medicine always would remain a secret remedy that was never scientifically shown to be effective. Stevan Durovic blocked efforts by federal agencies to witness the drug’s manufacture from start to finish. Patient records intended to demonstrate Krebiozen’s efficacy never met the standards set by the NCI to justify a clinical test of the drug. Eventually, Durovic and Ivy would alienate some of their most steadfast allies after they repeatedly failed to uphold their promises for Krebiozen. Still, the hoax persisted for years&#8211;so many people wanted so fervently to believe that the drug worked.</p>

<p>A physiology journal has retracted two papers after an institutional investigation found a heart researcher falsified data and figures in the articles.</p>



<p>A committee at the Ohio State University found <a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/govindasamy-ilangovan-phd">Govindasamy Ilangovan</a>, an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the school, <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_RET">falsified figures </a>and <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00395.2006_RET">reused</a> data, according to the retraction notices published in <em>Heart and Circulatory Physiology, </em>a journal of the American Physiological Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00395.2006">Heat shock protects cardiac cells from doxorubicin-induced toxicity by activating p38 MAPK and phosphorylation of small heat shock protein 27</a>,” and “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007">HSP27 regulates p53 transcriptional activity in doxorubicin-treated fibroblasts and cardiac H9c2 cells: p21 upregulation and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest</a>,” first appeared nearly 20 years ago. They have received 132 citations in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The notices detail how Ilangovan repurposed and relabelled Western blots from both published and unpublished works. One of the figures also was “inaccurate” due to “addition of false bands” in a Western blot, but the notice did not explicitly attribute the problems with the figure to Ilangovan.</p>



<span id="more-129837"></span>



<p>Anonymous commenters posted their <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/116BFBC578099B09D10B777DC40ECF">concerns</a> on PubPeer about Western blot bands in both papers. Elisabeth Bik built on one such comment by <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/30837B45AD3BECCB0774FC414D201B">pointing out</a> “identical” and “remarkably similar” lanes of in multiple Western blot figures.</p>



<p>One of the papers received a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_COR">corrigendum</a> in 2021 over a figure “published incorrectly” in the original paper. The investigation found that Ilangovan falsified the updated figure in the corrigendum, and the original “was inaccurate because of the reuse and relabeling” of a Western blot. Ilangovan did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ohio State requested the two retractions, Chris Booker, the university’s director of media and public relations, told Retraction Watch. A spokesperson for the journal declined to comment on the retractions due to “confidentiality policies and privacy considerations.”</p>



<p>The university has also requested the retraction of one additional article and is waiting for the journal to respond, Booker told Retraction Watch, but did not specify which article. The only other article of Ilangovan’s with comments on PubPeer is “<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C0671222DAAB88141BC447719CA6">Heat shock factor-1 knockout enhances cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and multidrug transporter (MDR1) gene expressions to attenuate atherosclerosis</a>” in <em>Cardiovascular Research</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The research misconduct process at Ohio State includes concurrence by university officials and an appeal by the respondent. We cannot comment further until the process is complete,” he said.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/patapoutian/">Ardem Patapoutian</a> is a neuroscientist who works on the molecular basis of sensation via mechanosensitive ion channels. In 2021, he was one of the recipients of the Nobel prize, at a relatively young age. He has since used his influence among scientists to speak out for improving academia for both research and the humans who do the research. </p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/ardemp/status/1748087857414361289">In a post on Twitter</a>, he compiled a list of 13 rules on how to do science. I strongly agreed with some aspects, disagreed with others (after all, Ardem is a scientist in a slightly different field), and felt inspired to share some thoughts about his list. I&#8217;m writing these comments also because I&#8217;m curious what I will think about my current ideas in 10 or 20 years from now. Here&#8217;s the list:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-eef9b06f222a259eeeca85df570a8e49">1. Don&#8217;t be too busy (Rule #1: No excuses. If you&#8217;re too busy, you&#8217;re not being creative).</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;d subscribe to this statement 100%.</p>



<p>As a PhD student, I had only few fixed responsibilities. Every couple of months, I started a new side-project, learned a completely new experimental technique, a new programming language, read about a new field of computational neuroscience, etc. 7 years ago, <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/news-events/articles/news.html?news=362">I gave an interview</a> about this creative process for my science. I believe that these deep dives into unknown territory are necessary for creativity. Creativity is often a combination of two influences from two different fields; in the simplest case, it&#8217;s just the application of a certain domain to another &#8211; let&#8217;s say, the use of a fancy cooking technique for the improvement of an immunohistochemistry method. Such a knowledge transfer requires not only focused work on the target method (immunohistochemistry), but also a deep knowledge about the other field (fancy cooking), which requires time, an exploratory spirit &#8211; and an appreciation for the fact that time spent understanding one domian can always be beneficial for another domain.</p>



<p>I noticed for myself that the available time that I have for such digressions became less once I became a PI, and it will become worse over time in the future. But I hope to maintain conditions in the future that won&#8217;t prevent me from staying creative!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-45635c6ba888cfce6eb7b4991ea6a5c5">2. Learn to say no (related to #1).</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s a very commonly given advice, but few people seem to follow it. &#8220;Saying no&#8221; is not only about focusing on one&#8217;s own projects and tasks, but also about saying no to the inner voices and the peer pressure. <em>You need to publish in Nature.</em> No, you don&#8217;t; don&#8217;t lose yourself while trying. <em>You need to finish your PhD with 30.</em> No, everybody at their own pace! <em>You need to have &gt;3 PhD students. </em>No, one may be just enough for some situations. <em>You need to become a professor within 5 years.</em> No, you don&#8217;t. Life outside academia has many things to offer.</p>



<p>For some people, learning &#8220;no&#8221; only seems applicable to requests from other people. But learning to say &#8220;no&#8221; to the internal voices &#8211; which are often only the internalized voices of other people, be it peers, parents or professors &#8211; can be even more important to free the mental resources for doing creative work and for doing real science.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t fully agree with that one for my field of science. In basic systems neuroscience, the relevant question is &#8220;how does the brain work&#8221;, and it cannot be approached within 5-10 years. In the meantime, from my own perspective, it seems to make more sense to find small islands of mechnistic understanding and curious observations (for example, I could pick <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan3846">behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">centripetal integration in astrocytes</a> as starting point phenomena) and continue to work from there bit by bit, even though it&#8217;s not yet clear how these questions can be answered within 10 years.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s good advice! I should do that more often.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Very good advice again.</p>



<p>I think it is very beneficial to invest a lot of energy trying to kill a project as early as possible. For example, trying to find a critical flaw in a conceptual idea before implementing it in a tedious series of experiments, and then realizing that the data cannot be analyzed properly.</p>



<p>For example, a typical situation at the beginning of an experimental systems neuroscience project is the design of a behavioral task for an animal. Will it be possible to extract the desired mental states from the acquired data, or will these states be confounded by movement or arousal of the animal? These are questions that need to be considered before, not after the experiment.</p>



<p>It happened to me already 3 times that I stopped my main scientific project (1x during my PhD, 1x during my postdoc, 1x as junior PI) because I convinced myself by theoretical arguments or by some analyses that it would not work out. And it happens much more often for smaller project.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m very skeptical about this piece of advice. Maybe I&#8217;ll think differently in 20 years. But at the moment, I have the impression that those who stay in a field and try to figure out the little details are my real scientific heros. If you&#8217;ve found a real effect, you should go for it fully and not drop it for the newest hot stuff. Otherwise, one risks joining a new field where the open questions only seem interesting from outside, the typical &#8220;hype train&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-dc59c03dc8ecfb05a9cd2a31148ce7e9">7. Ask for help &#8211; don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel.</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>As somebody who built several microscopes and data analysis pipelines from scratch, I can agree only very reluctantly. I learnt so much from reinventing these wheels! And I would be a much worse scientist without.</p>



<p>I still remember my first year of physics studies, when I did not know of any sort of theoretical neuroscience. Back then, I tried to develop a weird form of math that can deal with neuronal connectivity and dynamics. Only a year later or two, I stumbled across Dayan &amp; Abbott&#8217;s famous <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262041997/theoretical-neuroscience/">Theoretical Neuroscience</a> and learned that matrix algebra is a great and existing tool for that. But I still wonder what kind of math I would have come up with if I&#8217;d been more gifted for it and if I&#8217;d had more time without Dayan &amp; Abbott.</p>



<p>However, I also noticed that several extremely skilled scientist-tinkerers like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/systems-neuroscience/why-and-how-we-need-to-professionalize-neuroscience/">Jakob Voigt</a> and Spencer Smith (I was unable to find his blog post on this topic) turned into advocates of professional infrastructures later during their careers, advocating against the repeated reinvention wheels.</p>



<p>I still cannot decide whether the established black box button-press infractructure are more error-prone, or the code written from scratch by a very smart PhD student. From the perspective of a PhD student, it is probably better to write and build everything from scratch, because you learn more and know what is going on. From the perspective of the PhD student&#8217;s supervisor, however, it is better if an existing and tested infrastructure is used, because otherwise there is no efficient way to make sure that the results obtained by the PhD student are valid. Maybe these two different perspective are also the reason why some people change their mind once they are professors.</p>

<p>No strong opinion on that.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-705288aa7ba3704d90b8c9ca4762f6d3">9. Hire people who are smart, efficient, and kind (don&#8217;t forget about &#8220;kind&#8221;).</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>Agree. Even more important: As a PhD student, join a lab with a smart, efficient and kind PI (don&#8217;t forget about &#8220;kind&#8221;).</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I have a hard time agreeing with this rule. My best collaborations have been with people who were technically stronger than me. Collaborations with people who have only limited understanding and, in particular, limited appreciation for the skills that I bring into a collaboration, can be quite painful. But maybe I will judge collaborations from an entirely new angle in 10 years.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I noticed that senior PIs often do not have anybody (not a single person!) who tells them with all honesty when they are wrong. If such a condition is combined with a narcisstic personality of the senior PI, things can become really bad and embarrasing. I do not yet know how exactly to prevent this from happening, because it seems to happen to the best scientists, and it seems particulary common for men (less so for women according to my observations).</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I also think that reduction of anxiety is indeed important (related to #1 and #2). But I don&#8217;t have a recipe on how to reach such a state. From my own and very limited experience as an observer, the level of anxiety seems to be relatively stable for a given person within academia, independent of the position. I happen to be one of those persons who are not very anxious in general. The reason for this lack of anxiety is maybe that I&#8217;m not afraid of leaving academia, because I&#8217;m sure I would find another interesting job as well, and because my family does not have any ties with academia. But first of all, it&#8217;s probably a personality trait which I owe primarily to my genes and to my parents &#8211; and I&#8217;m grateful for that!</p>
