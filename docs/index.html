<p>In what has become a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">familiar refrain</a>, more than 30 editors and advisors of an economics journal have resigned because they felt the publisher’s need for growth would increase the “risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4md5d3oth3ap3995op7z0/public-statement-resignations-from-the-editorial-board-of-the-journal-of-economic-surveys-final.pdf?rlkey=lk43pcmovjc6yg74gfo1zaex1&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">letter</a> uploaded to Dropbox on February 7, the editors and advisors of the <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em> said: “We no longer believed that the corporate policies and practices of the Journal’s publisher, Wiley, as we perceived them through several statements made by Wiley and the draft of a new editor agreement submitted to the attention of Editors-in-Chief and Managing Editors by Wiley, were coherent with ours.”</p>



<p>Despite involving a lawyer, the now-former editors said:</p>



<span id="more-128749"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The non-negotiable documentation submitted to our analysis appeared to emphasize quantity over quality of the papers submitted and strongly favoured cross pollination among the various Wiley publications also in relation to papers that we would have not considered favourably for the Journal of Economic Surveys increasing–in our perception–risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement through a spokesperson to Retraction Watch, Allyn Molina, Wiley’s vice president of publishing development. said the company was “grateful to the leadership and dedication of the former Editors who created a strong foundation.” The journal offers an open access option, for a fee of more than <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14676419/homepage/fundedaccess.html">$4,000 per article</a>. But Molina said “this journal does not have any open access publishing targets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley proposed increasing publication output by 4% over the prior year as a goal rather than a requirement. In absolute terms, that’s an increase of 2 additional articles per year. This is supported by significant growth in submissions and a trend of emerging topics in the field.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/les.oxley">Les Oxley</a>, one of the two former managing editors in chief of the journal, said he and his colleagues had “have no comment to make” on Wiley’s statement.</p>



<p>The mass resignation joins a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a> of more than two dozen such episodes, as academic researchers battle for-profit journal publishing companies. Quoting public statements by Wiley, the editors wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley’s performance metrics for journals are “growth in submissions” and “growth in published articles”; Wiley also appears ready to affirm that “it’s all driven by volume ultimately”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company, the editors wrote, again quoting public statements, “considers it ‘important to keep authors at the center of journal strategy’” and “has an ‘Open Access (‘pay to publish’)’ business model and a ‘Cascade strategy of finding initially rejected articles another more appropriate home within Wiley’s portfolio.’”</p>



<p>Wiley told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We regularly take steps to ensure our journals are best serving the needs of the academic community. Over time, this means updating our editorial and production processes to improve the author experience, ensuring our workflows meet the needs of authors, librarians and funders, and bolstering processes to safeguard research integrity. Editors are key to making these changes happen, and our goal is always to reach common ground on changes that support the long-term success of the journal. We recognize that not all Editors will embrace these changes, and where compromise cannot be reached, it is sometimes in our mutual interest to part ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher said it “will work with the succeeding editorial team to carry on that legacy.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are currently working with members of the board and wider community to recruit new leadership for the journal. This is a fully transparent process that includes advertising and recruiting within the wider field. In partnership with the new editorial team, we plan to introduce best practice editorial workflows and broaden the journal’s scope to reflect new and emerging fields.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-wall-eurasian-reindeer-hunting-submerged">This Stone Age wall may have led Eurasian reindeer to their doom</a></h4>

              
                <p>If this underwater wall could talk, it might reveal that it once helped Stone Age Europeans hunt reindeer.</p>



<p>Submerged about 20 meters below the surface of the Baltic Sea off the coast of Germany, the wall stretches for almost a kilometer and contains nearly 1,700 stones, making it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312008121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the largest human-made megastructures in Northern Europe</a>, scientists report February 12 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</em>.</p>



<p>The team suspects it was used for hunting large prey, similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-scaled-drawing-desert-kite">ancient hunting traps in the Middle East</a> and North America (<em>SN: 5/17/23</em>). If so, it would be the first known trap of its kind in the southern Baltic region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered the structure, dubbed the Blinkerwall, while mapping seafloor depths with sonar in 2021. The data revealed odd protrusions down below, so the team returned with underwater cameras to get a better look.</p>



<p>“When we found the rocks, I realized it&#8217;s possibly not a natural process that put these rocks together,” says Jacob Geersen, a marine geologist at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde in Rostock, Germany.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that tsunamis, glaciers, ice floes or construction of nearby underwater infrastructure could have positioned the rocks into their flattened S-like shape, Geersen and colleagues say. The rocks seem to be intentionally placed, with the largest boulder (calculated to weigh over 11,000 kg, or the weight of seven mid-size cars) sitting in the middle. Most of the other rocks weigh less than 100 kg — light enough to have been moved by people to connect the larger rocks scattered along the wall’s length.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of sediment cores taken from near the Blinkerwall suggest that a lake bordered the structure around 10,000 years ago, before the Baltic Sea rose 8,500 years ago and submerged the area. The wall probably funneled Eurasian reindeer — which last occupied the area around the time the wall was built — towards the nearby lake, where the trapped prey could have been easily killed. At that time, the only people in the region who could have constructed such a large wall were nomadic hunter-gatherers, says study coauthor Marcel Bradtmöller, a Stone Age archaeologist at Rostock University.</p>



<p>The wall provides insights into how people at that time worked with the land and each other. It likely required a group of at least 10 people to use the structure to hunt, says Bradtmöller.</p>



<p>Humankind has a long history of enhancing natural topography to obtain resources, says archaeologist Geoff Bailey of University of York in England. The team’s interpretation of the findings “sounds, to me, to be very plausible,” he says.</p>



<p>Now there’s more work to do, Geersen says. He and colleagues plan to take more sediment samples from under the rocks and search for artifacts near the wall, which could reveal clues about the people who lived there.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migratory-fish-decline-un-report">Migratory fish species are in drastic decline, a new UN report details</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migratory species don’t travel with a passport, but they cross borders all the time. This makes the animals’ conservation a uniquely challenging, international effort.</p>



<p>That effort needs a lot of work, researchers argue in the <a href="https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-ever “State of the World’s Migratory Species<em>”</em> report</a> published February 12 by the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>



<p>The report is the most comprehensive tally of the over 1,000 species protected under an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals<em>, </em>or CMS. Nearly half of CMS species are experiencing population declines. Of those, fishes are faring the worst: 97 percent, roughly 56 species, are facing extinction. That includes species such as devil rays (<em>Mobula mobular</em>) and scalloped hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s that real decline in fish species that … is keeping me up at night,” said Kelly Malsch of UNEP’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre at a February 8 news conference.</p>



<p>The goal of the report is to guide priorities for CMS COP14, a meeting of global conservation leaders starting February 12 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to create new strategies for the protection of migratory species. This includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. These groups overall are faring better than fishes, but the report still shows that 1 in 5 of all the species covered by the treaty is at risk of extinction. While much of the data in the report is alarming, success stories like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">recovery of humpback whales</a> may provide ideas for protection of other species, including fishes (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Danger zone</h3>



<p>The first-ever global tally of how more than 1,000 migratory species are faring shows fishes are doing much worse than other groups such as land mammals or birds. There are a greater percentage of critically endangered (red) or endangered (orange) species of fish than of any other animal group covered by an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animal. While insects appear to be faring well, the report covers just one species — monarch butterflies (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) — and notes that their story is not so simple: While the species overall is listed as least concern, the ones that migrate are considered endangered.</p>

<p>U.N. researchers reviewed data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and found a 90 percent average decrease in the abundance of CMS-listed fishes since 1970. No other group of animals experienced an average decrease, let alone one this significant. The main culprits include bycatch (the accidental catching of fish), overfishing and pollution, the report notes.</p>



<p>The report goes beyond the species of every group already under the treaty’s protection and identifies almost 400 other species as vulnerable, including more than 200 fish species that are not yet protected — most of which have decreasing populations, like the zebra shark (<em>Stegostoma tigrinum)</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In need of protection</h3>



<p>The international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals covers just about a quarter of all migratory species. Of the remaining 3,339 species not covered by the treaty, 399 are considered either threatened or near threatened. Once again, fishes top that list.</p>

<p>“When you drill down into it, very few fish species are actually protected,” says Richard Caddell, an expert in marine and environmental law and policy at Cardiff University in Wales, who was not a part of this report. Only a few, like those heralded for caviar, are better protected than the rest, mainly for their commercial value. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Protecting migratory species on land across multiple countries is hard enough. But when it comes to animals in water, it’s a whole other beast. Most of the ocean is a mystery, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-data-unknown-oceans-sea-mountains">new environments are still being discovered</a>, making conservation efforts harder <em>(SN: 4/30/23)</em>.</p>



<p>And fish have another problem — they’re not sexy, Caddell says. Fish don’t draw conservation funding and international recognition the way gorillas and elephants and other charismatic megafauna do. “People think of a fish as being something that ends up on their plates,” he says.</p>



<p>This report might help to change that.</p>



<p>It recommends ways to protect migratory fish species from pollution and bycatch, like attaching LED lights to nets to deter certain fish. But it also keeps fishes in the spotlight, weaving the discussion of them throughout the report. By making their decline central to this report, delegates at CMS COP14 may take more notice, Caddell says.</p>



<p>“States not acting might not be [failing to protect fish species] out of malice or negligence, but out of sheer ignorance as to the true conservation status of a number of these animals, which is why a report like this is brilliant,” Caddell says.</p>



<p>More than 100 parties have signed and ratified the CMS since 1979. The United States is not one of those countries, but it has agreed to elements of the treaty focusing on marine mammals and sharks. But even for nations that have ratified the CMS, there’s no real legal penalties if they don’t follow the treaty. Instead, Caddell says reports like this new one remind those involved to do better. </p>



<p>“I think this report is a very, very welcome development,” Caddell says. “There’s an opportunity here to build a little bit of political momentum to try to think about fish in a different way. And to move away from that we&#8217;re just there to eat them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/babies-ai-learn-words-model">How do babies learn words? An AI experiment may hold clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>The AI program was way less cute than a real baby. But like a baby, it learned its first words by seeing objects and hearing words.</p>



<p>After being fed dozens of hours of video of a growing tot exploring his world, an artificial intelligence model could more often than not <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associate words — <em>ball</em>, <em>cat</em> and <em>car</em>, among others — with their images</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 2 <em>Science</em>. This AI feat, the team says, offers a new window into the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/language-heard-never-spoken-young-babies-bestows-hidden-benefit">mysterious ways that humans learn words</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>Some ideas of language learning hold that humans are born with specialized knowledge that allows us to soak up words, says Evan Kidd, a psycholinguist at the Australian National University in Canberra who was not involved in the study. The new work, he says, is “an elegant demonstration of how infants may not necessarily need a lot of in-built specialized cognitive mechanisms to begin the process of word learning.”</p>



<p>The new model keeps things simple, and small — a departure from many of the large language models, or LLMs, that underlie today’s chatbots. Those models learned to talk from enormous pools of data. “These AI systems we have now work remarkably well, but require astronomical amounts of data, sometimes trillions of words to train on,” says computational cognitive scientist Wai Keen Vong, of New York University.</p>



<p>But that’s not how humans learn words. “The input to a child isn’t the entire internet like some of these LLMs. It’s their parents and what’s being provided to them,” Vong says. Vong and his colleagues intentionally built a more realistic model of language learning, one that relies on just a sliver of data. The question is, “Can [the model] learn language from that kind of input?”</p>



<p>To narrow the inputs down from the entirety of the internet, Vong and his colleagues trained an AI program with the actual experiences of a real child, an Australian baby named Sam. A head-mounted video camera recorded what Sam saw, along with the words he heard, as he grew and learned English from 6 months of age to just over 2 years.</p>

<p>The researchers’ AI program — a type called a neural network — used about 60 hours of Sam’s recorded experiences, connecting objects in Sam’s videos to the words he heard caregivers speak as he saw them. From this data, which represented only about 1 percent of Sam’s waking hours, the model would then “learn” how closely aligned the images and spoken words were.</p>



<p>As this process happened iteratively, the model was able to pick up some key words. Vong and his team tested their model similar to a lab test used to find out which words babies know. The researchers gave the model a word— <em>crib</em>, for instance. Then the model was asked to find the picture that contained a crib from a group of four pictures. The model landed on the right answer about 62 percent of the time. Random guessing would have yielded correct answers 25 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“What they’ve shown is, if you can make these associations between the language you hear and the context, then you can get off the ground when it comes to word learning,” Kidd says. Of course, the results can’t say whether children learn words in a similar way, he says. “You have to think of [the results] as existence proofs, that this is a possibility of how children might learn language.”</p>



<p>The model made some mistakes. The word <em>hand</em> proved to be tricky. Most of the training images that involved <em>hand</em> happened at the beach, leaving the model confused over <em>hand</em> and <em>sand</em>. &nbsp;</p>

A common mistake is overgeneralizing, Kidd says, calling all adult men “Daddy,” for instance. “It would be interesting to know if [the model] made the kinds of errors that children make, because then you know it’s on the right track,” he says.</p>



<p>Verbs might also pose problems, particularly for an AI system that doesn’t have a body. The dataset’s visuals for running, for instance, come from Sam running, Vong says. “From the camera’s perspective, it’s just shaking up and down a lot.”</p>



<p>The researchers are now feeding even more audio and video data to their model.&nbsp; “There should be more efforts to understand what makes humans so efficient when it comes to learning language,” Vong says.</p>

<p>Erick Jones, the dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Nevada in Reno, is under fire for publishing a journal filled with what one academic called “<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/">bizarre” and “incoherent” articles</a>.</p>



<p>Jones founded the<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"> </a><a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"><em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em></a> in 2015 and served as the publication’s editor-in-chief until September 2022, when he <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">handed off the reins</a> to a former member of his lab. The journal notes that it requires authors to pay an “honorary” charge of $199 to publish their manuscripts.</p>



<p>Jones’s <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0931-1935">ORCID profile</a> lists 71 articles published in the journal, although an accurate count is difficult because of discrepancies in the journal’s database and the title’s PDF files. The pages of the journal were also filled with articles from his wife, his son, his students and the current editor-in-chief, along with the occasional outside submission.</p>



<p>One of Jones’s papers, published in 2022, is titled “Using Science to Minimize Sleep Deprivation that May Reduce Train Accidents.” In the two-paragraph article, Jones and his coauthors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/UsingSciencetoreducesleepdeprivationintrainworkersIONJones.pdf">note</a> that “both humans and flies sleep during the night and are awake during the day, and both species require a significant amount of sleep.” After a description of an unrelated study on fly lifespans, they conclude:</p>



<span id="more-128736"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is probable that the incorporation the findings of age-related health factors and increased sleep may lead to less train accidents. of these age factors when considering these options supply chain procedure for maintaining will be beneficial.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Jones’s other papers in the journal are also difficult to interpret. One is<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/259/257"> a statistical analysis</a> of the arrival times of planes to Dallas Fort Worth Airport on a single day, September 12, 2022, which finds that planes arrive quickly in the morning and more slowly later in the day. Another tries to link Jones’s expertise in supply chain management and radio frequency identification tags (RFID) to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/192/190">Beauty Sleep</a>.”</p>



<p>The journal is not indexed by SCOPUS or Web of Science, though the articles do appear on Google Scholar. They are also tallied on Jones’s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickcjones/"> LinkedIn profile</a> and in <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">press releases</a> about his record. Several of them have been cited in final reports submitted to the National Science Foundation and other agencies that have funded his research. Jones, a former NSF program director, currently serves on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/edu/advisory_members.jsp">the advisory committee</a> for NSF’s Directorate for STEM Education, and has received more than $700,000 in grant funding from the agency. Jones’s professional bio notes that he has “<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">garnered more than $9 million in grants and contracts</a>.”</p>



<p>Questions about the journal were first raised this week on the blog of statistician<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/"> Andrew Gelman</a>, and the controversy was covered by the student paper, <a href="https://nevadasagebrush.com/2024/02/07/unr-dean-of-engineerings-questionable-research-papers-arise/">The Nevada Sagebrush</a>, and a local news site, <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/02/unr-dean-faculty-member-accused-of-research-misconduct-over-self-published-research-articles/">This is Reno</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not a good look for the university,” says <a href="https://www.unr.edu/business/faculty-and-staff/lembke-ron">Ron Lembk</a>e, a supply chain expert at UNR’s College of Business, who was unaware of the journal’s existence until last week.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Jones did not respond to a request for an interview from <em>Retraction Watch</em>, but he defended the journal in<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851"> an online comment</a>, by stating that he does not list those publications on his resume and that he started the journal only after receiving tenure.</p>



<p>“When I started I did not expect to be an administrator just a faculty member who tried to make a difference and provide access to more applied supply chain engineering technology ideas, projects and research,” he wrote. “I standby [sic] having public access to new thought.”</p>



<p>The current editor-in-chief, Md. Mamun Habib, also failed to respond to a request for an interview but has recently taken down the train accident article and published  <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/critic">a statement</a> about the criticism on the journal’s website, where he took full responsibility for the journal’s shortcomings.</p>



<p>“While you can argue on the merits, quality, or impact of the work it is all original and we vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise,” he wrote. Habib also noted that many authors have only paid just $9.99 or nothing to publish their articles and that authors are required to disclose whether they used Chat-GPT or other artificial intelligence software to help them craft their manuscripts.</p>



<p>The journal is just one piece of Jones’s educational mini empire, which includes&nbsp; a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195">self-published book</a> and <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib">a supply chain certification program</a>.</p>



<p>The university says it is investigating the journal. “We are taking the claim seriously,” says Jessica Lozada, a spokesperson for UNR. “It is standard practice for the university to review and investigate, which we are currently in the process of doing.”</p>



<p>Jones’s son, Erick Jones Jr., who is also a prolific author in the journal and a member of the editorial board, calls the controversy “growing pains.”</p>



<p>“You can criticize the science, you can say this paper is shit, but, you know, a year from now, the papers are going to get better, and, hopefully, we can actually be a legitimate journal,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The elder Jones always had one foot in academics and one foot in business. “He takes risks, and that seems to have worked out well in his life,” says his son.</p>



<p>While working towards his PhD in industrial engineering at the University of Houston in the early 2000s, he supported himself with a job at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm best known for its role in the Enron scandal.</p>



<p>After the firm’s collapse in 2002, Jones entered the real estate business, obtaining a realtor’s license and a mortgage broker’s license, and founding his first company, PWD Groups Inc., which would morph into the publisher of his future journal.</p>



<p>At the same time, he was moving up the ranks in academia.</p>



<p>He obtained his PhD in 2003 and spent eight years as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he worked with NASA to<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080047724"> evaluate the feasibility of using radio frequency identification tags</a> (RFID) to keep track of supplies on the international space station.</p>



<p>In 2011, he joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he founded the<a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/research/centers-and-labs/raid"> RFID, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science (RAID) Laboratories</a>, attracting significant funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Transportation over the next decade.</p>



<p>Five years later, he was named Associate Dean of Graduate Affairs for the College of Engineering.</p>



<p>Then, in July 2022, he<a href="https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/engineering-dean"> accepted the dean’s job</a> at UNR, which came with a <a href="https://www.nevadafacultyalliance.org/resources/Documents/PUBLIC_DOCS/2023_UNR_Budget/UNR%202023%20vs%202022%20salaries%20top%2050%20f.pdf">$330,000</a> salary.</p>



<p>“What is exciting about having Jones as our new dean for the College of Engineering is how he clearly understands the current landscape for what it means to be a Carnegie R1 ‘Very High Research’ institution,” the provost said at the time. “He very clearly understands how we can amplify every aspect of our College of Engineering, so that we can continue to build transcendent programs for engineering education and research.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">By then, Jones had been running the <em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em> for nearly seven years.</p>



<p>Jones <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851">has stated</a> that his reason for starting his own journal was that publishing in top journals took too long and that “many in the field were not able to publish applied papers in this field in a timely fashion.”</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/2">first issue</a>, he was a coauthor on two out of the four articles the journal published. In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/3">second issue</a>, he was the primary author of all three articles.</p>



<p>One of his later articles, which is listed as one of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2028612&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">“main products”</a> of a $199,993 NSF grant, purports to use artificial intelligence to optimize the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines to vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10215577">paper</a> was edited and peer reviewed by three former members of Jones’s laboratory at UTA, and it was accepted two days after submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His work on the pandemic supply chain led the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Jones <a href="https://www.uta.edu/news/news-releases/2021/08/20/erick-jones-fellowship">to select</a> Jones to serve as a Jefferson Science Fellow, advising the chief economist of the U.S. State Department in 2021 and 2022.</p>



<p>After moving to UNR, Jones led a “<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">competitive search</a>” to find a new editor-in-chief for the journal, considering candidates across industry and academics before settling on Mamum Habib, a former visiting scientist in his own lab, according to a press release from the journal. (Jones and Habib also worked together on the <a href="https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/index"><em>International Journal of Supply Chain Management</em></a>,<a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/"> </a>which is published by a company that was listed on <a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/">Beall’s list of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers.</a>)</p>



<p>Jones’s wife, Felicia Jefferson, who recently joined UNR’s Department of Biochemistry and Biology, has also published articles connecting supply chain management to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/256">Deer Season</a>,” “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/30/28">Healthy Hair</a>,” and “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/257">Dragon Fly Research</a>,” which consists of seven sentences about fruit fly sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has recently been awarded <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2341551&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">$299,323</a> from NSF to use artificial intelligence to conduct research on sleep in rural communities, following a theme she has developed&nbsp; in various papers she coauthored with Jones, including those about beauty sleep and train accidents.</p>



<p>“The lab, PI, Dr. Jefferson sees her lab as a smaller more focused version of a NSF scaled ERC center, which focuses on heart disease research through tissue regeneration,” she and Jones write in <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/283/278">another recent article</a>. “Jefferson lab is more focused on AI models in biology that simulate sensor stimulation of brain cells.”</p>



<p>Jefferson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Erick Jones Jr., who was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington just as his father was departing, argues that the journal is a valid avenue to get new ideas out and to help students publish.</p>



<p>“It’s helped me in my career, not for building up my publication record, but just starting conversations,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s undoubtedly a valued part of his father’s business portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal<a href="https://www.iscea.org/journals"> is one of two affiliated with</a> the International Supply Chain Education Alliance, an Ohio corporation which was founded in 2003 and bills itself as “the first organization certifying supply chain professionals around the globe” with thousands of members.</p>



<p>Jones has been involved with the organization for many years and was<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib"> elected</a> president of the company’s standards board in 2020, when the journal first appeared on the company’s website.</p>



<p>Students who<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rfidscp-rfidscm-tickets-139093673923"> spend $1,499</a> for Jones’s three-hour RFID certification course receive a free copy of<a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195"> his book</a>, which is published by the PWD Group.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2024/02/10/exploitation-of-footballer-analytics.html">Exploitation of footballer analytics</a></h4>

              
                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Edward Wakelam will give a talk entitled &quot;Exploitation of footballer analytics&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There is growing on-going research into how footballer attributes, collected prior to,
during and post-match, may address the demands of clubs, media pundits and gaming
developers. These attributes include static, such as age and height, or dynamic, such as
pass completions and shots on target. Many are objectively measured, such as goals scored
or pass interceptions, but in some cases they are subjectively measured by observers, such
as quality of passing or athleticism. A handful of databases are available to clubs to be
used to assess transfer targets or to assess their current players, however even elite
clubs are failing to exploit this data. Additionally, there is limited application of AI
and Machine Learning methods to exploit the wealth of data available. Critically, very few
of the attributes address character traits, despite their use by the commercial world for
130 years and some well publicised problem player recruitment. I will present an analysis
of the data available collected from available research over the past 25 years,
identifying the mix of static vs dynamic and objective vs subjective data, and draw
attention to the limited character trait content of the data. I will discuss the likely
reason for this and how clubs may develop this dimension of their player analytics.</p>

                A slalom skier just achieved a remarkable result in the Alpine Ski World Cup—coming from last place to win. As mountains get warmer and conditions less predictable, expect more freak occurrences like this.

                <p><br>We&rsquo;re pleased to once again <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our annual </a>reporting from the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a> to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities and operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS has participated in the framework since its pilot phase in 2020 and we&rsquo;ve made all of our reporting transparently available through our blog. As the framework has been largely unchanged from previous years, we aim to keep this update short, but encourage you to look back at our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/">original post</a> for more detail on the categories Plan S provides for allocation, as well as key differences between our journal models.</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency Data 2022</strong></p>



<p>As indicated in the table below, publishers completing the framework are asked to provide the percentage of their Article Processing Charge (APC), per journal associated with eight different categories in order to demonstrate how journals value the allocation of services they provide. The data in the table below reflects the reporting we provided to the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/journal-comparison-service/">Journal Comparison Service</a> at the end of 2023 covering the year 2022 and is based on the publication fee for a Research Article in each journal at that time. You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kbuocrmHRKe_J6gsP1zto-VtZFwSKr4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s changed in 2022?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>New to our reporting this year is the inclusion of <em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Global Public Health, PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water </em>which launched in 2021 but did not begin publishing articles until late that year (in the case of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>) or 2022 for the other titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve highlighted in previous posts, differences in journal editorial structures and services drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated to each category and you&rsquo;ll see that in the breakdown of the new journals. We have also allocated a greater percentage of the APC to &ldquo;Journal Community Development&rdquo; which reflects activities such as editorial board and scope development which are critical to a new journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Not every PLOS author pays an APC</strong><br><strong><br></strong>The numbers above are based on the standard publication fee for each journal, however, it is an important focus for PLOS to expand opportunities for Open Access publishing beyond the dominant APC model. Each of our journals offer institutional partnership models that can significantly reduce or entirely eliminate publication fees for authors. These models each work a little differently to suit the needs of specific journal communities: redistributing the costs of selective publishing more fairly, more equitably accounting for regional economic differences, or simply streamlining APC support. We&rsquo;ve seen consistent growth in partnerships since we launched our first new models in 2020. In 2022 our institutional <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">partnerships nearly doubled </a>to include 181 institutions across 26 countries and we&rsquo;re continuing to invest in growing this support system.</p>



<p>Authors whose funder and institution are based in a Research4Life country are able to publish in PLOS journals for free, or significantly reduced publication fee (details can be found on our <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">website</a>). We also offer publication fee assistance to support authors accepted for publication at one of our journals who demonstrate a lack of funds to pay their publication fees.</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>The price transparency framework provides an objective tool to compare APC breakdowns across publishers. What can get lost in this framework is the detail of those services themselves. As a nonprofit organization, PLOS works alongside researchers and research stakeholders to transform scholarly communication. In each of the broad categories provided by the framework, there are a number of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/">activities</a> and decisions about <em>how </em>we work that drive forward our mission to make scholarly communication more open, equitable, and fair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, our highly regarded publishing ethics team works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by providing career-building resources and educational tools for Open Science. We are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science best-practices</a> across our organization and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">collaborating globally</a> to increase awareness of the benefits of Open Science and co-create pathways that enable more researchers to make their work open. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-sense-temperature-prosthetic-hand-touch">A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new device makes it possible for a person with an amputation to sense temperature with a prosthetic hand. The technology is a step toward prosthetic limbs that restore a full range of senses, improving both their usefulness and acceptance by those who wear them. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A team of researchers in Italy and Switzerland attached the device, called ”MiniTouch,” to the prosthetic hand of a 57-year-old man named Fabrizio, who has an above-the-wrist amputation. In tests, the man could identify cold, cool and hot bottles of liquid with perfect accuracy; tell the difference between plastic, glass and copper significantly better than chance; and <a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(23)00404-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort steel blocks by temperature</a> with around 75 percent accuracy, researchers report February 9 in <em>Med</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s important to incorporate these technologies in a way that prosthesis users can actually use to perform functional tasks,” says neuroengineer Luke Osborn of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who was not involved in the study. “Introducing new sensory feedback modalities could help give users more functionality they weren’t able to achieve before.”</p>



<p>The device also improved Fabrizio’s ability to tell whether he was touching an artificial or human arm. His accuracy was 80 percent with the device turned on, compared with 60 percent with it off. “It’s not quite as good as with the intact hand, probably because we’re not giving [information about] skin textures,” says neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p>



<p>Work to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-prosthetic-leg-senses-touch-reduces-phantom-pain">restore a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs</a> has advanced greatly over the past decade (<em>SN: 9/9/19</em>). But the ability to detect temperature has lagged behind. “Temperature is almost the last modality that needs to be solved in order to then put all the results together and be able to make an artificial limb really feel as the biological one,” says EPFL engineer Jonathan Muheim.</p>



<p>The study builds on work the group published last May, which found that people who have had amputations often have spots on their residual limbs that, when heated or cooled, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf6121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate temperature sensations in their missing hand</a>. It’s caused by stimulating nerves originally destined for the missing hand. The researchers showed they could reliably elicit phantom temperature sensations over time in 63 percent of amputees.</p>



<p>In the new study, Shokur, Muheim and colleagues first mapped Fabrizio’s phantom temperature sensations to match a spot on his arm to the corresponding sensation in the index finger of his missing hand. They then attached a temperature sensor to the fingertip of his prosthetic hand, which was connected via a controller unit to a device on Fabrizio’s arm that delivered appropriate temperature signals.</p>

<p>Currently the device employs only one sensor at the end of the index finger, but the team plans to add sensor-stimulator pairs to create more temperature-sensitive locations on the prosthetic hand. They are also planning to develop a prosthesis that combines the ability to sense touch as well as temperature. “In the coming year or so, hopefully that’s where we’ll be,” says Shokur.</p>



<p>The speed at which the device relays temperature may become an issue when combining multiple senses. Osborn and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01070-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have developed a device</a> as thin as a Band-Aid that delivers realistic cooling sensations nearly as quickly as natural responses, that team reported in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em> last July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the immediate term, the new device needs to be tested in larger groups of participants, as well as real world settings, to ensure it isn’t adversely affected by high air temperatures or humidity. “We still need to do those crash tests outside the lab,” says Shokur.</p>



<p>Once it leaves the lab, Fabrizio already knows how he’d put it to use. &#8220;With these new technologies, I can understand better what I am touching,” Fabrizio said in a prerecorded video interview. “Certainly, my priority would be to use it in a kitchen&nbsp;to&nbsp;cook.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-internet-communication-rover-psyche">How to build an internet on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When astronauts land on Mars, a couple of decades from now, perhaps, they’ll need to find a way to communicate — with each other, with equipment on and around the planet, and with mission control back on Earth. Despite living so far from home, they’ll no doubt want to connect with loved ones, keep their playlists up-to-date or stream the latest episodes of their favorite shows.</p>



<p>But setting up a Wi-Fi connection to Earth’s internet won’t be an option. Earth is simply too far away — around 55 million to 400 million kilometers, depending on where the planets are in their orbits. Spacefarers will need another strategy.</p>



<p>Establishing a good communications infrastructure is essential for human missions to Mars, says Claire Parfitt, a systems engineer with the European Space Agency, or ESA, who is based in Noordwijk, Netherlands. “At the moment, we’re in the early stages of working out what that means.”</p>



<p>Researchers are testing ways to upgrade existing networks, along with some far-out alternatives. For example, NASA’s Psyche mission, which lifted off in October with the job of <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploring an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter</a>, will also test interplanetary communication using lasers. Lasers could carry far more data than the radio waves that have been used from the earliest days of space travel.</p>



<p>No known strategies can get rid of the time lag in communications between Earth and Mars; a message moving at the speed of light takes anywhere between four and 24 minutes for a one-way trip. In other words, a quick ping to mission control is out of the question, not to mention a WhatsApp call home.</p>



<p>There’s also the issue of solar conjunction, says Parfitt, when the sun comes between Earth and Mars. This happens for a couple of weeks every two years or so, cutting off communications between the planets. The last one took place in November.</p>



<p>But new approaches could open possibilities that make communications on Mars more akin to what we experience here on Earth. At least one research team has wondered: What if Mars had its own internet?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How Mars communication works today</h4>



<p>Several space agencies have landers, rovers and satellites already at Mars that have to communicate with Earth.</p>



<p>Consider NASA’s Perseverance rover. It sends and receives two kinds of information. One is command and telemetry, where operators on Earth send instructions, receive information and make decisions on what to do next. Percy typically receives over 1,000 commands from Earth every day. The second is the science data — pictures of Martian rocks, for example — that Percy collects. The <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/379/nasas-ingenuity-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helicopter Ingenuity</a>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-ends-mission">ended its mission earlier this year</a>, also regularly pinged the rover, which served as a base station to relay data and commands between Ingenuity and Earth. Orbiters circling the planet, including <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Mars Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>, or MRO, and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars/Trace_Gas_Orbiter_instruments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter, or TGO</a>, similarly send science data back home.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Calling Earth</h3>



<p>Perseverance and other Mars rovers get most commands directly from Earth via X band radio waves. Though Percy can send small amounts of data directly, it often uses ultrahigh-frequency, or UHF, radio waves to transmit data to one of the orbiters in the Mars Relay Network, which have big antennas for sending data to Earth. Percy also served as a base station for communication with the helicopter Ingenuity.</p>

<p>A lot of the communication with Mars is routed through the Mars Relay Network in what NASA describes as “a tightly choreographed dance.” This network of five orbiters around Mars — MRO, TGO, MAVEN, Mars Odyssey and Mars Express — transmits information via antennas pointed toward Earth.</p>



<p>A rover that needs to send its latest observations back to Earth first passes the data along to one of the orbiters using ultrahigh-frequency radio transmissions. If that orbiter doesn’t have a line of sight to Earth, it can hold on to the information until it does. The data are then relayed toward Earth, where powerful radio antennas distributed across the globe are always listening for pings from deep space.</p>



<p>Once a human crew lands on Mars, this system will not be good enough. Vincent Chan, a researcher in fiber-optic and satellite communications at MIT, doesn’t foresee local, on-the-ground communication as a challenge. A Martian crew can interact using radio frequency and existing wireless technologies, he says. Two mini cell towers would be enough when the astronauts are close together, and a relay of some kind could be used when the astronauts are far enough apart that messages have to be sent over the horizon. People living in remote regions of Earth communicate in a similar way all the time. “Those services are already in play,” Chan says, and “very economical.”</p>



<p>A big antenna on the crew’s landing vehicle, pointed toward Earth, would probably be the very first infrastructure Martian explorers would set up, Chan says, but then things could get more challenging. When that ground-based antenna doesn’t have a direct line of sight, astronauts could use orbital relays akin to the Mars Relay Network to communicate with Earth. Several orbiters would have to be available for round-the-clock coverage, and they’d need to be optimized for heavy data transfer.</p>



<p>ESA is currently looking at making today’s relay network more robust. It is in the early stages of considering a concept called the Mars Communication and Navigation Infrastructure, or MARCONI. If it moves forward, the project will develop a set of communication- and navigation-related payloads that could piggyback on any mission headed to Mars.</p>



<p>Once deployed into orbit, these payloads would act as nodes to provide radio communication on and with Mars, Parfitt explains. They could then stick around for use on future missions. “The more mass you land, the more expensive it is, so you wouldn’t necessarily want to land massive communication systems on Mars every time,” she says.</p>



<p>Though traditional radio frequencies would suffice for low data rates, using a laser link could carry 10 to 100 times as much data in the same time frame. Because of the higher frequencies of optical waves, hundreds of thousands of times those of radio waves, much more information can be packed in. Thus, this type of optical signal is just where space communication may be headed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laser communication in space</h4>



<p>The Psyche spacecraft, launched last October, will test the feasibility of long-distance laser communications as it heads toward Psyche, the metal-rich asteroid it’s going to explore. The spacecraft carries NASA’s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission/deep-space-optical-communications-dsoc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Space Optical Communications</a>, or DSOC, technology.</p>



<p>Using lasers for space communication isn’t new, but they have never been tested from distances farther than the moon. In mid-November, Psyche beamed data to Earth <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-deep-space-optical-comm-demo-sends-receives-first-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a distance of 16 million kilometers</a> — 40 times farther than the moon. In December, it <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tech-demo-streams-first-video-from-deep-space-via-laser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a video of a cat named Taters</a> from 31 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>ESA is also exploring long-distance optical communication. One program called ScyLight, short for Secure and Laser Communication Technology and pronounced <em>skylight</em>, is <a href="https://connectivity.esa.int/artes-40-scylight-overview-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting the research and development of optical and quantum technologies</a> for secure and fast data communication from space.</p>



<p>Despite the benefits, optical communication requires ultraprecision in aiming the signal. Unlike radio communications, optical signals are sent in a narrow beam that has to point exactly at the receiver. What’s more, cloud cover and atmospheric effects also interfere with lasers.</p>



<p>Any shift toward optical communications would mean <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-new-experimental-antenna-tracks-deep-space-laser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some upgrades to the existing radio antennas</a> that listen for messages from deep space — called the Deep Space Network — or new infrastructure.</p>



<p>Though it’s closer than Mars, the moon offers learning opportunities for future connectivity. As part of the Artemis program, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">aims to return humans to the moon</a>, NASA has contracted private companies to set up a lunar 4G&nbsp;network for telecommunications. Such networks are based on radio waves and would include installing antennas and base stations that can withstand the harsh lunar landscape.</p>



<p>An ESA program called Moonlight invites private space companies to set up a constellation of communication satellites around the moon, including for regions that don’t have direct visibility to Earth. The first phase of the program includes the launch of the Lunar Pathfinder orbiter, currently planned for 2026.</p>



<p>“Everything that is being done for the moon, it’s got the objective of taking humans and missions to Mars,” says Tomas Navarro, who is based in London and is a future projects engineer with ESA.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An internet on Mars</h4>



<p>Those Martian explorers, not to mention future inhabitants, will no doubt want to do more than send messages back and forth. They’ll want a setup akin to Earth’s internet, which we use for everything from sharing photos to accessing massive databases. In June 2023, Tobias Pfandzelter and David Bermbach of Technische Universität Berlin proposed that a fleet of satellites orbiting Mars could provide the Red Planet with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own offshoot internet</a>.</p>



<p>Most of us here on Earth access the internet through our phones using radio-frequency radiation on either wireless 4G or 5G networks or through Wi-Fi routers. These connections are linked via fiber-optic cables around the world. The proposed Mars network would instead be similar to Starlink, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">a constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit</a> operated by SpaceX. On Earth, broadband internet and mobile phone coverage via satellite is expensive, but on Mars, such a system might be cheaper and easier to build than an expansive and robust network on the ground.</p>



<p>Pfandzelter and Bermbach are both experts in cloud computing — the delivery of computing services over the internet. For their proposed Martian internet, they extrapolated concepts from edge computing, in which information is processed close to where it is collected.</p>



<p>Michael Clegg, a general manager at the technology company Supermicro, based in San Jose, Calif., has explained edge computing <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/7/edge-computing-explained-plain-english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the analogy of a popular pizza restaurant</a> “that opens smaller branches in more neighborhoods, since a pie baked at the main location would get cold on its way to a distant customer.” Edge computing generally relies on base stations on the ground to store and relay the data, but low Earth orbit satellites are now being seen as an alternative.</p>

<p>Pfandzelter and Bermbach concluded that a constellation of 81 low-orbit satellites around Mars would be good enough for planetwide coverage. They would provide a local communications system that would be an extension of Earth’s internet.</p>



<p>Consider an astronaut on Mars trying to catch up on a Netflix show. “If you were to stream it from Earth, you would have to first wait 10, 15 or even 40&nbsp;minutes,” Pfandzelter says, and that’s just to connect. It would be a frustrating stop-and-start affair. And if another astronaut on Mars wanted to watch the same movie, they have to go through the same process all over again.</p>



<p>Instead, a cloud data storage system on Mars could make movies easy to access. “You could just have the same experience that you have on Earth, because all your data is locally copied,” he says. Meanwhile, other uploads and downloads to and from Earth, such as science data, could continue in the background.</p>



<p>Putting internet satellites into orbit around Mars would also be economical because it wouldn’t require landing infrastructure on the surface; landing equipment can make up a big chunk of a mission’s budget. “It would be much cheaper to just send a bunch of networking satellites to Mars, and just keep them in orbit,” says Pfandzelter.</p>



<p>It’s similar to a scaled-up version of the MARCONI concept (and could use radio or optical waves, depending on the state of those technologies).</p>



<p>Even if arrival on Mars is decades away, Parfitt says, it’s not too soon to start planning. Live video-chatting between planets is out of the realm of scientific possibility. Unless there is a major upheaval in the laws of physics, messages won’t ever be able to travel faster than the speed of light. “It’s not a problem to be solved. It’s just a problem.”</p>



<p>But other limitations can be overcome. Tackling those challenges may not only benefit future astronauts on Mars but may also help get them there sooner.</p>



<p>“When you put in an infrastructure like that,” Parfitt says, “you see many, many more missions being proposed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-bites-attack-2023">Here’s how many shark bites there were in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the sensationalized portrayal of sharks in movies like <em>Jaws</em>, the ocean’s apex predators have far more to fear from people than vice versa.</p>



<p>Even though millions of people around the world swim in the ocean each year, just 91 people were bitten by sharks in 2023 and only 10 of those bites were fatal, according to a new report from the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. Out of all bites, 69 were unprovoked while 22 were provoked, defined as a human-initiated interaction such as trying to touch or feed a shark. These numbers — reported by beach safety officers, hospital staff and other emergency responders — are consistent with the five-year global average.</p>



<p>The fact that so few bites occur each year “gives us a pretty strong indication that sharks are trying to avoid us,” says Joe Miguez, a marine ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who compiled data for the report. If sharks thought humans were prey, he says, there might be &#8220;thousands of shark attacks each day.”</p>



<p>In 2023, more than half of unprovoked shark bites happened in the United States, with a total of 36. That’s down from 41 the previous year. Following long-term trends, nearly one-quarter of all unprovoked bites globally occurred in Florida. This is due to the state’s ample coastline, abundant prey fish and year-round human swimmers.</p>



<p>One uptick in 2023 was fatalities, at 10 — double the amount in 2022. But put in historical perspective, shark bite fatalities are actually decreasing, on average, as people respond more quickly and effectively to treat bite wounds, says shark biologist Neil Hammerschlag, founder of <a href="https://atlanticsharkexp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic Shark Expeditions</a> in Boutiliers Point, Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>&#8220;These fatalities usually aren&#8217;t a result of a shark eating someone. It&#8217;s a result of blood loss,” says Hammerschlag, who was not affiliated with the report. Sharks use their teeth much like humans use their hands, he says, as sensory structures to test their environment.</p>



<p>Notably, of the nearly 550 known species of sharks, only three caused fatalities in 2023: great white sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>), bull sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) and tiger sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>).</p>



<p>Four of the 10 fatalities last year were caused by great whites: three in southern Australia and one in California. This is probably because “pockets of white shark populations are growing,” particularly in areas where seals, a main food source for sharks, have rebounded from near extinction, says Gavin Naylor of the University of Florida.</p>



<p>Seal colonies are often found near surf breaks, which also attract surfers. “Going forwards, it&#8217;s likely that these bites from white sharks might be a little bit more commonplace” as more people surf and shark populations continue to grow, says Naylor, a shark population geneticist and program director of the university’s <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Shark Attack File</a>.</p>



<p>The intent of compiling shark bite data is two-fold, Naylor says: to protect people from sharks and to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-we-need-predators">help these keystone predators thrive</a> (<em>SN: 9/17/15</em>). Shark populations have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03173-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plummeted by more than 70 percent</a> globally over the past half century, due mainly to increased fishing pressure that’s depleted their food sources.</p>



<p>“These ancient creatures have been on the planet 100 times longer than humans,” Naylor says, and have “magical tricks” — such as many shark species’ ability to move from saltwater to freshwater — that can teach us a lot about how other creatures survive.</p>



<p>While the odds of being bitten by a shark are incredibly slim, Naylor offers <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/reduce-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple advice for avoiding shark bites</a>: “Don’t swim alone. Don&#8217;t swim too far from shore. Don’t swim at dawn or dusk.”</p>

<p>An Indian paper mill featuring prominently in our <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">recent investigation</a> in <em>Science</em> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">a companion piece</a> on our website shut down its WhatsApp community six days after the stories ran, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The company, called iTrilon, used the messaging platform to hawk authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals.” It claimed to have connections at journals that allowed the mill to guarantee acceptance of most of its papers.</p>



<p>But on January 24, <a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww">Sarath Ranganathan</a>, iTrilon’s scientific director, deactivated the WhatsApp community he had been curating.</p>



<span id="more-128723"></span>



<p>“That’s big,” said Siddhesh Zadey, a PhD student at Columbia University and co-founder of the India-based <a href="https://www.asarforindia.org/">think tank ASAR</a>, who joined the iTrilon community last year and was a key source for our investigation. “I think it took [Ranganathan] about two years to build such a large group on WhatsApp.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/24_JUN_23_SZ_IMG-20230624-WA0018.jpg">an infographic</a> from last May, the Chennai-based company at the time had published “219+ papers” for clients in “21+” countries. The size of its WhatsApp community is not clear, but it likely exceeded 1,024, the maximum number of members in a WhatsApp “group.” In the platform’s terminology, a “community” is a collection of “groups.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company has also taken down <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">its website</a> and LinkedIn profiles.</p>



<p>Ranganathan did not answer calls to his WhatsApp number.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593129722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Moon</a><br><em>Rebecca Boyle</em><br><em>Random House, $28.99</em></p>



<p>Science journalist Rebecca Boyle has an intergenerational connection with the moon. Her grandfather Pfc. John J. Corcoran was involved in the 1943 Battle of Tarawa on the namesake atoll in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. The United States’ narrow victory against Japan came at heavy human cost. One reason: A weak high tide forced American soldiers to wade through the ocean into Japanese gunfire rather than sail their boats to meet their enemies.</p>



<p>Historians blame the moon for the massive casualties — the battle occurred during a time of month when the sun’s and moon’s gravitational tugs partially cancel each other out, contributing to the lower-than-usual high tide.</p>



<p>Boyle, however, recognizes that the moon’s impact on humankind is far more vast and multifaceted. After all, the moon helped shape Earth into the home we know, she writes in her new book, <em>Our Moon</em>. At the outset, Boyle promises to convince readers of the moon’s extensive influences, both biological and spiritual. Over nearly 300 pages, she delivers.</p>



<p>Naturally, the book touches on well-known subjects, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/core-memory-weavers-navajo-apollo-raytheon-computer-nasa">the Apollo missions</a> that brought humans to the lunar surface (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>). Still, the book is guaranteed to surprise, filled with factoid gold that will enthrall geologists, moon nerds and casual readers alike. For instance, Boyle incorporates new research on how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-formed-moon-earth-mantle">moon formed 4.5 billion years ago</a>, pointing to geologic evidence that may still be entombed deep within Earth’s mantle (<em>SN: 11/1/23</em>). And contrary to what Apollo photos suggest, the moon’s surface sparkles with technicolor hues, astronauts reported. “The Moon was not gray, but a landscape flecked with color,” Boyle writes. “Analysis of the Moon rocks has since found volcanic glass in every color of the spectrum.”</p>



<p>And then there are the ways the moon has influenced life on Earth. The tides pulled our ocean-confined ancestors out of the water. Extremes between high and low tides in the distant past kept beaching marine life; those that could breathe in air or developed limbs for walking became the earliest landlubbers. Acting as a mini counterweight to the Earth’s own heft, the moon has kept our planet’s axis from lurching all over the place, thereby preventing extreme climate swings over millennia. The moon also inspired the first religions, and its study spawned the first science.</p>



<p>Boyle packs in an impressive amount of information. But instead of throwing details at the reader, she packages them into imagined experiences of a lunar visitor. The result is a rich travelog that makes the moon’s sensations visceral, down to its acrid smell and the hay fever you’d get from exposure to pesky <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-wears-dusty-cloak">lunar dust</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/13</em>). Early humans brought the distant moon down to Earth through patient observation and art. Now, Boyle brings readers up there.</p>



<p>With much ground to cover, she divides the book into three sections: the moon’s making, its cultural footprint and how modern society recast the moon in a new light. Rather than adhering to a strict chronology, Boyle roams under these three broad umbrellas. Her discussions within each section come in palatable bite sizes and swing between the ancient and modern, culture and science.</p>



<p>That masterful weaving is on display when Boyle recounts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-time-calendar-ancient-human-art">the moon’s role in keeping track of time</a> (<em>SN: 7/9/19</em>). “Time confers power to whoever commands it,” she writes, and it remains “the simplest and most predictable way to seize that command.” Stone Age Scots, Mesopotamians and Native Americans understood the power of the lunar cycles, and they erected monuments to track the moon’s trek across the sky. But around 45 B.C., Julius Caesar designed a calendar that banished the moon from its timekeeping duties. Now, society mostly looks to the sun as our daily metronome.</p>



<p>Today, we’re at another juncture where the moon might further drop from its standing of reverence and communion. Soon, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">astronauts will return there</a>, with the United States, China and other countries scoping out landing sites <em>(SN: 11/16/22</em>). Instead of being endeavors for the benefit of all humankind, these explorations will probably be a nationalistic race for scientific real estate, Boyle warns. Our heavenly neighbor is also being eyed as a mining outpost, a junkyard, a waystation for deep space travel or a settlement destination. The moon, she worries, may fall into the ravenous maw of capitalism.</p>



<p>Still, the moon is more than just another target for humankind’s material ambitions. <em>Our Moon</em> reminds us that our “silvery sister” has given us our habitable climate, sciences and cultures. These gifts are more than enough; they are priceless.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/new-neural-implant-translates-brainwaves-into-words-for-natural-communication">New neural implant translates brainwaves into words for natural communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a future in which individuals can regain the ability to communicate almost naturally through a brain-computer interface. In a new development, a team of Duke University researchers has unveiled a cutting-edge speech prosthetic that holds promise for individuals suffering with speech-impairing neurological disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The prosthetic features 256 brain sensors on a small, flexible piece of medical grade plastic, and aims to convert neural signals from the speech motor cortex into realistic speech using both these high-density sensors and machine learning. The study included four participants, all with some form of pre-existing motor disorders, such as ALS, and were subsequently undergoing brain surgery. The researchers collaborated with surgeons during the surgery, implanting the device in participants' brains as they engaged in a speech repetition task. During this task, participants heard unfamiliar/nonsensical words, such as “Yak”, and were instructed to repeat them. The speech prosthetic recorded activity from the brain as participants coordinated the muscles involved in speech, acting as a tool to capture and decode related brain signals, and translating this intended speech into audible words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the initial trials, the prosthetic demonstrated an impressive 40% accuracy in converting brain signals into ‘spoken words’. The algorithm uses this data to predict the intended speech sounds based on the brain activity recordings. What makes this achievement notable is that the interface achieved this level of accuracy with just 90 seconds of data, a significantly shorter duration compared to the extensive datasets typically required by other existing methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we apply this?</strong></p>

<p>In the future, research on these types of prosthetics could revolutionise current assistive technologies for individuals with speech-impairing neurological disorders. This device promises faster and more natural verbal communication than through neural speech prostheses. With 256 high-density brain sensors on a flexible substrate and machine learning adaptability, it provides a more comprehensive and personalised communication experience than conventional methods. Its future integration with communication aids might enable real-time speech decoding, fostering dynamic conversations and accommodating larger vocabularies. Furthermore, the researchers aim to develop this research further and create a cordless device for speech deciphering.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What challenges need to be overcome?</strong></p>

<p>While this innovative technology represents a significant leap forward from existing communication aids. The main hurdle for future advancements lies in addressing the current decoding speed, which falls behind natural speech and achieves an accuracy level of approximately 40%. However, at present the researchers are optimistic about possibilities of refining the technology to match the rapid pace of natural speech, bringing it closer to mainstream availability, and potentially transforming the lives of those with speech-related challenges.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-scorpion-live-ants-carries-hitchhikers-animals">The first known scorpion to live with ants carries mini hitchhikers</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of an April night in Israel’s Jordan Valley, Yoram Zvik sweeps a UV light over the dark ground near throngs of marching ants. The light passes over the brilliant blue-green fluorescence of a scorpion clambering alongside the ant trail. Peering closer, Zvik — a scorpiologist at the University of Haifa — sees black specks on the scorpion’s glowing back. But they aren’t dirt or sand. They’re alive, and unlike their venom-tailed transport, the stowaways don’t fluoresce under UV light, which betrays their location.</p>



<p>The millimeter-long creatures (about one-twentieth the length of the scorpions) are pseudoscorpions. They have eight legs and claws like their much larger arachnid relatives but lack a stinging tail. Pseudoscorpions commonly get around by hitching rides on much larger animals such as bats, birds and beetles. Zvik’s nighttime discovery <a href="https://doi.org/10.30963/aramit6605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveals for the first time</a> that scorpions can act as the transport too. <br><br>The finding, reported in December in <em>Arachnologische Mitteilungen: Arachnology Letters</em>, is just the latest illustration of how ant nests are miniature ecosystems. Well-defended by ant armies and loaded with food, no wonder the scorpions and their hangers-on want to move in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zvik first got an inkling of this network of tiny tenants in 2016. Searching for <em>Birulatus israelensis</em> scorpions in the wild, he found them walking along trails made by foraging <em>Messor</em> harvester ants. Zvik and colleagues <a href="https://arages.de/10.5431/aramit5404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspected that the scorpions were living within the ant colonies</a>. Ants in the colony don’t seem to recognize the scorpions as threats, and the sting-bearing sojourners skitter in and out of the nest freely. <em>B. israelensis</em> appears to be the only known scorpion myrmecophile — a creature that lives in close association with ants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lab experiments between 2019 and 2022 revealed that the scorpions have an appetite for ant larvae. “So, they probably exploit [the ants],” Zvik says.</p>



<p>Then came the pseudoscorpion piece of the puzzle. One <em>B. israelensis</em> collected in 2018 had two pseudoscorpions gripping its back and hanging on for dear life. Over the next five years, the researchers collected many more scorpions — all without pseudoscorpions in tow. It was unclear whether that one observation was a fluke. But that spring night in 2023 in the Jordan Valley, Zvik found seven scorpions, each with at least two pseudoscorpions along for a ride. One of those scorpions carried six wee passengers.&nbsp;</p>

Zvik</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Zvik and his then-advisor Efrat Gavish-Regev, an arachnologist at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, reached out to Sharon Warburg, a pseudoscorpion expert also at the university. Together, the researchers characterized this arthropod rodeo in more detail.</p>



<p>The pseudoscorpion, identified as <em>Nannowithius wahrmani</em>, probably uses the scorpion as a shuttle to disperse among ant colonies, the team suspects. That may help the pseudoscorpion infiltrate the nest where it can feed on mites and other small prey within.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paula Cushing, an evolutionary biologist at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, agrees this strategic taxiing is likely. Scientists have documented a similar situation in a myrmecophilous spider, she says. <em>Attacobius attarum</em> lives with leaf-cutter ants (<em>Atta sexdens</em>) and uses them as taxis to move between colonies.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how the ants benefit from such arrangements, if at all. But Zvik thinks the pseudoscorpions could have a more reliable ride than the spiders Cushing describes.</p>



<p>“The ant goes out, collects some food and goes back to the same colony,” Zvik says. “The scorpion probably moves to another colony” because, like the pseudoscorpion, it too may be looking for the next feast. In other words, a perfect match of motivations.</p>

                <p>In 1997, at 15 and a half months old, Maria Crandall was developing well and the “happiest little kid,” says her mom Laura Gould, a research scientist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “There was no concern.”</p>



<p>One night, Maria developed a fever. By the next morning, she “seemed to be back to her happy self.” Yet after Maria’s nap later that day, Gould couldn’t wake her. Gould started CPR. Emergency medical technicians quickly arrived and took Maria to the emergency room. But Gould’s daughter had died in her sleep.</p>



<p>“You think it’s going to be like TV and, you know, all of the sudden they’re going to wake up,” Gould says. “And it was just too late.”</p>

<p>Gould thought she must have missed something. But the medical examiner couldn’t find anything wrong from the autopsy. The mystery of Maria’s death led Gould to help bring into existence a whole field of research on unexpected deaths in children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudden unexplained death in childhood, or SUDC, is a category of death for children age 1 and older. It means that after an autopsy and review of the child’s medical history and circumstances of the death, there remains no explanation for why the child died. These deaths most often occur when a child is sleeping.</p>



<p>In the United States, around 400 children age 1 and older die without an explanation each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of these deaths affect younger children, those who are 1 to 4 years old. SUDC is much rarer than sudden unexpected infant death, or SUID; around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,400 babies die unexpectedly each year</a> in the United States. SUID includes sudden infant death syndrome along with other unexpected deaths in children younger than 1 year old.</p>

<p>After her daughter died in 1997, Gould, then a neurological physical therapist, searched for answers. The only information she could find was about infants who unexpectedly died. She attended a conference on sudden infant deaths in 1999 and met pathologist Henry Krous of Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego. Gould and Krous cofounded the San Diego SUDC Research Project, the first big effort to study sudden unexplained deaths in children. The project collected available information on SUDC cases, including autopsy reports and medical records, and developed a questionnaire for parents. Researchers reviewed the material to look for commonalities among these deaths.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for clues to help unravel SUDC</h4>



<p>One clue that emerged from the project was an association between SUDC and seizures that are due to fevers. These febrile seizures occur in about 2 to 4 percent of kids younger than 5 years old and are generally considered harmless by the medical community. But the seizures turned out to be a prevalent feature in the medical histories of children affected by SUDC. A study that included 49 toddlers with SUDC found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3286023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 percent had a history of febrile seizures</a>, Krous, Gould and colleagues reported in 2009. Subsequent research has found that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2731680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to 30 percent of children with unexplained death have a history</a> of febrile seizures.</p>



<p>The San Diego SUDC Research Project continued until 2012, when Krous retired. Gould went on to work with neurologist Orrin Devinsky of New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. Devinsky is an expert in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, a brain disorder marked by recurring seizures. In 2014, Gould, Devinsky and others set up the SUDC Foundation to provide families with information and support and to raise research funds. The same year Gould and Devinsky started the <a href="https://sudcrrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUDC Registry and Research Collaborative</a> at NYU Langone Health, with an eye towards expanding the types of studies they could do and the biological specimens and other information they collected.</p>

<p>Families learn about the NYU registry on their own or through the foundation. Medical examiners refer SUDC cases to the registry too, sometimes before the autopsy has started. This means that, with the parents’ consent, the registry can acquire the whole brain to look for differences in children with SUDC. The NYU registry includes more than 350 families, Gould says. Over 80 percent of the children died at the ages of 1 to 4 years old.</p>



<p>Gould works with families as they are deciding whether to enroll. At times, she is speaking with people hours to days after their lives have changed forever. Gould remembers the “absolute numbness” she felt when her daughter died. When she talks to families, she tells them about her experience and “that they can ask me anything they want whether they enroll in the research or not — that I’m there to support them.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Video evidence of seizures before SUDC</h4>



<p>Over time, some enrolled families have been able to provide videos from crib cameras or home security systems. These images of their sleeping children had unexpectedly captured their final moments.</p>



<p>A team of forensic pathologists and neurologists who specialize in epilepsy reviewed seven videos the registry received, of children who were 13 to 27 months old. Six of the children <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000208038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to have a seizure shortly before they died</a>, Gould, Devinsky and the team reported online in <em>Neurology</em> in January. After the seizure, some of the children appeared to have irregular or labored breathing before they became still.</p>



<p>The videos add evidence that seizures probably play a prominent role in SUDC, Gould says. Yet why these brief seizures are followed by the death of these children still isn’t known. The team didn’t have heart rate or brain activity information for the kids in the video study. But a study of people who experienced sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, which often occurs during or after a seizure, may offer some clues, Gould says. These people were being evaluated in epilepsy monitoring units, from which heart rate, brain activity and other information was available. Those who died unexpectedly <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(13)70214-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhibited heart rate and breathing disturbances</a> beforehand.</p>

<p>“The vast, vast majority of children with febrile seizures will do just fine,” Gould says. “We don’t want to scare everyone.” &nbsp;A big part of the research is figuring out how to identify the children at risk, she says. That would also inform recommendations for families — perhaps including some type of monitoring during sleep for vulnerable children — and guidelines that pediatricians can offer.</p>



<p>This 25-years-and-counting research endeavor wouldn’t have gotten to this point without the efforts of many, Gould says, including scientists from many disciplines, medical examiners and the families — “The families, who say, this is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, learn as much as you can from it to help someone else.”</p>



<p>When Maria died, many medical professionals told Gould her daughter was the only such case they’d ever encountered. Having no one who could relate to her experience was incredibly isolating, she says. Now, when talking to grieving parents, “one of the things I always want every family to know is that you’re not alone.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blueberry-blue-color-nanostructure-wax-pigment">Here’s why blueberries are blue</a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret to a blueberry’s hue is in the structure of its wax coat.</p>



<p>Waxy coverings on blue-colored fruits such as blueberries (<em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em>), grapes (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>) and some plums contain <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4219?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D50591903454205250422835735522079100285%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1707232555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nanostructures that scatter blue and ultraviolet light</a>, researchers report February 7 in <em>Science Advances</em>. That makes these fruits look blue to people. Birds — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/do-eggs-go-cuckoo-under-uv-light">capable of seeing UV light</a> — probably see such delicious snacks as blue-UV (<em>SN: 4/3/01</em>).</p>



<p>Blue is not a common color in nature. And while there are some known blue fruits, few contain pigments in that shade. Blueberries, for instance, contain a heaping amount of anthocyanin, a skin pigment that should give each sphere a dark red color.</p>



<p>But structures in the fruits’ waxy outer layers can create their own blues. Devising ways to mimic a blueberry’s color-forming coating might one day provide a new way to give plastics or makeup a blue tint. “Using this kind of coloring is cool because it doesn’t stain,” says Rox Middleton, a physicist at the University of Bristol in England and Dresden University of Technology in Germany.</p>



<p>To better understand what is special about the berries’ waxy coverings, Middleton and colleagues looked at a variety of fruits under a scanning electron microscope. The resulting images showed an assortment of tiny molecular structures. Additional optical experiments revealed that all the structures scatter blue and UV light.</p>

<p>“When you rub the outside of a blueberry and take this outside layer of wax off,” Middleton says, “then you can see underneath is completely dark.”</p>



<p>The team also managed to re-create this effect in the lab. Wax from Oregon grapes (<em>Mahonia aquifolium</em>) became transparent when it was dissolved with chloroform. When the wax recrystallized after being spread on a black card, the layer regained its blue hue.</p>

<p>Not long ago, it came to my attention that a 2016 paper by my students and me, &#8220;<a href="https://aclanthology.org/W16-1622">Measuring Semantic Similarity Of Words Using Concept Networks</a>,&#8221;&nbsp; had been plagiarized, verbatim. The offenders had added two words to the title, which now read: &#8220;<a href="https://webology.org/data-cms/articles/20220921120640amwebology%20special%20issue.pdf">A Novel Methodology For Measuring Semantic Similarity Of Words Using Concept Networks</a>.&#8221; Their article was published in the journal<em> Webology</em>, which has been delisted from Scopus, Elsevier’s abstract and citation database. My first impulse was to ignore the transgression, but I asked the question what to do on a closed mailing list read by former colleagues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and I&#8217;m sufficiently flattered, and I know that even a Harvard President was let go for lesser forms of plagiarism, but Integral University of Lucknow is not exactly Harvard. We may already live in a post-truth world (if Trump gets reelected it&#8217;s proof positive that we do) and I don&#8217;t quite have it in me to destroy the futures of some random students (or perhaps faculty?) in India. The online journal where it appeared is published in Teheran, and does not appear on Beall&#8217;s list of predatory journals. What to do?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The responses ran 10-0 in favor of doing something. Here is a typical one:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128714"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>you should alert the journal where it appeared. I&#8217;m not familiar with Webology, but if it&#8217;s a reputable, peer-reviewed journal, authors would be required to attest that the material is original (or sufficiently sourced with references). My assumption is that the editors will want to know that this article failed their pre-publication review process and should be retracted. Bad behavior and laziness should not be rewarded. You have every right to point out that careful, deliberative, accepted and established processes were not followed in this case. Sometimes we need to be the &#8220;check&#8221; in checks and balances.</p>



<p>The final point I would make is that it&#8217;s better to respond to this situation quickly (sooner rather than later). Otherwise, a long &amp; growing chain of references could develop pointing to the plagiarized article. It can be difficult to retract and correct mistakes, but the problem only gets worse (more entrenched) over time. good luck,</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I followed up with the journal, but have received no response so far. I have not followed up with Integral University of Lucknow, whose <a href="https://www.iul.ac.in/">website</a> simply claims theirs is the &#8220;best university in India&#8221;. The head of the <a href="https://www.iul.ac.in/CA/">Department of Computer Application</a>, where both plagiarist authors work, is none other than Mohammad Faisal, second &#8220;author.&#8221; I could complain directly to him, or perhaps to the first author, Farooq Ahmad, who seems to be <a href="https://www.iul.ac.in/DWC/DeptNewsNotice/fileupload/Computer%20Application/_Computer%20Application-133376768021001565.pdf">in charge of quality assurance</a> for &#8220;Teaching Learning &amp; Education&#8221; at the department.</p>



<p>So far I have not done so (some people on the mailing list suggested complaining to their superiors, which I haven’t done either). But again, I am not interested in destroying their careers. If they continue to serve at the Best University in India so be it. Someone on the mailing list wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Flattery is one thing, plagiarism is something else again.&nbsp; From what you describe, this is far beyond flattery.&nbsp; The author had to knowingly do this and from what you say provided nothing of his own. I consider plagiarism worse than theft. Stolen physical objects can be recovered or replaced. Stealing ideas can’t be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But I strongly disagree: ideas reproduce at zero cost; a stolen idea is an idea that somehow gets broader circulation. What is stolen really is the <em>credit</em> for the idea (more on this later). Also, consider this reply on the mailing list:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Back in the 1980s and 1990s I found myself asking large groups of computer science undergraduates to write simple essays. We often found that Indian students (in particular) were &#8220;plagiarising&#8221;. When we confronted the students we discovered that this was truly a symptom of a culture clash. The norm at their home schools was to do research, often as a collaborative group, draw their own conclusions but include supporting evidence directly from published work elsewhere without attribution. They had never been told that this was unacceptable, and in their previous experience it was completely normal. So we very simply gave them a written statement of what was considered appropriate in a US setting, including attribution of included materials and acknowledgement of the work of collaborators. There were no complaints and the problem stopped.</p>



<p>The fact that the journal claims to check for plagiarism but didn&#8217;t catch this seems to be a serious problem.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell from your description whether they have a statement for submitters to sign that asserts they haven&#8217;t plagiarized &#8212; some journals do and some just take it for granted. Based on my experience, the &#8220;take for granted&#8221; approach isn&#8217;t wise in an international context.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What makes the whole affair interesting is that it sheds some light on the seamy side of academic publishing. Since citations are the coin of the realm, the tracking of citations is a life and death matter both for clueless university administrators, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon">Vogons</a> who increasingly rule academia, and for the professors caught in the rat race. Back in the day it was &#8220;publish or perish,&#8221; and one side effect was the proliferation of second- and third-rate journals that helped desperate authors improve their publication count. My own university is guilty of this practice, <a href="https://pp.bme.hu/">publishing</a> such a journal at least since the 1970s, so who is to cast the first stone on Webology? </p>



<p>By the standard eigenvector method (nowadays better known as Google’s PageRank), scientometry is perfectly capable of detecting the lower- and higher-quality journals, and this is what impact factor should all be about. But as soon as IF became important (e.g. in evaluating “research output” by universities and grant agencies), it became subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>, and Retraction Watch already discussed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">very significant efforts</a> to game it. Back in the day, this method was monopolized by Thomson Reuters whose annual Journal Citation Report was largely in line with the researchers&#8217; own assessment of journal quality, except for weird effects that were stemming mostly from misclassification (what constitutes a comparable range), from weak control for the size of the field in question, and from selection bias (it was a lot of work to start indexing a new journal).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This last effect, which hurt journals published in foreign/mixed languages particularly, is by now greatly ameliorated by publication shifting online, which enables better language detection, better citation parsing and, at least in principle, better duplicate detection. Today there is an active effort by Clarivate to combat the gaming of IF (a similar arms race is taking place between Google and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>s) and I, for one, expect impact rankings to become better over time.<br><br>This is something that we should all welcome, especially as 2nd- and 3rd-tier publications play an important role in the research ecosystem (besides letting Vogons pretend they have genuine academic credentials). Peer review is far from perfect, and sometimes genuine jewels get lost in the rush to the highest IF journals. But this is rare (and there is no suggestion that my plagiarized paper was such) and the system is largely self-correcting by the well-known mechanism of rejected authors systematically working toward getting their paper published in the next-highest tier (and walking down the hierarchy until it gets accepted). <em>Séminaire Delange-Pisot-Poitou</em> is no <em>Annals of Mathematics</em>, but it publishes solid work that needs to see the light of the day. Just as in industry, there is a genuine structural need for the &#8220;Mittelstand,&#8221; and even for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_office/home_office">&#8220;SOHO,&#8221;</a> journals.</p>



<p>This brings me to the real issue: How did I know about the plagiarism? The paper that got plagiarized is a genuine 2nd rater – it got published in the proceedings of a workshop sponsored by what was at the time the premier professional society of my field, the Association for Computational Linguistics. ACL proceedings are nowadays overshadowed by NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML proceedings, but at the time they had better exposure, and our paper garnered 35 citations according to Semantic Scholar, 49 according to Google Scholar. A truly first-rate paper is much less likely to have been stolen – the risk would be too high. The problem is not so much stealing <a href="https://www.musee-fournaise.com/Decouvrir-le-musee/Le-Dejeuner-des-canotiers">Le Déjeuner des Canotiers</a> as trying to resell it &#8212; no fence in their right mind would touch it. I don&#8217;t read <em>Webology</em>, nor do I think I have ever come across a paper that was (originally?) published there. So how did I find out? As I explained on the mailing list:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m again working on a project I started 15 years ago, and this required looking at an old paper of mine <a href="https://kornai.com/Papers/fg.pdf">&#8220;Eliminating ditransitives&#8221;</a> [&#8230;] – let&#8217;s call this paper &#8220;A&#8221;. One of the reasons why I haven&#8217;t continued with the project was that it had no pickup whatsoever, of the 20 citations (Google Scholar) it gathered in the meantime 19 were by my students, who of course knew it perfectly well that the subject is dear to my heart. Now that Google Scholar was showing <strong>one</strong> independent citation I was curious to check what the citing paper &#8220;<a href="https://webology.org/abstract.php?id=3784">B</a>&#8220;, had to say. Finally, finally, someone is interested in my brilliant contribution to the hard problem that &#8220;A&#8221; attacked!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sadly, no such luck. It was just that the paper in <em>Webology</em> was a verbatim copy of &#8220;B&#8221;, which cited &#8220;A&#8221; – the one I really care about –&nbsp; and in the process professors Ahmad and Faisal lifted the citation together with the content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the moral is that we should be grateful to the ever-growing citation databases. Making these public would be a lot better than the current state of the art, just as it would be better to have a lively IF competition rather than the monopolistic Clarivate, but that&#8217;s another story. Given the current &#8220;H-index or bust&#8221; mentality, I should be actually grateful to <em>Webology</em> for having lifted what was a self-citation (which my university, quite correctly, does not count towards H-index) to the more valuable &#8220;independent citation&#8221; category. For better or worse, I am flattered.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-mimas-hidden-ocean">Saturn’s ‘Death Star’ moon might contain a hidden ocean</a></h4>

              
                <p>An uncanny resemblance to the Death Star might not be the only intriguing thing about Saturn’s moon Mimas. It could also harbor a vast ocean of liquid water beneath its pockmarked exterior.</p>



<p>A new look at data from NASA’s Cassini probe reveals that the point in Mimas’ orbit where it comes closest to Saturn <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06975-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed slightly over 13 years</a>, researchers report February 7 in <em>Nature</em>. Because Mimas’ internal composition affects the gravitational dance between the moon and its planet, these orbital dynamics, along with some previously seen moon wobbles, point to a liquid interior, astronomer Valéry Lainey of the Paris Observatory and colleagues say.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a very surprising result,” says Francis Nimmo, a geologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the findings. “When you look at Mimas, it does not look like a moon with an ocean.”</p>



<p>This is not the first time that liquid water has been suspected on tiny Mimas, which at 400 kilometers across is the smallest of Saturn’s major moons. A 2014 study suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/surprises-lurk-inside-saturn-moon">slight wobbles in the satellite’s rotation</a> could be explained by a watery reservoir under its frozen shell <em>(SN: 10/16/14)</em>. Other researchers pooh-poohed this possibility, maintaining that Saturn’s gravity would flex a hidden ocean so much that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/saturn-death-star-moon-may-not-conceal-ocean-after-all">large cracks would eventually appear in the moon’s surface ice</a> <em>(SN: 2/28/17)</em>. Such fractures have not been seen.</p>



<p>The new calculations suggest that Mimas has an ice shell roughly 20 to 30 kilometers thick, followed by a 70-kilometer-deep ocean and a solid rocky core. To account for the lack of surface cracks, Lainey and colleagues believe the ocean formed between 5 million and 50 million years ago, a geological eyeblink that wouldn’t provide enough time for major alterations to the moon’s exterior.</p>



<p>The accumulating evidence has converted some prior naysayers, such as Alyssa Rhoden, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “I was the most skeptical of Mimas having an ocean,” she says. “But you really have to go where the data takes you, and it seems like we&#8217;re getting a new ocean world.”</p>



<p>Nimmo isn’t entirely convinced. The presence of an ocean at the same epoch as humanity’s exploration of the planets “would mean that we had to be seeing the solar system at an extremely special time,” he says. And even if there hasn’t been enough time for the putative ocean to fracture the surface, Nimmo notes, there should still be signs of contraction: Water takes up less space than ice, so a recently formed ocean would have created voids beneath Mimas’ crust that left visible scars. There are no hints of that, he says.</p>



<p>If the ocean hypothesis bears out, it would bolster the prospect that hidden seas abound in the outer solar system, such as the moons of Uranus. The possibility that the ocean is so young, geologically speaking, also excites Lainey, because some future probe might drill through the icy exterior and observe fresh liquid water interacting with a rocky core.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s really the place you want to look if you want to look at the beginning of conditions for life,” he says. “Whether there is life there, nobody knows.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fern-first-plant-dead-leaves-new-roots">This weird fern is the first known plant that turns its dead leaves into new roots</a></h4>

              
                <p>To get by in the waterlogged, low-nutrient soil of the Quebrada Chorro forest in western Panama, a species of tree fern repurposes its dead fronds, turning them into roots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery “was completely serendipitous,” says James Dalling, a tropical forest ecologist at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. In 2019, Dalling and colleagues were on an expedition to study how the roots of the tropical conifer <em>Podocarpus</em> acquire nutrients when the team came across a dense brush of <em>Cyathea rojasiana </em>tree ferns. The researchers tried to move dead fern fronds out of the way and found that the leaves were rooted in the ground. “We would have missed it if we hadn&#8217;t actually been digging around in the soil,” Dalling says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digging up the stubborn leaves revealed that <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.4248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the tips of their veins had sprouted rootlets</a>, the team reports in the Jan. 18 <em>Ecology</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cyathea</em> tree ferns are known to keep <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48621885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skirts of dead leaves</a> around them, which may fend off climbing vines or insulate the ferns from frigid temperatures. Because <em>C.</em> <em>rojasiana</em> is relatively short compared with other tree ferns, when its leaves die and droop, they touch the ground. Dalling suspects that the fern uses its languishing leaves to seek out pockets of nutrients instead of investing resources in building new roots from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dalling’s team dug up some of the leafy roots and, back in the lab, planted them in pots with a stable form of nitrogen called nitrogen-15. Later dissections of the rootlets showed that they pulled the nutrient up into the plants, indicating that the structures function as roots, the researchers report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plenty of other plants do odd things with their leaves or roots. The walking fern (<em>Asplenium rhizophyllum</em>) of the eastern United States, for instance, can reproduce by sprouting new plants from the tips of its leaves. And Dalling has seen roots in the Quebrada Chorro forest, like those of shrubby <em>Clusia</em> plants, climb up other plants. But <em>C. rojasiana </em>is the only plant in the world known to bring its dead leaves back to life as roots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve never heard of any other fern doing this, or for that matter, any other land plant,” says botanist Erin Sigel of the University of New Hampshire in Durham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neotropical fern expert Robbin Moran is similarly stunned. “I have not previously heard of this in ferns or other plants,” says Moran, now retired from New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. “It’s weird.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dalling plans to team up with a plant anatomist to better understand the structure of the rootlets and wants to probe them for mycorrhizal fungi, which play a role in how the roots of some plants absorb nutrients. “I&#8217;m really curious now,” he says. “Are there fungi in these rootlets?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earthquakes-map-hazard-risks">Where are U.S. earthquakes most likely? A new map shows the hazard risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some 230 million people in the United States face the potential of damaging earthquakes in 100 years, according to the latest U.S. National Seismic Hazard Model, or NSHM. That’s about 40 million more people than the NHSM previously suggested.</p>



<p>“This hazard model forecasts where we think the future earthquakes will occur,” and moreover, where there’s “the chance of having any damage from an earthquake,” says geophysicist Mark Petersen of the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver.</p>



<p>The NSHM draws from data on some 130,000 quakes recorded in seismic catalogs and the geologic record, as well as nearly 500 new active faults. It also incorporates new ground motion models that estimate the shaking at a site during a quake. These updates contributed to an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/87552930231215428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase in the mean earthquake hazard</a> across the country, Petersen and colleagues report December 29 in <em>Earthquake Spectra</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Damaging quakes</h3>



<p>This map from the updated National Seismic Hazard Model shows the probability of a damaging earthquake occurring anywhere in the United States in 100 years. A damaging quake is any temblor with a Modified Mercalli Intensity, or MMI, rating of VI or above. MMI ratings are roman numerals that ascribe quakes a severity based on their observable effects. An earthquake rated as MMI VI is felt by all, frightens many, moves some heavy furniture and causes a few instances of fallen plaster, resulting in relatively slight damage overall.</p>

<p>One key difference in this update is the improved characterization of shaking in sedimentary basins, Petersen says. Basins with deep soil can amplify some of the waves generated by an earthquake. That boost can be significant for a quake’s longer and slower waves, causing more damage to tall buildings and long bridges. Accounting for the amplification elevated the ground shaking hazard for such structures in some major cities, like Seattle, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore.</p>



<p>The new NSHM also includes updated ground shaking models of the subduction zones in the Pacific Northwest and southern Alaska. These are areas <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">where one tectonic plate pushes under another</a>, and they’re notorious for generating large quakes (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). In general, the changes in the new NSHM have increased the hazard very close to the subduction zone and decreased the hazard away from it. </p>



<p>That’s not to say quakes are restricted to the plate boundaries, though. In and around southwestern Missouri, quakes sometimes rumble along ancient rifts in the crust. And in 1886, an unidentified fault near Charleston, South Carolina birthed a devasting temblor that led to 60 deaths and damaged thousands of structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-3d-tree-fossil-forest-understory">A rare 3-D tree fossil may be the earliest glimpse at a forest understory</a></h4>

              
                <p>With its fluffed, spiraling top and thin trunk, the <em>Sanfordiacaulis densifolia</em> tree looks like it came straight out of Dr. Seuss’ <em>The Lorax</em>. But this isn’t a truffula come to life. It’s a 3-D rendering of a 350 million-year-old fossil that shows something very few other fossils in the world ever have — <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00011-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224000113%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both a trunk and the leaves of a tree species</a> from a somewhat fuzzy time period in plant history, researchers report February 2 in <em>Current Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I first saw [the fossil], I was gobsmacked,” says geologist Robert Gastaldo of Colby College in Waterville, Maine. “Finding this … it made me think we should buy lottery tickets. That’s how rare it is.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past seven years, researchers have found five specimens of <em>S. densifolia</em> — all of which come from what was once a lake in New Brunswick, Canada. These trees lived during a time period known as the early Mississippian when little is understood about prehistoric plants. The short height of this new fossil, preserved with both a trunk and crown, suggests Mississippian forests may have had more layers than previously known. Not only is this the most complete tree fossil to be dated to this time period, but it is one of few fossils like this ever found across any geologic era.</p>



<p>“This is something remarkable,” says botanist Mihai Tomescu of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, who was not involved in this study. “It fills a gap within our picture of what forest structure looked like in the Mississippian.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="486" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020224_hb_tree-fossil_inline_REV.jpg?resize=680%2C486&#038;ssl=1" alt="A woman poses horizontally on top of a gray fossil of a tree trunk and extending leaves." class="wp-image-3135716" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020224_hb_tree-fossil_inline_REV.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020224_hb_tree-fossil_inline_REV.jpg?resize=536%2C383&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020224_hb_tree-fossil_inline_REV.jpg?resize=630%2C450&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/020224_hb_tree-fossil_inline_REV.jpg?resize=260%2C186&amp;ssl=1 260w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3135716">Superlong leaves spiraled out of <em>S. densifolia’s&nbsp;</em>skinny trunk (the fossil shown here with paleontologist Olivia King for scale), which may have helped the tree maximize photosynthesis in the forest understory.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135716">Matthew Stimson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An earthquake probably broke these trees off at their bases, sending them rolling to the bottom of a nearby lake where they were later preserved, the researchers say. But when this recently discovered specimen fell, it wasn’t flattened like many other fossils. “This tree was preserved in almost complete three dimensionality,” says Patricia Gensel, a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “The leaves are very much intact, and that’s highly unusual.”</p>



<p>Using the fossil and a computer graphics program called Blender, the researchers created a 3-D digital reconstruction of what they think the tree would have looked like. It was only about half the height of a full-grown giraffe, but its crown was large, possibly as wide as 6 meters with leaves as long as 3 meters, the researchers estimate. They don’t yet know if this tree was fully mature, but they don’t think it would have ever neared the height of the other known trees from the Mississippian, which might have been upwards of 20 meters.</p>



<p>The combination of the tree’s mid-sized height and massive leaves lead researchers to believe <em>S. densifolia </em>could be the earliest known evidence of a subcanopy tree, which would have created a layered forest. Trees trying to live in the subcanopy would have had to adapt, in this case, by using large leaves to capture as much sunlight as possible. This new forest layer would have also altered the ecosystems around it by creating shelter and humidity, by shading sunlight and trapping evaporating groundwater. The creation of this kind of understory would have created new ecosystems for other organisms to exploit, creating more biodiversity, Gestaldo says.</p>



<p>More fossils of <em>S. densifolia </em>could help researchers better understand how plants adapted long ago. “Knowing about the changes that have taken place in plants through time helps us understand how plants may modify themselves to survive in the future,” Gensel says.</p>

<p>A journal and publisher have retracted three papers about abortion, including one that has been used in court cases to support the suspension of FDA approval for mifepristone, aka an “<a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill">abortion pill</a>.”</p>



<p>Sage, the publisher of <em>Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology</em>, <a href="https://perspectivesblog.sagepub.com/blog/note-from-sage-on-retractions-in-health-services-research-and-managerial-epidemiology">announced</a> the retractions yesterday and posted a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23333928231216699">retraction notice covering the three articles</a>.</p>



<p>For <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23333928211053965">one of those articles,&nbsp; initially flagged by a reader</a>, “an independent reviewer with expertise in statistical analyses evaluated the concerns and opined that the article&#8217;s presentation of the data in Figures 2 and 3 leads to an inaccurate conclusion and that the composition of the cohort studied has problems that could affect the article&#8217;s conclusions,” according to the notice.</p>



<span id="more-128704"></span>



<p>The notice also said Sage “confirmed that all but one of the article’s authors had an affiliation with one or more of Charlotte Lozier Institute, Elliot Institute, and American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, all pro-life advocacy organizations, despite having declared they had no conflicts of interest when they submitted the article for publication or in the article itself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the peer reviewers, Sage learned, “was affiliated with Charlotte Lozier Institute at the time of the review,” leading the publisher and journal editor to determine “the peer review for initial publication was unreliable.” That referee also reviewed the other two <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23333928221103107">now-retracted</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2333392819841211">papers</a>, according to Sage.</p>



<p>James Studnicki, the lead author of the three papers, told Retraction Watch the retractions were “a blatant attempt to discredit excellent research which is incongruent with a preferred abortion narrative.” He told <em>The Daily Wire</em>, a conservative news outlet that was <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/completely-unjustified-medical-journal-retracts-major-studies-critical-of-abortion-pill-ahead-of-supreme-court-clash">first to report on the retractions</a>, the move was “completely unjustified.” <em>The Daily Wire</em> notes that “The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in March on the legality of restricting the abortion pill based on [Judge Matthew] Kacsmaryk’s ruling, proceedings that will certainly be impacted by the retractions.”</p>



<p>Sage had subjected one of the papers to an expression of concern in August 2023, saying they were investigating “potential issues regarding the representation of data in the article and author conflicts of interest” after being alerted by a reader. As <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/study-cited-texas-judge-abortion-pill-case-under-investigation">News From The States reported then</a>, the notice came after Chris Adkins, a professor at South University who teaches pharmaceutical sciences, raised concerns with Sage. As News From The States noted in August:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Kacsmaryk leaned hard on a<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23333928211053965"> 2021 study</a> that was designed, funded and produced by the research arm of one of the most powerful anti-abortion political groups in the U.S. The judge cited this paper — which looked at Medicaid patients’ visits to the emergency room within 30 days of having an abortion — to justify that a group of anti-abortion doctors and medical groups have legal standing to force the FDA to recall mifepristone.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/23.11.29-Sage-Scientific-Response.pdf">point-by-point response to Sage’s critiques of the paper</a> sent to the publisher in November and now shared with Retraction Watch, Studnicki and colleagues pointed out they had noted their affiliations in the original manuscript and the then-proposed retractions “misrepresent ICMJE disclosure standards,” referring to the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/author-responsibilities--conflicts-of-interest.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ guidelines</a>. They also call some of the post-publication peer reviewers’ critiques “factually incorrect” and “unfounded.” They conclude:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><em>No single specific finding in any of the three papers has been explicitly challenged, let alone invalidated.</em></li>



<li><em>There is no evidence of a major error, miscalculation, fabrication, or falsification.</em></li>



<li><em>There is no breach of any of the COPE guidelines that could permit Sage to retract any of our published papers.</em></li>



<li><em>The retraction of any of these papers, let alone all three, is demonstrably unwarranted.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Adkins told Retraction Watch he is “pleased the journal approached my concerns with legitimate and serious consideration.” He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is reassuring that my initial concerns with the 2021 Studnicki et al. article were verified and affirmed by other experts. Despite the length of time spanning my initial communications with the journal and today’s retractions, I understand that thorough investigations and re-review processes take time. Given that these now-retracted articles have been excessively cited by parties involved in ongoing federal judicial cases, now positioned before the SCOTUS, Sage’s retractions should help our courts remain informed by the highest standards and quality in scientific and medical evidence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-exploded-antarctica-millions-years-ago">An asteroid may have exploded over Antarctica about 2.5 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Around 2.5 million years ago, an asteroid may have exploded over Antarctica.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The evidence comes from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X23005721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a chemical analysis of more than 100 tiny pieces of rock</a> entrained within the White Continent’s ice, researchers report in the Feb. 1 <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>. The timing makes the midair detonation the oldest known airburst, the team says. Only two other ancient airburst events are known in the geologic record, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating to 480,000</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteor-explosion-over-antarctica-impact-rock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">430,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The surfaces of Earth and other rocky bodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-craters-mars-spotted-50-years-ago" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are littered with conspicuous craters</a> caused by direct hits from asteroids or comets (<em>SN: 7/23/15</em>). But sometimes an incoming object disintegrates in midair before reaching the surface. Since there’s no crater left behind, there’s scant evidence for airbursts in the geologic record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, such events can still be enormously destructive: When an airburst occurs — typically at altitudes ranging from several to a few tens of kilometers — the enormous kinetic energy of the incoming body is transferred into an impact plume, a maelstrom of pressure disturbances and heat. “All the energy is released in the atmosphere in the form of shock waves and thermal radiation,” says Matthias van Ginneken, a cosmochemist at the University of Kent in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s what happened in 2013 after a roughly 20-meter asteroid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-explodes-over-russia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke up high over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/13</em>). When the resulting shock wave reached the ground, it shattered thousands of windows. In 1908, an even more catastrophic airburst took place over Tunguska, Siberia, when a body roughly three times as large as the Chelyabinsk boulder disintegrated in the atmosphere and flattened over 2,000 square kilometers of forest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, van Ginneken and his colleagues believe they’ve uncovered evidence for an airburst that occurred between 2.3 million and 2.7 million years ago over Antarctica.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team analyzed 116 tiny bits of rock, each about the width of a human hair and many of them spheroidal, found within the continent’s ice. The rocks are dominated by the minerals olivine and spinel, which makes them chemically consistent with a type of asteroid known as an ordinary chondrite, the researchers conclude. Furthermore, the precise ratio of different forms of oxygen in the rocks suggests that they had been produced in an airburst whose impact plume interacted with ice and had therefore reached all the way down to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such “touchdown” airbursts are particularly destructive, van Ginneken says. “It’s like a huge torch touching the ground and vaporizing everything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earth is bombarded by sizeable chunks of extraterrestrial material pretty frequently, says Jason Pearl, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who was not involved in the research. Chelyabinsk- and Tunguska-type events are predicted to occur roughly every 50 and 500 years, respectively, he says. It therefore makes sense to undercover evidence of an airburst a couple million years ago. “It’s totally believable that events would have occurred in that time period.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Van Ginneken is keen to look for more airbursts in the geologic record. There’s got to be others to be found, he says. “I’m convinced there are more examples.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smallest-molecular-knot-54-atoms-chain-gold">The smallest known molecular knot is made of just 54 atoms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a knot so small that it can’t be seen with the naked eye. Then think even smaller.</p>



<p>Chemists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44302-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tied together just 54 atoms</a> to form the smallest molecular knot yet. Described January 2 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, the knot is a chain of gold, phosphorus, oxygen and carbon atoms that crosses itself three times, forming a pretzel shape called a trefoil. The previous smallest molecular knot, reported in 2020, contained 69 atoms.</p>



<p>Chemist Richard Puddephatt, working with colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Dalian, created the new knot by accident while attempting to build complex structures of interlocked ring molecules, or catenanes. Someday catenanes could be used in molecular machines — essentially, switches and motors at the molecular scale — but for now scientists are still figuring out how they work, which, in this case, resulted in producing something else by mistake.</p>



<p>“It was just serendipity really, one of those lucky moments in research that balances out all the hard knocks that you take,” says Puddephatt, of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada.</p>



<p>The new trefoil knot is also the tightest of its kind. Researchers calculate a molecular knot’s tightness by dividing the number of atoms in the chain by the number of chain crossings to get what’s called the backbone crossing ratio, or BCR. The smaller the BCR, the tighter the knot. The new knot has a BCR of 18. The previous tightest trefoil knot had a BCR of 23.</p>



<p>Studying small molecular knots <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/molecules-knots-periodic-table">could someday lead to</a> new materials (<em>SN</em>: <em>8/27/18</em>). But for now, the team is still trying to determine why this combination of atoms results in a knot at all.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/heshmati.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="213" height="256" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/heshmati.jpeg?resize=213%2C256&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128697" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Almas Heshmati</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Last year, a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">study</a> on green innovations and patents in 27 countries left one reader slack-jawed. The findings were no surprise. What was baffling was how the authors, two professors of economics in Europe, had pulled off the research in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reader, a PhD student in economics, was working with the same data described in the paper. He knew they were riddled with holes – sometimes big ones: For several countries, observations for some of the variables the study tracked were completely absent. The authors made no mention of how they dealt with this problem. On the contrary, they wrote they had “balanced panel data,” which in economic parlance means a dataset with no gaps.</p>



<p>“I was dumbstruck for a week,” said the student, who requested anonymity for fear of harming his career. (His identity is known to Retraction Watch.)</p>



<span id="more-128696"></span>



<p>The student wrote a polite email to the paper’s first author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a>, a professor of economics at Jönköping University in Sweden, asking how he dealt with the missing data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In email correspondence seen by Retraction Watch and a follow-up Zoom call, Heshmati told the student he had used Excel’s autofill function to mend the data. He had marked anywhere from two to four observations before or after the missing values and dragged the selected cells down or up, depending on the case. The program then filled in the blanks. If the new numbers turned negative, Heshmati replaced them with the last positive value Excel had spit out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The student was shocked. Replacing missing observations with substitute values – an operation known in statistics as imputation – is a common but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440761500278X?via%3Dihub">controversial</a> technique in economics that allows certain types of analyses to be carried out on incomplete data. Researchers have established methods for the practice; each comes with its own drawbacks that affect how the results are interpreted. As far as the student knew, Excel’s autofill function was not among these methods, especially not when applied in a haphazard way without clear justification.</p>



<p>But it got worse. Heshmati’s data, which the student convinced him to share, showed that in several instances where there were no observations to use for the autofill operation, the professor had taken the values from an adjacent country in the spreadsheet. New Zealand’s data had been copied from the Netherlands, for example, and the United States’ data from the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, Heshmati had filled in thousands of empty cells in the dataset – well over one in 10 – including missing values for the study’s outcome variables. A table listing descriptive statistics for the study’s 25 variables referred to “783 observations” of each variable, but did not mention that many of these “observations” were in fact imputations.</p>



<p>“This fellow, he imputed everything,” the student said. “He is a professor, he should know that if you do so much imputation then your data will be entirely fabricated.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Other experts echoed the student’s concerns when told of the Excel operations underlying the paper.</p>



<p>“That sounds rather horrendous,” said Andrew Harvey, a professor of econometrics at the University of Cambridge, in England. “If you fill in lots of data points in this way it will invalidate a lot of the statistics and associated tests. There are ways of dealing with these problems correctly but they do require some effort.</p>



<p>“Interpolating data is bad practice but lots of people do it and it’s not dishonest so long as it’s mentioned,” Harvey added. “The other point about copying data from one country to another sounds much worse.”</p>



<p>Søren Johansen, an econometrician and professor emeritus at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark, characterized what Heshmati did as “cheating.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The reason it’s cheating isn’t that he’s done it, but that he hasn’t written it down,” Johansen said. “It’s pretty egregious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “Green innovations and patents in OECD countries,” was published in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>, a <a href="https://journalpublishingguide.vu.nl/WebQuery/vubrowser/498">highly ranked</a> title from Elsevier. It has been cited just once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Neither the publisher nor the journal’s editors, whom the student said he alerted to his concerns, have responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Heshmati’s coauthor, Mike Tsionas, a professor of economics at Lancaster University in the UK, <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news/article/mike-tsionas">died recently</a>. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifabs_remembering-professor-mike-tsionas-a-activity-7150834577173872640-iGW4">a eulogy posted on LinkedIn</a> in January, the International Finance and Banking Society hailed Tsionas as “a true luminary in the field of econometrics.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Almas-interview-full-Gmail-journalist-inquiry.pdf">a series of emails</a> to Retraction Watch, Heshmati, who, according to the paper, was responsible for data curation, first said Tsionas had been aware of how Heshmati dealt with the missing data.</p>



<p>“If we do not use imputation, such data is almost useless,” Heshmati said. He added that the description of the data in the paper as “balanced” referred to “the final data” – that is, the mended dataset.</p>



<p>Referring to the imputation, Heshmati wrote in a subsequent email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Of course, the procedure must be acknowledged and explained. I have missed to explain the imputation procedure in the data section unintentionally in the writing stage of the paper. I am fully responsible for imputations and missing to acknowledge it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that when he was approached by the PhD student:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I offered him a zoom meeting to explain to him the procedure and even gave him the data. If I had other intensions [sic] and did not believe in my imputation approach, I would not share the data with him. If I had to start over again, I would have managed the data in the same way as the alternative would mean dropping several countries and years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">G<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/25/torturing-data-to-predict-bitcoin-prices-a-book-excerpt/">ary Smith</a>, a professor of economics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, said the copying of data between countries was “beyond concerning.” He reviewed Heshmati’s spreadsheet for Retraction Watch and found five cases where more than two dozen data points had been copied from one country to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marco Hafner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank, said “using the autofill function may not be the best of ideas in the first place as I can imagine it is not directly evident to what conditions missing values have been determined/imputed.”</p>



<p>Hafner, who is research leader at RAND Europe, added that “under reasonable assumptions and if it’s really necessary for analytical reasons, one could fill in data gaps for one country with data from another country.” But, he said, the impact of those assumptions would need to be reported in a sensitivity analysis – something Heshmati said he had not done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At the bare minimum,” Hafner said, the paper should have stated the assumptions underlying the imputation and how it was done – something that, he added, would have reduced the chances of the work getting published should the reviewers find the methods inappropriate.</p>

<p><em>In a recent <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn9352">Science editorial</a>, Barbara Redman and our Ivan Oransky called for a boost to the budget and authority of the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI). In this letter, a nephrologist and researcher suggests one potential way to fight fraud.</em></p>



<p>Bravo on your editorial, which pointed out the pathetic funding level for an agency that is supposed to put a check on self-interested fabrication and distortion in scientific research.  Perhaps universities and influential individuals who feel the threat of censure have collaborated to minimize that risk by throttling the Office of Research Integrity (ORI).  Regardless, billions of dollars each year are probably lost in misdirected efforts based on false information. That is a national tragedy.</p>



<p>During the time I was an undergraduate at Caltech we had an honor code that was very clear: You cheat, lie or fabricate and you are at best heavily censured, and likely out.  We learned that one’s research notes were our reputation, and that our supervising senior researchers would often and unpredictably ask to review them.  It was daunting and occasionally very stressful, but led to a lifelong ethic that stood me in good stead when I went into medicine, where peoples’ lives were at stake based on what we wrote and did.  </p>



<span id="more-128690"></span>



<p>One tool I used while working for the Veterans Administration (VA) could come in useful in the wider context of research. The VA has an electronic health record (EHR) called “CPRS” that is based on “write once/read many.”  Every note and every prescription is encrypted and stored in a way that cannot be erased.  You can enter a note amending an erroneous entry, but the original entry can never be erased.  It uses a lot of memory but assures that if an audit is needed for any reason the original entry will be available for review.  Perhaps having lab notes based on such a digital system would raise the bar to post-hoc alteration high enough to discourage at least that form of cheating.  </p>



<p>Of course, where prestige, money and fame are concerned there is no way to totally stop cheating. But an un-erasable digital form of lab notebook might help to at least reduce fabrication and manipulation in a world where lying seems to have become an accepted form of behavior for altogether too many in science.</p>



<p><em>Following graduation from Caltech, TJ O&#8217;Neil spent 45 years in the Air Force and VA as a clinical nephrologist after completing a fellowship in the lab of Jay Stein at the University of Texas, San Antonio.  He is currently developing a patient kidney disease education program and a dialysis safety device. </em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conservation considerations</h4>



<p><em>The online mapping tool Landscape Explorer uses historical and modern aerial images to show how the American West’s landscapes have changed over the last 70 years, <strong>Brianna Randall</strong> wrote in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/landscape-explorer-interactive-map-american-west">Landscape Explorer transports you back to a more wild West</a>” (</em>SN: 12/2/23, p. 32<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Randall</strong> wrote that Landscape Explorer has helped conservationists in Montana prioritize where to remove invasive trees that have taken root in grasslands, which threaten local biodiversity and increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Given the climate crisis, reader <strong>Mark Granville </strong>wondered why conservationists would cut down trees that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Is grass better at trapping the greenhouse gas?</p>



<p>Though mitigating carbon emissions is key in combating the climate crisis, other ecosystem benefits like biodiversity, water storage, and people’s cultural and spiritual values remain important, says <strong>Kelsey Molloy</strong>, a rangeland ecologist at the Nature Conservancy, which is a member of the partnership that led the Montana efforts. That said, the role of grasslands and other rangelands in storing carbon is often overlooked, <strong>Molloy</strong> says. “Grasses store carbon deep in the soil, and that carbon is not lost from fires the way [it is] in treed landscapes.”</p>



<p>It’s a common misconception that planting more trees everywhere will decrease global warming, says <strong>Scott Morford</strong>,an applied spatial ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula who led the development of Landscape Explorer. “In places like the Amazon, maintaining and increasing tree cover is critical for global climate regulation. In snow-dominated grasslands and shrublands, however, there is no clear evidence that increasing tree cover contributes to climate cooling,” he says.</p>



<p>Planting trees in historically treeless grasslands can also increase warming by altering the way the land surface reflects light back into space, <strong>Morford </strong>says. “In the northern Great Plains of the United States, tree cover would need to surpass 95 percent to achieve even a small net cooling effect.”</p>



<p>Previous simulations have even suggested that removing vast swaths of forests in the Northern Hemisphere and replacing them with grasslands may help cool the planet due to changes in the land surface’s reflectivity, <strong>Morford</strong> says. Of course, “no reasonable conservationist who values grassland protection would suggest cutting down North America’s northern forests to benefit the climate,” he says. “We are instead dedicated to safeguarding what little remains of the planet’s most endangered terrestrial biome and averting the collapse of its unique and essential biodiversity.”</p>



<p>As we seek solutions to the climate crisis, it’s important not to pit ecosystems and environmental challenges against one another, <strong>Morford</strong> says. “Rather, let’s unite to address the intertwined challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss in a way that preserves all the natural systems we cherish.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bird acrobatics</h4>



<p><em>High-speed cameras reveal that Anna’s hummingbirds turn sideways to slip through gaps narrower than their wingspan, <strong>Erin Garcia de Jesús</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbirds-fly-spaces-narrow-wings">Hummingbirds show off a flight trick</a>” (</em>SN: 12/16/23 &amp; 12/30/23, p. 14<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story unlocked a memory for reader <strong>Blair Campbell</strong>: “Years ago, in my parents’ backyard, [which was] partially enclosed by a chain link fence installed to pen the little dog, I was fascinated to see a ruby-throated hummingbird take a weaving flight back and forth through the links.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-public-health-research-to-save-lives">Using public health research to save lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than 106,000 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2021. That’s more than the number of people who died due to firearm-related injuries (48,830), falls (44,686) or motor vehicle crashes (42,939). These are all considered preventable causes of death, and as such, they are a public health problem. Reducing the toll requires research to identify risk factors and then the development of interventions that make the environment safer and discourage unsafe behavior.</p>



<p>Motor vehicle crashes make for a good case study. From 1972 to 2019, the death rate from crashes dropped by more than half in the United States, from 26.9 per 100,000 people to 11.9. It took multiple interventions to make that happen, including laws requiring seat belts and lower speed limits, graduated driver’s licenses for teens, safer roads, new technologies like airbags and advocacy from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</p>



<p>Some simple interventions are remarkably effective. Just using a seat belt, for example, reduces the risk of death for people in the front seat of a car by 45 percent compared with those without seat belts. New technologies like forward collision avoidance may do more. Research by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimates that these technologies could potentially prevent more than 2.7 million crashes a year if they were on all cars and properly used by drivers.</p>



<p>In this issue, we explore one effort to prevent deaths from drug overdoses. In the 1990s, use of prescription opioids like Oxycontin fueled a rise in overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the last decade, powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have greatly increased the risk of overdose and death — so much so that annual deaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled since 2015. Addiction is a disease; the goal here is keeping people alive so they can get treatment and rebuild their lives.</p>



<p>Access to naloxone, a medication that reverses an opioid overdose, is one tool. Another is overdose prevention centers, where people can use drugs in a supervised setting. As freelance science journalist Tara Haelle reports, the United States lags behind some other countries in opening overdose prevention centers, despite data showing their effectiveness in saving lives. Only two officially sanctioned overdose prevention centers currently exist in the United States, both in New York City. To see how well these centers might work across the country, researchers are gearing up to study the impacts of the New York sites, as well as one that is scheduled to open in Rhode Island later this year.</p>



<p>Current barriers to opening more overdose prevention centers include addressing legal obstacles and local concerns, Haelle notes. But as the opioid crisis grinds on, some government officials and communities appear increasingly open to whatever tools that can save lives. </p>



<p>The work of confronting public health threats never ends. New risks emerge, whether it’s the advent of synthetic opioids or the use of mobile phones while driving. Research helps gauge the effectiveness of new public safety approaches, as well as how best to implement interventions that save lives.</p>
