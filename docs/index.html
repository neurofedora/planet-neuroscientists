<p>An Elsevier chemistry journal has marked <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=%22expression%20of%20concern%22&amp;pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;sortBy=date">more than 60 papers</a> with expressions of concern amid an investigation involving potential undisclosed conflicts of interest among editors, authorship irregularities and manipulation of peer reviews and citations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524008816">One of the notices</a>, published online April 11 in <em>Chemosphere</em>, read, for example:</p>



<span id="more-129212"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding:</p>



<ul>
<li>unusual changes to the authorship of the article prior to publication.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by a reviewer.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by the editor who handled the peer-review process for the article.</li>
</ul>



<p>The journal editors are investigating the article, including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the editors can reach a conclusion, they will take any action that is deemed necessary. If the editors have determined that they cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion with the information available to them, a further notification will be published to update the community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher would not share further details about its efforts, telling us only:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics team is investigating a series of articles published in Chemosphere.  In line with our Article Correction, Retraction &amp; Removal Policy, we have published temporary Expressions of Concern against a series of papers where investigations are ongoing and may take considerable time to conclude (<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal#3-expressions-of-concern">https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal#3-expressions-of-concern</a>). We will update the community on the outcome of the investigations in due course with further notices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sleuths have flagged dozens of publications in <em>Chemosphere</em>. In December, for instance, an anonymous PubPeer comment listed several papers that were “part of a potential breach in the publication ethics as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87A4CAC90B526F773F36C93BC737B4">the editor is linked with the authors</a>.” In other cases, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/32B04AD9A0235DD21932848B9CF773">the handling editor was also an author</a> of the paper, another post pointed out.</p>



<p>The notices started to appear online in March. Papers in both special&nbsp; and regular issues of the journal seem to be affected.</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal last week retracted a paper by two senior economists who used <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/05/no-data-no-problem-undisclosed-tinkering-in-excel-behind-economics-paper/">questionable methods</a> to replace large chunks of missing observations in their dataset without disclosing the procedure.</p>



<p>The move follows a Retraction Watch story published in February that revealed the paper’s corresponding author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a> of Jönköping University in Sweden, used Excel’s autofill function and other undisclosed operations to populate thousands of empty cells, or well over 10% of the dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a guest post on our blog, economist Gary Smith argued Heshmati and his coauthor had&nbsp; “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/21/how-not-to-deal-with-missing-data-an-economists-take-on-a-controversial-study/">no justification</a>” for not describing what they had done. Smith also commented in <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">an article</a> for <em>Mind Matters</em> that “<a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">the solution to an absence of data is not to fabricate data</a>.”</p>



<p>Less than three weeks after our report, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">Elsevier told us</a> it would pull the study, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">Green innovations and patents in OECD countries</a>,” which appeared last year in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>. On May 4, the publisher issued a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018560">retraction notice</a> stating:</p>



<span id="more-129194"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns were raised about the data in this paper post-publication. The first author confirmed to the Editors that the data contained many gaps across countries and over time. The majority of the missing unit values appeared in beginning and end year years (1990–1992 and 2017–2018). To represent country data over time, the first author imputed the missing unit values using forward and backward trends based on three consecutive values in Excel. The first author claims that this resulted in a balanced dataset inclusive of the sample countries and further states that the imputation of missing values based on variable—specific trend will not change the result and large number of observations will produce more stable estimated coefficients.</p>



<p>However, the first author agrees that he has not explained the imputation in the data section of the article and the effects that the imputed data has on the result has not been tested. Since a total of 36 variables had missing units, few observations would have remained.</p>



<p>The Editors and the authors have concluded that the findings of the paper may be biased.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heshmati did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His paper has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including once in February.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0B5019C56E0A6ADCC0E1A2E485FDB8#5">PubPeer comment on the retraction</a>, sleuth Alexander Magazinov said “the imputation as described in the note is way more benign than the one described in the Retraction Watch blog post. Which description is more accurate?”</p>



<p>Heshmati has used the same dataset in past research. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">we reported</a> in February:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In 2020, he and two colleagues published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-020-01986-1">a paper</a> in Empirical Economics, a Springer Nature title, that bore strong resemblance to the 2023 article and relied on the same patched-up dataset. The article mentioned neither the data gaps nor the Excel operations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher told us at the time it was “looking into the matter carefully.” In a May 9 email, however, Deborah Kendall-Cheeseman, a communications manager at Springer Nature, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I’m afraid we don’t have an update we can share at the moment but we’ll let you know once we do.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="214" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?resize=214%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124354" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Paul McCrory</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>More than two years after retracting an article by one of its former editors in chief for plagiarism, the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> has retracted six more pieces by the editor, Paul McCrory, a noted concussion researcher in Australia.</p>



<p>The retractions join 11 more of McCrory’s works, including 10 from <em>BJSM </em>and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/JSR.0000000000001125">one from <em>Current Sports Medicine Reports</em></a>.The <em>BJSM</em>, published by The BMJ, is also correcting two additional articles by McCrory.</p>



<p>Troubles for McCrory – for decades “the world’s foremost doctor shaping the concussion protocols that are used by sports leagues and organizations globally,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/sports/football/paul-mccrory-plagiarism-concussions.html">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a> – began in 2021 when Steve Haake, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/28/this-is-frankly-insulting-an-author-plagiarized-by-a-journal-editor-speaks/">told the <em>BJSM</em></a> McCrory had plagiarized a 2000 article by Haake in <em>Physics World</em>. (It would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/11/neri-oxman-accused-of-lifting-from-article-whose-plagiarism-led-to-downfall-of-concussion-expert/">not be the only time</a> the work was plagiarized.)</p>



<span id="more-129190"></span>



<p>The journal retracted the offending editorial in February 2022, with McCrory apologizing for the “isolated incident.” McCrory told us at the time that he was “sincerely sorry that this has happened and caused [Haake] and his team hurt.” He said he would be requesting another of his articles be retracted.</p>



<p>By then, however, sleuth Nick Brown had started looking into McCrory’s work, and he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/02/was-leading-sports-medicine-researchers-plagiarism-an-isolated-and-unfortunate-incident/">found more problems</a>. In October of that year, the journal retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/10/concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory-earns-nine-more-retractions-nearly-40-expressions-of-concern/">nine more of McCrory’s single-authored editorials</a>, and placed expressions of concern on nearly 40, the total they said they could find in their archives. They revised that number upward significantly after we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/16/bmj-says-its-an-ongoing-effort-to-find-articles-by-concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory/">pointed out that we found 78 such articles</a>, and told us the expressions of concern would remain unless they were replaced with retraction notices.</p>



<p>McCrory, whose University of Melbourne email address no longer seems to work, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/concussion-kingpin-resigns-global-post-over-plagiarism-scandal">resigned from key posts</a> in the wake of the scandal. The <em>BJSM </em>said he <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1327.responses">agreed with the new retractions</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement today, the journal said the retractions and corrections “conclude BMJ’s investigation into research integrity issues concerning Paul McCrory.” The University of Melbourne had also requested an investigation, the journal said.</p>



<p>“As no further concerns have been raised with BMJ about Dr McCrory’s authorship in BMJ journals, no further action will be taken,” Helen Macdonald, the BMJ’s publication ethics and content integrity editor, said in the statement.</p>



<p>Macdonald left open the possibility the McCrory saga is not over: “But should any further allegations be made about Dr McCrory’s work published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine or in any of the other titles in BMJ’s journal portfolio, these will be investigated.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/diagnosis-of-early-dementia-blood-proteins-reveal-potential-risk">Diagnosis of early dementia: blood proteins reveal potential risk</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>A recent study published in Nature has identified blood protein biomarkers that could be used to predict the risk of developing dementia, up to 15 years before diagnosis in clinic. Given that there is currently no cure, early preventative action could prove crucial in our fight against dementia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time of presenting to the clinic, when a person is experiencing symptoms that impact on their daily life, the pathology in the brain is typically very advanced. Any potential treatment options or interventions may be being delivered too late. However, these potential treatments can have much more impact on slowing, stopping, or reversing decline if we can intervene earlier before significant damage is done. Dementia is very difficult to treat, but early detection affords new opportunities for early intervention.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guo et al. analysed data from 52,645 adults (without a dementia diagnosis) who were followed up for up to 14.1 years, with their blood samples analysed repeatedly over this time. By the end of the study period, 1,417 of these participants had developed dementia. Using data from the UK Biobank, it was found that of 1,463 proteins in the blood plasma, changes in the levels of two proteins, GFAP and LTBP2, had high specificity for predicting cases of dementia. This study is a great example of how advances in proteomics and other scientific techniques can be used to provide new insights into large longitudinal datasets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A biomarker is an objective indication of disease that can be accurately and reproducibly measured.  Blood biomarkers are particularly promising, as they are minimally invasive to obtain and relatively cheap to process. This in turn means that they are also a scalable option, suitable to screen large numbers of the population for early signs of disease – in this case, dementia. The Guo et al. study concludes that people with high levels of a specific protein in their blood are more than twice as likely as people with normal levels to develop dementia, and nearly three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, whilst the findings are promising, we must be cautious. Further validation of the new potential blood-based biomarkers is needed and a better understanding of how these changes in protein differ between disease must be a focus for future research.</p>

As we grapple with pressing challenges such as climate change, food security, and biodiversity loss, the importance of innovative agricultural practices has never been more critical.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agriculture is at the heart of human survival and prosperity, but it also faces immense pressures from environmental changes and the growing needs of a global population. <em>BMC Agriculture</em> aims to address these issues by advancing research in areas such as  crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.  It joins our expanding portfolio of journals covering these topics, including <a href="https://bmcenvsci.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Environmental Science</em></a>, launched only last year and <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></a>, one of our earliest <em>BMC series</em> journals. At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p>
<p>Aligned with the objectives of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, <em>BMC Agriculture</em> particularly encourages papers focused on zero hunger (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">SDG2</a>), good health and well-being (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG3</a>), clean water and sanitation (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG6</a>), responsible consumption and production (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">SDG12</a>), climate action (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">SDG13</a>), life below water (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">SDG14</a>) and life on land (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">SDG15</a>). These focus areas highlight the journal&#8217;s commitment to not only advancing scientific understanding but also contributing practical solutions that enhance global welfare.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the ethos of the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC series</em>,</a> our journal stands for open, robust and reproducible science with <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/open-data">freely available data</a> to speed up the pace of discovery. We support <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a> and make editorial decisions based on the validity and rigor of a study rather than its perceived impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>BMC Agriculture</em> will be launching this summer and we are now looking for researchers to join the editorial board.

<br /><p>Much development has been directed toward improving the performance and automation of spike sorting. This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike&nbsp;sorters.</p>

<p>On March 1, 2022, Eric Ross, then a psychiatrist-in-training in Boston, alerted two major publishers to a pair of disturbingly similar papers he suspected had been “fabricated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The articles are written by the same corresponding author and contain much of the same unrealistic data,” Ross, now an assistant professor at the University of Vermont, in Burlington, wrote in an email whose recipients included the editors-in-chief of Wiley’s <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em> and Springer Nature’s <em>Neurotherapeutics.</em></p>



<p>Ross listed several “red flags” he felt clearly pointed to “research misconduct” in the two papers, which reported on two separate clinical trials of new antidepressant add-on medications (metformin and cilostazol). He also emphasized that fake medical research could have real consequences:</p>



<span id="more-129183"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research misconduct is damaging in any field, but I am particularly disturbed by these articles. Besides its harms to the research community, a fabricated clinical trial with clinically actionable conclusions has the potential to do real and immediate harm to patients. I have already seen one of these articles picked up for discussion on a popular psychiatry podcast; I would hate to see clinicians begin acting on this information in their practice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then he waited.</p>



<p>After six months, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> pulled one of the studies, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-022-01291-y">stating</a> in a Sept. 7, 2022, notice, “there are serious issues with the ethical oversight, the reporting and the availability of audited data for this clinical trial.” Yet nearly a year after Ross’s email, the paper in <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics </em>remained in place, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/08/i-was-fired-up-psychiatrist-effort-prompts-retraction-of-antidepressant-treatment-paper/">we reported</a> in February 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think this was [a case] where it took a lot of, you know, complex sleuthing, like doing statistical analysis or anything like that, to be very suspicious about these papers,” Ross told us at the time.</p>



<p>Now, after two years, the Wiley journal has finally issued a retraction. In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.14667">a March 11 notice</a>, the publisher stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, multiple concerns were raised by a third party about the integrity of the clinical trial. An investigation revealed significant issues regarding the reliability of the reported data. As a result, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the validity of the results presented in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 11 times since Ross first contacted the journal, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science &#8212; including by a Hindawi/Wiley journal paper that was since <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2024/9860462/">retracted for likely paper mill activity</a>.</p>



<p>We contacted Wiley on Friday to learn what caused the long delay, particularly given Springer Nature’s previous retraction, but have yet to hear back from the publisher, which recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">trumpeted its efforts</a> to retract thousands of paper mill articles from its Hindawi subsidiary. An email seeking comment from the corresponding author of the two papers, Mahmoud S. Abdallah of the University of Sadat City, in Egypt, also went unanswered.</p>
