              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-dysentery-giardia-parasite-toilet">Oldest traces of a dysentery-causing parasite were found in ancient toilets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giardia has plagued people for a long time.</p>



<p>The parasite can bring about dysentery — a miserable (and occasionally deadly) mixture of diarrhea, cramps and fever. Scientists have now uncovered traces of the giardia parasite in the remains of two roughly 2,600-year-old toilets once used by the wealthy denizens of Jerusalem. The remains are <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182023000410" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest known biological evidence of giardia</a> anywhere in the world, researchers report May 25 in <em>Parasitology</em>.</p>



<p>The single-cell parasite <em>Giardia duodenalis </em>can be found today in human guts around the planet. This wasn’t always the case — but working out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-bacteria-infection-medieval-child-haemophilus-influenzae-type-b">how pathogens made their debut</a> and moved around is no easy feat (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). While some intestinal parasites can be preserved for centuries in the ground, others, like giardia, quickly disintegrate and can’t be spotted under a microscope.</p>





<p>In 1991 and 2019, archeologists working at two sites in Jerusalem came across stone toilet seats in the remains of mansionlike homes. These “were quite posh toilets” used by “swanky people,” says Piers Mitchel, a paleoparasitolgist at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>The original excavators of soil taken from beneath the seats of these toilets glimpsed traces of roundworm and other possible intestinal parasites in soil samples put under a microscope. Mitchel and his colleagues built on this analysis by using antibodies to search for the remains of giardia and two other fragile parasites in the millennia-old decomposed feces under both seats.</p>



<p>There was “plenty of doubt” that giardia was around in Jerusalem at the time because it’s so hard to reconstruct the movement of ancient disease, Mitchel says.</p>



<p>But the find hints that it was a regular presence in the region, says Mattieu le Bailly, a paleoparasitolgist at the University Bourgogne Franche-Comté in Besançon, France, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>The idea that a pathogen like giardia, which spreads via contaminated water and sometimes flies, existed and was possibly widespread in ancient Jerusalem makes a lot of sense, Mitchel says, given the hot, dry, insect-ridden climate around the Iron Age city.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-microbes-climate-young-trees">Soil microbes that survived tough climates can help young trees do the same</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microbial stress can be a boon for young trees.</p>



<p>Saplings grown in soil microbes that have experienced drought, cold or heat are <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2027?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D04632587591522892811387901287291181512%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1684867390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to survive</a> when faced with those same conditions, researchers report in the May 26 <em>Science</em>. And follow-up tests suggest that the microbes’ protective relationship with trees may linger beyond initial planting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team’s findings could aid massive tree planting efforts by giving new saplings the best chance of survival over the long run, says Ian Sanders, a plant and fungal ecologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. “If you can control which microbes are put onto tree saplings in a nursery, you can probably help to determine whether they’re going to survive or not when they’re transplanted to the field.”</p>





<p>As climate change pushes global temperatures ever higher, many species must either adapt to new conditions or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-early-primates-lived-swampy-arctic">follow their ideal climate</a> to new places (<em>SN: 1/25/23</em>). While forests’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-antarctica-south-pole-roughly-90-million-years-ago">ranges have changed</a> as Earth’s climate has warmed and cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the pace of current climate change is too fast for trees to keep up (<em>SN: 4/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>Trees live a long time, and they don’t move or evolve very quickly, says Richard Lankau, a forest ecologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. They do have close relationships with fast-adapting soil microbes, including fungi, which can help plants survive stressful conditions.</p>



<p>But it was unclear whether microbes that had previously survived various climates and stresses might give inexperienced baby trees encountering a changing climate a leg up. With friends in the soil, “trees might have more tools in their toolkit than we give them credit for” to survive tough conditions, Lankau says.</p>



<p>For the study, Lankau and fellow ecologists Cassandra Allsup and Isabelle George — both also at UW–Madison — collected soil from 12 spots in Wisconsin and Illinois that varied in temperature and amount of rain. The team then used the soils to plant an abundance of 12 native tree species, including white oak (<em>Quercus alba</em>) and silver maple (<em>Acer saccharinum</em>). Overall, “we had thousands of plants we were monitoring,” Allsup says.</p>



<p>Those saplings grew in the soils in a greenhouse for two months before being transplanted in one of two field sites — one warm and one cold. To simulate drought, some trees in each spot were placed under transparent plastic sheets that blocked direct rainfall.</p>



<p>One site in northern Wisconsin was at the northern edge of the trees’ range and represented how trees might take root in a new area that’s getting warm enough for them to grow. There, trees planted in soil containing cold-adapted microbes better survived Wisconsin’s frigid winter temperatures. Plants that faced drought in addition to the cold, on the other hand, didn’t have the same benefit.</p>



<p>The other location, set up in central Illinois, was designed to represent a region where the climate is getting too hot or dry for the tree species to tolerate. Saplings grown in soil with microbes from arid spots were more likely to survive a lack of rain. But those grown in soils with heat-tolerant microbes were only slightly more likely to survive when they received normal rainfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Resident species already living in the area didn’t outcompete all of the transplanted microbes. Newly introduced fungi persisted in the soil for three years, a sign that any protective effects might last at least that long, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s still unclear which microbes best aid the trees. Analyses of microbes living in the soil hinted that fungi that live inside plant roots may better help trees survive drought. Cold-adapted soils seem to have fewer fungal species. But soils also contain bacteria, archaea and protists, Sanders says. “We don’t know what it is yet that seems to affect the plant survival in these changing climates.”</p>





<p>Determining which microbes are the important ones and whether there are specific conditions that best suit the soil is next up on the list, Allsup says. For example, can dry-adapted soil from Iowa help when planting trees in Illinois? “We need to think more about soils and combinations and [transplant] success… to actually save the forest.”</p>



<p>One caution, Sanders says, is that transporting microbes from one place to another en masse could bring the bad along with the good. Some microbes might be pathogens in the new place where they’re transplanted. “That’s also a big danger.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>More than 5,000 animal species previously unknown to science live in a pristine part of the deep sea.</p>



<p>Their home — called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone — sits in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. The zone is roughly twice the size of India, sits 4,000 to 6,000 meters deep and is largely a mystery, like much of the deep sea.</p>



<p>In a new study, scientists amassed and analyzed more than 100,000 published records of animals found in the zone, with some records dating back to the 1870s. About 90 percent of species<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00534-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> from these records were previously undescribed</a>: There were only about 440 named species compared with roughly 5,100 without scientific names. Worms and arthropods make up the bulk of the undescribed creatures, but other animals found there include sponges, sea cucumbers and corals, the researchers report May 25 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“The diversity down there does surprise me,” says study coauthor Muriel Rabone, a data analyst and biologist at the Natural History Museum in London. “It’s just astonishing.”</p>

<h3>Life in the deep</h3>



<p>A new study analyzed more than 100,000 records of animals found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a large area of the seafloor in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. About 90 percent of species from the records were unknown to science (orange). The majority of animals there are in the phyla Annelida and Arthropoda, which include creatures like worms and crustaceans.</p>

<p>Due to its rich content of minerals like cobalt and nickel, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is sought after by mining companies. About a sixth of it, roughly a million square kilometers, has already been promised to companies for exploration.</p>





<p>Many of the named species in the new study have been found only in the zone, emphasizing how important it is to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-deep-sea-sponge-could-play-starring-role-monitoring-ocean-health">establish a biodiversity baseline</a> for the area before mining starts, Rabone says. But the area is deep and remote, making data collection there difficult and expensive (<em>SN: 11/10/17</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, deep-sea ecosystems are connected to the ecosystems above them, Rabone says, such as through nutrient cycling. Scientists need to understand more about the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and areas like it to anticipate how the effects of mining may bubble up to the ocean surface.</p>

<p>Springer Nature will retract an article that reported results of a survey of parents who thought their children’s gender dysphoria resulted from social contagion. The move is “due to concerns about lack of informed consent,” according to tweets by one of the paper’s authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9">Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible Cases</a>,” was published in March in the <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>. It has not been cited in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, but Altmetric, which tracks the online attention papers receive, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9/metrics">ranks</a> the article in the top 1% of all articles of a similar age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) is, the article stated, a “controversial theory” that “common cultural beliefs, values, and preoccupations cause some adolescents (especially female adolescents) to attribute their social problems, feelings, and mental health issues to gender dysphoria,” and that “youth with ROGD falsely believe that they are transgender,” in part due to social influences.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://psychology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/profiles/michael-bailey.html">Michael Bailey</a>, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and the paper’s corresponding author, tweeted:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bailey told Retraction Watch that he would “respond when [he] can” to our request for comment, following “new developments on our end.” Neither Springer Nature nor Kenneth Zucker, editor in chief of <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>, has responded to similar requests. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper reported the results of a survey of parents who contacted the website ParentsofROGDKids.com, with which the first author is affiliated. According to the abstract, the authors found:&nbsp;</p>

According to the parents, AYA children’s mental health deteriorated considerably after social transition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after publication, the paper attracted criticism that its method of gathering study participants was biased, and that the authors ignored information that didn’t support the theory of ROGD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The episode prompted a May 5 &#8220;<a href="https://www.fairforall.org/open-letters/archives-of-sexual-behavior/">Open Letter in Support of Dr. Kenneth Zucker and the Need to Promote Robust Scientific Debate</a>&#8221; from the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism that has now been signed by nearly 2000 people.</p>



<p> On May 10, the following publisher’s note was added to the article: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>readers are alerted that concerns have been raised regarding methodology as described in this article. The publisher is currently investigating this matter and a further response will follow the conclusion of this investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Six days later, the publisher removed the article’s supplementary information “due to a lack of documented consent by study participants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The story may feel familiar to readers who recall what happened to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">another paper in 2018</a>. In that paper, Brown University’s Lisa Littman coined the term ROGD. Following a backlash, Brown <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/29/reader-outcry-prompts-brown-to-retract-press-release-on-trans-teens/">took down a press release</a> touting the results, and the paper was eventually <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214157">republished with corrections</a>.</p>



<p>Bailey has been accused of mistreating transgender research participants, but an investigation by bioethicist Alice Dreger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170124/">found</a> that of the many accusations, “almost none appear to have been legitimate.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://unherd.com/2023/05/why-is-my-gender-research-being-cancelled/">post on UnHerd</a> earlier this month, Bailey responded to the reported concerns about the study lacking approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and that the way the participants were recruited biased the results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IRB approval was not necessary, Bailey wrote, because Suzanna Diaz, the first author who collected the data, was not affiliated with an institution that required it. “Suzanna Diaz” is a pseudonym for “the mother of a gender dysphoric child she believes has ROGD” who wishes to remain anonymous for the sake of her family, Bailey wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper included the following statement about its ethical approval:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The first author and creator of the survey is not affiliated with any university or hospital. Thus, she did not seek approval from an IRB. After seeing a presentation of preliminary survey results by the first author, the second author suggested the data to be analyzed and submitted as an academic article (he was not involved in collecting the data). The second author consulted with his university’s IRB, who declined to certify the study because data were already collected. However, they advised that publishing the results was likely ethical provided data were deidentified. Editor’s note: After I reviewed the manuscript, I concluded that its publication is ethically appropriate, consistent with Springer policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his UnHerd post, Bailey quoted from the journal’s <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10508/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20involving%20human%20participants,%20their%20data%20or%20biological%20material">submission guidelines</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the Editor&#8217;s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/painting-beer-brew-yeast-art-canvas-denmark">19th century painters may have primed their canvases with beer-brewing leftovers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beer breweries’ trash may have been Danish painters’ treasure.</p>



<p>The base layer of several paintings created in Denmark in the mid-1800s <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade7686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contains remnants of cereal grains and brewer’s yeast</a>, the latter being a common by-product of the beer brewing process, researchers report May 24 in <em>Science Advances.</em> The finding hints that artists may have used the leftovers to prime their canvases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Records suggest that Danish house painters sometimes created glossy, decorative paint by adding beer, says Cecil Krarup Andersen, a conservator at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. But yeast and cereal grains have never been found in primer.</p>





<p>Andersen had been studying paintings from the Danish Golden Age, an explosion of artistic creativity in the first half of the 19th century, at the National Gallery of Denmark. Understanding these paintings’ chemical compositions is key to preserving them, she says. As part of this work, she and colleagues looked at 10 pieces by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, considered the father of Danish painting, and his protégé Christen Schiellerup Købke.</p>



<p>Canvas trimmings from an earlier conservation effort allowed for an in-depth analysis that wouldn’t have otherwise been possible, since the process destroys samples. In seven paintings, <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </em>proteins turned up, as well as various combinations of wheat, barley, buckwheat and rye proteins. All these proteins are involved in beer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biochemist-brews-wild-beer">fermentation</a> (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>).</p>



<p>Tests of an experimental primer that the researchers whipped up using residual yeast from modern beer brewing showed that the mixture held together and provided a stable painting surface — a primary purpose of a primer. And this concoction worked much better than one made with beer.</p>



<p>Beer was the most common drink in 1800s Denmark, and it was akin to liquid gold. Water needed to be treated prior to consuming and the brewing process took care of that. As a result, plenty of residual yeast would have been available for artists to purchase, the researchers say.</p>



<p>If the beer by-product is found in paintings by other artists, Andersen says, that information can help conservators better preserve the works and better understand the artists’ lives and craftsmanship. “It’s another piece of the puzzle.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-paralysis-walk">A brain implant helped a man with paralysis walk more naturally</a></h4>

              
                <p>A system that restores communication between the brain and spine has enabled a man paralyzed by a spinal cord injury to regain near natural walking ability.</p>



<p>Once the patient’s brain activity was decoded, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06094-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain-spine interface</a> took mere minutes to calibrate, after which the man reported natural-feeling control over movements. He still needs crutches but can easily navigate ramps and steps, surpassing gains from previous treatments, researchers report May 24 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“The results are consistent with what I’d hope would happen, which is encouraging,” says V. Reggie Edgerton, a physiologist at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, Calif., who was not involved in the study. In terms of treating spinal cord paralysis, he says, “we’re at the stage of the Wright brothers and flight.”</p>





<p>Spinal cord injuries can interrupt communication between the brain and spine, causing paralysis. Previous research showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">stimulating spinal cord nerves can produce movement</a> (<em>SN: 8/3/22</em>), but this is the first time that a patient’s own brain activity has been used to re-establish voluntary control of leg movements.</p>



<p>A biking accident 11 years ago left 40-year-old Gert-Jan Oskam paralyzed, with an incomplete spinal cord injury. Five years later, he enrolled in a clinical trial involving a spinal cord implant that stimulates nerves that control leg movements. Oskam <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01663-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regained the ability to step with a walker</a>, but this involved making unnatural heel movements, picked up by motion sensors, to trigger preprogramed nerve stimulation patterns. He had difficulty starting and stopping, and could walk only over flat surfaces.</p>



<p>The new study aimed to hand control over to Oskam’s brain. “Despite using the [spinal cord implant] stimulation for three years, he hit a plateau in his recovery, and became interested in using the new brain-controlled stimulation,” says Grégoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. “So he became our first test pilot.”</p>



<p>Courtine and colleagues added a brain implant to create a system that translates thought into movement. Two electrode arrays that sit on the surface of the brain record activity from the sensorimotor cortex, a region of the brain that helps direct muscle movements. These signals are sent wirelessly to a processing unit that converts them into stimulation patterns, which are transmitted to the spinal cord implant.</p>



<p>After implantation, Courtine and colleagues asked Oskam to attempt leg joint movements while they analyzed his brain activity. Different patterns of activity differentiated hip, knee and ankle movements, the researchers found, enabling them to map brain signals to intended movements. The team created stimulation patterns targeting muscles that control putting weight down, pushing forward and leg swings, to reproduce walking motions. During use, an artificial intelligence algorithm translates incoming brain signals into appropriate commands signals for the spinal implant.</p>



<p>The researchers calibrated the system so that Oskam could control the amount of movement. “This brings a more fluid walking pattern,” Courtine says, helping him adapt his foot placement and even climb staircases.</p>





<p>“The stimulation before was controlling me, and now I’m controlling the stimulation,” Oskam said May 23 during a news conference.</p>



<p>A “neurorehabilitation” training program while using the device led to mobility improvements even with the brain-spine interface turned off, the researchers found. “This suggests new nerve connections developed,” Courtine says.</p>



<p>Researchers need to understand more about how this recovery works. “The question is: Where in the brain is getting connected to where in the spinal cord? And we don&#8217;t really know that,” Edgerton says. “We need to figure out how the two are working together.”</p>



<p>The extent of Oskam’s recovery delivered quality of life boosts, such as moving around the house independently, or standing at a bar drinking with friends. “That&#8217;s the goal of a lot of people who are completely paralyzed,” Edgerton says. “To be standing at a bar, looking people eye to eye.” While many paralyzed people prioritize other problems, such as bathroom function and blood pressure, this study aimed only to restore mobility..</p>



<p>Oskam has been using the system for nearly two years now, Courtine says, and the brain implant has remained stable and reliable.</p>



<p>The researchers think the approach will work for other patients, but caution that the extent of recovery may depend on the severity of injury. “You have to be careful to calibrate expectations,” Courtine says. “But I&#8217;m confident we can reproduce the same outcome, especially in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury.”</p>



<p>The team plans to apply the approach to the upper limbs too, neuroscientist Henri Lorach, also at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, said during the news conference. “We are initiating a clinical trial in three participants that will target these circuits.” It may also be possible to treat paralysis caused by stroke, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Courtine and colleagues developed a version of the system that Oskam could operate himself at home, but further improvements are still needed. The processing unit is bulky, for example, and the brain implant involves two 5-centimeter-wide cylinders that sit in holes cut in the skull.</p>



<p>Onward Medical, a Lausanne-based company cofounded by Courtine, is working on miniaturizing the brain implant and processing unit, Courtine says, to develop a commercial version that “is easy for patients to use in daily life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiny-mice-armadillo-armor-tails">Spiny mice have armadillo-like armor in their tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spiny mouse is an unassuming rodent, but it’s armed with a very special tail.</p>



<p>CT scans show the <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)00856-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail is sheathed in a secret blanket of bony plates</a>. Before the scans, only one other group of modern mammals was known to wield this kind of armor: armadillos. The discovery, reported May 24 in <em>iScience</em>, may mean that the skin bones are more widespread in mammals than previously thought and could shed light on their evolution.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The rodent’s secret was revealed when evolutionary biologist Edward Stanley of the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville put a museum specimen of a spiny mouse (<em>Acomys spp</em>.) in an X-ray machine as part of a multi-institutional project to develop 3-D digital models of all vertebrate life.</p>



<p>It was a “nondescript looking” mouse with slightly spiky fur, Stanley says. But in the initial X-ray, its tail looked unusual. “It looked kind of dark and weird,” he says.</p>



<p>A more detailed CT scan showed the mouse’s whole tail was covered in overlapping bony plates within the skin, under the surface layers.</p>



<p>To understand how the bony plates develop, Stanley and his colleagues teamed with Malcolm Maden, a developmental biologist at the University of Florida. The team scanned the tails of newborn spiny mice up to those that were 6 weeks old. Bony plates form first near the base of the tail and then as the mouse ages, grow down the tail to its tip. CT scans revealed that three other species in the same subfamily as the spiny mouse also have armor-studded tails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These bony plates, called osteoderms, may help keep spiny mice and their relatives alive. The rodents’ skin is especially fragile and easily tears off, particularly on the tail. It’s hypothesized that the tearaway skin is a macabre defense, where attacking predators are left with a mouthful or paw full of shed skin. The plates may prevent predators from piercing too deep. </p>



<p>“If you can stop the teeth or the claws of your predator at the tearaway boundary, then it’s much easier to get away,” Stanley explains. The mice regenerate the lost skin later.</p>



<p>But the tail’s skin bones might protect against more than just predators. For some reason, spiny mice routinely bite each other’s tails, says Ashley Seifert, a developmental biologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. “So maybe they have evolved osteoderms as armament, but to defend their tails from each other instead of predators.”</p>





<p>To better understand the biological underpinnings of the bony skin, the researchers took skin samples from the tails of newborn spiny mice in places with and without osteoderms and analyzed gene activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In skin samples with osteoderms, the activity of a suite of genes associated with bone cell development was boosted compared with samples without osteoderms. But the activity of genes that make keratin, a key building block for skin, was ramped down. The next step, Maden says, is to see how all these genes actually grow the osteoderms.</p>



<p>The research could help provide insights into osteoderm evolution. Bony skin is found in a variety of reptile groups, having evolved independently in crocodilians, many different lizard groups and some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ankylosaur-dinosaur-tail-club-bludgeon">dinosaurs</a> (but no birds) (<em>SN: 12/6/22</em>). Madagascar’s fish-scaled geckos have osteoderms and shed skin like spiny mice. Aside from the rodents in the new study and armadillos, the only other known mammals with bony skin are all extinct: an ancient hedgehog-like animal called <em>Pholidocercus</em>, ground sloths and armadillo relatives called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/surprise-ancient-armadillos-are-related-modern-armadillos">glyptodonts</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/16</em>).</p>



<p>Delving into gene activity patterns is rarely done in osteoderm research, says Chris Broeckhoven, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. Having this comparative data from mice available could yield key evolutionary insights.</p>



<p>One key insight, Maden says, could be “why [osteoderms] keep appearing in evolution and then disappear.”</p>



<p>It’s also possible osteoderms are more common among vertebrates than previously thought. No snakes were known to have the bony skin and then in April researchers reported finding them in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33244-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sand boas</a>.</p>



<p>These discoveries are “a good example of how you should look at the world around you,” Maden says. “Who knows what you will discover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-lightning-bolt-contort-earth">Jupiter’s lightning bolts contort the same way as Earth’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>On Jupiter, lightning jerks and jolts a lot like it does on Earth.</p>



<p>Jovian lightning emits radio wave pulses that are typically separated by about one millisecond, researchers report May 23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The energetic prestissimo, the scientists say, is a sign that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38351-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the gas giant’s lightning propagates in pulses</a>, at a pace comparable to that of the bolts that cavort through our own planet’s thunderclouds. The similarities between the two world’s electrical phenomena could have implications for the search for alien life.</p>





<p>Arcs of lightning on both worlds appear to move somewhat like a winded hiker going up a mountain, pausing after each step to catch their breath, says Ivana Kolmašová, an atmospheric physicist at the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague. “One step, another step, then another step … and so on.”</p>



<p>Here on Earth, lightning forms as turbulent winds within thunderclouds cause many ice crystals and water droplets to rub together, become charged and then move to opposite sides of the clouds, progressively generating static electrical charges. When the charges grow big enough to overcome the air’s ability to insulate them, electrons are released — the lightning takes its first step. From there, the surging electrons will repeatedly ionize the air and rush into it, lurching the bolt forward at an average of hundreds of thousands of meters per second.</p>



<p>Scientists have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exotic-lightning-jupiter-clouds-nasa-juno-images">superbolts observed in Jovian clouds</a> might also form by collisions between ice crystals and water droplets (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>). But no one knew whether the alien bolts extended and branched in increments, as they do on Earth, or if they took some other form.</p>



<p>For the new study, Kolmašová and her colleagues used five years of radio wave data collected by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-juno-jupiter-moons-mission">NASA’s Juno spacecraft</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/22</em>). Analyzing hundreds of thousands of radio wave snapshots, the team found radio wave emissions from Jovian lightning appeared to pulse at a rate comparable to that of Earth’s intracloud lightning — arcs of electricity that never strike ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If bolts extend through Jupiter’s water clouds at a similar velocity as they do in Earth’s clouds, then Jovian lightning might branch and extend in steps that are hundreds to thousands of meters long. That’s comparable in length to the jolted strides of Earth’s intracloud lightning, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“That’s a perfectly reasonable explanation,” says atmospheric physicist Richard Sonnenfeld of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, who wasn’t involved in the study. Alternatively, he says, the signals could be produced as pulses of electrical current propagate back and forth along tendrils of lightning that have already formed, rather than from the stop-and-go advancements of a new bolt. On Earth, such currents cause some bolts to appear to flicker.</p>



<p>But stop and go seems like a sound interpretation, says atmospheric physicist Yoav Yair of Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel. Kolmašová and her colleagues “show that if you&#8217;re discharging a cloud … the physics remains basically the same [on Jupiter as on Earth], and the current will behave the same.”</p>





<p>If that universality is real, it could have implications for the search for life elsewhere. Experiments have shown that lightning strikes on Earth could have smelted some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry">chemical ingredients</a> needed to form the building blocks of life (<em>SN: 3/16/21</em>). If lightning is discharging in a similar way on alien worlds, Yair says, then it could be producing similar ingredients in those places too.</p>

<p>Four of Mohammadhosseini’s studies are being retracted from the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production.</em> They are:</p>

</ul>



<p>Though the studies have not yet been retracted, Retraction Watch learned of the upcoming retractions from an anonymous whistleblower who goes by the name Artemisia Stricta. Artemisia, who originally raised the concerns about Mohammadhosseini’s research in October 2022, was informed of the upcoming retractions on May 8 by Chunyan Wang, assistant editor of the journal, and alerted Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, told Retraction Watch that “the investigations of the five papers have concluded, and the retraction notices for the four papers will be published in the coming weeks.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In October 2022, Artemisia emailed editors of each of the 11 journals that had published these studies. Between 2015 and 2022, Artemisia noted that Mohammadhosseini published 33 papers using the same research on this formulation of concrete. Artemisia wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Notably, even when different materials or conditions were reported (e.g., prepacked vs. mixed-in aggregate, unexposed vs. sulfate-exposed concrete), identical results were sometimes shown. This indicates potential falsification. It is also notable that identical (or nearly-identical) work was often published with varying authorship lists, indicating either ghost or gift authorship.</p>



<p>Generally, it appears that the authors submitted similar publications in parallel, which would have allowed them to avoid detection for duplicate submission. Of course, as part of the submission process, authors are generally required to attest that they will not do so, as such duplicate publication wastes the resources of journals/publishers and skews the scientific literature.</p>



<p>As I am sure you will agree, such conduct, if confirmed, would violate publication ethics and may constitute grounds for retraction of the papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of these 33 papers had already been retracted when Artemisia wrote this message, and since then, five others have been retracted, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHossein%2bMohammadhosseini">Retraction Watch Database</a>.</p>



<p>Though Artemisia originally raised concerns about five papers published in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production,</em> the journal ultimately decided to retract only four of them. In response to questions from Retraction Watch,an Elsevier spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Artemisia Stricta contacted the Editor of JCLP with concerns about five papers.&nbsp; We investigated all five papers and found that – in four of them – images and data had been re-used from already published papers.&nbsp; The author was asked to provide explanations, denied duplication but ultimately upon further review the decision was made to retract 4 of the 5 papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, Artemisia reiterated that they believe all five papers contain duplicated material and should have been retracted. Artemisia also said they believed that in all, there were about 40 papers published by this researcher and their coauthors that should be retracted.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Though Mohammadhosseini did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, Artemisia forwarded us an email that Mohammadhosseini had sent them in October 2022, which Artemisia said is the first such email they have received directly from a researcher asking them to stop raising concerns about the researcher’s work. In the message, Mohammadhosseini wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We expected if there were a mistakes in our papers, you would contact us directly and help us to resolve it, but unfortunately, you did this in a way that the journal’s editor, my colleagues, and friends thought wrong about me, and it embarrassed me.</p>



<p>I don’t understand the reason behind this action. You have emailed all journals and mentioned duplication, which is not correct, as I reuse some of the common pictures in relevant papers.</p>



<p>You have done what you want to destroy my life and career, which is not fair, but I confirm and guarantee that there is no wanted duplication to ignore the journal’s ethics.</p>



<p>I hope you are satisfied with what you did, and I request you stop playing with my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Artemisia wrote that while they “feel a lot of compassion” for Mohammadhosseini, he does not seem to understand how his misconduct has damaged this field of study. For instance, Artemisia noted that because research like this is used in building codes, falsified data can claim lives.</p>



<p>Along with his message, Mohammadhosseini forwarded Artemisia an email he had received claiming to know Artemisia’s identity. Artemisia said the claims in the message were not only false but dangerous, and that at least one researcher, who might be the one identified in the email, has had death threats made against them and their family based on the false notion that this person was Artemisia. Artemisia wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By and large, the scientific community (to include editors at prominent journals and publishers) has received my allegations with hostility. Revenge, retaliation, and bluster seem to be kneejerk reactions, and their deterrent effect cannot be overlooked. Prominent researchers, when not actively complicit, often allow this atmosphere to fester by inaction.</p>

                <p>Deblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind.</p>

<p>Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natya, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I&#8217;m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.”</p>



<p>That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders.</p>





<p>“She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.”</p>



<h4>A focus on nanoelectronics</h4>



<p>Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering.</p>



<p>At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house.</p>



<p>“That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.”</p>





<p>After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics.</p>



<p>One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/century-scientific-innovation-invention-technology">common silicon transistors</a> (<em>SN: 3/18/22</em>). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering.</p>



<h4>When tech meets the body</h4>



<p>Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00912-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amyloid-beta plaques</a> as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32862-4#article-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cell Rover</a>, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules.</p>



<p>Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it.</p>

<p>She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.”</p>



<p>One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implants-chronic-pain">Brain implants have revealed a signature for chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists can see chronic pain in the brain with new clarity.</p>



<p>Over months, electrodes implanted in the brains of four people picked up specific signs of their persistent pain. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01338-z" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01338-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed view of chronic pain</a>, described May 22 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, suggests new ways to curtail the devastating condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The approach “provides a way into the brain to track pain,” says Katherine Martucci, a neuroscientist who studies chronic pain at Duke University School of Medicine.</p>





<p>Chronic pain is incredibly common. In the United States from 2019 to 2020, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more adults were diagnosed with chronic pain</a> than with diabetes, depression or high blood pressure, researchers reported May 16 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Chronic pain is also incredibly complex, an amalgam influenced by the body, brain, context, emotions and expectations, Martucci says. That complexity makes chronic pain seemingly invisible to an outsider, and very difficult to treat.</p>



<p>One treatment approach is to stimulate the brain with electricity. As part of a clinical trial, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco implanted four electrode wires into the brains of four volunteers with chronic pain. These electrodes can both monitor and stimulate nerve cells in two brain areas: the orbitofrontal cortex, or OFC, and the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC. The OFC isn’t known to be a key pain influencer in the brain, but this region has lots of neural connections to pain-related areas, including the ACC, which is thought to be involved in how people experience pain.</p>

These electrodes are controlled by two devices implanted on the upper chest.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124784">P. Shirvalkar</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But before researchers stimulated the brain, they needed to know how chronic pain was affecting it. For about 3 to 6 months, the implanted electrodes monitored brain signals of these people as they went about their lives. During that time, the participants rated their pain on standard scales two to eight times a day.<br><br>Using sophisticated machine learning approaches, researchers then linked each person’s pain ratings to their brain activity patterns, ultimately landing on a signature of each person’s chronic pain.</p>



<p>In many ways, the patterns were unique to each person, but there was overlap: Brain activity in the OFC, an area at the front of the brain just behind the eyes, tracked with people’s chronic pain levels. Some unexpected pain patterns cropped up along the way, too. Two volunteers’ pain fluctuated on a roughly three-day cycle, for instance.</p>



<p>Brain activity in the OFC could represent a solid biomarker of chronic pain, a signal that could both help doctors track treatment responses and serve as new targets for treatment, says neuroscientist Chelsea Kaplan of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>





<p>The study was done on only four people, three with pain from a stroke and one with phantom limb pain after a leg amputation. “We would need to know if these findings can generalize to other patients and pain conditions,” Kaplan says.</p>



<p>If brain activity patterns end up being common across people with chronic pain, they might one day be used to measure pain in people who can’t communicate, Martucci says. That includes people in nonresponsive states such as those with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-activity-unconscious-patients-offers-new-views-awareness">locked-in syndrome</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/15</em>).</p>



<p>Yet the goal of identifying reliable markers of chronic pain is not necessarily to establish whether a person is in pain, or serve as a yes-no diagnostic test, study coauthor Prasad Shirvalkar, a neurologist at UCSF, said in a May 18 news briefing. Instead, it’s to guide treatment. Shirvalkar and his colleagues are now conducting a clinical trial that involves stimulating peoples’ brains to treat chronic pain. “I think of [the biomarker] as one tool to actually help treat a patient, to actually make them feel more seen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-400-million-years-age">Saturn’s rings may be no more than 400 million years old</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s rings might have formed while trilobites scuttled about on Earth. Space dust has been accumulating on the icy halos for <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf8537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no more than 400 million years</a>, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The 4.5-billion-year-old planet appears to have acquired its iconic ornamentation relatively recently, says physicist Sascha Kempf of the University of Colorado Boulder. “We’re quite lucky to see a ring in the first place.”</p>



<p>The rings of Saturn are made of countless icy particles, which become covered with dust as tiny meteoroids strike them. These dustings darken the rings’ complexion, like mud sullies snow on roads in winter.</p>





<p>This cosmic staining was key to the new analysis, as was the now-defunct Cassini spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyzer. From 2004 to 2017, the instrument caught dust-sized micrometeoroids moving around Saturn, measuring their velocity, mass, charge and composition.</p>



<p>Kempf and colleagues identified about 160 particles — out of millions — that could have hailed from beyond the Saturn system. The researchers estimated the rate at which the incoming dust accumulates on Saturn’s rings, and calculated how long it would have taken to darken the rings to their observed color. The planet’s hoops might have materialized more than 100 million years after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fly-fossils-might-challenge-idea-ancient-trilobites-crystal-eyes">trilobites</a> — mysterious, extinct invertebrates — appeared on Earth, the team found (<em>SN: 8/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>The age of the rings has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experts-dont-agree-age-saturn-rings">debated for decades</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/16</em>). Even after the new study, there’s still disagreement.</p>



<p>If the rings are somehow losing dust over time, they could be ancient, says planetary scientist Aurélien Crida of Université Côte d&#8217;Azur in Nice, France, who was not involved in the study. “Possibly as old as Saturn.”</p>



<p>It seems clear that the rings have been exposed to micrometeoroid impacts for at least a hundred million years, Crida says. But simulations of the rings’ formation from the gravitational shredding of an early moon suggest their size is consistent with an age of billions of years, he says. And researchers have reported silicate grains <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-ring-rain-surprising-cocktail-chemicals">falling from the rings</a> into Saturn’s atmosphere (<em>SN: 10/4/18)</em>. Some unidentified process might be cleaning the rings of the micrometeoroid dust, making them appear younger than they are, Crida says.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the previously reported falling dust might come from meteoroid impacts that shatter ring ice, Kempf says.</p>





<p>Experiments that smash micrometeoroids into ice particles could help resolve the discrepancy, Crida says. For now, the debate over the age of the rings lives on.</p>

<p>In 2018, a newly minted PhD made an uncomfortable discovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a conference, he saw other researchers presenting the results of their attempt to replicate the work of one of his fellow students at Wageningen University in the Netherlands who had found a relationship between heavy rainfall and the number of prisoners in Nigeria in the first half of the 20th century.</p>



<p>But they couldn’t replicate the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127138"></span>



<p>After the presentation, the researchers discussed the discrepancy, and found that while both projects had used the same colonial records as the basis for their work, the numbers the PhD student at Wageningen University had used differed dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery sparked an investigation that led to the revocation of the student’s degree in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The student challenged the withdrawal of his degree in court, but the Dutch Court of Gelderland sided with the university in a <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2023:2068">decision</a> issued last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it is very important that we now have a court ruling showing a university can revoke a doctorate that was granted under false pretenses,” Arthur Mol, rector magnificus of Wageningen University, said in an <a href="https://issuu.com/wageningenur/docs/eng_1-32p_resource_1716/18">interview</a> with the university’s magazine. Dutch law does not say explicitly that universities can revoke degrees, Mol said, but this case was the first time anyone had challenged their ability to do so in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar ruling issued last month thousands of miles away, the Texas Supreme Court also <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/education/universities-can-revoke-former-student-degrees/269-981fb3b9-468e-438e-a9a6-3cca409bd328">decided</a> that two state universities could revoke degrees for misconduct. In one of the cases involved in the ruling, which we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/12/university-of-texas-lacks-authority-to-revoke-phds-judge-rules/">previously covered</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/12/university-of-texas-lacks-authority-to-revoke-phds-judge-rules/">Suvi Orr</a>, now director of chemistry for the gastroenterology drug discovery unit at Takeda, sued the University of Texas at Austin after the university revoked her PhD in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Dutch court ruling and the university’s <a href="https://www.wur.nl/nl/nieuws/wageningen-university-krijgt-toestemming-rechter-voor-intrekken-doctorsgraad.htm">announcement</a> of the decision do not name the student whose degree was revoked, but sleuth Elisabeth Bik and one of her Twitter followers identified a <a href="https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/522422">retracted thesis</a> with the same issue date and research topic mentioned in the court’s decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603085622/https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/522422">archived version</a> of the thesis, “‘Force of Nature’ : climate shocks, food crises and conflict in Colonial Africa and Asia, 1880-1960,” by Kostadis J. Papaioannou, has three chapters that correspond to published articles:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962629815000578">Climate shocks and conflict: Evidence from colonial Nigeria</a>,” published in <em>Political Geography</em> in 2016.&nbsp;</li>



<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X17300359?via%3Dihub">Weather Shocks and Agricultural Commercialization in Colonial Tropical Africa: Did Cash Crops Alleviate Social Distress?</a>” published in <em>World Development</em> in 2017.&nbsp;</li>



<li>“<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article/21/1/1/2911958">‘Hunger makes a thief of any man’: Poverty and crime in British colonial Asia</a>,” published in <em>European Review of Economic History</em> in 2017.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Wageningen University’s press release stated that “the editors of the scientific journals will be asked to withdraw the associated articles.” The articles have been cited a few dozen times altogether, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the <em>World Development</em> article received an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17303856">extensive corrigendum</a> that began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors regret that in the original published version of the study, there were several errors in the description of the effect sizes, measured in standard deviations. These errors were purely textual, and did not bear any relation to the study’s empirical results, which are (correctly) summarized in Table 2 (page 355) and Table 3 (page 356) of the paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The same work had <a href="https://esshc.iisg.amsterdam/en/award-jury-report-20202021">received an award</a> at the European Social Science History Conference in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we contacted Wageningen University for comment, a spokesperson referred us to Mol’s magazine interview. We have not been able to reach Papaioannou for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The court decision notes that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Plaintiff disputes that he manipulated data for his dissertation and misrepresented quotes. There is no question of (deliberate) manipulation of data and misrepresentation of quotes, according to the claimant. He also disputes that there are substantial errors in the thesis and/or errors that influenced the conclusions drawn in the thesis with regard to his data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the decision continued</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The court is of the opinion that the Board has made it sufficiently plausible that the plaintiff manipulated quantitative and qualitative data in chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of his dissertation to the extent stated by the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Later, the judges wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Court agrees with the Board in its considerations that the interests of (the reputation of) WU and the trust in science in general, given the nature, seriousness and extent of the manipulations found, outweigh plaintiff&#8217;s interest in retaining his doctoral degree.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2023/05/22/revolutionizing-medicine-unlocking-the-potential-of-machine-learning/">Revolutionizing medicine: Unlocking the potential of machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AdobeStock_277867778-140x110.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The electronic medical record (EMR) as a big data source entails a large volume of data produced at a high speed. Hence, the complexity of the datasets it generates hinders analysis through traditional methods. Machine learning is an alternative to conventional data analysis that aids in understanding these large datasets.</p>
<h4>The good</h4>
<p>Machine learning models have a dynamic nature. They can <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/11/1/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn</a> from new observations and improve their predictive accuracy as the size of the datasets increases. These models are particularly <a href="https://www.ecrjournal.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-cardiovascular-risk-prediction-all-glitters-not-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useful</a> for managing multiple predictor variables with countless potential interactions, which may require more work to account for using traditional models.</p>
<p>The algorithms used in this branch of artificial intelligence incorporate predictor variables that may not be visible by mere background knowledge. Furthermore, when unsupervised <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.001593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning methods</a> are used, unknown patterns can be unveiled.</p>
<p>Another advantage of machine learning is that algorithms don&#8217;t <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/190/8/1476/6159690?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make assumptions</a> about the relationship between predictors and outcome variables (e.g. linear relationship). Instead, they rely on data rather than human decisions to generate a model that closely explains the data&#8217;s behavior. This leads to improved accuracy of the models.</p>
<p>However, there are also drawbacks to consider when it comes to machine learning.</p>
<h4>The bad and the ugly</h4>
<p>One of the biggest <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a> faced by machine learning models is interpretation and determining causality from evidence.</p>
<p>Physicians are typically well-versed in interpreting conventional statistics like odds and relative ratios. However, they may not have the same level of familiarity with the more complex statistics used in machine learning, such as in random forest models, where multiple decision trees are used to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nur.22122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predict</a> the classification of an outcome. Furthermore, as more predictors are added to the model, interpretability becomes even more difficult. To address this issue, methods using <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/17/6609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dimension reduction</a> may help with interpretability at the expense of accuracy.</p>
<p>Finally, another potential pitfall of machine learning is <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89010-0_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overfitting</a>, where the model becomes too reliant on the input data. This can be prevented by ensuring a proper balance between the size of the training data and the validation data.</p>
<h4>The future of fetal heart rate monitoring: a machine learning approach</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05632-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our study</a>, we used a machine learning approach to identify the important predictor variables to forecast changes in fetal heart rate after neuraxial analgesia during labor.</p>
<p>This type of analgesia has been associated with fetal heart rate changes. A significant drop in fetal heart rate may indicate potential issues with the baby&#8217;s health. However, several factors can increase the likelihood of a slow heart rate in the fetus, and it can be difficult for doctors to predict this outcome.</p>
<p>The multifactorial nature of fetal heart rate changes requires analyzing multiple possible predictor variables in a poorly understood medical problem. That is why our study utilized a machine learning approach to identify the important variables for our model.</p>
<p>We evaluated the predictive capabilities of four models &#8211; Principal Components Regression, Random Forest, Elastic Net Model, and Multiple Linear Regression &#8211; for fetal heart rate changes. Among them, the Random Forest model had the best performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9, while the other models had an MSE above 42. MSE is a measure of accuracy that represents the average difference between the predicted and measured values.</p>
<p>According to our research, certain factors such as the technique used for neuraxial analgesia (combined spinal-epidural), the amount of bupivacaine administered, the mother&#8217;s BMI, and the length of the initial stage of labor play a significant role in determining fetal heart rate changes following neuraxial analgesia during labor.</p>
<p>Our findings have practical implications for the medical field. They may increase the physician&#8217;s awareness of the potential risks for fetal heart rate drops in healthy pregnant patients and adjust their treatment plans accordingly. For example, if a patient has a high BMI, the physician can be extra cautious and avoid certain techniques or medications, such as a combined spinal-epidural technique or high doses of bupivacaine.</p>
<h4>Key points to take home</h4>
<p>Our article showcases how machine learning can assist in understanding medical problems that remain unclear. When applied correctly, machine learning is a valuable resource that can enhance healthcare procedures and improve patient care by using a greater amount of data from EMRs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-microwave-insecticide-spray">Microwaving an insecticide restores its mosquito-killing power</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heating an insecticide can give it new life.</p>



<p>Microwaving the insecticide deltamethrin rearranges its crystal structure but doesn’t change its chemical composition. The rearrangement <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04554-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renews deltamethrin’s ability to kill mosquitoes</a> that have become resistant to the insecticide, researchers report April 21 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t set out to revive insecticides, says Bart Kahr, a crystallographer at New York University. He and colleagues had been working on crystal growth experiments. “And it turns out that a very good crystal for the experiment that we wanted to do was DDT, the very old, notorious insecticide from the last century.” The researchers realized that DDT has two crystal forms, one of which works better than the other.</p>





<p>They then started experimenting with deltamethrin, an insecticide that is commonly used against mosquitoes that can carry malaria. The chemical is often incorporated into bed nets or sprayed on walls or other surfaces in homes. Mosquitoes absorb the insecticide when they come in contact with it. Kahr and colleagues previously discovered that heating deltamethrin <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-deltamethrin-pesticide-resistant-mosquitoes-insecticide">changed its crystal structure</a>, which let it work faster (<em>SN: 10/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>Altering the arrangement of crystals is a tried-and-true way of giving drugs new and different properties, Kahr says. But no one had thought to rearrange insecticide crystals to give them new life, he says. “We just were surprised at how relevant it really was, and a little surprised that nobody has looked at this before,” he says. “Different communities of scientists just have different urgencies. And sometimes when you come from the outside, you look at things from a completely different way.”</p>



<p>Kahr’s team heated a chalk formulation of deltamethrin called D-Fense Dust either in an oven or in a microwave. In the oven, the researchers could precisely control the temperature, he says. “But just for kicks, we said because this deltamethrin is a consumer product, what if you just pop it in the microwave for five minutes? Does that achieve the same thing as heating it to a prescribed temperature in the oven?” The microwave worked just as well, but Kahr cautions that people shouldn’t use the same microwave for heating food and insecticides.</p>

Tests of heated deltamethrin crystals (right) showed that they are effective against mosquitoes resistant to the insecticide’s usual form.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124723">Jingxiang Yang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previously, the researchers had tested the heated deltamethrin crystals on mosquitoes that were already sensitive to the insecticide. In the new study, the scientists teamed up with entomologists to test the heated crystals on five strains of <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes from West Africa that are resistant to deltamethrin. In all cases, the rearranged crystals killed the resistant mosquitoes.</p>



<p>That’s important because insecticide resistance is a growing problem and is impairing the ability to control mosquito populations to tamp down malaria spread, says Janet Hemingway, a geneticist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England who was not involved in the new study. “We&#8217;re now at the point where almost nowhere in Africa is fully susceptible.”</p>





<p>It is encouraging that heated insecticide killed highly resistant mosquitoes, says Hemingway, who directs the <a href="https://www.infectioninnovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infection Innovation Consortium</a>, a public-private effort to find new ways to combat infectious diseases. But, she says, “this is not something we can take and use that tomorrow.”</p>



<p>For instance, insecticide-treated bed nets are made by mixing deltamethrin with fibers before yarn is extruded. The insecticide migrates to the outside of the yarn and forms crystals. Depending on the manufacturer, “the crystal structures that end up on the surfaces of those bed nets can be quite different,” Hemingway says. </p>



<p>It’s not certain that the heat-treated deltamethrin would retain its more potent crystal structure through the net-making process. And you couldn’t just pop bed nets in the microwave to rearrange the deltamethrin crystals, she says. “You&#8217;d need some pretty big microwaves given these things come in shipping containers.”</p>



<p>Kahr’s team is working on incorporating the heat-treated crystal into nets. Liquid sprays are out since the rearranged crystals don’t retain their structure when mixed into water. People could spray the heated chalk instead, but few people would probably want chalky walls, Kahr says. “There are all kinds of social and cultural things that you could propose from a scientific perspective that wouldn&#8217;t be welcomed by a community of homeowners.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/formula-one-race-car-drivers-blink">Race car drivers tend to blink at the same places in each lap</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world goes dark for about one-fifth of a second every time you blink, a fraction of an instant that’s hardly noticeable to most people. But for a Formula One race car driver traveling up to 354 kilometers per hour, that one-fifth means almost 20 meters of lost vision. </p>



<p>Considering how often people blink (up to 30 times every minute), a driver could lose as much as 595 meters — over a third of a mile — worth of visual information per minute due to blinking.</p>





<p>People are often thought to blink at random intervals, but researchers found that wasn’t the case for three Formula drivers. Instead, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.106803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the drivers tended to blink at the same parts of the course</a> during each lap, cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Nishizono and colleagues report in the May 19 <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>Nishizono, of NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Atsugi, Japan, was inspired to study how humans process information during physical activity by his past as a professional racing cyclist.</p>



<p>He was surprised to find almost no literature on blinking behavior in active humans even though under extreme conditions like motor racing or cycling, “a slight mistake could lead to life-threatening danger,” Nishizono says. So he partnered with a Japanese Formula car racing team to examine how humans blink during high-speed driving.</p>



<p>Nishizono and colleagues mounted eye trackers on the helmets of three drivers and had them drive three Formula circuits — Fuji, Suzuka and Sugo — for a total of 304 laps.</p>



<p>Where the drivers blinked was surprisingly predictable, the team found. The drivers had a shared pattern of blinking that had a strong connection with acceleration, such that drivers tended not to blink while changing speed or direction — like while on a curve in the track — but did blink while on relatively safer straightaways.</p>



<p>The finding highlights the trade-off between keeping our eyes moist and not losing vision during crucial tasks, says Jonathan Matthis, a neuroscientist at Northeastern University in Boston who studies human movement and was not involved in the research. “We think of blinking as this nothing behavior,” he says, “but it&#8217;s not just wiping the eyes. Blinking is a part of our visual system.”</p>



<p>Nishizono next wants to explore what processes in the brain allow or inhibit blinking in a given moment, he says, and is also interested in how blinking behavior varies among the general population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/counter-birth-control-pill-reproductive">How over-the-counter birth control pills could improve reproductive health</a></h4>

              
                <p>Being able to buy birth control pills off the shelf took a big step forward on May 10. Two advisory committees to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO65CZ_PDeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a birth control pill available without a prescription</a>.</p>



<p>The pill, called Opill and known by the generic name norgestrel, is a <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/progestin-only-hormonal-birth-control-pill-and-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progestin-only pill</a>. That’s in contrast to combined oral contraceptive pills, which contain progestin—or another form of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/estrogen-birth-control-reduced">progesterone — along with a form of estrogen</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/23</em>). Progesterone and estrogen are two of the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.</p>





<p>Opill gained FDA approval for prescription use in the United States in 1973, under a different brand name. The advisory committees that recently met were tasked with considering a switch from prescription to over-the-counter status, which involves reviewing data that the drug can be used safely and effectively without the oversight of a physician.</p>



<p>The FDA committees — one with expertise on non-prescription drugs, the other with obstetric and gynecological drugs — endorsed the switch, and they are not alone. Medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians are also in favor of an over-the-counter birth control pill. The FDA is expected to announce a decision on the recommendation this summer.</p>



<p>If Opill gets the over-the-counter nod, it would become the most effective birth control method on store shelves, surpassing existing options like condoms and sponges. It would also remove barriers that can make getting this birth control option challenging for many people. </p>



<p>The possibility that a birth control pill could become more easily available comes as the United States faces a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maternal mortality crisis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abortion bans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/court-mifepristone-abortion-pill-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible restrictions on an FDA-approved abortion medication</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 3/16/23; SN: 6/24/22;&nbsp;SN: 5/18/23</em>). <em>Science News</em> talked with two sexual and reproductive health equity researchers about the impact of over-the-counter access to the pill on reproductive health and autonomy. The interviews were edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What barriers do adults and adolescents face in terms of access to different birth control methods?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rachel Logan, University of California, San Francisco:</strong> I think it’s the same barriers for both groups, although I think <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17305086" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adolescents face more</a>. It is transportation to health care appointments. [There are] barriers within care, such as some <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2018/10/the-utility-of-and-indications-for-routine-pelvic-examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providers requiring a pelvic examination</a> or a full gynecological exam before providing or prescribing contraceptive methods. [It is] a lack of insurance coverage. Unfortunately in this country, because we don’t have federally mandated, comprehensive sex ed, some people just <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379711009068?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not know about all of the contraceptive methods</a> that exist. </p>



<p>There continues to be the stigma associated with needing contraception and who uses contraception that is very patriarchal and really demeaning to people, like it says something about you if you have to use these methods, as opposed to [contraception being] an essential tool in your reproductive health journey. Another area that I don’t think is talked enough about is contraceptive coercion — that could be from a parent, a partner or a health care provider — where your options to use the method of your choice are limited for whatever reason.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What could it mean for adults and adolescents to have over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control, especially considering the maternal mortality crisis and abortion bans?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anu</strong><strong> Manchikanti Gómez of the University of California, Berkeley:</strong> Providing people the opportunity to be unpregnant is always important, but more important than ever because of these additional crises. Abortion <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bans have many effects, obviously, on people’s ability to access abortion</a>. But [bans are also] having a chilling effect on health care providers in some states. Maybe they are leaving those states where abortion is banned, or not coming [to those states] in the first place. Those are generally the same providers who might be doing contraceptive counseling or providing pap smears or prenatal care, [so] there can be less access to this care. Birth control can’t solve those issues, but there may be ways that more access is going to be particularly helpful when access is being lost in other ways.</p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> It feels like we’re in a very critical moment where reproductive autonomy is definitely under threat. So this could mean extending options to people who otherwise may not have an option or a way to obtain a method of birth control that works for them. Being able to walk into a store and pick something off of the shelf that you can use and is very safe and effective is life changing.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What do we know about the historical impact of prescription birth control?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> The availability of hormonal birth control has been transformative for, historically, cis gender women’s participation in the world, in <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/Goldin_PowerPill.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the workforce, in their ability to engage in education</a>. Being able to control your fertility is such an important part about being able to control your destiny. There are many things that can affect our ability to live the lives that we want, but if you are a person who can become pregnant, [it’s] really important to have the option of deciding if, when and how you want to become pregnant or remain pregnant.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: When choosing a birth control method, what does it mean to take a person-centered contraceptive care approach?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> A person-centered approach, if we’re talking about contraceptive access, means … actually support[ing] the person in making the decision that’s best for them versus what someone else thinks they should be doing. There’s a long history of <a href="https://apha.org/Policies-and-Advocacy/Public-Health-Policy-Statements/Policy-Database/2022/01/07/Opposing-Coercion-in-Contraceptive-Access-and-Care-to-Promote-Reproductive-Health-Equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth control abuse and coercion</a> in the United States, from forced sterilization to aggressive promotion of certain methods toward Black communities and people who are poor. Even though there are different levels of effectiveness of different types of methods, that doesn’t make one more medically appropriate. </p>



<p>For some people, they don’t like something that they can’t stop using without going to see a health care provider [such as an implant or other long-acting reversible contraception]. You may feel that you’re losing bodily autonomy through using a method that you can’t stop using on your own. That’s a very real concern for some people, and it’s definitely grounded in some of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4167937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical abuses and racism and ongoing experiences</a> of low-quality care that some people, too many people, experience.</p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> [A person-centered approach] is being <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(23)00072-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OK with people saying, “no,&nbsp; I don’t want to use that method,”</a> and saying, “that’s fine,” as opposed to [providers] feeling like it’s their job to convince people to get on a method or to use a particular method. [It’s] showing people that you care about them using what feels right and best for them. We’re aligning people’s preferences with methods that are available.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Does the possible over-the-counter availability of hormonal birth control assist with this approach?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> Yes. It gives people the power that they need without these constraints that are really only hurdles. This is in no way to replace routine preventative care. It is to reduce barriers to methods that we know are safe and effective that people can use independently. I think the health care system is already very strained. Is it a good thing that we’re moving some services that we know to be safe and effective outside of the health care system? I would say yes.</p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> [Easier access] can make a huge difference for people. Being able to start using [a birth control pill] without seeing a provider, that removes many layers of barriers. All of those can reduce people’s ability to use it at all or to use it continuously. Not everyone wants to use the pill, [but for those who do] having over-the-counter access is really going to help people.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-rna-editing-dna-cephalopods">Octopuses and squid are masters of RNA editing while leaving DNA intact</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Many writers grouse when an editor makes a change in a story, but the consequences of changing a single word usually aren’t that dire.</p>



<p>Not so with genetic instructions for making proteins. Even a small change can prevent a protein from doing its job properly, with possibly deadly consequences. Only occasionally is a change beneficial. It seems wisest to preserve genetic instructions as they are written. Unless you’re an octopus.</p>



<p>Octopuses are like aliens living among us — they do a lot of things differently from land animals, or even other sea creatures. Their flexible tentacles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">taste</a> what they touch and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-move-uncoordinated-arms">have minds of their own</a>. Octopuses’ eyes are color-blind, but their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-can-see-their-skin">skin can detect light</a> on its own (<em>SN: 6/27/15, p. 10</em>). They are masters of disguise, changing color and skin textures to blend into their surroundings or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/skin-color-changes-reveal-octopus-drama">scare off rivals</a>. And to a greater extent than most creatures, octopuses squirt the molecular equivalent of red ink over their genetic instructions with astounding abandon, like a copy editor run amok.</p>





<p>These edits modify RNA, the molecule used to translate information from the genetic blueprint stored in DNA, while leaving the DNA unaltered.</p>



<p>Scientists don’t yet know for sure why octopuses, and other shell-less cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish, are such prolific editors. Researchers are debating whether this form of genetic editing gave cephalopods an evolutionary leg (or tentacle) up or whether the editing is just a sometimes useful accident. Scientists are also probing what consequences the RNA alterations may have under various conditions. Some evidence suggests <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cephalopods-may-have-traded-evolution-gains-extra-smarts">editing may give cephalopods some of their smarts</a> but could come at the cost of holding back evolution in their DNA (<em>SN:&nbsp;4/29/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>“These animals are just magical,” says Caroline Albertin, a comparative developmental biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. “They have all sorts of different solutions to living in the world they come from.” RNA editing may help give the creatures vast numbers of solutions for problems they may face.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Unlike other animals with bilateral symmetry, octopuses don’t crawl in a predetermined direction. Videos of octopuses crawling show they can move in any direction relative to their body, and they change crawling direction independently of turning their bodies. In the clip, the green arrow marks the orientation of the octopus’ body and a blue arrow marks the direction it is crawling.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>How cephalopods modify their RNA</h4>



<p>Molecular biology’s central dogma holds that instructions for building an organism are contained in DNA. Cells copy those instructions into messenger RNAs, or mRNAs. Then, cellular machinery called ribosomes read the mRNAs to build proteins by stringing amino acids together. Most of the time, the protein’s composition conforms to the DNA template for the protein’s sequence of amino acids.</p>





<p>But RNA editing can cause divergences from the DNA instructions, creating some proteins that have different amino acids than specified by the DNA.</p>



<p>Editing chemically modifies one of RNA’s four building blocks, or bases. Those bases are often referred to by the first letters of their names: A, C, G and U, for adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil (RNA’s version of the DNA base thymine). In an RNA molecule, the bases are linked to sugars; the adenine-sugar unit, for instance, is referred to as adenosine.</p>



<p>There are many ways to edit RNA letters. Cephalopods excel at a type of editing known as adenosine to inosine, or A-to-I, editing. This happens when an enzyme called ADAR2 strips a nitrogen and two hydrogen atoms off adenosine (the A). That chemical peel turns adenosine into inosine (I).</p>



<p>Ribosomes read inosine as guanine instead of adenine. Sometimes that switch has no effect on the resulting protein’s chain of amino acids. But in some cases, having a G where an A should be results in a different amino acid being inserted into the protein. Such protein-altering RNA editing is called RNA recoding.</p>



<p>Soft-bodied cephalopods have embraced RNA recoding with all of their arms while even closely related species are more tentative about accepting rewrites, Albertin says. “Other mollusks don’t seem to do it” to the same extent.</p>



<p>RNA editing isn’t limited to creatures of the deep. Almost every multicellular organism has one or more RNA editing enzymes called ADAR enzymes, short for “adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA,” says Joshua Rosenthal, a molecular neurobiologist also at the Marine Biological Laboratory.</p>



<p>Cephalopods have two ADAR enzymes. Humans have versions of them, too. “In our brains, we edit a ton of RNA. We do it a lot,” Rosenthal says. Over the last decade, scientists have discovered millions of places in human RNAs where editing occurs.</p>



<p>But those edits rarely change the amino acids in a protein. For instance, Eli Eisenberg of Tel Aviv University and colleagues identified more than 4.6 million editing sites in human RNAs. Of those, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28841-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 1,517 recode proteins</a>, the researchers reported last year in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Of those recoding sites, up to 835 are shared with other mammals, suggesting that evolutionary forces preserved editing at those locations.</p>

<h3>How does RNA editing work?</h3>



<p>In a common form of RNA editing, an adenosine becomes an inosine through a reaction that removes an amino group and replaces it with an oxygen (arrows). The illustration shows an ADAR enzyme attaching to a double-stranded RNA at the “dsRNA binding domain.” The region of the enzyme that will interact to cause the reaction, the “deaminase domain,” is positioned near the adenosine that will become an inosine.</p>

EISENBERG/<em>ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANIMAL BIOSCIENCES</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Cephalopods take RNA recoding to a whole new level, Albertin says. Longfin squid (<em>Doryteuthis pealeii</em>) <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/05198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have 57,108 recoding sites</a>, Rosenthal, Eisenberg and colleagues reported in 2015 in <em>eLife</em>. Since then, the researchers have examined multiple species of octopus, squid and cuttlefish, each time finding tens of thousands of recoding sites.</p>



<p>Soft-bodied, or coleoid, cephalopods may have more opportunities for editing than other animals because of where at least one of the ADAR enzymes, ADAR2, is located in the cell. Most animals edit RNAs in the nucleus — the compartment where DNA is stored and copied into RNA — before sending the messages out to meet up with ribosomes. But cephalopods also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-their-genetic-material-uniquely-weird-place">have the enzymes in the cytoplasm</a>, the cells’ jellylike guts, Rosenthal and colleagues discovered (<em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Having editing enzymes in two locales doesn’t fully explain why cephalopods’ RNA recoding so far outstrips that of humans and other animals. Nor does it explain the patterns of editing scientists have uncovered.</p>



<h4>RNA editing may give cephalopods flexibility</h4>



<p>Editing isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. Rarely are all copies of an RNA in a cell edited. It’s much more common for some percentage of RNAs to be edited while the rest retain their original information. The percentage, or frequency, of editing can vary widely from RNA to RNA or between cells or tissues, and may depend on water temperature or other conditions. In longfin squid, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29748-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most RNA editing sites were edited 2 percent or less of the time</a>, Albertin and colleagues reported last year in <em>Nature Communications</em>. But the researchers also found more than 205,000 sites that were edited 25 percent of the time or more.</p>



<p>In most of a cephalopod’s body, RNA editing doesn’t often affect the makeup of proteins. But in the nervous system, it’s a different story. In longfin squids’ nervous systems, 70 percent of edits in protein-producing RNAs recode proteins. And RNAs in the nervous system of the California two-spot octopus (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) are recoded three to six times as often as in other organs or tissues.</p>

RNA recoding might help the squid respond more flexibly to its environment, but whether recoding has evolutionary value is not yet clear.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124674">ELAINE BEARER</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Some mRNAs have multiple edit sites that alter amino acids in the proteins the mRNAs encode. In the longfin squid’s nervous system, for instance, 27 percent of mRNAs have three or more recoding sites. Some contain 10 or more such sites. Combinations of those editing sites could result in multiple versions of a protein being made in a cell.</p>



<p>Having a wide selection of proteins may give cephalopods “more flexibility in responding to the environment,” Albertin says, “or give you a variety of solutions to the problem in front of you.” In the nervous system, RNA editing might contribute to flexibility in thinking, which could help explain why octopuses can unlock cages or use tools, some researchers think. Editing could be an easy way to create one or more versions of a protein in the nervous system and different ones in the rest of the body, Albertin says.</p>



<p>When humans and other vertebrates have different versions of a protein, it often comes from having multiple copies of a gene. Doubling, tripling or quadrupling copies of a gene “results in a whole genetic playground to allow genes to go off and do different functions,” Albertin says. But cephalopods tend not to duplicate genes. Instead, their innovations come from editing.</p>



<p>And there is a lot of room for innovation. In squid, mRNAs for building the alpha-spectrin protein <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-animal-060322-114534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have 242 recoding sites</a>. All the combinations of edited and unedited sites theoretically could create up to 7 x 10<sup>72</sup> forms of the protein, Rosenthal and Eisenberg report in this year’s issue of <em>Annual Review of Animal Biosciences</em>. “To put this number in perspective,” the researchers wrote, “suffice it to say that it dwarfs the number of all alpha-spectrin molecules (or, for that matter, all protein molecules) synthesized in all cells of all the squids that have ever lived on our planet since the dawn of time.”</p>



<p>That incredible level of complexity would be possible only if every site were independent, says Kavita Rangan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Diego. Rangan has been studying RNA recoding in California market squid (<em>Doryteuthis opalescens</em>) and in longfin squid. Water temperature triggers the squid to recode motor proteins called kinesins that move cargo inside cells.</p>



<p>In longfin squid, the mRNA that produces kinesin-1 has 14&nbsp;recoding sites, Rangan has found. She examined mRNAs from the optic lobe — the part of the brain that processes visual information — and from the stellate ganglion, a collection of nerves involved in generating the muscle contractions that produce jets of water to propel the squid.</p>



<p>Each tissue made several versions of the protein. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">certain sites tended to be edited together</a>, Rangan and Samara Reck-Peterson, also of UC San Diego, reported last September in a preprint posted online at bioRxiv.org. Their data suggest that editing of some sites is coordinated and “very strongly rejects the idea that editing is independent,” Rangan says. “The frequency of the combos that we see don’t match if every site was edited independently.”</p>



<p>Yoking editing sites may prevent squid and other cephalopods from reaching the pinnacles of complexity that they’re theoretically capable of. Still, RNA editing provides cephalopods a way to try out many versions of a protein without getting locked into a permanent change in DNA, Rangan says.</p>



<p>That lack of commitment puzzles Jianzhi Zhang, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “It doesn’t make sense to me,” he says. “If you want a particular amino acid in a protein, you should change the DNA. Why do you change the RNA?”</p>



<h4>Is there evolutionary value to RNA editing?</h4>



<p>Perhaps RNA editing provides some evolutionary advantage. To test that idea, Zhang and then–graduate student Daohan Jiang compared “synonymous” sites, where edits do not change amino acids, with “nonsynonymous” sites where recoding happens. Since synonymous edits don’t change amino acids, the researchers considered those edits to be neutral as far as evolution is concerned. In humans, recoding, or nonsynonymous editing, happens at fewer sites than synonymous editing, and the percentage of RNA molecules that are edited is lower than at synonymous sites.</p>



<p>“If we assume synonymous editing is just like noise that happens in the cell, and nonsynonymous editing is less frequent and [at a] lower level, that suggests nonsynonymous editing is actually harmful,” Zhang says. Even though recoding in cephalopods happens much more frequently than for humans, in most cases, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13275-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoding is not advantageous</a>, or adaptive, for cephalopods, the researchers argued in 2019 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>There are a few shared sites where octopuses, squid and cuttlefish all recode their RNAs, the researchers found, suggesting the recoding is useful in those instances. But this is a small fraction of editing sites. A few other sites that are edited in one species of cephalopod but not others were also adaptive, Zhang and Jiang found.</p>



<p>If it’s not all that helpful, why have cephalopods persisted with RNA recoding for hundreds of millions of years? RNA editing may stick around not because it is adaptive, but because it is addictive, Zhang says.</p>



<p>He and Jiang proposed a harm-permitting model (that is, a situation that permits harmful changes to DNA). Imagine, he says, a situation in which a G (guanine) in an organism’s DNA gets mutated to an A (adenine). If that mutation leads to a harmful amino acid change in a protein, natural selection should weed out individuals that carry that mutation. But if, by chance, the organism has RNA editing, the mistake in the DNA might be corrected by editing RNA, essentially changing the A back to G. If the protein is essential for life, then the RNA would have to be edited at high levels so that nearly every copy is corrected.</p>



<p>When that happens, “You’re locked into the system,” Zhang says. Now the organism is dependent on RNA editing machinery. “It cannot be lost, because you will require the A to be edited back to G for survival, so the editing will be kept at high levels.… In the beginning you really didn’t need it, but after you got it, you became addicted.”</p>



<p>Zhang argues that that sort of editing is neutral, not adaptive. But other research suggests RNA editing can be adaptive.</p>



<p>RNA editing may work as a transition phase, letting organisms try out a switch from adenine to guanine without making a permanent change in their DNA. Over the course of evolution, sites where adenines are recoded in RNA in one cephalopod species are more likely than unedited adenines to be <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/10456/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced with guanine in the DNA of one or more related specie</a>s, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>PeerJ</em>. And for heavily edited sites, evolution across cephalopods seems to favor a transition from A to G in DNA (rather than to cytosine or thymine, the other two DNA building blocks). That favors the idea that editing can be adaptive.</p>



<p>Other recent work by Rosenthal and colleagues, which examined A-to-G replacements in different species, suggests that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/9/3775/6281225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having an editable A is an evolutionary boon</a> over an uneditable A or a hardwired G.</p>

<h5>How common is RNA recoding?</h5>



<p>Soft-bodied cephalopod species including octopuses, squid and cuttlefish recode RNA in their nervous systems at tens of thousands of sites, compared with about a thousand or fewer sites in humans, mice, fruit flies and other animal species. Though scientists have been documenting the number of editing sites, they will need new tools to directly test how recoding influences cephalopod biology.</p>

<h4>There are a lot of open questions</h4>



<p>Evidence for and against RNA recoding’s evolutionary value has come mainly from examining the total genetic makeup, or genomes, of various cephalopod species. But scientists would like to directly test whether recoded RNAs have an effect on cephalopod biology. Doing that will require some new tools and creative thinking.</p>



<p>Rangan tested synthetic versions of squid motor proteins and found that two edited versions that squid make in the cold <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">moved slower but traveled farther</a> along protein tracks called microtubules than unedited proteins did. But that’s in artificial laboratory conditions on microscope slides. To understand what is happening in cells, Rangan says, she would like to be able to grow squid cells in lab dishes. Right now, she has to take tissue directly from the squid and can only get snapshots of what is happening. Lab-grown cells might allow her to follow what happens over time.</p>



<p>Zhang says he is testing his harm-permitting hypothesis by getting yeast hooked on RNA editing. Baker’s yeast (<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) doesn’t have ADAR enzymes. But Zhang engineered a strain of the yeast to carry a human version of the enzyme. The ADAR enzymes make the yeast sick and grow slowly, he says. To speed up the experiment, the strain he is using has a higher-than-normal mutation rate, and may build up G-to-A mutations. But if RNA editing can correct those mutations, the ADAR-carrying yeast may grow better than ones that don’t have the enzyme. And after many generations, the yeast may become addicted to editing, Zhang predicts.</p>



<p>Albertin, Rosenthal and colleagues have developed ways to change the genes of squid with the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9. The team <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30985-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created an albino squid</a> by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out, or disable, a gene that produces pigment. The researchers may be able to change editing sites in DNA or in RNA and test their function, Albertin says.</p>



<p>This science is still in its early stages, and the story may lead somewhere unexpected. Still, with cephalopods’ skillful editing, it’s bound to be a good read.</p>

<p>Tokyo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/">Waseda University</a> is investigating alleged misconduct by an assistant professor at the institution, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The probe is focusing on at least three works by <a href="https://w-rdb.waseda.jp/html/100002891_en.html">Woohyang Sim</a>, of the Faculty of International Research and Education, including her 2020 doctoral dissertation, titled &#8220;What is Higher Education For? Educational Aspirations and Career Prospects of Women in the Arab Gulf.&#8221; Two of Sim’s published papers are also under scrutiny, according to a source familiar with the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2022, an anonymous commenter on PubPeer flagged several problems with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B412918881783FB611BBFBADE6ADA3">these publications</a>, as well as with Sim&#8217;s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3FF17ABF75D18032052CF0ADA5CFD8#3">master&#8217;s thesis and another one of her papers</a>. That same month, a whistleblower notified the Japanese government about the concerns, according to the source.</p>



<span id="more-127146"></span>



<p>Waseda has faced problems with research misconduct in the past. In 2015, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/04/university-revokes-phd-of-lead-author-on-retracted-stap-stem-cell-papers/">the school revoked the PhD</a> of cell scientist Haruko Obokata, due partly to plagiarism concerns, as we reported that year. Obokata was first author on a pair of controversial <em>Nature</em> papers describing an easy way to create stem cells with the so-called <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/26/stap-stem-cell-researcher-obokata-loses-another-paper/#more-37272">STAP method</a>; both articles were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/02/stap-stem-cell-papers-officially-retracted-as-nature-argues-peer-review-couldnt-have-detected-fatal-problems/">retracted in 2014</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the heels of the scandal, Waseda said it would be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/04/08/waseda-university-checking-dissertations-for-plagiarism-in-wake-of-stap-stem-cell-misconduct-finding/">vetting all dissertations</a> submitted to the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering for signs of plagiarism and other irregularities.</p>



<p>Waseda University told Retraction Watch it &#8220;takes strict measures in dealing with any compliance violation, including research misconduct&#8221; but that &#8220;currently there is no information that we are able to disclose.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sim did not respond to our requests for comments about the new investigation. But in a May 16 email Retraction Watch has seen, Sim acknowledged: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am currently undergoing a research ethic committee process and cooperating fully with the procedure. I have provided all raw data I possess and I am awaiting the committee&#8217;s final report.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sim, who is listed as a &#8220;co-researcher&#8221; on a <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/qatarchair">$13 million joint project</a> between Waseda University and Qatar University, also wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to address the concerns raised about my work, acknowledging that I have identified a few inconsistencies resulting from careless mistakes. As a non-native speaker of English, I admit that I placed significant emphasis on accurately translating my work into a language in which I do not feel entirely comfortable. In the process of writing, driven by anxiety, I may have overlooked some crucial details that required more attention.</p>



<p>However, I want to assure that any mistakes in the paper were unintentional, and I did not intentionally fabricate or alter any information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the papers that were flagged on PubPeer, &#8220;<a href="https://fire-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/FIRE/article/view/109">The Educational Aspirations of Saudi Arabian Youth: Implications for Creating a New Framework to Explain Saudi Arabian Society</a>,” published in <em>FIRE: Forum for International Research in Education</em> in 2016, no longer resolves from its <a href="https://doi.org/10.18275/fire201603021081">DOI</a>.</p>



<p>The journal&#8217;s senior editor, <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/education/our-people/Faculty/alexander_wiseman.php">Alexander W. Wiseman</a> of Texas Tech University, did not respond to our emails or phone calls. Nor did we hear back from Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania, which is responsible for maintaining the paper&#8217;s DOI.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predators-coyotes-bobcats-wolves-people">Large predators push coyotes and bobcats near people and to their demise</a></h4>

              
                <p>When wild animals take refuge from predators by straying near people, the illusion of safety can be deadly.</p>



<p>In the wilderness, mid-sized predators like coyotes have learned to fear larger carnivores like wolves and cougars, which will violently attack and kill those smaller carnivores. A new study finds that when those larger predators are around, the smaller ones will try to evade attack by moving into spaces shaped by people. But that ends up putting them at a much higher risk of getting killed — by people, scientists report in the May 19 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The study is among the first to show that large cats and wolves shape the behavior of other predators outside of wilderness areas, says Laura Prugh, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>When large carnivore populations plummeted from being hunted in vast stretches of North America, predators less threatening to humans flourished. Then, as large predators were reintroduced into the wild — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-genes-ancestry">wolves in Yellowstone National Park</a> — scientists started to notice deadly (and mostly-one sided) violence erupting between old and new meat-eating residents (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>What the aftermath of this violence looks like is something that Prugh has witnessed firsthand. During a field season in Alaska, the wildlife ecologist came across the remains of coyotes massacred by wolves.</p>



<p>“The wolves had buried [the coyotes’] heads in the snow,” recalls Prugh. “It was a little macabre.”</p>



<p>Understandably, smaller predators will try to stay clear of their murderous kin. Yet how this works outside of wilderness areas is unclear. Some animals will hide from danger in spaces shaped by people — be it farms or suburbs — in a phenomenon called the human shield effect. But other research indicates that mid-sized predators keep away from people when given the chance.</p>



<p>“Animals are really, really scared of humans,” explains Taal Levi, a wildlife ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who was not involved in the study. In experiments where scientists played recordings of either growling or human voices, smaller meat-eaters like coyotes were more likely to “avoid areas where you play recordings of Rush Limbaugh or people talking in general,” he says.</p>



<p>To see how smaller predators behave near human territory, Prugh and her colleagues attached radio collars to 37 bobcats and 35 coyotes, as well as to 22 wolves and 60 cougars, in two rural areas of Washington State. These collars tracked the location of the animals every four hours for up to two years — “one of the most impressive datasets” on predator movement outside of a wilderness area to date, Levi says.</p>



<p>Tracking these animals revealed that coyotes and bobcats, the mid-sized predators, were twice as likely to spend time near ranches, roads, fields and towns when large carnivores were around. But the animals traded one threat for another: People shot, trapped or otherwise killed 25 bobcats and coyotes during the study period. Wolves and cougars killed just eight, meaning people killed three times as many coyotes and bobcats than the large predators.</p>

Humans were responsible for 14 coyote deaths during the study period.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124714">Savanah Walker</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This may be because animals aren’t good at reading danger signs from people in a modern world, Prugh says. A coyote is unlikely to make the connection that a person is behind a gun. But the smell and sound of wolves — which evolved alongside coyotes for millennia — are hard to forget if you’ve been attacked.</p>



<p>The study shows that large carnivores shape the behavior of smaller predators even outside wilderness areas, something not all scientist agreed would be the case, Levi says.</p>





<p>“As wolves recover outside of national parks, there was this major question about whether they could recover enough to actually fulfill their ecological role” of controlling the numbers of smaller carnivores, he says. This study shows that large carnivores can — and will — shape how smaller meat-eaters live and die near people.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-lakes-drying-shrinking-climate">More than half of the world’s largest lakes are drying up</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than half of the world’s largest lakes <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrank over the last three decades</a>, researchers report in the May 19 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>That’s a big problem for the people who depend on those lakes for drinking water and irrigation. Drying lakes also threaten the survival of local ecosystems and migrating birds, and can even give rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">insalubrious dust storms</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/23</em>).</p>



<p>“About one-quarter of the Earth’s population lives in these basins with lake water losses,” says surface hydrologist Fangfang Yao of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.</p>





<p>Using satellite observations from 1992 to 2020, Yao, then at the University of Colorado Boulder, and colleagues estimated the area and water levels of <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/globallakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 2,000 freshwater bodies</a>. That work provided a continuous stream of lake volume measurements. The lakes account for 96 percent of Earth’s total natural lake storage and 83 percent of that in reservoirs. The team also used population data to estimate the number of people living by the drying lakes.</p>



<p>About 53 percent of the world’s lakes have clearly shrunk, the researchers found, while only 22 percent made gains. From these bodies of water, roughly 600 cubic kilometers of water were lost over the 28-year time span. That’s around 17 times the maximum capacity of Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States.</p>



<p>The researchers used hydrologic and climate simulations to tease out the processes influencing the fluctuating water bodies. They found climate change and human consumption were the main causes of the decline in natural lakes, while in reservoirs, sediment buildup was the primary driver of storage loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/court-mifepristone-abortion-pill-safety">As U.S. courts weigh in on mifepristone, here’s the abortion pill’s safety record</a></h4>

              
                <p>A widely used abortion medicine is in legal jeopardy, despite decades of data supporting its use.</p>



<p>The medicine, called mifepristone, is part of two-drug regimen that can end a pregnancy, and was used in more than half of abortions in the United States in 2020. Late last year, a group of antiabortion doctors and others sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/abortion-pills-whats-going-on?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=281219&amp;post_id=108194767&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging mifepristone’s initial approval</a> in 2000 and the changes the agency later made to broaden access to the drug.</p>





<p>In the <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/abortion-pills-whats-going-on?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=281219&amp;post_id=108194767&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a>, they claim that the drug isn’t safe, that the FDA improperly approved it and failed to follow the science, and that mifepristone is illegal to send in the mail. The U.S. District Court judge that first heard the case sided with the group. Now, the case is being reviewed by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans; on May 17, the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments related to the judge’s ruling. The matter may ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p>



<p>But the original scientific evidence used in the FDA’s approval process offered a clear answer to the drug’s safety, says Thomas Kosasa, an obstetrician gynecologist at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who served on a 1996 committee that advised the FDA. “We made sure that it was a safe medication,” he says. “It was also effective.”</p>



<p>In the 23 years since the agency approved mifepristone, the drug has amassed a long track record of safety data — in the United States and around the world, says Lauren Owens, an obstetrician gynecologist at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. In 2020 in the United States alone, there were nearly 500,000 medication-induced abortions, which relied on mifepristone and a second drug, misoprostol, to terminate a pregnancy. The drugs are also used to manage miscarriages. And during the coronavirus pandemic, an influx of new safety data supported what earlier studies had found.</p>



<p>“Millions of people have used this medication,” Owens says. She and other doctors and scientists say decades of data demonstrate mifepristone’s safety and note that the court’s decision could affect access to the drug — even in states where abortion is legal. The case comes nearly a year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling">after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>Owens says she’s concerned that a court’s decision could potentially override medical experts. “If the FDA doesn’t get to say what medications are safe,” she says, “where does that stop?”</p>



<h4>The FDA approved mifepristone 2000. What data did it use to decide?</h4>



<p>On a hot day in July 1996, a group of doctors and scientists who were part of the FDA’s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee gathered in Gaithersburg, Md., to evaluate mifepristone, also known as RU-486 as well as Mifeprex. The drug had already been approved in France, England, Sweden and China. The committee’s job was to review data on the drug’s safety and efficacy for ending an early pregnancy and vote on whether to recommend its use in the United States.</p>





<p>Such committee meetings were typically held at the FDA’s offices in Rockville, but this time was different. This time, the committee members traveled with armed guards. Concern for their safety may have stemmed, in part, from recent violence at abortion clinics in Florida and Massachusetts, Kosasa recalls. The agency held the meeting in a small building north of Rockville; the eight committee members rode in bulletproof vehicles, police escorts leading and trailing the group.</p>



<p>The meeting was open to the public, but security was tight. Visitors went through metal detectors and had their bags scanned. People packed in to hear the proceedings, says committee member Diana Petitti, a physician and epidemiologist who retired from the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix in 2017. “It was totally full,” she recalls. The FDA set up an overflow room nearby for a crowd to watch the meeting on video. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>A timeline of the FDA’s decisions on mifepristone</h3>



<p>Over the last few decades, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed data on the abortion medication mifepristone and updated the conditions of its approval.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1996:</strong> An FDA committee reviewed mifepristone safety data, concluding the benefits outweighed the risks</li>



<li><strong>2000:</strong> The FDA approved mifepristone (Mifeprex) for termination of pregnancy up to seven weeks</li>



<li><strong>2016:</strong> The FDA extended the drug approval through 10 weeks of pregnancy</li>



<li><strong>2021:</strong> An FDA update now allowed people to receive the drug in the mail, without visiting a clinic in person</li>



<li><strong>2021:</strong> The FDA added a requirement that pharmacies that dispense the drug be certified </li>
</ul>

</div>



<p>FDA’s then-commissioner David Kessler opened the meeting with clear instructions for the committee: “What you need to do today is to focus on the science,” he said, according to a <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170403223214/https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/96/transcpt/3198t1a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript</a>. “Examine the clinical data carefully. Ask the tough questions and then give the FDA your best scientific advice based on the data.”</p>



<p>The data came from two clinical trials in France and an ongoing trial in the United States. The French trials enrolled 2,480 women, most of whom were seven weeks pregnant or less, and doctors used a dose of mifepristone followed by misoprostol two days later, if needed, to end the pregnancy. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, causing the lining of the uterus to break down. Misoprostol triggers contractions that help expel that broken-down tissue. </p>



<p>In the French trials, this regimen worked in about 95 percent of women, with few serious side effects, such as severe bleeding. Many women reported painful contractions, and some experienced nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Those are expected side effects of the drugs, Petitti says. “But nothing popped out as something we really ought to be worried about.” Altogether, she says, “The safety question was pretty straightforward.”</p>



<p>The committee took the day to discuss mifepristone and voted 6 to 0 that the benefits exceeded the risks. Two members abstained from voting.</p>



<p>After multiple rounds of reviews, the FDA ultimately followed the committees’ advice and approved mifepristone in 2000, with some restrictions in place. Notably, people could take the medication up to seven weeks of pregnancy, but only under doctor supervision. And patients had to come to the office three times­ — once for mifepristone, once for misoprostol and then again for a follow-up visit.</p>



<p>Petitti says she’s surprised that mifepristone’s safety has been called into question. “I just keep waiting for somebody to show me evidence that shows something different than the evidence I saw in 1996.”</p>



<h4>Doctors collected data on mifepristone during the coronavirus pandemic. Here’s what they found.</h4>



<p>Since mifepristone’s approval, the FDA has eased some of its original restrictions. A&nbsp;2016 update allowed for the drug’s use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy and required just one clinic visit instead of three. Then, the coronavirus pandemic spurred another change that allowed people to access mifepristone by mail, without coming into a clinic in person at all.</p>



<p>The FDA’s updates gave scientists a new way to investigate the safety of the drug, specifically whether past restrictions kept people safer or not. The clinic visit was one of those lifted restrictions, says Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>



<p>Even without the typical pre-abortion ultrasound or pelvic exam, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790319?resultClick=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the medicine was about 95 percent effective at terminating a pregnancy and serious complications were rare</a>, show data that Upadhyay and colleagues collected from February 2020 through January 2021 on nearly 4,000 people throughout the United States. The study “confirms that mifepristone is extremely safe and extremely effective,” she says.</p>



<p>The results echo data from other countries, including a massive study from the United Kingdom that analyzed the records of more than 18,000 telemedicine patients who had medication abortions. The drugs were <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">99 percent effective, and serious outcomes, such as a blood transfusion or major surgery, &nbsp;occurred in just 0.02 percent of people</a>, researchers reported in 2021.</p>



<p>The latest data suggest that doctors can prescribe mifepristone safely, without any special exams, Upadhyay says.</p>



<p>That’s how prescriptions of the medication work in Canada, where mifepristone became widely available in late 2017. Canada’s drug regulators “took a really unprecedented step of treating mifepristone as any other medication,” says Laura Schummers, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. That meant any physician or nurse practitioner can prescribe mifepristone, any pharmacy can dispense it, and patients can take the medication at home “if, when and where they choose,” she says.</p>



<p>Within a few years, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa2109779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the percent of abortions by surgery in Canada dropped from 98 percent to about 69 percent</a>. By early 2020, more than 30 percent of first trimester abortions were provided using medication, Schummers’ team reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 2022. The scientists also analyzed safety trends. “The take-home message was that there was no change at all to the safety outcomes,” Schummers says.</p>



<p>Her team’s paper adds to the stack of studies validating mifepristone’s safety. And medication abortion, she points out, is safer than childbirth, which can be deadly. As scientists reported this year, U.S. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity">maternal deaths continue to climb</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>In the United States, abortion is already difficult to access, Upadhyay says, especially for people of color and people with low incomes. Any decision to restrict or ban mifepristone, she says, “would be devastating for people who are most in need of care.”</p>



<p>In April, a Supreme Court ruling left the drug available for use while the case proceeds with the Fifth Circuit. But the appeals court decision may not be the final word; the Supreme Court could end up having the final say.</p>



<p>This judicial review of medication concerns not only Owens, of the University of Washington, but also Kosasa. He worries what the outcome of the case will mean for the FDA, and the agency’s ability to evaluate and approve drugs — even ones, like mifepristone, with a well-supported safety record.</p>



<p>If courts can go against “a whole tremendous amount of scientific evidence,” Kosasa says, “that just doesn’t seem right.”</p>

<p>The chair of the Department of Pulmonary Immunology at the University of Texas at Tyler Health Science Center lost a paper last year after an institutional investigation found several issues with the data in the article.</p>



<p>Although the researcher, <a href="https://www.uthct.edu/directory-profile/?smid=22942">Ramakrishna Vankayalapati</a>, is still identified as the chair on his online profile and the <a href="https://archive.is/8kijx">department’s website</a>, he no longer holds that position, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17310-5">Ornithine-A urea cycle metabolite enhances autophagy and controls <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection</a>,” was published in <em>Nature Communications</em> in July 2020. It has been cited 21 times, according to the journal&#8217;s statistics.</p>



<span id="more-127132"></span>



<p>Soon after publication, scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a> posted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/57EBD9F0C323014FEB6E0CFE62B64C">several comments on PubPeer</a> about similarities between images in the paper that she and a “reader” had noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thank you so much for letting me know,” Vankayalapati <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/57EBD9F0C323014FEB6E0CFE62B64C#12">responded</a>. “I will look at all data to proceed further. Thanks again.”</p>



<p>After two years with no further response, Bik posted again last July to ask if Vankalapati had contacted the journal. He did not reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last October, the paper was retracted. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33608-y">notice</a> detailed issues with the images Bik had called out in her PubPeer posts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor has retracted this Article at the authors’ request. Following concerns from a reader, the authors initiated an internal investigation. After comparing the laboratory record and the figures, it was concluded that:</p>



<ul>
<li>The﻿ data in Fig. 3c did not originate from three biological replicates as claimed in the legend;</li>



<li>In Figs. 3c and 5f, multiple lanes could not be matched back to the original raw data in the laboratory records;</li>



<li>The GAPDH bands in Figs. 3c, 5f and 6e could not be matched with raw data;</li>



<li>The LC-3B image in Fig. 5f was duplicated and rotated 180 degrees in Fig. 6e to represent p-AMPK (T172);</li>



<li>In Fig. 7d, the 4X and 10X images did not originate from the same samples;</li>



<li>In Fig. 7d, the 10X images of Mtb H37Rv + Ornithine and Mtb H37Rv + Imidazole contain overlap.</li>
</ul>



<p>Further data similarities have been identified in Figs. 2j and S1, as well as within Figs. S5, S10, S11 and S16. In light of these issues, the authors have requested to retract this Article.</p>



<p>Ramya Sivangala Thandi has not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction. All other authors agree to this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vankayalapati has not responded to our request for comment. A spokesperson for the university confirmed that the school had conducted the investigation mentioned in the notice, and that Vankayalapati “is not currently the chair of the department of pulmonary immunology.” She declined to say whether his departure from the role was related to the investigation, citing a policy against discussing personnel matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.txbiomed.org/about/leadership/dr-larry-schlesinger-presidentceo/">Larry S. Schlesinger</a>, one of the coauthors on the paper, is president and CEO of Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. Texas Biomed recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/03/leading-primate-researcher-demoted-after-admitting-he-faked-data/">demoted</a> the director of the Southwest National Primate Research Center after he <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-kaushal-deepak">admitted to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity that he had faked data</a>. The institute initially said “the misconduct finding is not directly related to, and does not impact, his administrative leadership functions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Schlesinger’s retraction, a spokesperson for Texas Biomed told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Schlesinger’s involvement in this study was minimal. Dr. Schlesinger provided some guidance on possible direction in experiments, and they recognized this contribution in co-authorship. The study was not a Texas Biomed study, and the PI is not affiliated with Texas Biomed, so we were not involved in the investigation.</p>

                <p>PLOS is committed to openness and equity to ensure everyone has the opportunity to thrive in the workplace. As a nonprofit mission-driven publisher spread across four countries, we recognize that our 175+ global staff are the reason behind our success, and following the announcement that 34 of our US colleagues have called to unionize, we would like to acknowledge the important role that unions play in improving employees&rsquo; working conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The formation of a US-based Union is a significant step for the organization and one that requires time to consider. We believe that all colleagues across our global workforce deserve to be part of this conversation, as the unionization of a section of regional staff has the potential to disproportionately influence our global organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to take the time to understand the complexities of this action and therefore have&nbsp; elected not to voluntarily recognize the Union at this stage. We will move forward with due process for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the US to ensure we continue a meaningful and constructive dialogue on this important issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain committed to working with all of our staff to ensure PLOS is a thriving, engaged environment for all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-scaled-drawing-desert-kite">The oldest scaled-down drawings of actual structures go back 9,000 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two large, engraved stones found in the Middle East display the oldest known building plans drawn to scale, researchers say.</p>



<p>One carved depiction covers part of a rectangular stone found at a Jordanian campsite dating to about 9,000 years ago. Two other engravings were made roughly 8,000 years ago on a boulder discovered at the base of a cliff in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Carvings on these stones <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0277927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depict nearby desert kites</a>, massive structures once used to capture animal herds, scientists report May 17 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Desert kites consist of stone walls up to five kilometers long that narrow into large enclosures surrounded by pits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killing-fields-ancient-syria-revealed">where hunters trapped animals</a>, such as gazelles and deer (<em>SN: 4/18/11</em>). Kite depictions at the two sites closely resemble the shape, layout and proportions of desert kites found close by, archaeologist Rémy Crassard and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Scale drawings etched in rock may have served as maps that helped hunters plan strategies for driving animal herds into specific desert kites, the scientists report. These engravings might also have been blueprints for building desert kites, or public displays of their makers’ ability to transfer large, 3-D structures onto small, flat surfaces.</p>

<p>As farming and animal domestication took root in parts of the Middle East, regional hunting groups that built desert kites to trap wild animal herds maintained a special regard for massive hunting structures, says Crassard, of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Lyon.</p>



<p>Other ancient maps and structural plans, intended as scaled-down drawings, date to about 4,300 years ago in Mesopotamia. Those depictions, Crassard says, were not as accurate as the newly discovered desert kite engravings.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Eleonora Bernasconi will present her work about &quot;Computational model of the cerebellar cortex&quot;. Please find below to see the abstract of one of the related papers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals driving cerebellar learning, but
mechanisms causing the variable CF responses in Purkinje cells (PCs) are not fully
understood. Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we unveil the ionic mechanisms
underlying CF-evoked distinct spike waveforms on different parts of the PC. We demonstrate
that voltage can gate both the amplitude and the spatial range of CF-evoked Ca2+ influx by
the availability of K+ currents. This makes the energy consumed during a complex spike
(CS) also voltage dependent. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with
individual branches as computational units for CF input. The variability of somatic CSs
can be explained by voltage state, CF activation phase, and instantaneous CF firing rate.
Concurrent clustered synaptic inputs affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a
spatially precise way. The voltage- and branch-specific CF responses can increase
dendritic computational capacity and enable PCs to actively integrate CF signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antenor-firmin-anthropology-racism-haiti">Anténor Firmin challenged anthropology’s racist roots 150 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the end of the 19th century, one of the hottest debates among anthropologists was whether human beings originated from a single ancestor or many (the answer: just one). Members of both camps, though, largely agreed that whatever their origins, some races were superior to others. Haitian anthropologist Anténor Firmin knew that premise to be false.</p>



<p>“Human beings everywhere are endowed with the same qualities and defects, without distinctions based on color or anatomical shape,” Firmin wrote in French in his 1885 book, <em>The Equality of the Human Races</em>. “The races are equal.”</p>





<p>Firmin was ahead of his time. Today, genetic research confirms that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">human populations cannot be divided</a> into distinct racial groups.</p>



<p>But few scholars in the nascent field of anthropology, or any other contemporaries, read his treatise. Instead, leaders in the field were deeply influenced by the French white supremacist Arthur de Gobineau’s four-volume <em>Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races</em>, published in the 1850s. Against that backdrop, in 1859, Paul Broca, a French physician and brain researcher interested in the study of human origins, founded the Société d’Anthropologie de Paris, one of the first anthropological societies in Europe. Broca believed he could use skull measurements to identify human populations, which could then be categorized into a racial hierarchy. When Firmin joined that society in the 1880s, such racist views had become foundational to anthropology.</p>



<p>Few anthropologists outside of Firmin’s native Haiti have heard of <em>The Equality of the Human Races, </em>anthropologist Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban of Rhode Island College in Providence wrote in <em>American Anthropologist</em> in 2000<em>.</em> “This is hardly surprising since most of the early [Black] pioneers of anthropology have only recently been brought to light.”</p>



<p>Those leaders include many other Haitians, such as doctor and writer Louis-Joseph Janvier, who wrote <em>The Equality of Races</em> in 1884, and politician Hannibal Price, who wrote <em>On the Rehabilitation of the Black Race by the Republic of Haiti </em>in 1900. American abolitionist Martin Delany wrote<em> Principia of Ethnology: The Origin of Races and Color</em> in 1879.</p>



<p>Firmin would probably still be languishing in near-total obscurity if not for an English translation of his book that came out in 2000. Following that publication, a small number of anthropologists and other social scientists began calling for Firmin to be recognized as a founding father of anthropology. His arguments, after all, predated by several decades similar arguments by the German-American scholar Franz Boas, often considered the father of modern anthropology. Like Firmin, Boas argued that race was a cultural construct.</p>



<p>Firmin was among the first to view anthropology as the study of all humankind, rather than the more divisive approach common in his day, says Fluehr-Lobban, who wrote the introduction to the English translation.</p>



<p>Firmin also brought to his book a deep scientific rigor that was not yet common in the field. His highest priority was that “the case be made on the facts,” Fluehr-Lobban says. &nbsp;</p>





<h4>No evidence for racial hierarchies</h4>



<p>Firmin was born in the northern town of Cap-Haitien in 1850 to a working-class family. He grew up at a time of tremendous national pride. Haiti achieved independence from France in 1804, making it the first free Black republic in the world and the first independent nation in the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a young adult, Firmin studied law, which led to a career in politics. He served as the inspector of schools in Cap-Haitien and as a Haitian government official in Caracas, Venezuela. He married his neighbor, Rosa Salnave, in 1881. In 1883, Firmin became Haiti’s diplomat for France and moved to Paris.</p>



<p>Firmin, like many scholars of his day, read across fields, Fluehr-Lobban says. That led him to become interested in the study of humankind. While in Paris, Firmin spoke of this interest with French physician Ernest Aubertin, who invited him to join the Société d&#8217;Anthropologie de Paris.</p>



<p>It did not take long for Firmin to question his membership in a group openly hostile to people who looked like him. Faced with such a tough environment, Firmin remained silent at meetings. He acknowledges this reluctance to strike up a debate with other society members in his book’s preface: “I risked being perceived as an intruder and, being ill-disposed against me, my colleagues might have rejected my request without further thought.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Firmin penned his 451-page rebuttal, using a title that clearly contradicted de Gobineau’s influential work.</p>



<p>On a general level, Firmin takes aim at the nonscientific tenor of many society members’ arguments. “On the one hand, there is a dearth of solid principles in anthropological science at this point; on the other hand, and precisely for this reason, its practitioners, with their methodical minds, are able to construct the most extravagant theories, from which they can draw the most absurd and pretentious conclusions,” Firmin writes in a chapter devoted to dismantling the then-popular classification of races using cranial measurements.</p>



<p>Firmin uses the bulk of the book, though, to flesh out his argument in precise detail. For instance, Firmin conducts a thorough analysis of the physical factors that were purported to separate the races, such as height, size, muscularity and cranium shape. He then painstakingly combs through the data to debunk prevalent theories of racial hierarchies.</p>



<p>“What can we conclude here from these observations? Can we find here any indication of hierarchy at all?” he queries at one point in reference to a chart on brain volume. The question is rhetorical. The measurements of supposedly distinct racial groups instead often overlap. Nor do the measurements conform to established racial hierarchies. “It is all so very anarchic,” he concludes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The power of Firmin’s writings stem from his deep commitment to following the evidence, says Niccolo Caldararo, an anthropologist at San Francisco State University. “His criticism of European, especially French scientists, was so careful, was so precise, was so perfectly defined that he undermined their practice as bias rather than empiricism.”</p>



<h4>Firmin’s modern-day relevance</h4>



<p>The translation of Firmin’s text came out of a chance encounter between Fluehr-Lobban and a Haitian student in her Race and Racism class in 1988. That student approached Fluehr-Lobban and asked if she had ever heard of Firmin. She had not but was intrigued.</p>



<p>In collaboration with Asselin Charles, a Haitian-born literary scholar then at neighboring Brown University, the duo set out to find a copy of the book. That turned out to be no easy feat. “There were three copies in the United States,” Fluehr-Lobban says. “One of them was in the Library of Congress.”</p>



<p>To Fluehr-Lobban’s surprise, upon receiving her request, library staffers sent her the book. Charles served as translator. “As a result of this book coming out in English, it had a whole new life,” Fluehr-Lobban says. Still, she adds, the book has yet to get its due: “It has not gotten into the canon of anthropology.”</p>



<p>Fluehr-Lobban hopes that will change, especially given the book’s modern-day relevance. Despite clear evidence that race has no biological basis, some scientists still use the concept as an organizing principle. And racism remains prevalent.</p>



<p>“This was a critical race theory book [written] in 1885,” Fluehr-Lobban says.</p>



<p>Firmin, however, remained optimistic that science would eventually get the last word. “Truth is like light: one may hide it for as long as human intelligence can conceive, it will still shine in the cellar where it has been related; at the least opportunity, its rays will pierce the darkness and, as it shines for all, it will compel the most rebellious minds to bend before its laws,” he wrote. “Science owes all its prestige only to this power, to this intransigence of the truth.” &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spleen-ultrasound-treatment-inflammation">Stimulating spleens with ultrasound hints at a treatment for inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <p>We typically think of using ultrasound to take pictures of our organs and tissues to check if they are healthy. But a slight tweak to the tool might lead to treatments for certain diseases, scientists suggest.</p>



<p>Stimulating people’s spleens with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X23017436#abs0015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrasound waves appears to briefly reduce a sign of inflammation</a> in samples of their blood, researchers report in the May–June issue of <em>Brain Stimulation</em>. If validated in further studies, the results could lead the way toward a noninvasive therapy for chronic inflammation, the team says.</p>





<p>The ultrasound waves used in the new study are more intense than what’s used to generate images, and they’re specially designed to stimulate nerves. Past research on targeting different brain areas or the spinal cord with such intense sound waves has shown potential for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00549/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treating neurological diseases</a>. And when directed at the liver, the technique — called focused ultrasound stimulation, or FUS — has helped to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00870-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce signs of diabetes</a> in mice, rats and pigs.</p>



<p>It “is a pretty active area of research right now,” says neurophysiologist Stavros Zanos of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Long Island, New York.</p>



<p>Zanos and his team wondered whether FUS targeted at the spleen could help to tamp down inflammation. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/not-so-dispensable-spleen">spleen</a> stores and filters blood (<em>SN: 7/30/09</em>). When something goes awry anywhere in the body and a distress signal is sent via the blood, immune cells in the organ know about it. So do cells in the splenic nerve, which reacts to the signal by telling immune cells how strong of an inflammatory response to initiate.</p>



<p>Zanos’ group recently showed that targeting rodents’ spleen with FUS <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08750-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to reduce inflammation</a>. “It was about time to test [the technique] in humans to see if it has any chance of working,” he says.</p>



<p>The team administered FUS to 60 healthy people, in slightly different locations of the spleen and at different intensities. Researchers then exposed a blood sample drawn from each of 60 participants who had FUS and 10 who did not to a type of toxin that would normally trigger an inflammatory response. (For safety reasons, the team could not directly expose the participants to the toxin.)</p>



<p>One hallmark of an inflammatory response is that white blood cells release a blood protein called TNF, tumor necrosis factor. The more TNF, the larger the response. All samples from participants who received FUS, regardless of the intensity or location, had about a third the amount of TNF — 300 picograms per milliliter on average — than samples from individuals who had not had the treatment, suggesting the treatment dampened overall immune response. The effect seen in the blood sample lasted more than two hours, and there were no safety issues with FUS, the team reports.</p>



<p>“This really portrays the strength of the ultrasound as a noninvasive intervention that can successfully modulate neurons,” says Jan Kubanek, a biomedical engineer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>But Kubanek has reservations about the applicability of the results because the inflammation test was done outside the body. He says he would like to see results showing that inflammation in the body drops after FUS, especially in people with chronic inflammation.</p>



<p>Practical challenges, such as the delivery and frequency of FUS treatments, could also stand in the way of spleen-targeted FUS leaving the lab, he says.</p>



<p>Zanos agrees. “There are so many questions of how applicable this therapy will be to treating real patients, even if it’s effective,” he says. “I think it&#8217;s an important thing for people to remember, especially patients who expect a lot from these new technologies,” he says. “We shouldn&#8217;t overpromise.”</p>

<p>A university in Japan has revoked the doctoral degree of a former student found to have manipulated images and graphs in a dissertation and two published papers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although our university has been working to raise awareness of research ethics in order to prevent research misconduct, it is extremely regrettable that such a situation has occurred,&#8221; Tohoku University President Hideo Ohno said in an <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/japanese/2023/03/news20230330-koho.html">announcement</a> made on March 30 (translated from the Japanese using Google Translate).</p>



<p>The school did not name the former student, who was first author on both papers. But details mentioned in its investigation <a href="https://www.bureau.tohoku.ac.jp/kenkyo/fb/files/rules/61.pdf">report</a> (in Japanese) point to a researcher called Nan Li. Li was also named on a <a href="https://blog.goo.ne.jp/lemon-stoism/e/2b2270b33aa72eae7f44283aa10e8e34">blog</a> in Japan that covered the case (in Japanese).&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127126"></span>



<p>We reached out to Tohoku for confirmation, but the school declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Google translation of Tohoku&#8217;s report, the former student admitted to &#8220;cutting and pasting&#8221; part of a figure in a paper and was found to have &#8220;deliberately committed misconduct.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since the fabrication/falsification involved fraudulent acts in an important part of Article 1 and affected the conclusion, the degree of maliciousness of the act was judged to be &#8216;high,'&#8221; the report states, noting that &#8220;the article was retracted immediately after publication.&#8221;</p>



<p>A paper titled &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/62/4/e1/6140782">Chloroplast proteotoxic stress-induced autophagy is involved in the degradation of chloroplast proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</a>&#8221; was published in 2021 in <em>Plant and Cell Physiology</em> and retracted the same year. The affiliations of first author Nan Li were listed as Tohoku University and Liaocheng University in China.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/62/4/741/6268295?login=false">retraction notice</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following article publication, the corresponding author flagged concerns over potential image manipulation and duplication of some of the Western blot data in Figures 5 and 9C, and the first author has since admitted to this image duplication. The senior author has been unable to verify or reproduce the data in these figures and as such confidence in the experiments and figures generated by the first author have been undermined (i.e. Figures 3B, 3C, 5, 6, 7C and 9C). Consequently, the authors and editors have agreed to retract this article. The first author wishes to express apologies to the other authors of this work, and all co-authors apologize to the general scientific community for the inconvenience caused.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Masanori Izumi, did not respond to a request for comments.</p>



<p>According to Tohoku&#8217;s investigation, another paper by the former student contained a figure that was &#8220;cut and pasted&#8221; and the student &#8220;did not provide a sufficient explanation of the problem.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The suspect figure &#8220;does not affect the conclusion of the paper,&#8221; the report states. But it constituted an &#8220;important part&#8221; of the student&#8217;s doctoral dissertation, titled &#8220;Mechanisms of UVB and UVA/Blue light inducible expression of CPD photolyase in de-etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings: UVR8-dependent/independent and cryptochrome-dependent pathways.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Li&#8217;s papers, &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/56/10/2014/2461035">UV-B-Induced CPD Photolyase Gene Expression is Regulated by UVR8-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Arabidopsis</a>,&#8221; published in <em>Plant and Cell Physiology</em> in 2015, was corrected in 2022. The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/63/12/2042/6833004">correction notice</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The corresponding author contacted the journal in March 2022 with concerns about manipulation of&nbsp;<a href="about:blank">Figs. 2B and 5C</a>, which were compiled by the first author. Upon request of the journal editors, the authors repeated the experiments for the figures concerned and achieved similar results supporting the original conclusions of the work, as shown below. All other results in the paper were confirmed and validated by original supporting data and/or new reproducibility experiments supplied by the senior author. The editors are satisfied that the results and overall conclusions of the original work have not changed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Jun Hidema, did not answer a request for comments.</p>



<p>The investigative committee found that neither of the two corresponding authors on the former student&#8217;s papers was &#8220;involved in the misconduct.&#8221;</p>



<p>We could not ascertain Nan Li&#8217;s current affiliation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antidote-death-cap-mushrooms">Scientists may have found an antidote for death cap mushrooms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Death cap mushrooms get their name for a reason: The poisonous fungi can kill if ingested in even small amounts. But researchers may have found an antidote for one of the mushroom’s most deadly toxins.</p>



<p>A dye already used in medical procedures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37714-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can block damage from the mushroom’s alpha-amanitin toxin</a>, researchers report May 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The work was done with human cells grown in lab dishes and with mice. If the finding holds up in trials with people, the antidote has potential to save lives.</p>





<p>Death cap mushrooms (<em>Amanita phalloides</em>) are responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6621a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the majority of deaths from mushroom poisonings</a> worldwide. Symptoms may appear as soon as six hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If a person isn’t treated immediately, the toxins can cause liver and kidney damage that can lead to death within 48 hours after ingestion. There is no antidote currently available, but people can be treated with fluids, activated charcoal and other therapies.</p>



<p>How alpha-amanitin kills isn’t fully understood. A team of researchers in China and Australia used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9</a> to determine which human genes the toxin triggers to cause cell damage and death (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). One of those genes makes a protein called STT3B, which helps attach sugars to proteins. Scientists hadn’t known that that process was important for mushroom toxicity.</p>



<p>The team then screened a library of more than 3,000 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for molecules that could inhibit STT3B’s action. The team found that the dye indocyanine green could stop the protein from doing its job and prevent human cells in lab dishes from dying after being treated with alpha-amanitin.</p>



<p>In tests with mice poisoned with alpha-amanitin, the dye reduced liver and kidney damage and increased survival rates if given one to four hours after poisoning. Waiting eight to 12 hours to administer the antidote reduced its effectiveness, the team found, probably because irreversible organ damage had already occurred.</p>
