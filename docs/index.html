<p>The corresponding author of a recently published – and then quickly retracted – letter in <em>The Lancet</em> decrying the failure of the Chinese Ministry of Health to pay doctors and other health care workers says authorities did not pressure him to withdraw the piece.</p>



<p>The letter begins:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end in China, medical personnel who have worked tirelessly to fight the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant are now facing a new challenge. Despite their heroic efforts, many of them are now struggling to receive the financial compensation they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The second sentence cites a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/okprK5R0CENaQVnZyQTG5Q">blog post on Weixin</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126893"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673623006918">retraction notice</a>, published on March 31, just eight days after the original letter, blames “inaccurate statements and personal opinions from social media” for the authors’ decision to retract, which was communicated to the journal on March 27.</p>



<p>By our count, there have now been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">315 retractions of COVID-19 papers</a>.</p>



<p>Tian Yang, the corresponding author of the letter and a liver specialist at Hangzhou Medical College and Second Military Medical University (Navy Medical University) in Shanghai, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reason for the retraction is due to “inaccurate statements and personal opinions” that this correspondence cited one reference from personal social media sources. As scholars, we recognize the importance of upholding objectivity and accuracy in our statement, and we believe that these issues compromised the integrity of this correspondence. While there were no instances of academic misconduct such as data fabrication, image duplication, or plagiarism, we felt it was necessary to take this action to demonstrate our commitment to these principles.</p>

<p>Given questions about <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/04/24/chinese-state-censorship-of-covid-19-research-represents-a-looming-crisis-for-academic-publishers/">censorship of COVID-19 research</a> by the Chinese government, we asked Yang – who urged us not to report on the case – whether he had been pressured to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of course not,” he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-bat-skeletons-oldest-fossils">Newfound bat skeletons are the oldest on record</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two fossilized bat skeletons unearthed in western Wyoming represent a new species and are the oldest set of bat bones yet discovered, researchers say.</p>



<p>The incredibly <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283505" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete fossils of <em>Icaronycteris gunnelli</em></a>, which show all the animals’ bones in lifelike positions, are from limestone rocks that accumulated as lake sediments about 52.5 million years ago, vertebrate paleontologist Tim Rietbergen and colleagues report April 12 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Skeletons of the few other bat species, including another one from the <em>Icaronycteris</em> genus, found in the same limestones, called the Green River Formation, were preserved at least 40 centimeters above the new fossils — and are thus younger.</p>





<p>But it’s difficult to estimate just how much younger those fossils are because researchers don’t know how rapidly sediments accumulated over time, says Rietbergen, of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.</p>



<p>An analysis of the newfound skeletons indicates <em>I</em>. <em>gunnelli</em> is the runt of its genus. The species has a wingspan, typically estimated from the length of forearm bones, that is almost 7 percent smaller than that of the bat’s closest known cousin, Rietbergen and colleagues say. During its lifetime, <em>I. gunnelli </em>weighed somewhere between 22.5 and 28.9 grams — roughly half as heavy as a tennis ball, the team calculates.</p>



<p>These skeletons “are a great discovery,” says Zhe-Xi Luo, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the study. The arrangement of bones in <em>I. gunnelli</em>’s feet suggest that it, like many modern bats, hung upside down when roosting, he says.</p>



<p>Because the skeletons are so much like those of some modern bats, “we’re not any closer to knowing what type of creatures bats evolved from,” says Brock Fenton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, who also was not involved with the work. The world’s oldest known bats lived about 56 million years ago, but the fossils of those species are mostly isolated teeth, not entire skeletons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gold-nanoparticles-crystal-structure">Videos of gold nanoparticles snapping together show how some crystals grow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mesmerizing videos offer a new look at the ways crystals form.</p>



<p>The real-time clips, described March 30 in <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>, show closeup views of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-023-01355-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microscopic gold particles tumbling, sliding and flitting about</a> before clicking into place in crystalline structures.</p>



<p>Before embarking on the study, physicist Erik Luijten of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., had expected to simply confirm century-old perceptions about how crystals form. But, he says, “there was still so much to discover about crystallization.” &nbsp;</p>





<p>Atoms that make up familiar crystals such as salt, sugar and quartz are hard to image in action. So the team turned to gold nanoparticles, each about 60 billionths of a meter across, or roughly one-thousandth the diameter of a typical human hair. The researchers used transmission electron microscopy to track the particles as they snapped into position after floating in a salty fluid.</p>



<p>Among the surprises in the videos, Luijten says, is the way crystallization depended on the gold nanoparticles skittering across crystal surfaces, as well as how the particles rapidly made their way to the growing crystals from the surrounding fluid. The videos allowed the researchers to find ways to control both of those processes.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gold nanocubes, each about 60 billionths of a meter on a side, come together to form a growing crystal in a salty fluid. Yellow dots highlight the newest additions to the crystal as the nanocubes attach.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By adjusting the chemistry of the fluid, the researchers tuned the rate at which the nanoparticles were deposited from the surrounding solution to build up the crystals. Choosing among shapes including cubes, cubes with indented faces and spheres changed how the particles moved along the crystals. By changing both fluid chemistry and particle shape, the researchers controlled whether the nanoparticle crystals grew smooth planes or rough surfaces.</p>



<p>The nanoparticles are hundreds of times the size of atoms. But the researchers think that atoms grow into crystals in much the same way, making the nanoparticles handy stand-ins. The study could aid in the design of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry">bendable electronics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">high-efficiency solar cells</a> and other materials with properties that rely on crystal structures (<em>SN: 6/1/18; SN: 7/26/17</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chatgpt-ai-artificial-intelligence-education-cheating-accuracy">How ChatGPT and similar AI will disrupt education</a></h4>

              
                <p>“We need to talk,” Brett Vogelsinger said. A student had just asked for feedback on an essay. One paragraph stood out. Vogelsinger, a ninth grade English teacher in Doylestown, Pa., realized that the student hadn’t written the piece himself. He had used ChatGPT.</p>



<p>The artificial intelligence tool, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made available for free</a> late last year by the company OpenAI, can reply to simple prompts and generate essays and stories. It can also write code.</p>



<p>Within a week, it had more than a million users. As of early 2023, Microsoft planned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to invest $10&nbsp;billion into OpenAI</a>, and OpenAI’s value had been put at $29 billion, more than double what it was in 2021.</p>





<p>It’s no wonder other tech companies have been racing to put out competing tools. Anthropic, an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees, is testing a new chatbot called Claude. Google <a href="https://bard.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Bard</a> in early February, and the Chinese search company Baidu released Ernie Bot in March.</p>



<p>A lot of people have been using ChatGPT out of curiosity or for entertainment. I asked it to invent a silly excuse for not doing homework in the style of a medieval proclamation. In less than a second, it offered me: “Hark! Thy servant was beset by a horde of mischievous leprechauns, who didst steal mine quill and parchment, rendering me unable to complete mine homework.”</p>



<p>But students can also use it to cheat. ChatGPT marks the beginning of a new wave of AI, a wave that’s poised to disrupt education.</p>



<p>When Stanford University’s student-run newspaper polled students at the university, 17 percent <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/01/22/scores-of-stanford-students-used-chatgpt-on-final-exams-survey-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said they had used ChatGPT on assignments or exams</a> at the end of 2022. Some admitted to submitting the chatbot’s writing as their own. For now, these students and others are probably getting away with it. That’s because ChatGPT often does an excellent job.</p>



<p>“It can outperform a lot of middle school kids,” Vogelsinger says. He might not have known his student had used it, except for one thing: “He copied and pasted the prompt.”</p>



<p>The essay was still a work in progress, so Vogelsinger didn’t see it as cheating. Instead, he saw an opportunity. Now, the student and AI are working together. ChatGPT is helping the student with his writing and research skills.</p>





<p>“[We’re] color-coding,” Vogelsinger says. The parts the student writes are in green. The parts from ChatGPT are in blue. Vogelsinger is helping the student pick and choose a few sentences from the AI to expand on — and allowing other students to collaborate with the tool as well. Most aren’t turning to it regularly, but a few kids really like it. Vogelsinger thinks the tool has helped them focus their ideas and get started.</p>



<p>This story had a happy ending. But at many schools and universities, educators are struggling with how to handle ChatGPT and other AI tools.</p>



<p>In early January, <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City public schools banned ChatGPT</a> on their devices and networks. Educators were worried that students who turned to it wouldn’t learn critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. They also were concerned that the tool’s answers might not be accurate or safe. Many other school systems in the United States and around the world have imposed similar bans.</p>



<p>Keith Schwarz, who teaches computer science at Stanford, said he had “switched back to pencil-and-paper exams,” so students couldn’t use ChatGPT, according to the <em>Stanford Daily</em>.</p>



<p>Yet ChatGPT and its kin could also be a great service to learners everywhere. Like calculators for math or Google for facts, AI can make writing that often takes time and effort much faster. With these tools, anyone can generate well-formed sentences and paragraphs. How could this change the way we teach and learn?</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Who said what? </h3>



<p>When prompted, ChatGPT can craft answers that sound surprisingly like those from a student. We asked middle school and high school students from across the country, all participants in our <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/outreach-and-equity/science-news-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science News Learning education program</a>, to answer some basic science questions in two sentences or less. The examples throughout the story compare how students responded with how ChatGPT responded when asked to answer the question at the same grade level.</p>

<h5>What effect do greenhouse gases have on the Earth?</h5>



<h6>Agnes B. | Grade 11, Harbor City International School, Minn.</h6>



<p>Greenhouse gases effectively trap heat from dissipating out of the atmosphere, increasing the amount of heat that remains near Earth in the troposphere.</p>



<h6>ChatGPT</h6>



<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing the planet to warm up and leading to climate change and its associated impacts like sea level rise, more frequent extreme weather events and shifts in ecosystems.</p>

<h4>The good, bad and weird of ChatGPT</h4>



<p>ChatGPT has wowed its users. “It’s so much more realistic than I thought a robot could be,” says Avani Rao, a sophomore in high school in California. She hasn’t used the bot to do homework. But for fun, she’s prompted it to say creative or silly things. She asked it to explain addition, for instance, in the voice of an evil villain.</p>



<p>Given how well it performs, there are plenty of ways that ChatGPT could level the playing field for students and others working in a second language or struggling with composing sentences. Since ChatGPT generates new, original material, its text is not technically plagiarism.</p>



<p>Students could use ChatGPT like a coach to help improve their writing and grammar, or even to explain subjects they find challenging. “It really will tutor you,” says Vogelsinger, who had one student come to him excited that ChatGPT had clearly outlined a concept from science class.</p>



<p>Educators could use ChatGPT to help generate lesson plans, activities or assessments — perhaps even personalized to address the needs or goals of specific students.</p>



<p>Xiaoming Zhai, an expert in science education at the University of Georgia in Athens, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4312418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested ChatGPT to see if it could write an academic paper</a>. He was impressed with how easy it was to summarize knowledge and generate good writing using the tool. “It’s really amazing,” he says.</p>



<p>All of this sounds wonderful, but really big problems exist. Most worrying, ChatGPT and other similar tools can often get things very wrong. They don’t pull facts from databases. Rather, they are trained to generate new text that sounds natural. They remix language without understanding it, which can lead to glaring mistakes.</p>



<p>The news website CNET came under fire earlier this year for using AI to churn out dozens of articles, many of them packed with errors. In an early advertisement for the Bard chatbot, it made a factual error about the James Webb Space Telescope, incorrectly claiming that it had taken the very first picture of an exoplanet. And ChatGPT said in a conversation posted on Twitter that the fastest marine mammal was the peregrine falcon. A falcon, of course, is a bird and doesn’t live in the ocean.</p>



<p>ChatGPT is “confidently wrong,” says Casey Fiesler, an expert in the ethics of technology at the University of Colorado Boulder. “There are mistakes and bad information.” She has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey/video/7176001815341944110?is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made multiple TikTok videos about the pitfalls of ChatGPT</a>.</p>



<p>Most of ChatGPT’s training data come from before September 2021, and it does not provide sources for its information. If asked for sources, it makes them up, Fiesler <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey/video/7175274448231173419?_r=1&amp;_t=8Y9IFiLVQg2&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed in one video</a>. Zhai, who sees the tool as an assistant, discovered the exact same thing. When he asked ChatGPT for citations, it gave him sources that looked correct. But they didn’t actually exist.</p>

<h4>How ChatGPT works</h4>



<p>ChatGPT’s mistakes make sense if you know how it works. “It doesn’t reason. It doesn’t have ideas. It doesn’t have thoughts,” explains Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>ChatGPT was developed using at least two types of machine learning. The primary type is a large language model based on an artificial neural network. Loosely inspired by how neurons in the brain interact, this computing architecture finds statistical patterns in vast amounts of data.</p>



<p>A language model learns to predict what words will come next in a sentence or phrase by churning through vast amounts of text. It places words and phrases into a multidimensional map that represents their relationships to one another. Words that tend to come together, like peanut butter and jelly, end up closer together in this map.</p>



<p>The size of an artificial neural network is measured in parameters. These internal values get tweaked as the model learns. In 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3. At the time, it was the biggest language model ever, containing 175 billion parameters. It had trained on text from the internet as well as digitized books and academic journals. Training text also included transcripts of dialog, essays, exams and more, says Sasha Luccioni, a Montreal-based researcher at Hugging Face, a company that builds AI tools.</p>



<p>OpenAI improved upon GPT-3 to create GPT-3.5. In early 2022, the company released a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 called InstructGPT. This time, OpenAI added a new type of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning with human feedback, it puts people into the training process. These workers check the AI’s output. Responses that people like get rewarded. Human feedback can also help reduce hurtful, biased or inappropriate responses. This fine-tuned language model powers freely available ChatGPT. As of March, paying users receive answers powered by GPT-4, a bigger language model.</p>



<p>During ChatGPT’s development, OpenAI added extra safety rules to the model. It will refuse to answer certain sensitive prompts or provide harmful information. But this step raises another issue: Whose values are programmed into the bot, including what it is — or is not — allowed to talk about?</p>



<p>OpenAI is not offering exact details about how it developed and trained ChatGPT. The company has not released its code or training data. This disappoints Luccioni because it means the tool can’t benefit from the perspectives of the larger AI community. “I’d like to know how it works so I can understand how to make it better,” she says.</p>



<p>When asked to comment on this story, OpenAI provided a statement from an unnamed spokesperson. “We made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from real-world use, which we believe is a critical part of developing and deploying capable, safe AI systems,” the statement said. “We are constantly incorporating feedback and lessons learned.” Indeed, some experimenters have gotten the bot to say biased or inappropriate things despite the safety rules. OpenAI has been patching the tool as these problems come up.</p>



<p>ChatGPT is not a finished product. OpenAI needs data from the real world. The people who are using it are the guinea pigs. Notes Bender: “You are working for OpenAI for free.”</p>

<h4>ChatGPT’s academic performance</h4>



<p>How good is ChatGPT in an academic setting? Catherine Gao, a doctor and medical researcher at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, is part of one team of researchers that is putting the tool to the test.</p>



<p>Gao and her colleagues gathered 50 real abstracts from research papers in medical journals and then, after providing the titles of the papers and the journal names, asked ChatGPT to generate 50 fake abstracts. The team asked people familiar with reading and writing these types of research papers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521610v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to identify which were which</a>.</p>



<p>“I was surprised by how realistic and convincing the generated abstracts were,” Gao says. The reviewers mistook roughly one-third of the AI-generated abstracts as human-generated.</p>



<p>In another study, Will Yeadon and colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested whether AI tools could pass a college exam</a>. Yeadon, a physics instructor at Durham University in England, picked an exam from a course that he teaches. The test asks students to write five short essays about physics and its history. Students have an average score of 71 percent, which he says is equivalent to an A in the United States.</p>



<p>Yeadon used the tool davinci-003, a close cousin of ChatGPT. It generated 10 sets of exam answers. Then Yeadon and four other teachers graded the answers using their typical standards. The AI also scored an average of 71 percent. Unlike the human students, though, it had no very low or very high marks. It consistently wrote well, but not excellently. For students who regularly get bad grades in writing, Yeadon says, it “will write a better essay than you.”</p>



<p>These graders knew they were looking at AI work. In a follow-up study, Yeadon plans to use work from the AI and students and not tell the graders whose is whose.</p>

<h4>Tools to check for cheating</h4>



<p>When it’s unclear whether ChatGPT wrote something or not, other AI tools may help. These tools typically train on AI-generated text and sometimes human-generated text as well. They can tell you how likely it is that text was composed by an AI. Many of the existing tools were trained on older language models, but developers are working quickly to put out new, improved tools.</p>



<p>A company called Originality.ai sells access to a tool that trained on GPT-3. Founder Jon Gillham says that in a test of 10,000 samples of texts composed by models based on GPT-3, the tool tagged 94 percent of them correctly as AI-generated. When ChatGPT came out, his team tested a smaller set of 20 samples. Each only 500 words in length, these had been created by ChatGPT and other models based on GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. Here, Gillham says, the tool correctly identified 97&nbsp;percent of them as AI-generated.</p>



<p>In late January 2023, OpenAI released its own free tool for spotting AI writing, cautioning that the tool was “not fully reliable.” The company is working to add watermarks to its AI text, which would tag the output as machine-generated, but doesn’t give details on how. Gillham describes one possible approach: Whenever it generates text, the AI ranks many different possible words for each position. If its developers told it to always choose the word ranked in third place rather than first place at specific points in its output, those words could act as a fingerprint, he says.</p>



<p>As AI writing tools improve, the tools to sniff them out will need to improve as well. Eventually, some sort of watermark might be the only way to sort out true authorship.</p>

<h4>ChatGPT and the future of writing</h4>



<p>There’s no doubt we will soon have to adjust to a world in which computers can write for us. But educators have made these sorts of adjustments before. As high school student Rao points out, Google was once seen as a threat to education because it made it possible to look up facts instantly. Teachers adapted by coming up with teaching and testing materials that don’t depend as heavily on memorization.</p>



<p>Now that AI can generate essays and stories, teachers may once again have to rethink how they teach and test. Rao says: “We might have to shift our point of view about what’s cheating and what isn’t.”</p>



<p>Some teachers will prevent students from using AI by limiting access to technology. Right now, Vogelsinger says, teachers regularly ask students to write out answers or essays at home. “I think those assignments will have to change,” he says. But he hopes that doesn’t mean kids do less writing.</p>



<p>Teaching students to write without AI’s help will remain essential, agrees Zhai. That’s because “we really care about a student’s thinking,” he stresses. And writing is a great way to demonstrate thinking. Though ChatGPT can help a student organize their thoughts, it can’t think for them, he says.</p>



<p>Kids still learn to do basic math even though they have calculators (which are often on the phones they never leave home without), Zhai acknowledges. Once students have learned basic math, they can lean on a calculator for help with more complex problems.</p>



<p>In the same way, once students have learned to compose their thoughts, they could turn to a tool like ChatGPT for assistance with crafting an essay or story. Vogelsinger doesn’t expect writing classes to become editing classes, where students brush up AI content. He instead imagines students doing prewriting or brainstorming, then using AI to generate parts of a draft, and working back and forth to revise and refine from there.</p>



<p>Though he’s overwhelmed about the prospect of having to adapt his teaching to another new technology, he says he is “having fun” figuring out how to navigate the new tech with his students.</p>



<p>Rao doesn’t see AI ever replacing stories and other texts generated by humans. Why? “The reason those things exist is not only because we want to read it but because we want to write it,” she says. People will always want to make their voices heard.</p>

<p>Six months after the authors of a 2012 paper requested its retraction, a marketing journal is still investigating the concerns,&nbsp; Retraction Watch has learned. Other researchers had failed to replicate the findings – that consumers choose portion sizes based on their desire to signal higher social status –&nbsp; and discovered anomalies in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/38/6/1047/1790951">Super Size Me: Product Size as a Signal of Status</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> and attracted media attention from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/us/a-new-linkage-offers-possibilities-in-the-anti-obesity-campaign.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/11/04/142019920/do-people-pick-super-sized-portions-to-boost-their-social-status">NPR</a>, among other outlets. The lay media interpreted the findings as helping to explain the rise in obesity in the United States. The article has been cited 180 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same authors requested the retraction of another paper, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/68/2379624">Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth</a>, published in 2016 and cited 61 times, which the journal is also still investigating.</p>



<span id="more-126889"></span>



<p>Problems with the portion size paper date back to 2020, when a team of researchers posted a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/fm7aj">preprint</a>, later published in <a href="https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/2538"><em>Meta-Psychology</em></a>, about their unsuccessful attempt to directly replicate one of its experiments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was slightly disappointed but not too surprised,” said Ignazio Ziano, now a professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, who oversaw the replication by a master’s student of his when he was a professor at the Grenoble Ecole de Management in France. “I thought this was just another unreplicable finding like so many others that are published in consumer behavior journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group not only failed to replicate the results, but they also found inconsistencies in the statistical calculations. Ziano told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We realized that there had to be a statistical mistake in the data reporting (some standardized effect sizes, i.e., the differences between product size conditions, did not line up with the p-value and the test statistics within the same comparisons between product size).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve made Ziano’s full comments about his experience with the replication study available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ziano-on-Dubois.pdf">here</a>. He told us that when he and his coauthors emailed <a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/david-dubois">David Dubois</a>, one of the authors of the original study who is now a professor at the Fontainebleau, France campus of <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>, to ask for the original data so they could recalculate the effect sizes, Dubois replied “that he was in the middle of moving and that he did not have the data handy at the moment.”</p>



<p>They did not follow up, Ziano said, because “my previous experiences in replication papers suggested that original authors (at least those who have already not shared data and materials in the paper) are not super keen to share data and materials, and even less keen to know that their study does not replicate.” (That’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/06/a-grad-student-finds-a-typo-in-a-psychedelic-studys-script-that-leads-to-a-retraction/">not always</a> the case, however.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Ziano and his team published their findings, another marketing researcher, Aaron Charlton, analyzed the paper and found more numerical inconsistencies in the statistical calculations. Charlton, who maintains <a href="https://openmkt.org/">OpenMKT.org</a>, a site aimed at improving evidence quality in academic publications in marketing and consumer behavior, wrote up his findings in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Numerical-inconsistencies-in-Dubois-et-al.-2012-v2.pdf">report</a> he shared with Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Erroneous <em>P</em>-values are “a fairly universal problem throughout the paper,” Charlton wrote in his report, which also identified “impossible means” using the <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/2064.pdf">GRIM test</a> developed by data sleuths <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">Nick Brown and James Heathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dubois was responsible for the data collection and analysis, the authors told Charlton, and shared with him a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Lh0bf4F2RK958_k8HmToTbh-Lktip39-9ag-qINovM/edit#gid=170080309">spreadsheet</a> of <em>P</em>-values, in which he noted that none of the errors substantively changed the conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charlton informed the authors of his findings about a year ago. While they were looking into the issues, another analyst, who remains anonymous, found “huge problems” in the 2016 paper, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last October, the two senior coauthors of the papers, <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rucker_derek_d.aspx#research=page1">Derek Rucker</a> of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago, and <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/ag2514">Adam Galinsky</a> of Columbia Business School in New York City, requested that the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> retract both papers, Charlton told us. Neither has been pulled. Dubois is an <a href="https://consumerresearcher.com/editorial-team/associate-editors">associate editor</a> of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The JCR policy board has assigned this matter to a special committee of experts who are thoroughly investigating it,” <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/carolyn-yoon">Carolyn Yoon</a>, the chair of the board and a professor of management and marketing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business, told Retraction Watch. “We are still waiting on the report, as it took longer than expected. We hope to have a decision by the end of this month.”</p>



<p>Yoon also told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is critical that we get this right. Hence the commentaries, speculations, and foregone conclusions that are being shared are unfortunate and unhelpful given these parties do not have full information or knowledge about the case.</p>



<p>As for Dubois being listed an AE, it has not yet been determined that he did anything wrong.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rucker, Galinsky, and Dubois declined to comment while the journal’s investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I disagree that they are ‘thoroughly investigating’ it,” Charlton told us when we shared Yoon’s comments with him. He said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In my opinion a thorough investigation would require interviewing the whistleblower who discovered and reported the issues. That&#8217;s me. I&#8217;ve not heard from them. Would a police investigation be thorough if they didn&#8217;t take the time to interview the accuser/key witness? This distorts the meaning of the word &#8220;thorough.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yoon’s comments about “commentaries, speculations, and foregone conclusions” seemed “aimed at discrediting whistleblowers,” Charlton said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My understanding is that all three coauthors jointly requested retraction of the 2012 paper back in mid-October of 2022. Why would the journal say &#8220;no you&#8217;re wrong, your paper is fine.&#8221; I first made the authors aware of the issues in early February of 2022. That was 14 months ago. Seems like it&#8217;s time for JCR to act. Every day they delay, people are citing the paper, grad students are trying to replicate it as part of their thesis, etc.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/freshwater-leeches-snails-could-control-diseases">Freshwater leeches’ taste for snails could help control snail-borne diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leeches might seem like relics of a bygone age of medicine, but they haven’t outlived their usefulness to people yet. The freshwater leech <em>Helobdella austinensis</em> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can eat its weight in snails every day</a>, suggesting that leeches could be used to control freshwater snail populations — and the host of diseases they carry, researchers report April 12 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Snails spread diseases such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis to humans and livestock. Both of those conditions are caused by flukes that spend part of their life cycle in snails. In 2021, more than 250 million people — many of them children — needed preventive treatment against the blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis. A more effective prevention would be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/getting-rid-snails-effective-stopping-snail-fever">controlling snail populations</a> that host the parasite (<em>SN: 7/21/16</em>).</p>





<p>Leeches may be staple frights for horror movie characters, but the animals that should really live in terror of <em>H.</em> <em>austinensis</em> are snails. “Everybody who works in the very small leech world globally, we all know that these particular types of leeches love snails,” says Daniel Shain, an evolutionary biologist at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J. The leeches aren’t very picky in terms of the types of snails they eat. “And snails are a big problem globally, in terms of health, and so we just connected a few dots.”</p>



<p>The scientists used <em>H. austinensis</em>, a laboratory leech, and two other species, the lab leech <em>H. serendipitous</em> and <em>H. modesta</em>, which can be found in local lakes in New Jersey by turning over rocks. The team tested the leeches in the lab with seven different freshwater snail species, and only <em>H. austinensis</em> proved an indiscriminate devotee of escargot. If enough snails were present, one leech could consume 0.97 milligrams of snail per day — roughly the leech’s own weight.</p>



<p>Using different ratios of leeches and snails, Shain and colleagues put together predator-prey computer simulations that suggested leeches could tank populations of snails within six months.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Helobdella austinensis </em>can’t resist escargot. In this video, the leeches seek out and swarm a hapless snail. The leech’s taste for snails suggests that it could be used to control snail populations — and, hopefully, snail-borne diseases.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More importantly, Civitello says, <em>H. austinensis</em> does love snails — but it will eat other things too. This is a problem that has plagued snail biocontrol, he explains. “These predators are often not specialists on the snails we want them to eat.”</p>



<p>It’s an interesting idea, says David Civitello, an ecologist at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the study. But he thinks much more research is needed. Once populations of snails decreased, he notes, the leeches had a hard time finding snails. “Having a hard time finding your prey item is indicative of a poor ability to drive it extinct,” he says. “If you are indiscriminately killing snails, but you’re not eradicating snails, you’re setting up the possibility that you are weakening competition for food.” And if the leeches leave low populations of big, well-fed snails at large, their infectiousness could mean that snail-borne disease ends up getting worse, not better, he says.</p>



<p>The leeches do happily eat many species of snails. But in the lab, they are also fed dead insect larvae, and Civitello worries that in the wild the leeches will prove to have dangerously diverse diets.</p>





<p>Shain and his colleagues want to try field trials to see if the leeches stick to snail snacks. They also want to look for similar snail-eating leech species native to particular areas. <em>H. austinensis</em> is native to Texas, but using native species elsewhere could reduce ecosystem disruption, Shain says.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Shain hopes that people won’t be put off by the concept of leeches. “The idea of having, you know, 10,000 leeches inside the pond instead of 10,000 snails probably isn&#8217;t so appealing,” he admits. On the plus side, <em>H. austinensis</em> is tiny — and uninterested in humans. Only the snails need to shiver.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/painted-lady-butterfly-migration-identified">The last leg of the longest butterfly migration has now been identified</a></h4>

              
                <p>Every year, painted lady butterflies born in Europe embark south on an epic journey to Africa. Now, researchers know exactly where on the continent these long-haul travelers spend their winter vacation.</p>



<p>From December through February, after flying across the Sahara in the fall, the orange-and-brown-winged insects set up camp and breed in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2218280120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">savannas and highlands across central Africa</a>, scientists report April 10 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. As the rainy season brings greenery to the region, the butterflies and their caterpillar offspring feast on a variety of plants until their wintering spots dry up. Then the butterflies fly north to Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Pinpointing exactly where painted lady butterflies (<em>Vanessa cardui</em>) overwinter and breed was the last unknown piece of their roughly 15,000-kilometer migration, says Gerard Talavera, an entomologist and evolutionary biologist at the Botanical Institute of Barcelona. The species — one of the most common butterflies in the world — boasts the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/painted-lady-butterflies-migration-sahara-africa">longest round-trip journey of any butterfly</a> (<em>SN: 6/20/18</em>).</p>



<p>Painted ladies aren’t the only insects to make such long migratory trips, says Constantí Stefanescu, a butterfly ecologist at Museu de Ciències Naturals de Granollers in Spain who was not involved in the study. Understanding how these butterflies do it provides a framework to explore <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-insects-tell-tales-long-distance-migrations">how other migratory insects</a>, including destructive pests, make such treks (<em>SN: 4/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/painted-lady-butterflies-migration-may-take-them-across-sahara">the painted ladies went to Africa</a>, but where on the continent they waited out European winters from December to February was a mystery (<em>SN: 10/12/16</em>). The butterflies cross the Sahara and arrive in countries such as Chad in the fall. Around November the insects fly elsewhere, Talavera says, but it was unknown where they landed.</p>



<p>Before this study, Talavera and colleagues had predicted that subtropical <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.1583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regions close to the equator</a> might provide suitable habitat. To know for sure, the researchers needed to find butterflies in the field.</p>



<p>From late 2017 through early 2020, Talavera and an international team of researchers conducted fieldwork at a wide variety of sites across sub-Saharan Africa during the months of December and January. Another 15 sites were monitored year-round for about two years. In total, the team looked for adults and their young in nine countries, including Benin, Cameroon, and Kenya.</p>



<p>It was a big bet that the team would even find the butterflies, Talavera says. Their preferred plants in Europe are well-known, making them relatively easy to find. But what plants the insects might settle on in Africa was a big open question. Aside from the previous analysis pointing toward the subtropics and knowing that the insects prefer open spaces over forests, the team was going in blind.</p>



<p>“My main worry was about that, not being able to actually find the species,” Talavera says.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That worry was unwarranted. The researchers found more than 2,700 caterpillars and nearly 2,000 adult butterflies, from as far west as Cote d’Ivoire and all the way east to Kenya and Ethiopia.</p>



<p>From September to November, the butterflies occupy semiarid savannas. As those areas dry up, the painted ladies shift south to savannas and highlands in slightly humid regions from December to February. Central Africa’s tropical rainforests stop the butterflies from going any farther south, Talavera says. “These butterflies don’t like wet areas.”</p>



<p>Field observations suggest that lots of breeding might happen in these slightly humid savannas and highlands. Warm weather across the region could help the butterflies reproduce more quickly than they do in some parts of Europe, Talavera says, meaning three to five generations might be born in sub-Saharan Africa before any surviving adults head north in February.</p>



<p>Knowing where painted lady butterflies breed could help researchers understand why there are occasional population booms with 100 times as many butterflies in some years as others, Stefanescu says. In 2021, he and colleagues linked the phenomenon to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2102762118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rains in sub-Saharan Africa</a> — perhaps giving butterflies more plants to stop and lay eggs on. But the part of West Africa identified in that study is different than where the newly identified breeding grounds are, Stefanescu says. Now, scientists can verify the link by looking at rainfall and other conditions where baby butterflies are found growing up.</p>



<p>But the next mystery Talavera’s group hopes to solve is why painted lady butterflies make such a long journey at all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smithsonian-lights-out-fading-night-sky">The Smithsonian’s ‘Lights Out’ inspires visitors to save the fading night sky</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bright, artificial lights are drowning out the night sky’s natural glow. Now, an exhibition is highlighting some of the consequences of a fading starry night — and how people can help restore it.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/lights-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lights Out</a>,” open through 2025 at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., illuminates how light pollution is affecting astronomy, natural ecosystems and human cultures around the world. “We want people to understand that it’s a global problem, and it’s having broad impact,” says Jill Johnson, an exhibit developer at the museum.</p>





<p>Upon entering the exhibition, the dimly lit space resets the mood for nighttime exploration. The exhibition spans a long hallway that can be entered from either end. One entrance quickly draws in visitors with a personal connection. An interactive display invites you to experience your own night sky, whether in a city, suburb or remote location. Three tactile panels feature raised elements, including dots representing light pollution and crosses indicating visible stars. The more populated a place, the more dots are smattered across the panel. </p>



<p>Visitors can also listen to the artificial light and starlight in each sky through data that have been translated into sound. The multisensory experience is especially engaging for visitors who may not be able to experience the exhibition visually.</p>



<p>The other entrance offers a more didactic introduction to the exhibition. A timeline presents a brief history of human-made light, from fire-lit torches to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-night-sky-bright-citizen-science">today’s LEDs</a>, and then segues to astronomy (<em>SN: 1/19/23</em>). Space scientists rely on light, both visible and not, to understand celestial bodies. And their views of the universe have become increasingly obstructed by artificial light.</p>



<p>“Astronomers were some of the first folks to sound the alarm on light pollution,” says Ryan Lavery, a public affairs specialist at the museum.</p>



<p>Astronomers aren’t the only scientists who have noticed the repercussions. Biologists have observed light pollution’s toll on plants and animals, whether harming corals’ moonlight-triggered reproduction or bats’ ability to pollinate flowers. Here, much of the evidence on display is visual. Photographs and specimens demonstrate the variety of critters that are active at night, while a glass case of preserved birds presents the grim consequences of light pollution. All of these birds died from striking buildings in Washington, D.C., or Baltimore after being disoriented by the bright cityscapes.</p>



<p>Losing dark, starry nights also affects human cultures. Another area of the exhibition presents people’s ancient and modern-day connections to the night sky through photographs, stories and cultural items. A glistening beadwork depicting the Milky Way was crafted specially for “Lights Out” by Gwich’in artist Margaret Nazon, who grew up staring at the stars in Canada’s Northwest Territories.</p>



<p>Our connections under a shared sky are emphasized in the exhibition’s small central theater. It replicates a starry night over Coudersport, Pa., through speckled lighting and walls bearing illustrations of trees and hills. A short film describes the star cluster Messier 45, also known as the Pleiades, and explains the stars’ origins according to tales from three cultures — the ancient Greeks, the Ainu in Japan and the Māori in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“Cultures all over the world have a deep relationship to the night sky,” says Stephen Loring, cocurator of the exhibition and an archaeologist at the museum. “If we lose the night sky, we lose an avenue to our understanding of what it is to be a human being.”</p>



<p>But the exhibition isn’t all bleak. Sprinkled throughout it are success stories of how people are reducing light pollution, from France’s outdoor lighting curfews to beach communities that have altered their lighting systems to avoid drawing hatchling sea turtles away from the ocean. And visitors may be heartened to learn about simple but meaningful actions that they can take, such as aiming outdoor lights downward and using the dimmest settings. </p>



<p>Overall, “Lights Out” instills a sense of hope and a desire to reconnect with the night sky. “This is an optimistic exhibition,” Loring says. “We can solve this problem.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuvierian-organ-sea-cucumber-defense-mechanism">This sea cucumber shoots sticky tubes out of its butt. Its genes hint at how</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some lizards shed their still-wriggling tails to distract predators, but sea cucumbers take this sort of strategy to the next level. Some startled sea cucumbers shoot a silky — and sticky — substance out of their rear ends that is actually an entire organ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tangle of tubules looks like intestines, but it evolved from the invertebrates’ respiratory system, and, like lizard tails, it regenerates after use. In a new study in the April 10 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, researchers delved into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2213512120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the black sea cucumber’s genome</a> to see how the stringlike tubules, called the Cuvierian organ, work at the molecular level.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When startled, some sea cucumbers shoot a silky substance from their rear ends. Analyzing the genome of the black sea cucumber (<em>Holothuria leucospilota</em>), seen in this video, is revealing how the tangle of tubules, called the Cuvierian organ, works as a defense against predators like crabs. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The black sea cucumber (<em>Holothuria leucospilota</em>) is “the most dominant sea cucumber species in the South China Sea,” says Ting Chen, a biologist at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology in Guangzhou.&nbsp;“We would like to know what evolutionary advantage this sea cucumber has gained … so that its population can expand so widely and predominantly.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>So the team analyzed the sea cucumber’s entire genome, or genetic instruction book, and focused on genes from the Cuvierian organ because it’s such an odd structure. Then the team predicted what proteins would be made from Cuvierian organ genes using a program called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">AlphaFold</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/22</em>). Some unexpected predicted proteins were new types of receptors on cells’ surfaces that may play a role in expelling the organ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also found that the “silk” proteins of sea cucumbers’ tubules don’t contain the same sequences of amino acids seen in spider silk, but are similarly made up of long repeated chains of amino acids. This finding hints that these long repeats might be a shared structure across silklike proteins, even when those proteins evolved independently.</p>



<p>What’s more, Chen says, is that the organ’s stickiness — which stops sea cucumber predators like fish, crabs and starfish in their tracks — comes from proteins that have features similar to amyloids. Amyloids are associated with many diseases in humans, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/misfolded-proteins-implicated-more-brain-diseases?mode=pick&amp;context=166">neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s</a> (<em>SN: 9/9/15</em>).</p>



<p>This paper not only highlights unexpected proteins that are specific to the Cuvierian tubules, says Patrick Flammang, a biologist at the University of Mons in Belgium who was not involved with the study. It also provides a lot of data that can be used to answer other questions about how the enigmatic organ evolved, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the usefulness of a high-quality genome doesn’t stop there. “We need genomic data for our studies on the reproductive, endocrine, immune and digestive systems of <em>H. leucospilota</em>,” Chen says. The team, he says, is now investigating the genetics behind how the sea cucumbers detect light and digest food.</p>





<p>A good genome, Flammang says, is “a cornerstone to be able to do this work.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dense-crowds-pedestrians-lines-math">Dense crowds of pedestrians shift into surprisingly orderly lines. Math explains why</a></h4>

              
                <p>No matter how chaotic the train station at rush hour might seem, there’s likely more order than you think in that crowd.</p>



<p>It’s long been observed that in a dense crowd with people headed in opposite directions, multiple parallel lanes emerge. In a recent report in the March 3 <em>Science</em>, mathematicians Tim Rogers and Karol Bacik of the University of Bath in England used a mathematical model to describe how such lanes form and evolve and confirmed the predictions with live experiments.</p>





<p>The results show that, assuming the passageway is wide enough, two groups intersecting head on form multiple lanes roughly two body widths across. If the two groups instead intersect at right angles, they will again form lanes, which migrate like the stripes on a barber pole. (Each person stays in a lane but the lane itself moves to the side.) Even if you tell everyone to pass on the right in a misguided attempt to form just two lanes, you will instead get multiple lanes at an oblique angle to the preferred direction of flow. This slows everybody down.</p>



<p>Apparently, the best thing you can do to control the traffic is … nothing at all. “Anarchy is enough,” Rogers says.</p>

Bacik, B. Bacik, T. Rogers</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Rogers and Bacik began working on crowds during the pandemic — ironically, at a time when crowds were scarce. “We were working with a local civil engineering firm to design layouts for socially distanced use of spaces, including conference venues,” Rogers says. For example, how do you design a coffee break area so a large volume of people can pass through quickly while staying six feet apart? Although software already existed for simulating pedestrian traffic, it had to be tweaked for a new world in which the definition of a close encounter had changed.</p>



<p>While working on this practical problem, Rogers and Bacik became intrigued by the known phenomenon of spontaneous lane formation. As early as 1991, Dirk Helbing, a physicist now at ETH Zürich, had developed a mathematical model to explain the formation of lanes when two groups flow in opposite directions. Helbing’s “social force” model describes the intended direction of the pedestrians, as well as the way they modify their motion to avoid collisions. It remains a state-of-the-art model, and it was part of the software that Rogers and Bacik were using. The challenge for any such model is to bridge the gap between individual decisions and the patterns of the crowd.</p>



<p>“We rediscovered the various hypotheses that people have had, and we have tried to unify them and show that they are different parts of the big picture,” Bacik says.</p>



<p>In the new report, Rogers and Bacik describe lane formation as a result of two processes: drift and diffusion. As pedestrians are moving across King’s Cross Station in London, for example, they can drift from their planned route either because collisions push them away from regions with a lot of opposing traffic or because they are attracted to pockets that are more open. This drift strongly encourages lane formation: As soon as a stripe of northbound pedestrians starts to form, other northbound pedestrians are attracted to it and southbound pedestrians are pushed away. Diffusion, on the other hand, tends to smooth out fluctuations in pedestrian density, so an excess in one direction has to be fairly large to survive.</p>





<p>Using a mathematical technique called perturbation analysis, Rogers and Bacik showed that fluctuations on the scale of two body widths dominate the formation of lanes and thus explain their width. “It’s a great idea, and I wish I had thought of it myself,” says Nicolas Bain of École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France, who has also studied lane formation.</p>



<p>Beyond testing head-on traffic, intersecting traffic and passing on the right, Rogers and Bacik also tested two streams crossing in a square vestibule when one or both streams have to funnel through a narrow exit, such as a doorway. Here, a surprise emerged that no one studying lane formation over the past three decades had noticed before: The lanes that form are curved, making the shape of a parabola (if only one exit is narrow) or an ellipse (if both exits are).</p>



<p>Finally, the team tested all of these mathematical predictions in a crowd of 60 to 70 people passing through a 6-meter-by-6-meter arena set up in Katowice, Poland. (Bacik’s father, Bogdan, a biomechanics expert, helped arrange this experiment.) Their video footage confirmed the predictions. “It is the connection between the actual experiments and the simulations which makes the paper top-notch,” says Hartmut Löwen, a physicist at University of Düsseldorf in Germany who was not involved in the research.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When two group are crossing through a space (red and blue) and one group is trying to pass through a narrow exit (blue on right), lanes shaped as parabolas form spontaneously.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Rogers and Bacik’s recent work focused on pattern formation, pedestrian flow can have real and sometimes tragic consequences. Stampedes or crowd crushes have killed people — more than 150 people celebrating Halloween in Seoul in 2022, for example, and hundreds of pilgrims in Saudi Arabia in 2015. Public spaces can be designed to help prevent such tragedies. </p>



<p>According to Helbing, one sign of trouble is three-way (or more) collisions, where people have no good way to escape, and they get stuck. These collisions can occur particularly at Y-shaped intersections or at four-way intersections. Rogers and Bacik’s models specifically exclude such situations, and civil engineers would be well advised to avoid them too.</p>



<p>“Two pedestrian streams can walk through each other in a surprisingly efficient way,” Helbing says. But, Helbing adds, “When more pedestrian flows intersect, there are typically no stable patterns of motion.” This can lead to turbulent flow or “crowdquakes,” in which people can’t control where they are going. The takeaway: When pedestrians are traveling two ways, trust the wisdom of crowds. When there’s a three-way or four-way intersection, watch out.</p>

                <p>When a strong tornado roars through a city, it often leaves behind demolished buildings, broken tree limbs and trails of debris. But a similarly powerful storm touching down over barren, unvegetated land is much harder to spot in the rearview mirror.</p>



<p>Now, satellite imagery has revealed a 60-kilometer-long track of moist earth in Arkansas that was invisible to human eyes. The feature was presumably <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL102984?af=R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excavated by a tornado when it stripped away the uppermost layer of the soil</a>, researchers report in the March 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. This method of looking for “hidden” tornado tracks is particularly valuable for better understanding storms that strike in the winter, when there’s less vegetation, the researchers suggest. And recent research has shown that wintertime storms are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tornado-climate-warming-winter-stronger">likely to increase in intensity as the climate warms</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>).</p>





<p>Over 1,000 tornadoes <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/newm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike the United States each year</a>, according to the National Weather Service. But not all are equally likely to be studied, says Darrel Kingfield, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>For starters, storms that pass over populated areas are more apt to be analyzed. “There’s historically been a pretty big population bias,” Kingfield says. Storms that occur over vegetated regions also tend to be well studied, simply because they leave obvious scars on the landscape. Ripped-up grasses or downed trees function like beacons to indicate the path of a storm, says Kingfield, who has studied <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/56/4/jamc-d-16-0228.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forests damaged by tornadoes</a>.</p>



<p>Spring and summer are peak storm seasons in the United States — more than 70 percent of tornadoes strike from March through September, according to NOAA. But on December 10, 2021, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/december-2021-tornado-outbreak-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cluster of storms started racing across the central and southern United States</a>. Those tornadoes, which claimed more than 80 lives, swept across cities and also farmland, much of which had already been harvested for the season.</p>



<p>Jingyu Wang, a physical geographer at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and his colleagues set out to detect the signatures of those deadly storms in unpopulated, barren landscapes.</p>



<p>Swirling winds, even relatively weak ones, can suction up several centimeters of soil. And since deeper layers of the ground tend to be wetter, a tornado ought to leave behind a telltale signature: a long swath of moister-than-usual soil. Two properties linked with soil moisture level — its texture and temperature — in turn impact how much near-infrared light the soil reflects.</p>



<p>Wang and his collaborators analyzed near-infrared data collected by NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites and looked for changes in soil moisture consistent with a passing tornado.</p>



<p>When the team looked at data obtained shortly after the 2021 storm outbreak, they noticed a signal in northeastern Arkansas. The feature was consistent with a roughly 60-kilometer-long track of wet soil. Tornadoes had been previously reported in that area — outside the city of Osceola — so it’s likely that this feature was created by a powerful storm, the team concluded.</p>





<p>That makes sense, Kingfield says, and observations like these can reveal tornado signatures that might otherwise be missed. However, it’s important to acknowledge that this new technique works best in places where soils are capable of retaining water, he says. “You need to have clay-rich soils.”</p>



<p>Even so, these results hold promise for analyzing other tornadoes, Kingfield says. It’s always useful to have a new tool for estimating the strength, path and structure of a storm, but many storms go relatively unexamined simply because of where and when they occur, he says. “Now we have this new ground truth.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/04/08/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use/">How much energy does ChatGPT use?</a></h4>

              
                <p>I received this intriguing question from Daria Marchenko, who is a contributor on <em>Moteur de Recherche</em>, on Canadian public radio. I went into a deep rabbit hole trying to find a good answer–especially since she also interviewed the wonderful Sasha Luccioni, an expert on ML and climate change. Most of the estimates I’ve found online seemed off by several orders of magnitude, so I reproduce the analysis so other journalists and curious people can find this information easily.</p>



<p>TL;DR: ChatGPT’s energy use might have peaked in February, with a trillion tokens produced by a server farm of several thousand A100 GPUs. This would have cost 6-figure hosting bills per day and lead to 7 to 15 metric tons of CO2 per day, or about the equivalent of 400-800 households in the US. That’s not nothing, but in the grand scheme of things is fairly modest, especially compared to more profligate uses of computing like cryptocurrency. What most surprised me about this is the sheer speed of adoption of ChatGPT, which shifts the bulk of the cost from training to inference. In February, ChatGPT saw about 1% of Google’s traffic, or 25% of Wikipedia’s, frankly shocking for a three-month-old product.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Calculation</strong></h2>



<p>There’s nothing very open about OpenAI, and most details are under wraps. We can make estimates of its energy use from what we know about probable architecture, cost to users, and public releases, as well as what we know about similar architectures.</p>



<p>The original ChatGPT is powered by GPT3.5, a version of GPT-3 retrained with reinforcement learning from human feedback to be more useful. We’ll assume that this model was a 175 billion parameter model similar to davinci.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.10350.pdf">Patterson et al. (2022)</a> estimated that the original GPT-3 cost 502 tons of CO2 to train. RLHF would add a bit of overhead on that, perhaps on the order of 1% of the original cost.</p>



<p>The more interesting question is the cost of serving the model. It’s been reported that ChatGPT is the fastest app to reach 100 million users. <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/chatgpt-1-billion/">Similarweb reported 1 billion visits in February to chat.openai.com</a>, compared to about 4 billion for Wikipedia or 80 billion for Google. With an average visit of just under 10 minutes, it seems reasonable to assume that 1000 tokens or so were generated by each visit, or 1 trillion tokens total.</p>



<p>We can estimate how these 1 trillion tokens would cost in inference from the performance of the similarly-sized, and open-source Bloom. It can produce <strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-inference-pytorch-scripts">about 1,400 tokens per second</a></strong> on a server with 8xA100 GPUs. To scale up to a trillion tokens in 28 days, we would need 300 8xA100 servers on average, or 2,400 A100 GPUs. That’s enormous!</p>



<p>Obviously, the capacity would need to be higher at the end of the month than at the start as more people adopt the product. Given the rapid growth, I’ll assume that at the end of February capacity was 1.4X higher than the average during the month. We can plug this information <strong><a href="https://mlco2.github.io/impact/">into the CO2 emissions calculator from Luccioni et al.</a></strong> I assumed inference was done on A100 SXM4 80GB on Azure cloud in the West US region. This comes to 7 metric tons of CO2 per day at the end of February. As a side note, on the public cloud, with a 3-year lease, it would cost OpenAI $90,000 per day to lease!</p>



<p>On March 1st, OpenAI switched to a new model for ChatGPT, gpt3.5-turbo. This new model is 1/10th the cost of davinci to the end user, and it is reasonable to assume that it has, consequently, 1/10th the carbon intensity. My hunch is that gpt3.5-turbo is a RLHF version of the curie model. Thus, in March, OpenAI’s emissions must have gone down drastically. This created extra capacity for GPT-4, which is likely at least as carbon-intensive as the original davinci GPT-3, and possibly more. Because GPT-4 is gated behind a payment, total energy outlay must have gone down in March, but in the long term should reach its past peak and exceed as higher capacity encourages new use cases. This is a good example of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons’ paradox in action</a></strong>.</p>



<p>As an aside, I came up with an alternative number of 15 tons of CO2 per day based on extrapolating <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tomgoldsteincs/status/1600650537547988992">Tom Goldstein’s work</a></strong>. So I think this is in the right order of magnitude.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>



<p>I was surprised by the numbers I came up with. Inference is now a big chunk of the cost of LLMs, whereas most of the literature has been focused on training. In the current regime, with these numbers, total carbon output from serving will overshadow training by a large margin over the lifetime of a model. It’s much higher than some fanciful numbers that are in the top 5 results on Google, and much lower than other ones, by several orders of magnitude. I won’t link to the specific estimates, but I am frustrated by OpenAI’s lack of transparency about its hardware use; it has encouraged a cottage industry of data scientists on medium multiplying big numbers by tiny numbers and not double-checking their results.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, I think the estimate is bounded by the number of GPUs involved, and based on availability, it cannot be much more than 10,000 A100’s (somebody has to pay that capital expense at the end of the day, and 10k A100’s is 100M$). It also can’t be much less than 1,000, since ChatGPT is reported to be costing OpenAI 6 or 7 figures per day.</p>



<p>In terms of cheer expensive stuff that needs to be bought or leased, 2,400 GPUs is a very large amount. <a href="http://www.idris.fr/eng/jean-zay/jean-zay-presentation-eng.html">The Jean-Zay supercomputer</a> that was used to train Bloom used about 3000 GPUs. Granted, OpenAI’s servers don’t need very high bandwidth, as they would in training, but it’s a lot of machines going brrr.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it’s still a fairly small amount of total CO2, all things considered. In its current state, running ChatGPT over a year is in the same ballpark in terms of carbon intensity as running one large international conference (e.g. NeurIPS). Even if ChatGPT became as big as Google (100X growth), at the same intensity as the old gpt-3.5, it would have a total carbon output of 255 kilotons of CO2 per year, a large amount, but still [100X lower than the estimated cost of cryptocurrency in the US alone](<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Crypto%2Dasset%20activity%20in%20the,railroads%20in%20the%20United%20States.)">https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Crypto-asset activity in the,railroads in the United States.)</a>.</p>



<p>A big caveat to this, however, is that this doesn’t take into account the embodied carbon cost in the GPUs used for inference. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure">Sasha Luccioni claims that it could be very high, saying “it’s going to be bananas”</a>. I will join her in stating that NVIDIA should release estimates of the embodied carbon footprint of its product.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-guna-panama-escape-rising-seas">How an Indigenous community in Panama is escaping rising seas</a></h4>

              
                <p>In pictures from high above, the island of Gardi Sugdub resembles a container shipyard — small, brightly colored dwellings are jammed together cheek to jowl. At ground level, the island, one of more than 350 in the San Blas archipelago off the northern coast of Panama, is hot, flat and crowded. More than 1,000 people occupy the narrow dwellings that cover virtually every bit of the 150-by-400-meter island, which is slowly being swallowed by rising seas driven by climate change.</p>



<p>This year, about 300 families from Gardi Sugdub are expected to begin moving to a new community on the mainland. The resettlement plan was initiated by the residents there more than a decade ago when they could no longer deny that the island couldn’t accommodate the growing population. Rising seas and intense storms are only making the predicament more dire.</p>





<p>Many of the older adults will opt to stay put. Some still don’t believe climate change poses a threat, but 70-year-old Pedro Lopez is not among them. Lopez, whose cousin interpreted for him during our Zoom interview, currently shares a small house with 16 family members and the family dog. He doesn’t plan to move. He knows Gardi Sugdub, translated as Crab Island, along with many others in the archipelago, is going underwater, but he believes it won’t happen within his lifetime.</p>



<p>The Indigenous Guna people have occupied these Caribbean islands since around the mid-1800s, when they abandoned the coastal jungle area near what is now the Panama-Colombia border to establish better trade and escape disease-carrying pests. Now, they are among the estimated hundreds of millions of people worldwide who by the end of the century may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-migrants-destination-cities-data-orlando">be forced to flee their land</a> because of rising sea levels (<em>SN: 5/9/20 &amp; 5/23/20, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>In the Caribbean, sea level rise <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently averages around 3 to 4 millimeters per year</a>. As global temperatures continue to rise, it is expected to hit 1 centimeter per year or more by century’s end.</p>



<p>All of the islands of the San Blas archipelago will eventually be underwater and uninhabitable, says Steven Paton, who directs the Physical Monitoring Program at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “Some may need to be abandoned very soon while others not for many decades,” he adds.</p>

<h3>Where the Guna live</h3>



<p>The Guna Yala territory includes a strip of land along Panama’s northern coast and the more than 350 nearby islands. Families on the island of Gardi Sugdub will be moving to a new mainland community, sometimes called La Barriada.</p>

<p>Anthropologist Anthony Oliver-Smith of the University of Florida in Gainesville has studied people who are forced from their homes by disasters for more than 50 years. Around the world, he says, climate change has become a major driver of displacement, with people who have limited resources facing the worst of it.</p>



<p>The impacts of climate change — flooding, rising seas and erosion — are threatening the Tuvaluans in the South Pacific, the Mi’Kmaq of Prince Edward Island in Canada and the <a href="https://www.shinnecock-nsn.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shinnecock Indian Nation of New York</a>. Half of some 1,600 remaining tribe members there still occupy a more than 300-hectare territorial homeland on Long Island surrounded by multimillion-dollar Southampton mansions.</p>



<p>The Guna relocation is being closely watched as a possible template for other threatened communities. What sets the Guna apart from many others is that they have a place to go.</p>



<h4>Rising sea levels in Guna Yala</h4>



<p>More than 30,000 Indigenous Guna inhabit the province now called Guna Yala, which includes the archipelago once known as San Blas and a strip of mainland. Most live on the islands, traveling back to the mainland to get water from the mouth of the river there, and in some cases to tend crops. Some of the islands sit several meters above average sea level, but the vast majority are uninhabited spits of land with palm trees, many only a meter or less above sea level.</p>



<p>So far, only the residents of Gardi Sugdub are included in the relocation plan.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How much is the sea rising?</h3>



<p>Measurements of the ocean surface height from satellites suggest sea levels are rising at an average rate of several millimeters per year across much of the Caribbean. Estimates for local sea level rise are limited by the availability of data from tide gauges (shown as dots).</p>



<h5>Sea level rise in North and Central America, from 1993–2020</h5>

<p>The Guna people of the islands are sustained by the biodiversity there. The sea, mangroves and nearby mainland forests provide food, medicine and building materials. The men hunt and fish to provide seafood to the best restaurants in Panama City, and agriculture remains part of the economy. Guna communities elect traditional authorities known as <em>sailas </em>(“chiefs” in Guna) and <em>argars </em>(“chief’s spokesmen”), and they hold regular meetings to address community issues.</p>



<p>In recent decades, the Guna have moved toward an economy based on tourism and providing services to outsiders. They earn money supplying food, souvenirs and cultural artifacts to tourists but allow visitors to the islands only with prior approval from the <em>sailas</em>. Outsiders are not permitted to own property or operate businesses.</p>



<p>Carlos Arenas is an international human rights lawyer and an adviser on social and climate justice issues. When he visited Gardi Sugdub in 2014 as a consultant for <a href="https://www.displacementsolutions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Displacement Solutions</a>, a nonprofit initiative focused on housing, land and property rights, he was tasked to assess the nascent relocation plans and provide recommendations. He was shocked to see the visible threat posed by the rising sea. “You cannot see much elevation,” Arenas says. “The level of exposure was extremely high, but they don’t see it necessarily that way. They have been living there for more than 170 years.”</p>



<p>Heliodora Murphy grew up on Gardi Sugdub and has watched the ocean rise higher each year. The 52-year-old grandmother doesn’t understand those who dismiss climate change in light of the growing physical evidence all around. Murphy, also speaking through an interpreter, recalls her father bringing rocks and sand from a river on the mainland to shore&nbsp;up pathways and keep their home dry.</p>

ROGERS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Arenas says that some families face a daily struggle against the ocean. They build barriers that are immediately destroyed and have to be built again.</p>



<p>Some of the stopgap measures have been counterproductive, like filling in coral reefs to expand the land area. Reefs are a natural buffer against wave action, storm surges, flooding and erosion. Destroying them has only added to the peril.</p>



<p>Today, Murphy says, storm surges carry water into her small, ground-level home. “It’s very different than in the past,” she says. “The waves are so much higher now.” About two years ago, she decided she’d move with her family. “We can’t stay here.”</p>



<h4>A history of autonomy</h4>



<p>Historically, the Guna have had a level of autonomy rare among Indigenous people. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in what is now Colombia and Panama, the Guna lived primarily near the Gulf of Urabá on the northern coast of Colombia. The two groups clashed violently, prompting the Guna to abandon the coastal border area and move north into the jungle of Panama near the Caribbean. By the mid-1800s, entire villages had relocated again, this time to the San Blas archipelago.</p>



<p>Panama declared its independence from Spain in 1821 and became a part of Gran Colombia. Throughout the 19th century, the Guna lived independently according to their customs. That changed in 1903 when Panama broke from Colombia. The new nation attempted to assimilate the people living on the archipelago.</p>



<p>But having escaped Spanish rule centuries earlier and avoided Colombian authority as well, the Guna resisted Panama’s acculturation efforts. When the Guna couldn’t achieve détente through other means, they launched an armed attack against the Panamanians in February 1925.</p>



<p>The United States, having occupied the Panama Canal Zone since 1903, had geopolitical interests in the region and threw its support behind the Guna. That support forced the Panamanian government into a negotiated peace that allowed the Guna to continue their way of life. In 1938, the Guna islands and adjacent coastline were recognized as a semiautonomous Indigenous territory, Guna Yala. The Guna have maintained control of that territory since.</p>



<h4>The Guna find a new home</h4>



<p>The Gardi Sugdub residents first broached the idea of relocation in 2010. “They basically ran out of room,” Oliver-Smith says.</p>



<p>He describes the Guna as the Indigenous people in Latin America who have been perhaps most successful in defending their cultural heritage, language and territory. They initiated the plans for resettlement and made arrangements among themselves to set aside 17 hectares of property on the mainland for these purposes. The land, within the Guna Yala territory, is near a school and health center being built by the Panamanian government.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="574" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030.jpg" alt="A far away photo of a person sitting on the end of a dock with a clutter of wooden docks and poles behind them." class="wp-image-3123436" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-680x379.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-800x446.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-330x184.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123436">The residents of Gardi Sugdub (the island is shown here in 2014) face overcrowding and rising seas. More than a decade ago, they initiated a plan to move more than 300 families to a new community on the mainland.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123436">ARNULFO FRANCO/AP PHOTO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When Guna leaders approached the government, the Ministry of Housing initially promised to build 50&nbsp;houses on the parcel. But it remained just that — a promise — until around 2014, when the Guna began to speak publicly about their situation. News of their predicament caught the attention of Indigenous rights organizations and eventually Displacement Solutions, which turned to Arenas and Oliver-Smith to evaluate the situation and offer recommendations about the best way forward.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/groups_committees/loss_and_damage_executive_committee/application/pdf/panama-_the_peninsula_principles_in_action.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Displacement Solutions’ first report in 2014</a>, Panama’s Ministry of Housing agreed to build 300 houses, along with the hospital and school. But Arenas, who until the COVID-19 pandemic started had visited Guna Yala every year or so, says progress remained slow, causing the Guna to question Panama’s commitment to the relocation. The Guna leveraged support from international groups and members of the Panamanian government to get the project moving. “They were the originators of the idea of resettlement,” Oliver-Smith says. “And they kept it alive.”</p>



<p>Arenas estimates that roughly 200 of the 300&nbsp;houses in the new community are complete. The cost for the houses, which are being paid for by the Panamanian government, exceeds $10 million, and the Inter-American Development Bank has invested $800,000 in technical assistance. The new homes will have cement floors, bamboo walls, zinc roofs, running water and full electrification.</p>



<p>Before plans to relocate began, many Guna had already moved to cities including Panama City and Colón for school, work or simply to have more room. Arenas expects that many more people already living in mainland Panama will likely join their families in the new community. People on other Guna Yala islands will likely have to move eventually too.</p>



<p>Murphy has already picked out her two-bedroom home for her small nuclear family of seven. Two daughters moved to Panama City years ago, and she hopes to see them more. But at around 40&nbsp;square meters, the homes may not accommodate the typical multigenerational, double-digit Guna families. Lopez plans to stay on the island, letting the younger generations live in the family’s new home on the mainland.</p>

<p>To ensure that the ethnic and cultural identities they fought to preserve are not lost in the move, the Guna plan to develop programs to teach traditions and culture to the resettled generations. But even on Gardi Sugdub, younger generations seem less inclined to practice the traditional customs — like making and wearing <em>wini </em>(vibrantly colored beads worn around the arms and legs) and <em>molas </em>(intricately designed fabric dresses that have become a symbol of Guna life and resistance to colonialism). Murphy began learning the craft when she was 6&nbsp;years old. She spends two months constructing each ensemble, which she sells to tourists for $80.</p>



<p>Oliver-Smith is optimistic about the relocation plan but worries that the Panamanian government has repeated some mistakes that have doomed projects elsewhere by treating resettlement solely as a housing issue. “You don’t just pick people up and move them from point A to point B. It is a reconfiguring of a life of a people,” Oliver-Smith says. “It has political, social, economic, environmental, spiritual and cultural dimensions.”</p>



<p>As is often the case when Indigenous and rural communities relocate, Arenas says, the government failed to make the Guna equal participants in the design concept. “The Panamanian government is trying to build a Panama City neighborhood in the middle of a tropical forest,” he says. “They have not tried to save a single tree of this beautiful landscape…. They removed everything. They tried to flatten the land because it’s cheaper…. It’s also extremely hot there, and the building materials are hot.” This increases the risk of failure, he says, because the houses don’t match the environment.</p>



<p>But Murphy hopes everything will be better. The new village promises dry land and more space. And perhaps returning to the mainland the Guna occupied nearly 150 years ago will lead to a stronger connection to Guna historical culture and traditions.</p>



<p>Oliver-Smith says the Guna are facing the challenge of resettlement with an intact culture and language that he hopes will be a basis for maintaining cultural continuity. His time spent with the Guna has convinced him that, as disruptive and devastating as resettlement can be, the Guna relocating as a cohesive group are perhaps best equipped to emerge intact even if not unscathed.</p>



<p>“Carlos [Arenas] and I asked an old, retired <em>saila</em> if he thought resettlement would change the Guna,” he says. “He said, ‘No. Individuals may change out of choice, but our culture is eternal. It will never die.’ ”</p>

<p>A 2017 paper describing neuroscience research with rats has been retracted after “data mis-management,” including the mistreatment of the animals, came to light. </p>



<p>The retracted paper was the second by <a href="http://gsm.utmck.edu/anesthesiology/faculty/datta.cfm">Subimal Datta</a>, a professor of psychology and anesthesiology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, to receive a flag for data problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432817305247">BNDF heterozygosity is associated with memory deficits and alterations in cortical and hippocampal EEG power</a>,” was published in <em>Behavioural Brain Research </em>and has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432823001183?via%3Dihub">notice</a>, published March 31, stated:&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baseball-home-run-climate-change">Baseball’s home run boom is due, in part, to climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>Baseball is the best sport in the world for numberphiles. There are so many stats collected that the analysis of them even has its own name: sabermetrics. Like in <em>Moneyball</em>, team managers, coaches and players use these statistics in game strategy, but the mountain of available data can also be put to other uses.</p>



<p>Researchers have now mined baseball’s number hoard to show that climate change <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0235.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused more than 500 home runs since 2010</a>, with higher air temperatures contributing to the sport’s ongoing home run heyday. The results appear April 7 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>





<p>Many factors have led to players hitting it out of the park more often in the last 40 years, from steroid use to the height of the stitches on the ball. Blog posts and news stories have also speculated about whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">climate change</a> could be increasing the number of home runs, says Christopher Callahan of Dartmouth College (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). “But nobody had quantitatively investigated it.”</p>



<p>A climate change researcher and baseball fan, Callahan decided to dig into the sport’s mound of data in his free time to answer the question. After he gave a brief presentation at Dartmouth on the topic, two researchers from different fields joined the project.</p>



<p>That collaboration produced an analysis that is methodologically sound and “does what it says,” says Madeleine Orr, a researcher of the impacts of climate change on sports at Loughborough University London, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>The theorized relationship between global warming and home runs stems from fundamental physics — the ideal gas law says as temperature goes up, air density goes down, reducing air resistance. To see if home runs were happening due to warming, Callahan and colleagues took several approaches.</p>



<p>First, the team looked for an effect at the game level. Across more than 100,000 MLB games, the researchers found that a 1-degree Celsius increase in the daily high temperature increased the number of home runs in a game by nearly 2 percent. For example, a game like the one on June 10, 2019, where the Arizona Diamondbacks and Philadelphia Phillies set the record for most home runs in a game, would be expected to have 14 home runs instead of 13 if it were 4 degrees C warmer.</p>



<p>The researchers then ran game-day temperatures through a climate model that controls for greenhouse gas emissions and found that human-caused warming led to an average of 58 more home runs each season from 2010 to 2019. The analysis also showed that the overall trend of more home runs in higher temperatures goes back to the 1960s.</p>



<p>The team followed that analysis with a look at more than 220,000 individual batted balls, made possible by the Statcast system — where high-speed cameras have tracked the trajectory and speed of every ball hit during a game since 2015. The researchers compared balls hit in almost exactly the same way on days with different temperatures, while controlling for other factors like wind speed and humidity. That analysis showed a similar increase in home runs per degree Celsius as the game-level analysis, with only lower air density due to higher temperatures left to explain higher numbers of home runs.</p>





<p>While climate change has “not been the dominant effect” causing more home runs, “if we continue to emit greenhouse gases strongly, we could see much more rapid increases in home runs” moving forward, Callahan says.</p>



<p>Some fans feel that the prevalence of home runs has made baseball duller, and it’s at least part of the reason that the MLB unveiled <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-2023-rule-changes-pitch-timer-larger-bases-shifts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several new rule changes</a> for the 2023 season, Callahan says.</p>



<p>Teams can adapt to rising temperatures by shifting day games to night games and adding domes to stadiums — the researchers found no effect of temperature on home runs for games played under a dome. But according to Orr, climate change may soon cause even more dramatic changes to America’s pastime, even with those adaptations.</p>



<p>Because the sport is susceptible to snow, storms, wildfires, flooding and heat at various points during the season, Orr says, “I don’t think, without substantial change, baseball exists in the current model” within 30 years.</p>



<p>Callahan agrees. “This sport, and all sports, are going to see major changes in ways that we cannot anticipate.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jet-pack-ultrasound-pregnant-whale-shark">‘Jet packs’ and ultrasounds could reveal secrets of pregnant whale sharks</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do you know if the world’s largest living fish is expecting babies? Not by her bulging belly, it turns out.</p>



<p>Scientists thought that an enlarged area on the undersides of female whale sharks was a sign of pregnancy. But <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2023/50/n050p125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a technique used for the first time on free-swimming animals</a> showed only skin and muscle. These humps might instead be a secondary sex characteristic on mature females, like breasts on humans, researchers report in the March 23 <em>Endangered Species Research.</em></p>





<p>The ultrasound is part of a suite of new methods including underwater “jet packs” and blood tests that scientists hope could unlock secrets about this creature’s reproduction.</p>



<p>Whale sharks (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) are classified as globally endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are only <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/19488/2365291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an estimated 100,000 to 238,000 individuals</a> left worldwide, which is more than a 50 percent decline in the last 75 years.</p>



<p>In part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whale-shark-fish-largest-omnivore-skin-meat-plants">whale sharks</a> are relatively rare, their reproductive biology is mostly a mystery (<em>SN: 8/1/22</em>). Nearly everything biologists think they know is based on the examination of one pregnant female caught by a commercial fishing boat in 1995.</p>



<p>“Protecting organisms without knowing about their biology is like trying to catch a fly with our eyes closed,” says Rui Matsumoto, a fisheries biologist with the Okinawa Churashima Foundation in Japan. The organization researches subtropical animals and plants to maintain or improve natural resources in national parks.</p>



<p>To learn more about these gentle giants, Matsumoto and shark biologist Kiyomi Murakumo of Japan’s Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium had to figure out how to keep up with them. Like superheroes in a comic book, the biologists used underwater jet packs — propellers attached to their scuba tanks — to swim alongside the fish, which average 12 meters in length and move about five kilometers per hour.</p>



<p>Then the researchers had to maneuver a 17-kilogram briefcase containing a waterproof ultrasound wand on the undersides of 22 females swimming near the Galápagos Islands and draw blood with syringes from their fins. Until this study, the ultrasound wand had never been used outside of an aquarium on free-swimming wildlife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline.jpg" alt="An underwater photo of a diver with a jet pack swimming under a whale shark performing an ultrasound on its belly." class="wp-image-3123412" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123412">Fisheries biologist Rui Matsumoto uses a propeller mounted on his scuba tank to keep pace with a female whale shark to take an ultrasound of her belly.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123412">S. Pierce</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Performing these two tests on whale sharks is especially challenging, says study coauthor Simon Pierce, a whale shark ecologist with the <a href="http://www.marinemegafauna.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marine Megafauna Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that uses research to drive marine conservation.&nbsp; The fish “have some of the thickest skin of any animal — up to about 30 centimeters thick.”</p>



<p>Another challenge is the seawater itself, which can contaminate blood samples. The researchers developed a two-syringe system, where the first syringe creates a vacuum and allows the second syringe to draw only blood.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Back in the lab, the blood plasma from six of the females showed hormone levels similar to levels obtained from a captive immature female in an aquarium, indicating those wild females were not pregnant.</p>



<p>Ultrasound imagery showed egg follicles in two of the 22 females studied, meaning those females were mature enough to reproduce but were also not pregnant. The biologists did not locate a pregnant whale shark.</p>



<p>Pioneering these noninvasive techniques on whale sharks has opened the door to possibly learning more about other endangered marine animals, too. Waterproof ultrasound wands mounted on a pole, Pierce says, are now being used on tiger sharks in places where the predators are drawn in by bait.</p>



<p>Rachel Graham agrees developing these underwater sampling techniques is an “astounding feat.” But the marine conservation scientist and founder of <a href="https://maralliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarAlliance</a>, a marine wildlife conservation nonprofit, doubts whether most free-ranging wild marine animals, particularly faster-swimming sharks or marine mammals, would tolerate similar tests.</p>



<p>“What makes whale sharks fairly unique … is&nbsp;that they move relatively slowly at times, have the ability to remain stationary, and they tolerate the presence of other animals — such as us — nearby,” says Graham, who has studied shark species around the world and was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Coupled with satellite tracking, the new methods, could eventually show us where whale sharks give birth, Pierce says. Little is known about whale shark pups, including whether they are born in shallow or deep water, and whether pups are born one-at-a-time or if mothers gather to give birth together. “Assuming they do have some sort of breeding or pelagic nursery area we can identify … then that obviously goes quite a long way towards conserving the population.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-yellow-crazy-ants-male-chimeras-reproduce">Invasive yellow crazy ants create male ‘chimeras’ to reproduce</a></h4>

              
                <p>Yellow crazy ants break the rules of reproduction.</p>



<p>Every male ant contains <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate populations of cells from two distinct genetic lineages</a>, making them “chimeras,” researchers report in the April 7 <em>Science</em>. Yellow crazy ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) are the first known species that requires chimerism to create fertile males.</p>



<p>It’s “an elegant response to the kinds of unusual mating systems we’ve observed in other ants,” says evolutionary geneticist Waring “Buck” Trible of Harvard University, who was not involved in the study. “We might consider this as the next evolutionary step” in ants.</p>





<p>Most animals develop from a sperm cell and an egg cell uniting into one, combining their DNA. As a creature grows, all of the subsequent cells, save for sex cells, carry two sets of DNA-bearing chromosomes, one from each parent. In other words, these somatic cells all carry the same genetic information. Sperm and egg cells contain just one set of chromosomes.</p>



<p>But in many ants, along with other insects like wasps and bees, only females have somatic cells with chromosome pairs. Males typically develop from unfertilized eggs. So their somatic cells hold just one set of chromosomes.</p>



<p>A 2007 study, however, found that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03260.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about half of the sampled male yellow crazy ants possessed two different copies of the same genes</a>, just like the species’ female worker ants. </p>



<p>But &#8220;it didn’t make any sense that all males in this species would be diploid,&#8221; or have two sets of chromosomes in each somatic cell, says evolutionary biologist Hugo Darras of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany. When this happens in other ants, the males are usually sterile, he says. &#8220;Nobody had any explanation.”</p>



<p>So Darras and colleagues collected hundreds of yellow crazy ants from across East and Southeast Asia. Analyzing females — queens and workers — revealed that royalty in this species has a genetic source. Reproductive queens came from combining sperm and egg cells from the same lineage, which the researchers dubbed R. Workers were hybrids of the two different lineages, the other being called W. In other words, workers had R/W genomes, while queens had R/R genomes.</p>



<p>Consistent with the previous study, the researchers identified R/W males. But they also found that males’ somatic cells have just one set of chromosomes, as in other ant species. Extracting DNA from individual cells showed that rather than having chromosome pairs within cells, each cell contains chromosomes from just one of the two lineages.</p>





<p>Further experiments found that the R and W cells are unevenly distributed throughout the males’ bodies. While most of the body contained majority R cells, almost 75 percent based on the sampled tissue, the ratio nearly flipped in the sperm — 65 percent were W cells.</p>

<p>Since both workers and males come from combining W sperm with R eggs, the sex depends on whether their packets of DNA, or nuclei, merge. Fusion creates a female. But failure to fuse causes the two nuclei to divide separately within the same egg, producing a male.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why this never-before-seen mode of reproduction evolved in these ants. “By refusing to fuse with the egg cell, [the sperm] might be able to increase its reproductive output,” Trible says. Female worker ants are sterile and therefore can’t pass on the W genome.</p>



<p>“We think it’s maybe an interaction between two genomes that are in conflict but sometimes cooperate,” Darras says. These distinct lineages may have evolved independently in two separate ant populations that eventually intermingled. Or they could have started with similar genes that diverged over time, he adds. “But it looks like the whole genomes are separated and don’t exchange any genetic material.”</p>



<p>This odd reproduction method could be advantageous for the ant populations, leading to the yellow crazy ant’s title as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-pants-drive-away-birds">one of the world’s worst invasive species</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/09</em>). Because fusion of R and W nuclei results only in sterile workers, the genomes can never mix and be passed to the next generation. Thus, the ants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-manage-incest-without-inbreeding">avoid any possibility of inbreeding</a>, a feature seen in other invasive ant species (<em>SN: 2/1/11</em>).</p>



<p>Chimeras have been found in other creatures, including humans, but it’s usually an accident. Yellow crazy ants are the first known species in which chimerism determines sex. But some scientists estimate there are around 20,000 ant species, and the reproductive systems of most haven’t been studied.</p>



<p>“This is a very special system,” says evolutionary biologist Guojie Zhang of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, who was not involved in the research. “The question would be how frequently this system can be observed in other ant lineages.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hair-europe-oldest-evidence-drug-use">Hair analysis reveals Europe’s oldest physical evidence of drug use</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human hair recovered in a Mediterranean island cave has yielded <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31064-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europe’s oldest direct evidence of people taking hallucinogenic drugs</a>, researchers say.</p>



<p>By around 3,000 years ago, visitors at Es Càrritx cave on Menorca — perhaps shamans who performed spiritual and healing rituals — consumed plants containing mind-altering and vision-inducing substances, say archaeologist Elisa Guerra-Doce of the University of Valladolid in Spain and colleagues.</p>



<p>Signs of human activity at the cave, including more than 200 human graves arrayed in a chamber at the entrance, were previously dated to between around 3,600 and 2,800 years ago. Researchers had also found a hoard of objects in a small pit within an inner cave chamber, including six wooden containers, each containing locks of human hair.</p>

Guerra-Doce <em>et al</em>/<em>Sci. Reports</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Chemical analyses of one container’s locks, possibly from more than one person, detected three psychoactive plant substances that had been ingested and absorbed into the hair over nearly a year, the scientists report April 6 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Two substances, atropine and scopolamine from nightshade plants, induce disorientation, hallucinations and altered physical sensations. Another, ephedrine, boosts energy and alertness. Shamans would have known how to handle and consume these potentially toxic plants safely, the investigators say.</p>





<p>Individuals intent on preserving ancient traditions hid hair and other ritually significant objects at Es Càrritx as Menorca’s growing population spurred social changes between 3,000 and 2,800 years ago, the researchers speculate. Burial rituals had included dyeing strands of hair on corpses a reddish color and later cutting off some locks to be put in containers left near graves.</p>



<p>Other hair analyses have found that Inca kids slated for sacrifice more than 500 years ago ingested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">hallucinogenic drinks </a>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mummified-incan-teen-drank-did-drugs">coca leaves and alcohol</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22; SN: 7/29/13</em>). &nbsp;And a 2005 study found chemical signs of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2005.10399820" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coca-leaf chewing in the hair of two human mummies from Chile</a> dating to around 3,000 years ago. Indirect evidence of drug use in various parts of the world, such as artistic depictions, go back further.</p>

<p>In 2017, a paper published in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em> made international headlines for the authors’ claim they had developed a way to analyze brain scans using machine learning to identify youth at risk for suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was a big, splashy finding,” said <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/verstynen-timothy.html">Timothy Verstynen</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the research. But at a neuroimaging conference soon after the publication, other researchers discussed the study “in kind of a sense of disbelief,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 91% accuracy for identifying suicidality that the researchers reported, from a sample size of just a few dozen participants, he said, “kind of went against what we as a field were starting to understand about the nature of these brain phenotype markers based off of neuroimaging data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After six years of scrutiny, during which Verstynen attempted to replicate the work but found a key problem, the authors of the 2017 paper have retracted the article. </p>



<span id="more-126852"></span>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y">Machine learning of neural representations of suicide and emotion concepts identifies suicidal youth</a>,” has been cited 134 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Altmetric, which tracks the online attention publications receive, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/28130609#score">places the article</a> in the top 5% of all the articles and other content it has tracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01581-1&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org">notice</a>, published today, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors are retracting this article after concerns were raised about the validity of their machine learning method in a Matters Arising. While revising their response to these concerns, the authors confirmed that their method was indeed flawed, which affects the conclusions of the article. Specifically, the stepwise classification method used in the article overestimated the classification accuracy of who is a suicidal ideator because the features of the classifier were tuned to that particular dataset. The authors aim to demonstrate the predictive value of machine learning applied to fMRI data for the classification of suicidal ideators using new data and analyses in an independent future publication. All authors agree to this retraction.</p>

<p>Eickhoff and some colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01085-w">published a Matters Arising in 2021</a> that formalized and expanded on his critiques of the sample size and the way the authors developed their machine learning model. The authors’ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01086-9">response</a> pushed back on the criticisms, while acknowledging the limitations of the sample size, and again stated that they “look forward to sharing the forthcoming results from our ongoing larger study.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, in 2020, Verstynen was looking for examples of prediction models to use for his students in his data science course. He remembered the 2017 paper and thought it would be worth diving into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen mentioned the idea to another researcher, Konrad Paul Kording of the University of Pennsylvania, who would later become his co-author on the <a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01560-6&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org">new Matters Arising</a> mentioned in the retraction notice. The two scientists talked about how the paper “seems like either an absolutely brilliant methodological feat, or there’s something possibly wrong with how the classification was done,” Verstynen said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kording pointed out that the authors had made their code and some of their process data available following earlier criticism, and Verstynen dug in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He reread the paper and noticed an “inconsistency” in how the authors selected the features to go into their model. “The way it was described made it seem like there was a possibility of information leakage happening in the development of the model, where information from the holdout set was leaking into the cross validation,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insidebigdata.com/2014/11/26/ask-data-scientist-data-leakage/">Information leakage</a>, meaning that the data used to train an algorithm contains some of the information the algorithm is supposed to learn to predict, is a common problem in machine learning, and can result in the algorithm not performing as well in the real world as in tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kording also tried replicating the work, but couldn’t get the same results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Initially I thought I was doing it wrong,” he said. But after a month of playing with the code, eventually he thought there might be something wrong with the paper’s methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2020, he emailed the paper’s authors about his difficulty replicating their work, and his concern about information leakage in their model. They thanked him, he said, but he didn’t hear anything further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen and Kording next reached out to <em>Nature Human Behavior</em> with their concerns, and at the editor’s recommendation submitted their Matters Arising in the summer of 2020. The authors submitted their reply, and both went through peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Verstynen and Kording got their reviews and made minor revisions, they didn’t hear anything for a while. Eventually, after they pushed the journal’s editor for a response this January, 2.5 years after submission, they learned that their Matters Arising would be published.</p>



<p>But instead of the authors’ reply being published with it, the original paper would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Eickhoff, the scientist who published the 2021 Matters Arising, told us he saw “no fundamental difference” between his concerns and the ones Verstynen and Kording articulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both commentaries, and the possibility of retraction, were under consideration at the journal at the same time, he said. The last he heard was that the article would stand along with the two critiques. He told us he was “perplexed” by the timing of the retraction. “I personally feel that keeping the article online &#8211; together with the matters arising &#8211; is preferable over a retraction.”</p>



<p>Verstynen didn’t start off trying to get the paper retracted, but simply was seeking clarification about the methods, he said. Because of the important topic, as well as the media attention and follow-up clinical trial the paper garnered, “it seemed warranted to really push to have this addressed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eickhoff and Verstynen both say that the field has evolved in the last six years to be more robust, so the retraction won’t have much effect on current methods. The paper probably couldn’t get published today, Verstynen said, but there are “probably a lot of studies” from the same time period that have similar problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen said he “can’t fault the journal” for following its process to reevaluate the paper, but more openness about what was going on would be helpful for the research community. “Given how long it took the process to play out, we’re talking half the lifespan of this paper was spent with this issue known to the journal.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-thousands-volcanoes-map">Venus has almost 50 times as many volcanoes as previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hellscape of Venus is riddled with even more volcanoes than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Using radar images taken by NASA’s Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s, researchers cataloged about <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JE007753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">85,000 volcanoes strewn across the Venusian surface</a>. That’s nearly 50 times as many volcanoes as past surveys counted. Planetary scientists Rebecca Hahn and Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis debuted the map in the April <em>JGR Planets</em>.</p>



<p>Such a thorough inventory of volcanism on Venus could offer clues about the planet’s interior, such as hot spots of magma production, Byrne says. And with the recent discovery that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-venus-erupting-decades-old-nasa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus is volcanically active</a>, the map could also help pinpoint places to look for new eruptions (<em>SN: 3/15/23</em>).</p>





<p>Almost all the volcanoes that Hahn and Byrne found are less than 5 kilometers wide. About 700 are 5 to 100 kilometers across, and about 100 are wider than 100 kilometers. The team also found many tight clusters of small volcanoes called volcanic fields.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Literal hot spots</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This map of Venus shows the locations and sizes of all volcanoes visible in radar data from the Magellan spacecraft. The newfound volcanoes range in size from less than 5 kilometers wide to more than 100 kilometers across, though most are on the small side.</p>

<p>“We have a better handle of how many volcanoes are on Venus than are on Earth,” where most volcanoes are probably hidden beneath the oceans, Byrne says. But he doesn’t think the Magellan data tell the whole story of Venus’ volcanism. That spacecraft could see features as small as about 1 kilometer in diameter. Earth has “lots and lots of volcanoes that are far smaller than a kilometer across,” Byrne says. “That’s probably the case with Venus, too.”</p>





<p>We may soon find out. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s VERITAS spacecraft</a> and the European Space Agency’s EnVision mission are slated to turn their much sharper eyes on Venus’ infernal surface within the next decade or so (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). <em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/on-the-existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/">On the existential risks of artificial intelligence</a></h4>

              
                <p>The impressive progresses in machine learning have revived the
fear that humans might eventually be wiped out or enslaved by artificial superintelligences.
This is hardly a new fear. For example, this fear is the basis of most of Isaac
Asimov’s books, who imagined that robots are built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws</a> to protect humans.</p>



<p>My point
here is not to demonstrate that such events are impossible. On the contrary, my
point is that autonomous human-made entities already exist, and cause the exact
same risks that AI alarmists are talking about, except they are real. In this
context, evil AI fantasies are an anthropomorphic distraction.</p>



<p>Let me quickly dismiss some misconceptions. Does ChatGPT understand language? Of course not. Large language models are (essentially) algorithms tuned to predict the next words. But here we don’t mean “word” in the human sense. In the human sense, a word is a symbol that means something. In the computer sense, a word is a symbol, to which <em>we</em> humans attribute meaning. When ChatGPT talks about bananas, it has no idea what a banana tastes like (well, it has no idea). It has never seen a banana or tasted a banana (well, it has never seen or tasted). “Banana” is just a node in a big graph of other nodes, totally disconnected from the outside world, and in particular from what “banana” might actually refer to. This is known in cognitive science as the “symbol grounding problem”, and it is a difficult problem that LLMs do not solve. So, maybe LLMs “understand” language, but only if you are willing to define “understand” in such a way that it is not required to know what words mean.</p>



<p>Machine
learning algorithms are not biological organisms, they do not perceive, they
are not conscious, they do not have intentions in the human sense. But it doesn’t
matter. The broader worry about AI is simply that these algorithms are
generally designed so as to optimize some predefined criterion (e.g.,
prediction error), and if we give them very powerful means to do so, in
particular means that involve real actions in the world, then who knows whether
using those means might not be harmful to us? At some point, without
necessarily postulating any kind of evil mind, we humans might become means in
the achievement of some optimization criterion. We built some technical goals
into the machine, but it is very difficult to ensure that those are aligned
with human values. This is the so-called “alignment” problem.</p>



<p>Why not. We are clearly not there, but maybe, in a hypothetical future, or at least as a thought experiment. But what strikes me with the misalignment narrative is that this scenario is not at all hypothetical if you are willing to look beyond anthropomorphic evil robots. Have you really never heard of any human-made entities with their own goals, which might be misaligned with human values? Entities that are powerful and hard to control by humans?</p>



<p>There is an obvious answer if you look at the social rather than technological domain: it is the modern financialized multinational corporation. The modern corporation is a human-made organization that is designed in such a way as to maximize profit. It does not have intentions or goals in a human sense, but exactly like in the AI alignment narrative, it is simply designed in such a way that it will use all means available in order to maximize a predefined criterion, which may or may not be perfectly aligned with human values. Let’s call these companies “profit robots”.</p>



<p>To what
extent are profit robots autonomous from humans? Today’s modern large corporations
are owned not by people but in majority by institutional stakeholders, such as
mutual funds, i.e., other organizations with the same goals. As is well known,
their multinational nature makes them largely immune to the legislation of states
(hence the issues of fiscal optimization, social dumping, etc). As is also well
known, a large part of the resources of a profit robot is devoted to marketing
and advertisement, that is, in manipulating humans into buying their products.</p>



<p>Profit robots also engage in intense lobbying to bend human laws in their favor. But more to the point, the very notion of law is not the same for a profit robot as for humans. For humans, a law is something that sets boundaries on what could be done or should not be done, morally. But a profit robot is not a person. It has no moral principles. So, law is just one particular constraint, in fact a financial cost or risk – a company does not go to prison. A striking example of this is the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Dieselgate</a>”: Volkswagen (also not owned by humans) intentionally programmed their engines so that their car emissions remained hidden during the pollution tests required to authorize their cars on the US market. As far as I know, shareholders were not informed, and neither were consumers. The company autonomously decided to break the law for profit. Again, the company is not evil: it is not a person. It behaves in this non-human way because it is a robot, exactly like in the AI misalignment narrative.</p>



<p>We often hear that ultimately, it is the consumers who have power, by deciding what to buy. This is simply false. Consumers did not know that Volkswagen cheated on pollution tests. Consumers rarely know in what exact conditions the products are made, or even to what corporation the products belong. This type of crucial information is deliberately hidden. Profit robots, on the other hand, actively manipulate consumers into buying their products. What to think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>? Nobody wants products that are deliberately designed to break down prematurely, yet that is what a profit robot makes. So yes, profit robots are largely autonomous from the human community.</p>



<p>Are profit robots an existential risk for humans?
That might be a bit dramatic, but they certainly do cause very significant
risks. A particular distressing fact illustrates this. As the Arctic ice melts
because of global warming, <a href="http://science.time.com/2012/09/11/arctic-sea-ice-vanishes-and-the-oil-rigs-move-in/">oil companies get ready to drill the
newly available resources</a>. Clearly this is not in the interest of humans, but this is what a
company like Shell, who is only <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-owns-the-oil-company-Royal-Dutch-Shell">directly owned by humans in the
proportion of 6%</a>, needs
to do to pursue its goals, which as any other profit robot, is to generate
profit by whatever means.</p>



<p>So yes, there is a risk that powerful human-made entities get out of control and that their goals are misaligned with human values. This worry is reasonable because it is already realized, except not in the technological domain. It is ironic (but not so surprising) that billionaires buy into the AI misalignment narrative but fail to see that the same narrative fully applies to the companies that their wealth depends on, except it is realized.</p>



<p>The reasonable worry about AI is not that AI takes control of the world: the worry is that AI provides even more powerful means for the misaligned robots that are already out of control now. In this context, evil AI fantasies are an anthropomorphic distraction from the actual problems we have already created.</p>

<p>Hindawi and Wiley, its parent company, have identified approximately 1,200 articles with compromised peer review that the publishers will begin retracting this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jay Flynn, executive vice president and general manager of the research division at Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, wrote about the forthcoming retractions in a <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/04/guest-post-addressing-paper-mills-and-a-way-forward-for-journal-security/">blog post</a> at Scholarly Kitchen yesterday.</p>



<p>The plan to retract 1,200 articles, which the publisher expects to take a few months, follows Hindawi’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">announcement last September</a> that it would retract 511 articles across 16 journals for manipulated peer review. (We’ve <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26pub%3dHindawi">tracked 501</a> retractions from 23 Hindawi journals since the announcement.)</p>



<span id="more-126848"></span>



<p>The new batch of articles was identified as a result of the work that led to those initial retractions, a Wiley spokesperson told us in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wiley-statement.pdf">statement</a>. The papers to be retracted are concentrated in the same journals as the earlier batch, the spokesperson said, and all from special issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Special Issues in these journals were targeted by papermills and bad actors, with researcher identities manipulated (to appear as legitimate researchers) and content fabricated (to appear as legitimate content),” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other publishers have recently issued retractions en masse after identifying signs of paper mill activity. Last year, IOP Publishing <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/09/physics-publisher-retracting-nearly-500-likely-paper-mill-papers/">retracted nearly 500 articles</a>, and PLOS <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">retracted more than 100 papers</a> from its flagship journal over manipulated peer review.</p>



<p>From mid-October to mid-January, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publication</a> of Hindawi special issues, losing $9 million in revenue. Last month, the analytics company Clarivate, which assigns impact factors to journals, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">dropped 19 Hindawi journals</a> from its Web of Science index for failing to meet quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flynn’s blog post also mentioned the publisher is “designing a new retraction process that will help us, and potentially others, accelerate and deal with this new era of mass retractions fairly.” The Wiley spokesperson declined to share further details on the new process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-gas-space-anthill-galaxy">A stream of cold gas is unexpectedly feeding the far-off Anthill Galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long, cold stream of gas <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is feeding a very distant galaxy</a> like a vast bendy straw. The finding suggests a new way for galaxies to grow in the early universe, researchers report in the March 31 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Computer simulations predicted that streams of gas should connect galaxies to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">cosmic web</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). But astronomers expected that gas to be warm, making it unsuitable for star-forming fuel and galaxy growth.</p>



<p>So astronomer Bjorn Emonts and his colleagues were surprised to see a stream of cold, star-forming gas leading into the Anthill Galaxy, a massive galaxy whose light takes 12 billion years to reach Earth.</p>





<p>The team spotted the stream while mapping cold gas in the galaxy’s neighborhood using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in Chile. Emonts was particularly interested in radio wavelengths of light that carbon atoms emit when the temperature is between about -260° and -160° Celsius.</p>



<p>“People didn’t think that these streams could get so cold,” says Emonts, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.</p>



<p>But there, in the data, a frigid stream stretched at least 325,000 light-years away from the galaxy. The stream carries the mass of 70 billion suns and deposits the equivalent of about 450 suns in cold gas onto the galaxy every year, the team calculated. That’s enough to double the galaxy’s mass within a billion years.</p>



<p>Emonts thinks that no one had seen such a stream before because his team used ALMA in an unusual configuration, with its telescopes arranged as close together as possible. That gave the observatory lower resolution, but a wider field of view.</p>



<p>“People don’t normally do that,” Emonts says. “We basically defocused ALMA to the worst possible extent.”</p>



<p>If other galaxies are fed by similar structures, it could mean that early galaxies grew mostly by drinking directly from the cosmic streams, rather than by the leading hypothesis — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-galaxy-merger-occurred-shortly-after-big-bang">violent galaxy mergers</a> (<em>SN: 6/28/19</em>).</p>

<p>In 2018, the journal <em>Respiration</em> was adamant that it wouldn’t retract a 2015 paper co-authored by once-respected transplant surgeon <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/paolo-macchiarini/">Paolo Macchiarini</a>. Now, the editors at <em>Respiration</em> seem to have changed their mind.</p>



<p>Macchiarini is most well known for his controversial artificial windpipe implants. Seven out of the eight patients who had artificial windpipes implanted from Macchiarini <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">suffered complications after the surgery</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years ago, the Karolinska Institute (KI) in Sweden found that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/01/31/macchiarini-3-co-authors-found-guilty-misconduct-2015-paper/">Macchiarini and three co-authors of his were guilty of misconduct</a> in the 2015 study, and recommended that it should be pulled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thomas Nold, then the editor-in-chief of <em>Respiration</em>, previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/18/journal-holds-firm-on-decision-not-to-retract-macchiarini-paper-despite-outside-pressure/">told <em>Retraction Watch</em></a>, however, that the journal decided against retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126839"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In any retraction case we conduct our own analysis and consider all available information. In this specific case we needed to consider four other renowned institutions besides KI and the 26 authors of the article. Based on the evidence available to the journal we do not see ourselves in the position to make a judgement. We see the journal as a forum, and by publishing the different statements including KI’s report concerning the article our aim is to make the conflict completely transparent.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last month, the journal reversed course and pulled the <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/441799">2015 paper</a>, titled: “Autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells as Treatment in Refractory Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”</p>



<p>By <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMacchiarini%252c%2bPaolo">our count</a>, this brings Macchiarini up to nine retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Karolinska Institute, although the 2015 paper included an ethical permit, the underlying research did not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875">retraction notice</a>, released last month, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Karolinska Institutet found that the research “lacked any biological hypothesis based on either in vitro or in vivo (animal) data. The notebook also lacks notes on any advance discussion of the risks and benefits of the treatment, the theory on which it was based, the results of preclinical or other studies demonstrating effect, and safety; nor of any discussion that followed from the deterioration of the patient’s condition, in spite of which it was decided to continue the experimental treatment. This contravenes articles 14, 16, 17, and 21 of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki (articles 31, 21, 18, and 12 of the 2008 version).” [<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875#ref1">1</a>]</p>



<p>Upon re-evaluation of the case and in line with the Committee on Publication Ethics Guidelines for Retractions recommending that “Editors should consider retracting a publication if […] it reports unethical research” [<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875#ref2">2</a>], we are retracting this article.</p>



<p>Ana I. Teixeira, Adil Duru and Vanessa Lundin agree with this retraction. The remaining authors did not respond or could not be reached for comment within the timeframe given.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2018, <em>Respiration</em> published <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/489981">a response</a> to Karolinska’s report from three authors of the study including Macchiarini. It reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision is contrary to the assessment of the Central Ethical Review Board of Sweden, where an expert group analyzed the research and concluded that it does not constitute grounds to determine scientific misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Study co-author Philipp Jungebluth wrote in the 2018 response:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>​​The decision that has now been taken by the KI is purely politically motivated. The explanation for their decision is poor and the accusations they made are false and incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martin O. Bergö, vice president of Karolinska Institute, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…the journal has decided to retract the article and we support this decision. Obviously, based on the communication between our previous president and the journal, we believe the decision should have been taken sooner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Felix J.F. Herth, the current <em>Respiration</em> editor-in-chief and a medical researcher at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, has not responded to a request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geometric-patterns-salt-flats-worldwide">Here’s why the geometric patterns in salt flats worldwide look so similar</a></h4>

              
                <p>From Death Valley to Chile to Iran, similarly sized polygons of salt form in playas all over the world — and subterranean fluid flows might be the key to solving the long-standing puzzle of why.</p>



<p>Geometric shapes such as pentagons and hexagons spontaneously form in a wide range of geologic settings. Dried mud, ice and rock often crack into polygons, but these patterns tend to vary dramatically in size.</p>



<p>So why are all playas so persistently similar? <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The answer </a><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lies underground</a>, physicist Jana Lasser and colleagues propose February 24 in <em>Physical Review X. </em><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>With sophisticated mathematical models, computer simulations and experiments performed at Owens Lake in California, the team connected what they saw on the surface with what is going on beneath.</p>





<p>“Fluid flows and convection underground are uniquely able to explain why the patterns form,” says Lasser, of the Graz University of Technology in Austria.</p>



<p>This 3-D approach was key to explaining the universality of salty polygons.</p>



<p>Salt flats <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salt-flat-isnt-flat-worlds-largest-playa-sports-ridges-valleys">form in places</a> where rainfall is scarce and there’s a lot of evaporation (<em>SN: 12/5/07</em>). Groundwater seeping up to the surface evaporates, leaving a crust of salts and other minerals that had been dissolved in the water. Most striking, this process results in low ridges of concentrated salt that divide the playa into polygons: mostly hexagons with a smattering of pentagons and other geometric shapes.</p>



<p>The type of salt varies from one playa to another. Table salt, or sodium chloride, dominates in some playas, but others have more sulfite salts. And the salt crusts themselves range in thickness from a few millimeters to several meters. That variation seems to be why previous attempts to describe the playas’ patterns failed.</p>



<p>Whether the crusts are meter- or millimeter-thick, salt pans feature polygons that are 1 to 2 meters across. Previous models based on cracking, expansion and other phenomena that describe how mud and rock fracture instead produce polygons with sizes that vary according to crust thickness.</p>



<p>As groundwater evaporates from the surface, it concentrates salt in the remaining groundwater. That salty water, now denser and heavier, sinks, forcing other less dense water upward. Lasser and colleagues showed that over time, the circulation, known as convection, tends to push the descending plumes of saltier water into a network of vertical sheets. The surface above these sheets accrues more salt, so thick salt ridges grow there. Thinner crusts of salt form between, where less salty water upwells, spontaneously making the characteristic polygons shared by playas around the world.</p>

Lasser <em>et al</em>/<em>Physical Review X</em></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The equations the researchers used describe the relative salinity of the groundwater, the pressure within the fluid and the speed at which the water circulates. Computer simulations that embraced the full complexity of the 3-D problem started with no salt crust or polygons and produced something that looks very much like real playas.</p>



<p>“This fluid dynamical model makes much more sense than a model that ignores what’s happening beneath the surface,” says physicist Julyan Cartwright of the Spanish National Research Council, who is based in Granada and was not involved in the research.</p>





<p>Tests at Owens Lake helped the team verify and refine the model. “Physics is so much more than just sitting in front of a computer,” Lasser says, “and I wanted to do something that involves experiments.”</p>



<p>The lake dried up in the 1920s as water was diverted to Los Angeles. The deposited minerals on the remaining salt flat include large natural concentrations of arsenic, which blows away with the dust kicked up by wind — creating serious health hazards. Among <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dried-california-lake-gets-muddy-facial">other remediation effort</a>s, brine has been pumped onto the lake bed to try to create a more stable salt crust (<em>SN: 11/28/01</em>). That human intervention gave the researchers the opportunity to test their ideas in a controlled way.</p>



<p>“The whole area is destroyed,” Lasser says, “but for us it was the perfect research environment.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">Trends in preprint, data, and code sharing, 2019-2022</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hryaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>PLOS recently <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">introduced Open Science Indicators</a> (OSIs), a large public dataset identifying and quantifying Open Science practices like preprint posting, data sharing and code sharing in PLOS articles, as well as a selection of comparator articles published elsewhere. <strong>Now, we are delighted to release another six months of data from the second half of 2022, providing a new view of Open Science practices by researchers, over four years. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#numbers">latest results</a> continue to show incremental growth in all three areas.</strong> Read on for more details on the project, detailed numbers, and a closer look at preprints.</p>



<h2>The why and how of Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; founding mission centers on breaking down barriers to publish, read, and reuse trusted scholarly research with the overall aim of accelerating progress across science and medicine. We do that by making Open Access publishing options and Open Science best-practices more accessible to all researchers, in all disciplines, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We aren&rsquo;t alone in this work: across the scholarly ecosystem, researchers, funders, institutions, librarians, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/open-science-advocacy-and-capacity-building-for-leadership-in-african-higher-education-institutions/">professional organizations</a>, and other Open Access publishers are embracing Open practices that support equity and inclusion, research integrity and reproducibility, and collaboration across distance and discipline. But to understand whether we are making progress towards increased adoption, we first have to understand where researchers are today. Open Science Indicators allow us to establish benchmarks, and to track changes over time.</p>



<p id="poll">After developing <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">a set of principles and definitions</a> for Open Science practices, PLOS <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">partnered with DataSeer</a> to create &ldquo;indicators&rdquo; which identify and measure specific Open Science practices in published research articles. In December we introduced our first three indicators: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting. We are currently working on a fourth indicator for protocol sharing. In the future we aim to continue refining our methods and expanding the dataset. We appreciate your comments and feedback, both on the latest data, how you are using it, and the data points and features you&rsquo;d find most valuable in the future.

<h2>A closer look at the latest Open Science Indicators</h2>



<h3>About the dataset</h3>



<p>The March 2023 dataset includes all 71,109 PLOS research articles published during the 4 year period from January 2019 to December 2022, along with a comparator set of 7,635 publicly-available research articles from PubMed Central, an increase of 16% over the previous dataset.</p>



<p>A few caveats to bear in mind: Open Science Indicators report only machine-detectible traits. Unclear labeling or missing metadata may mean that some practices are underrepresented in the dataset. Accuracy rates for the dataset have <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=39883933">been updated and expanded in this second release</a>, offering a more nuanced view of the quality of the dataset for advanced users.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="numbers">Updates through the end of 2022</h3>



<p>Open Science Indicators results continued to follow established patterns through the remainder of 2022. Specifically for PLOS articles:</p>



<ul><li>Rates of data repository use continued to rise, from 26% in 2021 to 28% for articles published in 2022. Overall rates of data sharing also rose to 75%.</li><li>Code sharing rates rose slightly in 2022, compared to 2021, reaching 15% for all articles published in 2022</li><li>The rate of preprints associated with published articles held steady at 24% across 2021 and 2022</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="404" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21202" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2.png 624w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></figure>



<h3>A closer look at preprint posting</h3>



<p>To complement the summary of data- and code-sharing results that accompanied our first data release, here we take a more in-depth look at preprint posting.</p>



<p>While the proportion of published articles with an associated preprint remained the same across 2021 and 2022, if we look at preprint habits based on the date the preprint was posted, rather than the date the associated article was published, a different pattern emerges. For PLOS articles, 57% more preprints were posted in Q2 2020 compared to the previous quarter, likely in part in response to the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Since then, rates have gradually normalized until, by Q4 2021, they were slightly above pre-pandemic levels, in keeping with the gradual upward trend observed in prior years. Comparator data sees a less marked pandemic increase and levels remain more stable throughout 2021 (although this is a much smaller sample size). Future iterations of the dataset will provide greater clarity on the ongoing trends for preprints.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="923" height="302" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21200" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021.png 923w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021-300x98.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021-768x251.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px"></figure>



<p><sub>*Preprints posted in 2022 are date are excluded, as many of these papers have not yet gone on to publication</sub></p>



<p>One benefit of the Open Science Indicators dataset is that it provides a more complete view of preprint posting <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">than has previously been possible</a> for PLOS. Among the most popular preprint servers for both PLOS and comparators were the community/discipline specific servers bioRxiv, medRxiv. Differences in server use between PLOS and comparators is likely correlated with the preprint servers different publishers work most closely with.</p>

<p><sub>*Calculated as a percentage of total preprints posted in a detectable repository</sub></p>



<p>The prevalence of preprints also varies by region. Looking at broad geographic areas, we see the highest preprint rates (27%) in the Americas. Africa (excluding North Africa), Europe, and Australasia all post preprints at a similar rate (21-23%), while Asia and North Africa/Middle East (MENA) have lower adoption at 15% and 17% respectively. We haven&rsquo;t so far sought to interpret why these differences in preprint posting by region exist, but welcome comments. These latest Open Science Indicator results may complement the work of others who have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281659">begun to look</a> at regional preprint adoption rates in the context of equity in scientific publication.</p>

<h2>Using the Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>There are many ways to view and analyze Open Science Indicators: take a closer look at the data: identify the most popular data and code repositories, look for patterns in how researchers use repositories vs Supporting Information files to share data, or cross reference to investigate differences in disciplinary or regional norms. Just last month, Robyn Price, Imperial College London wrote on <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/"><em>The Bibliomagician</em></a> how institutions might use Indicators to better understand their researchers&rsquo; publishing patterns while taking a deeper look at the data for a specific institution. However <em>you </em>use Open Science Indicators, we want to hear about it! Share your interpretations, thoughts, and questions&mdash;and be sure to let us know what additional data points would be most useful to you.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flour-beetles-drink-water-using-butts">How some beetles ‘drink’ water using their butts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some beetles “drink” using their butts, and scientists are starting to understand how.</p>



<p>Red flour beetles, a major agricultural pest, open their anus to get water vapor in the air flowing into the lower gut and condensing on any poop there. The insects draw water out of the fecal material <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217084120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using special cells lining their lower digestive system</a>, researchers report March 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>This “amazing mechanism” could one day be exploited to make beetle-specific pesticides that could protect crops while safeguarding bees and other insects, says Kenneth Halberg, a comparative endocrinologist and physiologist at the University of Copenhagen.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Insect pests get into <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/av013e/av013e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as 20 percent</a> of the global food supply every year, destroying food and costing farmers money, the United Nations&#8217; Food and Agriculture Organization estimates. Beetles are particularly pernicious. These insects can thrive in arid environments, including in supplies of wheat and other bone-dry crops. One way dry-adapted beetles survive is by recycling water out of their poop using the rectal complex, an organ near the end of their digestive system. But researchers didn’t know how the insects accomplished the feat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Halberg and colleagues found that in red flour beetles (<em>Tribolium castaneum</em>), the gene <em>Nha1</em> is more active in cells pockmarking the lining of the rectal complex than elsewhere in the body. Scientists have previously suggested that the rectal complex’s blisterlike cells were involved in sucking water out of material in the organ.</p>



<p>But “the paradox was that they don’t look like transporting cells,” says Michael O’Donnell, an insect physiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The new study may resolve that paradox. <em>Nha1 </em>produces a protein that pumps charged potassium particles across the cells’ membranes, Halberg’s team found. That may result in a buildup of the ions on the outside of the rectal complex, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>Through osmosis, water will move toward areas with a high concentration of ions. So that pool of potassium could allow beetles to move water through the wall of the rectal complex and into the rest of the body.</p>



<p>Experiments confirmed that the insects opened their anuses in high humidity so water vapor could flow into the rectal complex. What’s more, beetles with <em>Nha1</em> deactivated didn’t survive as well in dry conditions as normal beetles.</p>





<p>It’s not clear whether other beetles use a similar mechanism, Halberg says. But the finding emphasizes how “nature has its way of developing some quite interesting solutions to some very interesting problems.”</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission? We recently launched the </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, I created an alert on Scopus to keep me updated about new publications in the <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences,</em> which had been<em> </em><a href="http://hkjoss.com/index.php/journal">hijacked by fraudulent publishers</a>. I wanted to know if unauthorized content from this hijacked journal ended up in the index.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I forgot about the alert until last month, when I received three notifications from Scopus regarding new publications in the journal.</p>



<p>These notifications included lists of a dozen papers indexed in Scopus, all of them originating from the hijacked version of the journal. Inspecting the profile of the journal showed that probably more than 55 papers from the hijackers are currently indexed in Scopus:</p>



<span id="more-126833"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xu2CHwdse9VyHrkBNn6FsOoyI4VYR7MiOJOn3YbLXFvxT6nPS8N4L2QS4bP4iBgG-1-dNtHsTcvhXbsO_biIgNeiXio-2t1If0k7TEgzZPnh9SDjAmB_kM_Fduhtf1iWrN-JQ9bHsfsaPh1LTzogzQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The hijacking of the <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> started in 2019, when the web domain of the clone journal was created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hijackers’ website mimicked the genuine journal well. The archive of past issues included papers from the genuine journal. Additionally, the clone journal falsely claimed that it was indexed in Scopus and Web of Science and adhered to the ethical principles set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Although the papers were published online in English, the title and abstract of each paper were translated into Chinese to make the hijacked journal appear authentic. However, the Chinese versions were most likely machine-translated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, the hijacked <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> is a high quality clone, and hundreds of scholars have been duped by the fraudulent journal over several years.</p>



<p>The original journal became aware of the problem and informed potential authors:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GVlNSA6VbdNNwgRxs9WiNYu-59SEXdyDUuZu-JC-_BYZ30XCFLQefLe4l6OvmguyFOmgVTBNtUOy8AUJtaVD3q0yzO03P_LfKxOjyQuM3PQPU0h9lL5CZfoEA-kZZOHqjEpVV2zwDdecsH4aCRf3Qg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><em>Screenshot from April 2022.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“We have been alerted that some English websites have collected payments from authors for publications on the pretext of our Journal’s English and Chinese titles, i.e. Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences (香港社會科學學報), ISSN and Journal’s cover. The Journal solemnly clarifies that we are an academic journal only publishes papers written in Chinese, and do not charge from authors. If in doubt, please contact us at hkjss@eduhk.hk”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This fraudulent journal could continue to publish dozens of papers, charging 300 euros each, while&nbsp; the genuine journal, <a href="https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alPublicationJournal?PublicationID=P20201111001&amp;type=P001">according to the information on one Chinese website</a>, ceased publishing in 2022, with volume 58 as its final issue. <a href="http://www.eduhk.hk/hkjss">The website of the genuine journal </a>is not available anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the genuine <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> has really stopped publishing, this opens a new opportunity for the hijacked journal, because the clone website remains the only one for the title. Evidence from other cases also suggests that hijackers are particularly interested in cloning journals that have stopped publishing. Thus, the hijacked <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> succeeded in penetrating Scopus with an issue 59, published in 2022. All the new papers were published in English, unlike the genuine journal, which was published in Chinese.</p>



<p>Many of the papers published in this hijacked journal, including those which, according to Scopus, were funded by various universities, the Connecting Europe Facility, and the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research, are not considered as having been officially published. Furthermore, the money from universities and international organizations may have gone to fraudulent publishers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/threats-civilization-survival-humanity-apocalypse">Here are the Top 10 threats to the survival of civilization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Civilizations don’t last forever. Just ask the Aztecs. Or the Maya. Or fans of the original Roman Empire.</p>



<p>From the ancient Myceneans in the Mediterranean to the Anasazi in Arizona, societies throughout history have often gone the way of the dinosaurs and the dodo. Wars, or disease, or altered weather patterns, or natural disasters, or famine have repeatedly tipped complex regional societies past the point of stability, initiating chaos, ruin and ultimately total demise.</p>



<p>In his original unabridged dictionary, published in 1828, Noah Webster defined civilization as “the state of being refined in manners, from the grossness of savage life, and improved in arts and learning.”</p>





<p>Today civilization is a lot more complicated. Now <em>civilization</em> connotes global complexity and technological sophistication beyond anything Webster would have recognized. Civilization has become a state “marked by urbanization, advanced techniques (as of agriculture and industry), expanded population, and complex social organization,” as the most recent unabridged Webster’s dictionary describes it.</p>



<p>Civilization’s current stability depends on a vast global interdependence of countless connected components. Food and fuel, materials for manufacturing, clothing and housing — all require the cooperation of individuals, corporations and nations. Transportation, communication, economic activity anywhere affect everything everywhere (sometimes, all at once).</p>



<p>So far, the economic and social structures, governmental agencies and relevant public policies have managed to maintain something resembling Webster’s recent definition. But all that is under threat. Civilization is on the brink of breakdown. There’s no guarantee that 21st century civilization will last till the 22nd.</p>



<p>In fact, humankind now faces a multitude of credible existential threats of which everybody ought to be aware. Lack of space, though, requires that immediate warnings herein be restricted to the Top 10 Threats to the Survival of Civilization, with relevant movies noted. (Note to <em>The Last of Us</em> fans — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">fungal zombie apocalypse</a> would have been No. 11.)</p>



<h4>10. Alien invasion</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The War of the Worlds</em></a></p>





<p>An assault on Earth by extraterrestrials isn’t exactly likely anytime soon. Even if enemy aliens are out there, they’d have to come a really long way for no good reason. Surely they’ve monitored Earth’s TV and radio output and would decide to look for intelligent life elsewhere.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, if spacefaring aliens did attack, they could easily destroy all earthly civilization. Even if they appeared to be friendly at first, don’t be fooled by a gift book from them titled <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734684/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>To Serve Man</em></a>. And don’t think Earth’s microbes will save us like they did in <em>The War of the Worlds</em>. If aliens possessed the technological capability for interstellar travel, they would also be smart enough to wear a damn mask.</p>



<h4>9. Asteroid impact</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Armageddon</em></a><em></em></p>



<p>Not an immediate concern, yet more likely than an alien invasion. After all, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-dinosaur-demise-cause-mystery">asteroid has already wiped out civilization on Earth once before</a>. True, dinosaur civilization didn’t have the same kind of technology human civilization does. But a sufficiently big asteroid would certainly take down a lot of modern technology, and subsequent fires followed by global cooling (a <em>Game of Thrones</em> version of winter) would make a mess of the rest.</p>



<h4>8. Bees all die</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389790/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bee Movie</em></a></p>



<p>According to Twitter, if bees all die, humans will soon all be dead as well. That prediction appears to derive from an Albert Einstein quote found widely on the internet: “If the bee disappeared off the face of the Earth, man would only have four years left to live.” Such a quote does not appear in the standard compilation of Einstein quotations, though, and nobody seems to have any evidence that he ever said it.</p>



<p>Still, the demise of the bees would be disastrous. Their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-bees-pollinators-billion-yields-six-u-s-crops">pollination of important crops</a> (coffee beans, for instance) keeps the world going. Bees are not the only important pollinators of course, but if some combination of pesticide poisoning and other calamities wiped out bees and other pollinating insects and animals, the consequences for humankind’s food supplies would be dire. Animal pollination is of at least some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1702377/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">importance for the majority of the world’s food crops</a>, a 2007 study concluded. </p>



<p>Still, it’s unlikely that the human race would die out completely without pollinators. But civilization would probably collapse as the food chain (or web) unraveled, and there was no coffee.</p>



<h4>7. Artificial intelligence takeover</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Terminator</em></a> (or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Colossus: The Forbin Project</em></a>)</p>



<p>A vast literature already exists describing the threats that artificial intelligence poses to civilization. Most such threats are minimal now, but as AI systems become more widespread, and both software and hardware become more sophisticated, AI’s destructive potential will pose an accelerating threat. A 2018 paper identified <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/TURCOG-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of scenarios for AI-generated global catastrophe</a>.</p>



<p>For example, in a future in which civilization relies extensively on robots, a computer virus with AI capability could become a weapon for a malevolent cyberattack. “If the attack is on a very large scale, affecting billions of sophisticated robots with a large degree of autonomy, it may result in human extinction,” wrote <a href="https://www.archmission.org/alexey-turchin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexey Turchin</a> and <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/denkenberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Denkenberger</a>.</p>



<p>And of course, putting AI in charge of things like nuclear weapons might easily become just as dangerous in real life as it is in the movies. Already the military makes use of AI technologies and, in the future, will no doubt employ AI-powered drones and other robotic weapons with increasing frequency. “Military robotics could become so cheap that drone swarms could cause enormous damage to the human population; a large autonomous army could attack humans because of a command error; billions of nanobots with narrow AI could be created in a terrorist attack and create a global catastrophe,” note Turchin and Denkenberger. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>6. Quantum computing</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/robert-redford-film-foretold-shors-quantum-computing-bombshell">Relevant movie</a>: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/?ref_=tt_mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sneakers</a></p>



<p>Ordinary AI has the potential to be risky enough, so it shouldn’t be surprising to discover that quantum computing, in principle a much more powerful technology still in its infancy, poses even more serious dangers. Overhyped as it frequently is, quantum computing nevertheless might someday be able to perform specific tasks dramatically more rapidly than today’s supercomputers. One such task might be simulating the interactions of atoms and molecules in order to design new drugs or other chemicals.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantum simulation</a> … offers an exponential quantum speedup in understanding reaction mechanism in molecules and probing the properties of new materials,” quantum scientist <a href="https://www.mpq.mpg.de/person/104566/6448833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Schiffer</a> wrote in a paper last year.</p>



<p>In malevolent hands, such power would also enable design of more effective poisons. Using quantum computers, a novel pandemic agent could be engineered without the need for time-consuming ordinary chemical trial and error. “There is an existential threat to humanity arising from the prospect of being able to run quantum simulations on a quantum computer in the future,” Schiffer argues.</p>



<h4>5. Complexity’s instability</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <em>The Butterfly Effect</em> (title only — actual movie is irrelevant)</p>



<p>Any sufficiently complex system is at risk of reaching a tipping point where the slightest disturbance can initiate a collapse. So a seemingly insignificant event can trigger an apocalypse. It’s like the way at some point adding a single grain of sand to a large sandpile can cause it all to come tumbling down. Or the snap of a twig initiating an avalanche. Such complex systems seem stable because their complexity conceals underlying vulnerability. But the math exists to analyze such systems and predict their demise.</p>



<p>In 2000, geophysicists <a href="https://emeritus.er.ethz.ch/about-us/people/sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didier Sornette</a> and Anders Johansen warned that such analyses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast a collapse of human population growth</a> along with the mother of all economic crashes in the 2050s. Obviously, the economy and human population growth are key aspects of civilization as a whole. So these forecasts “point to the existence of an end to the present era, which will be irreversible and cannot be overcome by any novel innovation,” Sornette and Johansen wrote.</p>



<p>In a 2013 paper, Sornette and <a href="https://www.risk.net/author/peter-cauwels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Cauwels</a> compared the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silent march to catastrophe to the phenomenon of “creep” in materials</a>, where small, unnoticeable cracks accumulate until the material suddenly fractures. It’s like society today is a lobster that thinks it’s getting a nice, pleasant bath and doesn’t notice the water getting warmer until it’s too late. For the world at large, the result might very well be a “blood red abyss,” Sornette and Cauwels wrote, the “likely and very painful final stage of creep … ending in the failure of existing institutions.”</p>



<h4>4. Social media</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Don’t Look Up</em></a></p>



<p>It’s already evident that social media platforms have amplified ideological idiocy propagated to deter efforts to prevent or diminish many of the threats to civilization. Anti-vaccination propaganda is a prominent example, as is the effort to dispel the dangers of climate change and block efforts to address it. Social media enables <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">disseminators of falsehoods to manipulate the masses</a> and intimidate governments (as well as many organizations within the supposedly legitimate mainstream media). </p>



<p>On its own, social media might not destroy civilization totally, just eliminate civilized discourse. But combined with other options for vast destruction, social media could accelerate civilization’s devastation while impeding efforts to prevent it.</p>



<h4>3. Pandemic(s)</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>I Am Legend</em></a></p>



<p>You would think that a pandemic that has killed more than a million Americans and many millions more people worldwide would launch a serious effort to guard against future pandemics. Instead, the pandemic has led not to strengthening of public health measures, but an official response telling everybody they’re on their own.</p>



<p>Institutions charged with protecting public health now say individuals should weigh their own risks, but do not provide the necessary information to weigh those risks, and ignore the fact that the vast majority of people do not possess the expertise needed to weigh risks intelligently anyway. Making pandemic mitigations a personal choice is very much like saying people should decide for themselves whether to obey stop signs or run red lights. Consequently, a future pandemic as infectious as COVID-19, but with a much higher fatality rate, could kill enough people to shred the social fabric.</p>



<p>This danger has long been foreseen, but mostly ignored. In 1988, molecular biologist and Nobel laureate <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/373248" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Lederberg lamented complacency about the threat of global epidemics</a>, and warned that viruses and other microbes are formidable foes in a never-ending competition for planetary domination. “In that natural evolutionary competition,” Lederberg wrote, “there is no guarantee that we will find ourselves the survivor.”</p>



<h4>2. Nuclear war</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dr. Strangelove</em></a></p>



<p>After World War II, nuclear war was the most likely end-of-civilization scenario, and it certainly became a popular theme for fictional accounts of civilization’s demise. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, though, many people who had been holding their breath since 1945 permitted themselves to exhale. But as long as nuclear arsenals remained undismantled, the threat continued, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-power-weapons-risk-physics">now it may be greater than ever</a>.</p>



<p>In January, the <em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</em> <a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed its famous doomsday clock to 90 seconds before midnight</a>, the closest to global catastrophe in the clock’s history. The publication’s science and security board released a statement saying the new time was motivated largely, but not exclusively, by Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Russia’s thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict — by accident, intention, or miscalculation — is a terrible risk. The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone’s control remains high.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, declared last year that the world now faces a time of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-health-antonio-guterres-2871563e530f9a676d7884b3e2d871c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear danger</a> as great as during the height of the Cold War. “Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he warned.</p>



<p>And of course, if Russia doesn’t initiate nuclear holocaust, there’s always North Korea, China, Iran and a bunch of other countries.</p>



<h4>1. Climate change</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Mononoke</a></p>



<p>Scientists have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">warning for more than a century</a> that carbon dioxide emissions could alter the planet. Higher average temperatures, hotter summers, melting sea ice, severe droughts, more wildfires, more powerful hurricanes and yes, even stronger winter storms are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">already signaling that climate change is not a myth</a>. International efforts to agree on steps to limit rising carbon dioxide levels have stumbled. Study after study has detailed the numerous negative consequences for agriculture, human health and social well-being. Catastrophic climate change could instigate wars, famine, revolution.</p>



<p>Efforts to mitigate climate change might save civilization of course. But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if such efforts fail, the worst-case warming scenarios are truly apocalyptic</a>, as <a href="https://www.cser.ac.uk/team/luke-kemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Kemp</a> and coauthors warned last year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. “There is ample evidence that climate change could become catastrophic,” they wrote. They point out that climate change has played a part in the collapse of many regional civilizations. (There’s a reason why most people have never heard of the Natufian hunter-gatherers of Southwest Asia.) Uncertainties about future climate are great enough, those authors contend, to warrant serious investigation into the prospect that climate change could result “in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction.”</p>



<p>Of course, most of the risks to the civilization are not isolated threats. Climate change could trigger wars (see No. 2) or contribute to the spread of infectious diseases (No. 3), Kemp and colleagues note. And a United Nations report last year found that analyses of numerous related systemic risks “show a <a href="https://www.undrr.org/publication/global-catastrophic-risk-and-planetary-boundaries-relationship-global-targets-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous tendency</a> for the world to move toward a global collapse scenario” in “the absence of ambitious policy and near global adoption and successful implementation.” In other words, without worldwide cooperation, “total societal collapse is a possibility.”</p>



<p>Both Kemp and colleagues and the authors of the U.N. report emphasize that these warnings are not predictions but calls to action. Listing threats is not for the purpose of overdramatizing them or to suggest that everybody should surrender to an inevitable existential catastrophe.</p>



<p>Behavioral scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/RVAwonk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caroline Orr Bueno</a>, one of the few sane voices who offsets Twitter’s threat to civilization with insight and intelligence about misinformation and the techniques for spreading it, warns that scaring people “makes them reject the message.”</p>



<p>“The key is to get people to perceive that the threat is real,” she tweets, “but also that there are things we can do to effectively reverse the threat.”</p>



<p>And therein lies the hope. </p>



<p>Warnings of potential catastrophes should not be taken as cause for despair, but as motivation for investigating the dangers. “Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience and inform policy,” Kemp and colleagues write. After all, when drought dissolved the Natufians’ civilization 10,000 years ago, they had no power to affect the climate. Modern humans do have such power. They could, in principle, stop using that power to make things worse and take steps to restore civilization’s safety and stability. At least until the aliens arrive.</p>
