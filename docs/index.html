              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/logs-evidence-oldest-wood-structure">Interlocking logs may be evidence of the oldest known wooden structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modified logs dating to about 476,000 years ago might be the oldest evidence of wooden structures, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Wooden artifacts decompose easily and are relatively scant in the archaeological record compared with stone or bone. The new finding, reported September 20 in <em>Nature,</em> suggests that the structural use of wood <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may stretch </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> back</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> into the</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> history of human ancestors</a>, hinting at advanced cognitive skills and a less nomadic lifestyle for some hominids than previously thought.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s a challenge to preconceptions about what are considered sophisticated, complex behaviors,” says Larry Barham, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool in England. “For me, settling into one place and changing the landscape, that is very sophisticated.”</p>



<p>Humans and their ancestors have been using wood in some fashion for quite some time. The earliest known example of modified wood is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/004724849190015N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a polished plank from Israel</a> dating to around 780,000 years ago. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/385807a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wooden tools</a> don&#8217;t appear in the historical record until about 400,000 years ago. Before this new study, the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/50/impact/star-carr-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest known example of a wooden structure</a> was much more recent: around 9000 B.C.</p>



<p>During a dig in 2019, Barham and colleagues found five modified wooden objects in the exposed bank of a river flowing into the top of Kalambo Falls in Zambia. The area is rich with forest and has a consistently high water table. This makes it ideal for human habitation — and the water also blocks oxygen from buried wood. Since the 1950s, archaeologists have excavated ancient technologies here, though wooden objects couldn’t be accurately placed in time and clear modifications had been worn away.</p>



<p>This time the team used a technique <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-first-settled-australia-early-65000-years-ago">known as luminescence dating</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/17</em>). Minerals buried underground gradually absorb background radiation like a battery taking up charge, which can be released later as light. This reveals how many years ago a sample last saw the sun. The team analyzed 16 sand samples‚ including from directly around the wooden objects, and grouped the artifacts into three chunks of time from 476,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>In the sands that are nearly half a million years old, the team found two large interlocking logs, with shaped ends and wide, carved notches at the point they overlap. Like an early version of Lincoln Logs, this would have held the wood together. Both logs showed evidence of chopping and scraping, and were buried near tools used for scraping or carving, hand axes and other crafting equipment.</p>

<p>These logs may have been part of a structure — a raised walkway, a place to store wood or somewhere to sit — that helped early hominids in their environment, the researchers suggest. Based on timing and location, the structure could be the handiwork of <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>, a human ancestor that lived about 700,000 to 200,000 years ago. Other wooden objects recovered from the site include a wedge, a digging stick and a chopped log, dating from 390,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>“This paper provides a wonderful peek into our past,” says Rebecca Biermann Gürbüz, a biological anthropologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in the study. Other primates use wood and plants in a variety of ways, she says. “So the fact that [hominids] did so nearly half a million years ago is not surprising.”</p>



<p>In fact, Barham wonders if Stone Age is even the right term for that era. “Let&#8217;s say wood survived as much as bone does in the archaeological record,” he says. “Maybe we should relabel our Stone Age to the Woodworking Age, an Organic Age or something that reflects the reality of common behavior, which we can only really glimpse.”</p>

<p>Surveys show spreadsheets are the <a href="http://10.12688/f1000research.8414.1">most widely used</a> analytical tool in academic research. But they are <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0801/0801.3114.pdf">prone to errors</a>. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health England lost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988">16,000 test results</a> after using an old Excel file format to handle data. Whether this mix-up hampered local infection control is anybody’s guess, but it certainly could have. </p>



<p>The software is causing trouble for other lines of research, too, as our team and others have shown: Genomics studies that rely on Excel spreadsheets to manage data turn out to be riddled with erroneous gene names, or gene-name errors, and the issue is affecting more and more journals.</p>



<span id="more-127892"></span>



<p><strong>A persistent problem</strong></p>



<p>Gene-name errors were <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80">discovered</a> by Barry R. Zeeberg and his team at the National Institutes of Health in 2004. Their study first showed that when genomic data is handled in Excel, the program automatically corrects gene names to dates. What’s more, Riken clone identifiers – unique name tags given to pieces of DNA – can be misinterpreted as numbers with decimal points.</p>



<p>In 2016, we conducted a more extensive search, showing that in more than 3,500 articles published between 2005 and 2015, <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">20% of Excel gene lists contained errors</a> in their supplementary files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are no documented cases in which gene-name errors have affected the conclusions of a study. But if a researcher unknowingly saved a spreadsheet containing such errors, someone importing those data for further analysis would face a reproducibility problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to these issues, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0669-3">made changes</a> to some gene names prone to errors. This includes converting the SEPT-1 gene to SEPTIN1 and the MARCH1 gene to MARCHF1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The widespread adoption of these new names is a lengthy process: Our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008984">latest study, of</a> more than 11,000 articles published between 2014 and 2020, found that 31% of supplementary files that included gene lists in Excel contained errors. This percentage is higher than in <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">our previous 2016 study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also found some novel errors. Some were connected to the local language setting. For example, the AGO2 gene was converted to Aug-02, perhaps due to “Ago” being short for “August” in Spanish. Similarly, MEI1 was switched to May-01 (“Mei” is “May” in Dutch), and TAMM41 to Jan-41 (“Tammikuu” is “January” in Finnish).<br><br>One of the significant findings in our study was the five-digit conversion. When saving a gene name converted to a date and importing it into a new Excel spreadsheet, the dates will change into a five-digit number. Software packages like HGNChelper and Gene Updater can help in fixing gene-name errors, but not once they have been converted to numbers.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-ziemann.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="312" height="284" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-ziemann.jpeg?resize=312%2C284&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127894" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-ziemann.jpeg?w=312&amp;ssl=1 312w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-ziemann.jpeg?resize=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mark Ziemann</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>More and more journals affected</strong></p>



<p>Despite increased recognition of gene-name errors, scientific journals have taken no significant initiatives to mitigate the problem. Our continuous tracking of these errors, the data for which is publicly accessible at <a href="https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/">https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/</a>, reveals a steady rate of gene-name errors and a rising number of affected journals until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This spread may be due to the expansion of omics into different branches of biology and medicine, coupled with the growth of second-tier journals.</p>



<p>But the problem isn’t limited to lesser-known journals. We found the journals with the highest numbers of affected articles were <em>Nature Communications, PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports, BMC Genomics, PLOS Genetics </em>and<em> Oncotarget</em>, with at least 100 affected publications each. Clearly, journals need to produce guidelines about how to filter for and address gene-name errors that can affect data reproducibility.</p>



<p>A substantial number of genes may be misnamed when the computer is set to a non-English language. Our studies only scratch the surface of this problem, but they plainly show Excel and other non-specialised spreadsheet programs are not designed to handle big data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although gene-name errors may seem like small fry in the grand scheme of scientific data analysis, they are a symptom of broader issues like over-reliance on spreadsheets and lack of consensus on how large genomic datasets should be reviewed and disseminated. These issues need to be addressed to improve the reliability of genomics research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sewage-key-track-disease-covid-19-wastewater">Why sewage may hold the key to tracking diseases far beyond COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The future of disease tracking is going down the drain — literally. Flushed with success over detecting coronavirus in wastewater, and even specific variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, researchers are now eyeing our collective poop to monitor a wide variety of health threats.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, wastewater surveillance was a smaller field, primarily focused on testing for drugs or mapping microbial ecosystems. But these researchers were tracking specific health threats in specific places — opioids in parts of Arizona, polio in Israel — and hadn’t quite realized the potential for national or global public health.</p>





<p>Then COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The pandemic triggered an “incredible acceleration” of wastewater science, says Adam Gushgari, an environmental engineer who before 2020 worked on testing wastewater for opioids. He now develops a range of wastewater surveillance projects for Eurofins Scientific, a global laboratory testing and research company headquartered in Luxembourg.</p>



<p>A subfield that was once a few handfuls of specialists has grown into more than enough scientists to pack a stadium, he says. And they come from a wide variety of fields — environmental science, analytical chemistry, microbiology, epidemiology and more — all collaborating to track the coronavirus, interpret the data and communicate results to the public. With other methods of monitoring COVID-19 on the decline, wastewater surveillance has become one of health experts’ primary sources for spotting new surges.</p>



<p>Hundreds of wastewater treatment plants across the United States are now part of COVID-19 testing programs, sending their data to the National Wastewater Surveillance System, or NWSS, a monitoring program launched in fall 2020 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds more such testing programs have launched globally, as tracked by the <a href="https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVIDPoops19 dashboard</a> run by researchers at the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>In the last year, wastewater scientists have started to consider what else could be tracked through this new infrastructure. They’re looking at seasonal diseases like the flu, recently emerging diseases like bird flu and mpox, formerly called monkeypox, as well as drug-resistant pathogens like the fungus <em>Candida auris</em>. The scientists are even considering how to identify entirely new threats.</p>



<p>Wastewater surveillance will have health impacts “far broader than COVID,” predicts Amy Kirby, a health scientist at the CDC who leads NWSS.</p>



<p>But there are challenges getting from promise to possible. So far, such sewage surveillance has been mostly a proof of concept, confirming data from other tracking systems. Experts are still determining how data from our poop can actually inform policy; that’s true even for COVID-19, now the poster child for this monitoring. And they face public officials wary of its value and questions over whether, now that COVID-19 health emergencies have ended, the pipeline of funding will be cut off.</p>



<p>This monitoring will hopefully become “one of the technologies that really evolves post-pandemic to be here to stay,” says Mariana Matus, cofounder of Biobot Analytics, a company based in Cambridge, Mass., that has tested sewage for the CDC and many other health agencies. But for that to happen, the technology needs continued buy-in from governments, research institutions and the public, Matus and other scientists say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How wastewater testing works</h4>



<p>Wastewater-based epidemiology has a long history, tracing back at least to physician <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150208/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Snow’s 1850s observations</a> that cholera outbreaks in London were connected to contaminated water.</p>





<p>In the 1920s and ’30s, scientists began to take samples from sewage and study them in the lab, learning to isolate specific pathogens that cause disease. These early researchers focused on diseases that spread through contaminated water, such as polio and typhoid.</p>



<p>Today, automated machines typically retrieve sewage samples. The machines used to collect waste beneath maintenance hole covers are “like R2-D2 in terms of size” or smaller, says Erin Driver, an environmental engineer at Arizona State University in Tempe who works on collection methods.</p>



<p>Driver can plug this machine, or a larger version used for sampling at wastewater treatment plants, into a water pipe and program it to pull a small amount of sewage into an empty bottle at regular intervals, say, once an hour for 24 hours. She and colleagues are developing smaller versions of the automated sampler that could be better suited for more targeted sampling.</p>



<p>What happens in the lab to that bottle of waste depends on what scientists are testing for. To test for opioids and other chemicals, scientists might filter large particles out of the sample with a vacuum system, extract the specific chemicals that they want to test, then run the results through a spectrometer, an instrument that measures chemical concentrations by analyzing the light the chemicals give off.</p>



<p>To determine levels of SARS-CoV-2 or another virus, a scientist might separate liquid waste from solid waste with a centrifuge, isolate viral genetic material, and then test the results with a PCR machine, similar to testing someone’s nose swab. Or, if scientists want to know which SARS-CoV-2 variants are present, they can put the material through a machine that identifies a variety of genetic sequences.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Would the coronavirus even show up in waste?</h4>



<p>In the panicked early days of the pandemic, an urgent basic question loomed. “Will this even work?” remembers Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist at Emory University in Atlanta. While polio is spread through fecal matter, there were early hints that the coronavirus mostly spreads through the air; scientists initially weren’t even sure that it would show up in sewage.</p>



<p>On the same day in 2020 that the San Francisco Bay Area went on lockdown, Wolfe and colleagues at Stanford University, where she was based at the time, got a grant to find out. The team was soon spending hours driving around the Bay Area to collect sewage samples, “navigating lockdown rules” and negotiating special permissions to use lab space, she says.</p>



<p>“We were anxiously waiting to see if our first samples would show a positive result for SARS-CoV-2,” Wolfe says.</p>



<p>Not only did the sewage samples test positive, Wolfe and her colleagues found that coronavirus levels in the Bay Area’s <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c06191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wastewater followed the same trends as reported cases</a>, the team reported in December 2020 in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>. When case counts went up, more virus appeared in the sewage, and vice versa. Early projects in other parts of the country showed similar results.</p>



<p>More than three years later, data on reported cases have become much less reliable. Fewer people are seeking out lab-based PCR tests in favor of easier-to-access at-home tests — with results often not reported. Wastewater trends have become the best proxy to provide early warnings of potential new COVID-19 surges, such as the increased spread this summer, to health officials and the public alike.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opening the tracking floodgates</h4>



<p>In summer 2022, wastewater tracking got a new chance to prove itself. Mpox was rapidly spreading globally, including in the United States. But tests were limited, and the disease, which was spreading primarily through intimate contact between men, quickly drew social stigma, leading some people to hesitate in seeking medical care.</p>



<p>Within a few weeks of the start of the U.S. outbreak, Wolfe and her colleagues, as well as research teams at Biobot and other companies, had developed tests to identify mpox in sewage.</p>



<p>Just as scientists had seen with COVID-19, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2213882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpox trends in wastewater matched trends in official case numbers</a>. In California, wastewater results even suggested that the disease may have spread farther than data from doctors’ offices suggested, Wolfe and collaborators reported in February in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Like COVID-19, mpox doesn’t transmit through the water, but sewage testing still picked up the virus. The early results from that summer outbreak convinced some health officials that wastewater technology could be used for many diseases, no matter how they spread, Matus says.</p>

<p>Scientists are starting to find more and more infectious diseases that can be tracked in sewage. “Honestly, everything that we’ve tried so far has worked,” says Wolfe, who is now a principal investigator of <a href="https://wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WastewaterSCAN</a>, a national sewage testing project led by researchers at Stanford and Emory. The project team currently tests samples for six different viruses and is working on other tests that it can send out to the more than 150 sites in its monitoring network.</p>



<p>Through an informal literature <a href="https://biobot.io/pathogen-biomarkers-in-wastewater-stool-and-urine-nearly-endless-opportunities-for-the-future-of-wbe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of pathogens important for public health</a>, scientists at Biobot found that previous research had identified 76 out of 80 of them in wastewater, stool or urine, suggesting that those pathogens could be monitored through sewage. The list ranges from the chicken pox virus to the microbes that cause sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia to the tickborne bacteria that cause Lyme disease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Finding focus</h4>



<p>With this much opportunity, the question on many researchers’ minds is not, “What <em>can</em> we test for?” but “What <em>should</em> we test for?”</p>



<p>In January, a report put out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine came up with <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26767/wastewater-based-disease-surveillance-for-public-health-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three criteria</a>. The pathogen should threaten public health. It should be detectable in wastewater. And it should generate data that public health agencies can use to protect their communities.</p>



<p>Given all the threats and hints of what can be found in wastewater, the first two criteria don’t narrow the field too much. So for now, researchers are taking cues from state and local public health officials on which pathogens to prioritize.</p>



<p>Biobot is working on tests for common diseases like the flu, RSV, hepatitis C and gonorrhea. And the CDC has its eye on some of the same common pathogens, as well as strategies for tracking antimicrobial resistance, a threat that has increased during the pandemic as health systems have been under strain.</p>



<p>Even if they choose the perfect targets, though, researchers also have to figure out how to generate useful data. For now, that’s a sticking point.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to use the data</h4>



<p>Tracking pathogens is one thing. But determining how the results correspond to actual numbers of sick people is another, even in the case of COVID-19, where researchers now have years of detailed data. As a result, many public health officials aren’t yet ready to make policy decisions based on poop data.</p>



<p>In New York City over the last three years, for example, the local government has poured more than $1 million into <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/wastewater-can-predict-covid-19-surges-but-nycs-data-remains-hard-to-find" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing for COVID-19, mpox and polio in sewage</a> from the city’s water treatment plants. But the city’s health department hasn’t been using the resulting data to inform local COVID-19 safety measures, so it’s unclear what’s being done with the data.</p>

<p>Health officials are used to one swab per person, says Rachel Poretsky, a microbiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. She also heads wastewater monitoring for the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois.</p>



<p>Public health training relies on identifying individual sick people and tracing how they became ill. But in wastewater surveillance, one data point could represent thousands of sick people — and the data come from the environment, rather than from hospitals and health clinics. What to do next when positive results turn up isn’t as obvious.</p>



<p>Numbers collected from the health care system always represent patients, so a spike indicates a surge in cases. In the case of sewage data, however, environmental factors like weather, local industries and the coming and going of tourists also can create “weird outliers” that resist easy interpretation, Poretsky says. For instance, a massive rainstorm might dilute samples, or chemical runoff from a factory might interfere with a research team’s analytical methods.</p>



<p>Data interpretation only gets more complicated when scientists begin testing wastewater for an increasing number of health threats. Every pathogen’s data need to be interpreted differently.</p>



<p>With coronavirus data, for example, wastewater tests consistently come back positive, so interpreting the data is all about looking for trends: Are viral concentrations going up or down? How does the amount of virus present compare with the past? A spike in a particular location might signal a surge in the community that hasn’t yet been picked up by the health care system. The community might respond by boosting health resources, such as opening vaccine clinics, handing out free masks and at-home tests, or adding staff to local hospital emergency departments.</p>



<p>Mpox, on the other hand, has infected far fewer people, and positive tests have been rare after last summer’s outbreaks ended. Now, researchers are simply watching to see whether the virus is present or absent in a given sewershed.</p>



<p>“It’s more about having an early warning,” Matus says. If a sewershed suddenly tests positive for mpox after negative results for the last few months, health officials might alert local doctors and community organizations to look out for anyone with symptoms, aiming to identify any cases and prevent a potential outbreak.</p>



<p>Another complicated pathogen is <em>C. auris</em>, a fungus that has developed resistance to common drugs. It can spread rapidly in health care settings — and be detected in sewage. Researchers from Utah and Nevada reported in February in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases </em>that it was <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/2/22-1523_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible to track <em>C. auris</em> in the sewage</a> from areas experiencing outbreaks.</p>



<p>If hospitals or health officials could identify the presence of this fungus early, that information could guide public health actions to curb outbreaks, says Alessandro Rossi, a microbiologist at the Utah Public Health Laboratory in Salt Lake City. But interpreting the warnings isn’t as clear-cut for <em>C. auris</em> as for viruses.</p>



<p>The fungus can grow in sewage after it leaves health care facilities, Rossi says. The pathogen has “the potential to replicate, form biofilms and colonize a sewershed.” In other words, <em>C. auris</em> can create its own data interference, potentially making wastewater results seem worse than they really are.</p>

<p>As mpox spread in the United States in 2022, scientists tested wastewater samples at nine sites in California for the virus. At five of those sites, the virus was detected before or within a day of the first case being confirmed in that sewershed.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Moving wastewater into the future</h4>



<p>Most current testing programs are reactive. By looking at health threats one at a time using specific PCR tests, the programs mostly confirm that pathogens we already are worrying about are getting people sick.</p>



<p>But some scientists, like Wim Meijer, envision a future in which wastewater monitoring wades into the unknown and alerts us to unusual disease outbreaks. The microbiologist, of the University College Dublin, heads Ireland’s wastewater surveillance program. Ideally, in this ahead-of-the-curve future, after detecting something alarming in sewage, his team could closely collaborate with health officials to study the pathogen and, if necessary, start combating the threat.</p>



<p>One idea for turning the tech proactive is to prepare for new health threats that we can see coming. For example, Meijer and his colleagues are interested in screening Ireland’s sewage for the H5N1 bird flu, but they are not yet doing this testing.</p>



<p>Another approach takes advantage of genetic testing technology to look at<em> everything </em>in our waste. Kartik Chandran, an environmental engineer at Columbia University who has mapped sewers’ microbial ecosystems with this technique, describes it as “trying to shine the light more broadly” rather than looking where the light is already shining brightest.</p>



<p>Such an approach might identify new pathogens before sick people start going to the doctor’s office, potentially leading to an earlier public health response. But with health officials still unsure of how best to use wastewater data, much more basic research is needed first.</p>

<p>“People think wastewater surveillance is the answer to everything, and clearly that’s not true,” says Kirby, of the CDC, reflecting concerns from the state and local officials that she collaborates with at NWSS. Before diving ahead into proactive surveillance, Kirby and her colleagues are working to set up basic wastewater standards and protocols for health agencies. Priorities include evaluating how sewage trends correlate to cases for different pathogens and developing standards for how to use the data.</p>



<p>The wastewater surveillance field also needs to keep growing if the goal is to monitor and contribute to global health, with more sites contributing data and more scientists to analyze it. All of this work requires sustained funding.</p>



<p>The CDC’s program so far has been funded by COVID-era legislation and will run out of money in 2025. While wastewater surveillance is more cost-effective than other types of testing, it still requires a lot of resources. Washington’s state health department, for example, paid Biobot more than $500,000 for a one-year sewage testing contract, while the CDC has paid the company more than $23 million since 2020 for its work with NWSS.</p>



<p>For the last few years, wastewater surveillance has been a giant, messy group project. Scientists have collaborated across fields and locations, across private and public institutions, through Zoom calls and through poop samples shipped on ice. They’ve shown that waste might hold the key to a new way of tracking our collective health.</p>



<p>A lot of unanswered questions remain, and it could be some time before your local sewer can tell you exactly what disease risks you might be facing. But COVID-19 pushed thousands of experts to look into their toilets and start asking those questions. “Now, everyone’s a believer,” says Driver, of ASU. “Everyone’s doing the work.”</p>

<p><strong>Searching for superheavies</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chemistry-139"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 8, 1973</p>



<p>Physicists and chemists have been actively searching for superheavy elements, substances with atomic weights and numbers greater than the 105 [elements] now known. Results of two searches are reported … none were found…. Future searches will have to involve direct fusion of heavy nuclei by driving one against another in heavy-ion accelerators.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Particle accelerators have been crucial for creating superheavies beyond elements 104 and 105. Just a year later, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/element-106-takes-name-seaborgium">element 106, seaborgium</a>, emerged from collisions of oxygen ions and californium atoms — though its discovery wasn’t officially confirmed until two decades later (<em>SN: 3/19/94, p. 180</em>). Elements 107 through 118 have since made their debut, with several <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-elements-earn-permanent-seats-periodic-table">joining the periodic table</a> as recently as 2016. Scientists are now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-periodic-table-future-superheavy-elements">trying to create elements 119 and 120</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/19, p. 16</em>). Forming heavier elements and pushing known superheavyweights to their limits could reveal insights into the forces that bind atoms together and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5-ways-heaviest-element-periodic-table-really-bizarre">the bizarre chemistry of the most extreme elements</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-decode-rna-extinct-animal-tasmanian">For the first time, researchers decoded the RNA of an extinct animal</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, researchers have successfully extracted and decoded RNA from an extinct animal.</p>



<p>The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a wolflike marsupial that went extinct after the last one died in a zoo in Hobart, Tasmania in 1936. Now <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2023/07/18/gr.277663.123.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a roughly 130-year-old museum specimen has yielded bits of RNA</a>, the fragile molecules responsible for turning DNA’s genetic instructions into cellular functions, researchers report in the August <em>Genome Research</em>. The results shed new light on thylacine biology and may inform efforts to bring the marsupial back from extinction.</p>





<p>With dark stripes running over its tawny coat from its shoulders to its tail and jaws capable of opening more than 80 degrees, the thylacine (<em>Thylacinus cynocephalus</em>) was a striking animal. But the carnivores were no match for humans: As sheep farming proliferated in the 1800s in Tasmania — the home of the last remaining wild population of thylacine — the animals were frequently implicated in killing livestock. In the late 19th century, a bounty was established for every adult thylacine killed, and the animals were hunted nearly to extinction.</p>



<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers have mapped out the thylacine genetic blueprint,</a> in addition to the genomes of other extinct animals like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">woolly mammoth</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). But such investigations were all focused on DNA. Only RNA can reveal how an organism’s cells actually functioned, says Emilio Mármol-Sánchez, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “You see the real biology of the cell.”</p>



<p>In 2020, Mármol-Sánchez and colleagues came across a thylacine specimen in storage at the Natural History Museum in Stockholm. “It was just there in a cupboard,” says Mármol-Sánchez, then at Stockholm University and the Center for Paleogenetics in Stockholm.</p>



<p>The team collected six small samples of skin and muscle from the desiccated animal. Back in the laboratory, the researchers ground each sample into a powder and added chemicals that isolated nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA. Next, the team used a computer algorithm to compare those strings of nucleotides, or sequences, with a database containing the genomes of thousands of animals, plants, fungi, bacteria and viruses — including the thylacine.</p>



<p>The team concluded that roughly 70 percent of the RNA sequences they found were reliably thylacine, with some contamination from human RNA since the thylacine specimen was repeatedly handled.</p>



<p>Their analysis revealed different protein-coding RNA molecules in their skin and muscle samples. That makes sense, Mármol-Sánchez says. “Muscle cells and skin cells serve quite different functions in the body.” For instance, the researchers pinpointed RNA molecules that coded cells to make slow-twitch muscle fiber, which helps with endurance.</p>



<p>The team also found over 250 thylacine-specific short RNA molecules known as microRNAs. These RNA sequences regulate cell functioning, Mármol-Sánchez says. “They’re the policemen of the cell.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>These are impressive results, says Andrew Pask, a developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who was not involved in the research. Many researchers never even look for RNA, he says. “It’s much less stable than DNA.” And the findings are doubly impressive given that the specimen was stored at room temperature, Pask says, rather than in sterile or frozen conditions. (RNA has been previously extracted from samples <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/4/793/2741258?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of existing species preserved in alcohol or ice</a>.) “It’s transformed the way that we look at museum and archive specimens.”</p>



<p>In the not-too-distant-future, Pask and other researchers are hoping to bring thylacine back to Tasmania. <a href="https://tigrrlab.science.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their plan to de-extinct the animal</a> involves modifying the genes of one of the thylacine’s closest living relatives, another marsupial called a fat-tailed dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis crassicaudata</em>). These new findings could very well inform that effort, Pask says, by revealing genes that controlled the animal’s attributes. “It’s a whole other layer of information.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pink-diamonds-build-destroy-supercontinent">To form pink diamonds, build and destroy a supercontinent</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s largest source of natural diamonds — and of more than 90 percent of all natural pink diamonds found so far — may have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40904-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formed due to the breakup of Earth’s first supercontinent</a>, researchers report September 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The diamond-bearing rocks of the Argyle mine in Western Australia probably formed about 1.3 billion years ago, the analysis shows, along a rift zone that sundered the supercontinent Nuna. The finding suggests that exploring ancient rift zones for diamond troves may be more worthwhile than previously thought.</p>





<p>On Earth’s surface, carbon atoms tend to form soft, dull graphite. But down in the forge that is the upper mantle, extreme conditions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-rarest-diamonds-form-primordial-carbon-mantle">mold the element into hard, dense gemstones</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>). These diamonds can escape their chthonic womb by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbonation-brings-diamonds-surface">hitching a ride in rapidly ascending magmas</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/12</em>). Near the surface, the molten material solidifies as vertical tubes of volcanic rock, known as kimberlite pipes. Most diamonds are found in these formations.</p>



<p>But this classic story does not explain the Argyle formation, nor its pink diamonds. To make a diamond blush, something more powerful than mere mantle conditions must contort its sturdy crystal structure, altering how it absorbs and transmits light.</p>



<p>Another wrinkle lies in Argyle’s diamondiferous pipes. They are not kimberlite, but rather lamproite pipes, which are generally thought to form at shallower depths, says geologist Maya Kopylova of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Lamproites’ shallow origins may explain why they usually lack kimberlites’ rich diamond loads. The exception is Argyle — somehow, its lamproites raised treasures from the deep.</p>

<p>The oddities of the Argyle formation have long puzzled geologists. Chemical analyses conducted in the 1980s suggested it formed roughly 1.2 billion years ago. But that dating was questionable; the mineral that was analyzed may have been chemically altered by fluids in the Earth, potentially yielding a too-young age. What’s more, the results did little to clear up Argyle’s mysterious origins, says Hugo Olierook of Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “Nothing was really happening [geologically] in Australia at the time.”</p>



<p>So Olierook and colleagues dated resilient grains of the minerals apatite and zircon that fell into the lamproite when it was still molten. The researchers also analyzed titanite, a mineral that appears to have crystallized slightly later than the rest of the lamproite.</p>



<p>By measuring the quantities of radioactive elements and their decay products within each mineral, the team found that the lamproite formed about 1.3 billion years ago, roughly 100 million years earlier than previously suggested.</p>



<p>“When I first got the age, I thought, this doesn’t make any sense at all,” Olierook says. But while he was cycling home a couple of hours later, it clicked. “That’s when the first supercontinent was breaking up,” he says.</p>



<p>Argyle sits within an ancient continental suture, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">two plates once collided to form part of Nuna</a>, roughly 1.8 billion years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>). “It’s the smashing of those continents together; that’s what made those diamonds pink,” Olierook speculates.</p>





<p>About 500 million years later, when Nuna rifted apart, that suture split like a reopened wound. That may have opened conduits for lamproite magmas laden with rosy gems to rise through, Olierook says.</p>



<p>For decades, it has been thought that tectonic processes like rifting destroyed diamonds, Kopylova says. But this research supports a recent paradigm shift, she says. Rifting “might be a trigger to get diamonds from deep in the mantle to the surface.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, she says, it remains a mystery why Argyle’s lamproite pipes are the only ones known that contained minable quantities of diamonds. In late 2020, the diamond mine there stopped production after exhausting the diamonds that were economically feasible to extract.</p>



<p>It may be the case that more gem-studded lamproites are awaiting discovery, Olierook says. Perhaps somewhere, another Argyle lies hidden in the ruins of an ancient rift.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 16px">The 1967 Abortion Act also regulates conscientious objection in the UK, stating that individuals (including healthcare providers) may ‘object’ to participate in an abortion based on religious, moral, philosophical, ethical, or personal beliefs. </span>Current research mainly focuses on conscientious objection from an ethical, legal, or financial point of view and the perspectives of healthcare providers. In contrast, the impact of conscientious objection on service users and their abortion journey is understudied, although this aspect appears essential to estimate the real-world consequences of abortion policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The authors of this study created a platform for women and those who can become pregnant to share experiences and opinions on conscientious objection. They interviewed service users and assessed how the conscience clause impacted their reproductive rights or influenced their access to and experience of abortion in the UK.<br />
All interviewees were able to access legal abortion without significant delays, mostly via their GP and not via self-referral. Although some doctors adhered to the relevant guidelines, not all were transparent in communicating conscientious objection, failed to provide comprehensive information, or treated service users judgmentally. Overall, service users felt scared, angry, and hopeless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">These findings indicate that conscientious objection can work in practice even though more education and regulation that includes the missing voices in the conscientious objection debate are needed to improve doctors’ adherence to guidelines and ensure fair, impartial, non-judgemental care of all service users.</p>

<p>Low birth weight (LBW, &lt; 2500 g) infants are at higher risk for health complications and may require advanced neonatal care. Due to the limited provision of advanced neonatal care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), its strategic allocation becomes critical to improve health outcomes for LBW infants.</p>
<p>In these settings, predictive modeling can prove invaluable in identifying mothers at high risk of delivering LBW infants, enabling timely referrals to specialized care facilities.</p>
<p>This work tested five different predictive models to determine pregnancy characteristics associated with a greater probability of delivering LBW infants, using a large global registry, with enrolled pregnant women from several LMIC countries and research sites. Based on the obtained area under the curve (0.72), accuracy (61%), and recall (72%), the logistic regression model showed the best performance. All top-performing models identified clinical site, maternal weight, hypertensive disorders, severe antepartum hemorrhage, and antenatal care as critical factors for predicting LBW.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, predictive modeling proves effective in identifying high-risk pregnant women who may deliver LBW infants. This approach can be further developed into a clinical decision support tool to assist healthcare providers and enable timely referral of high-risk pregnant women before delivery.</p>
<p>Optimized referral and allocation could have substantial public health implications in LMICs by directing limited resources towards the most vulnerable infants, potentially reducing long-term morbidity and mortality rates in this population.</p>

<p>Breast cancer care inequities disproportionately affect minoritized groups of women in the US. Black women face 40 % higher breast cancer mortality rates than White women. Personalized risk assessment and tailored care are essential to reducing inequities in prevention and treatment, yet evidence suggests that Black and Hispanic women are less likely to access these services.<br />
This study focused on the Breast Cancer Personalized Risk Assessment, Education, and Prevention (B-PREP) program which helps individuals determine and understand their breast cancer risk, and informs on enhanced screening, risk-reducing therapies, and genetic testing.</p>
<p>In line with previous findings, this work revealed significant racial, ethnic, social, and linguistic inequities in access and referral to B-PREP. Black, Hispanic, non-English speaking, and publicly insured patients were less likely to be referred for breast cancer risk assessment than White or privately insured patients.<br />
The authors also conducted structured interviews with primary care clinicians to explore potential determinants of inequitable B-PREP referral patterns. Time and capacity limitations represented primary barriers leading to a lack of systematic approaches to address risk assessment and referral. Structural challenges, such as language barriers and socioeconomic factors, were also reported.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The evolutionary history of filter-feeding, a feeding strategy primarily known in whales, takes an intriguing turn with knowledge of the convergent evolution of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus nanchangensis</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a one-meter-long marine reptile from the Early Triassic. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The feeding strategy of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> remained long controversial, mostly because of the poorly preserved available skulls and the lack of gill slits of fish or the baleen of whales, the key structures that enable filter-feeding in fish and mammals.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zi-Chen Fang</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> et al.</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> aimed to resolve this controversy using two fossil specimens of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus nanchangensis,</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with a well-preserved dorsal view of the skull. From a comparison with skull reconstructions of modern animals, it emerges that the shape of the skull roof and snout of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus nanchangensis</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> highly converges with that of modern whales.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its snout exhibits a long intercrural space similar to the mesorostral groove in cetaceans, allowing </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to enlarge its buccal cavity, a vital requirement for effective filter feeding. These findings also suggest that </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> likely engaged in continuous ram filter feeding, like bowhead and right whales, swimming slowly with their mouth open. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This work challenges the notion that marine reptiles lacked the necessary adaptations for filter feeding and indicates that </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> might have acquired such adaptations within only 5 million years as a result of the rapid biotic recovery of complex marine ecosystems after the end-Permian mass extinction.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left">Individuals with complex care needs often must navigate a web of services from various providers, including hospitals, primary care, home care, and municipal care, which can lead to treatment disruptions and harm their well-being.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The Swedish healthcare project, known as Esther, is a successful example of addressing these challenges. Named after Esther&#8217;s story, the project champions a person-centered, holistic approach that prioritizes individual preferences and needs, redefining the care experience. Initially designed for older adults, Esther now caters to individuals of all ages with complex care needs. It has yielded significant outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations, increased home care availability, enhanced patient satisfaction, and trust in regional healthcare.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">To disclose staff experiences and lessons learned, the authors of this study conducted a retrospective longitudinal case study with a qualitative mixed-methods approach based on document analyses, interviews, and focus groups with staff members and patients. Their findings underscore the critical roles of co-production and person-centeredness in improving care. Esther&#8217;s persistence over two decades is attributed to the promotion of systems thinking, embracing change psychology, and multidisciplinary improvement dialogues. Key focus areas include incentives, work in practice, and integration sustained by trust in frontline staff and continuous senior management support. A continuous learning approach further promotes integration into daily practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The central question “What is best for Esther?” unifies people, flattens the hierarchy, and reminds all care providers why they need to improve together. This paper presents valuable knowledge on how to move mindsets that connect and improve the care of persons with complex care needs, thereby informing and guiding practice in other health and welfare contexts.</p>

<p>It was that rarest of things: a sliver of good news about climate change.</p>



<p>According to calculations published last year in <em>Nature</em>, our planet was keeping pace, and then some, with rising emissions from tropical forest clearance by gobbling up more and more atmospheric carbon. </p>



<p>“What we can mainly prove is that the worst nightmare scenarios of an impaired carbon sink have not yet materialised and that the news is not quite as bad,” Guido van der Werf, a professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/global-carbon-emissions-from-deforestation-reveal-surprisingly-stable-co2-uptake-by-land-and-oceans.htm">in a press release</a> at the time.</p>



<p>His coauthor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-van-wees-91258a214/">Dave van Wees</a> added:</p>



<span id="more-127886"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It may well be that some of the climate feedback loops that we are concerned about, such as the thawing of permafrost or more forest fires, are already making their mark but are being offset by other mechanisms. </p>

<p>But on Monday, <em>Nature</em> retracted the article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04376-4">New land-use-change emissions indicate a declining CO2 airborne fraction</a>.” It has been cited 20 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and was covered on at least <a href="https://climate-science.press/2022/04/02/climate-change-weekly-430-sec-abandons-mission-goes-woke-on-climate-change/">one climate-skeptic blog</a>.</p>



<p>Writing in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06605-4">retraction notice</a>, van der Werf and his colleagues acknowledged that their “statistical approach needs to be corrected and therefore accept a retraction as requested by the editor.&#8221;</p>



<p>We emailed van der Werf, van Wees and the paper’s first author, Margreet J. E. van Marle, for comments, but either did not hear back or received automatic replies stating they were unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction follows an editor&#8217;s note from December stating <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04376-4#change-history">the results were in question</a>, and a short communication from April by researchers in Denmark and the Netherlands who took <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05871-6">a fresh look</a> at the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A re-examination of the data using a variety of statistical tests finds no evidence of a trend on the whole sample and some evidence of a positive trend,&#8221; wrote <a href="https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mikkel-bennedsen(9dc89b5b-f447-4ae2-b6ef-e1b9838c280d).html">Mikkel Bennedsen</a> of Aarhus University, in Denmark, and his colleagues. In other words, a stable or growing fraction of anthropogenic emissions would remain in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>Bennedsen declined to comment for this article. According to the retraction notice, his team assisted van der Werf and his coauthors in revising their calculations, which will be re-submitted for publication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/exploring-deep-brain-stimulation-applications-challenges-and-alternatives">Exploring Deep Brain Stimulation: Applications, Challenges, and Alternatives</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the world's population grows at an unprecedented rate, we must cope with a significant increase in people suffering with various neurological disorders. This brings with it a range of challenges: from personal well-being to social dynamics, healthcare, and economic systems. Among the issues that arise, there is a substantial increase in mental health disorders, which can significantly impact an individual’s quality of life.  One potential avenue for treating various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). This relatively non-invasive technology can boost and coordinate the rhythmic activity of brain circuits, potentially preserving or even enhancing cognitive and mobility performance. </p>

<p><strong>DBS: How does it work? </strong></p>
<p>DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the placement of electrodes within specific brain regions. The electrodes are connected to a device called a pulse generator that sends electrical impulses to the brain. These impulses aim to modulate neural activity and restore more balanced brain function. </p>

<p><strong>Unveiling applications: How DBS can help patients</strong></p>
<p>DBS is used to treat various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Parkinson’s disease</em></strong><em>:</em> A study conducted by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University discovered that through the use of the well-established ‘bottom- up’ approach, (examining the fundamental components of a complex system and then building an understanding of the larger system based on this information), as opposed to the traditional ‘top-down’ approach, (beginning research with a broader      understanding before investigating specific components). This allowed them to define a more precise process of DBS for targeting Parkinson’s, which demonstrates greater symptom relief as well as long lasting effects. This breakthrough ultimately opens the potential for a breakthrough in Parkinson’s treatment. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Depression:</em></strong> DBS has been studied as a potential treatment for severe, treatment-resistant depression. In a study by researchers at the Ichan School of Medicine, DBS      was shown to have positive effects on participants that involved a gradual easing of depressive symptoms, as well as generally replacing negative outlooks with positivity. Their research ultimately concluded that DBS holds the potential to greatly impact the lives of people suffering from depression, however more research is needed to fully understand the safety, efficacy, and long-term effects. </li>
  <li><strong><em>OCD</em>:</strong> A study undertaken by researchers at the University of California demonstrated the potential modulation of OCD via DBS. They discovered that DBS holds promise as a potential treatment for OCD by modulating neural activity in particular brain regions, via disruption of the dysfunctional circuits responsible for obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. These effects accumulate over time, leading to improvements in OCD symptoms. The ongoing exploration of different implantation sites underscores the complexity of OCD and the potential for DBS to offer relief for      individuals who have not responded well to other interventions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Navigating challenges: What are the potential drawbacks? </strong> </p>
<p>While the potential of DBS is great, it comes with its fair share of challenges and considerations:</p><ol>
  <li><strong><em>Precision and targeting</em>:</strong> The precise placement of electrodes is crucial for  the success of DBS. Striking a delicate balance between accurate positioning and avoiding damage to surrounding brain tissue is a  considerable challenge.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Individual variability</em>:</strong> Responses to DBS can differ significantly from person to person, necessitating a tailored approach to optimise stimulation settings for each patient.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Long-term effects</em>:</strong> Ongoing research is delving into the long-term effects and safety of DBS. Questions about potential side effects and the impact of sustained electrical stimulation are still being explored. Additionally, there is no current evidence that DBS would work as a long-term treatment, as ongoing therapy may be invasive to everyday life. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Ethical and regulatory hurdles</em>:</strong> As DBS involves surgical procedures and device implantation, ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding patient consent, long-term monitoring, and potential risks are highlighted by researchers. Other ethical considerations include the resource intensity demanded from DBS procedure. In the current context of limited healthcare resources, the pros and cons of utilising substantial resources, such as the capital costs incurred and the need for a multidisciplinary team, must be considered.</li>

<p>Beyond DBS, several alternative treatments and interventions are transforming the field of brain health.</p><ol>
  <li><strong><em>Pharmacotherapy</em>:</strong> Medications continue to be a cornerstone of treatment for various      neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, for example the dopamine agonist ‘levodopa’ currently in use to help alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s. Ongoing research aims to develop more effective drugs and refine existing treatments. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Cognitive interventions</em>:</strong> Non-invasive techniques such as cognitive training and behavioural therapies focus on improving brain function through learning and adaptation, addressing cognitive deficits and mental health challenges. These methods are used to treat memory-related neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Neuromodulation techniques</em>:</strong> Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive approaches that have no surgical intervention. TMS has shown potential in alleviating symptoms of depression, as well as increasing general emotional wellbeing, whereas tDCS demonstrates improvement to cognitive functions such as memory and learning. </li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, DBS is a powerful instrument that can be used for both therapy and research of the pathophysiology of brain disorders. DBS has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, allowing for the process to become a familiar norm within the realm of neurological conditions. The field is still evolving every day, with many aspects of the process still to consider, however, the clear goal is to treat neurological disorders as safely and effectively as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clara-sousa-silva-exoplanets-biosignatures">Clara Sousa-Silva seeks molecular signatures of life in alien atmospheres</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask Clara Sousa-Silva about her research and she’ll be absolutely clear: Yes, she is looking for aliens. But she is <em>not</em> hunting them.</p>



<p>“The idea that I&#8217;m hunting anything, I find very distasteful,” she says. “I have spent my life … trying to let go of the notion that I have to go somewhere to know it, that I have to touch it to know it&#8217;s real.”</p>

<p>Sousa-Silva is a quantum astrochemist at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and an expert in knowing things from afar. Her research team studies how molecules in space interact with light, essential groundwork for scientists figuring out what the astronomical objects glimpsed through telescopes are made of. One day, she hopes her work will help identify traces of life in the atmospheres of worlds beyond Earth, including exoplanets — faraway worlds that humankind will almost certainly never visit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Molecules behave on a quantum level, and they interact with light on a quantum level,” Sousa-Silva says. “I’m using quantum behavior of molecules — so, chemistry — to study space.”</p>





<p>Though these quantum interactions play out on tiny scales, they leave traces in starlight’s spectrum — a chart of intensity at different wavelengths. Scientists can read spectra like a chemical bar code to identify the molecules the light encountered before reaching Earth. Each molecule contributes to the bar code, but scientists only know what those contributions look like for a handful of common molecules, says astronomer Adam Burgasser of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Figuring out how a molecule interacts with light is a “very detailed computational problem,” he says. “It literally occupies a whole graduate thesis just to study one of these.”</p>



<p>One of those theses has Sousa-Silva’s name on it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A possible sign of life on Venus?</h4>



<p>During her Ph.D. at University College London, Sousa-Silva simulated the light spectrum of phosphine — a simple molecule that she says is still her absolute favorite.  Phosphine is considered a potential biosignature because it’s easily made by life but considered unlikely to form on a lifeless, Earthlike planet.</p>



<p>“I know no one else who is so knowledgeable about one molecule — any molecule,” Burgasser says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Simulated phosphine spectrum</h4>



<p>With quantum chemistry and very powerful computers, Clara Sousa-Silva and colleagues have simulated the expected spectrum for the molecule phosphine at room temperature.</p>

<p>So when astronomers thought they might have detected the toxic gas in Venus’ atmosphere, they knew exactly who to call. A team including Sousa-Silva announced in 2020 that they’d detected phosphine in the atmosphere — which many, including Sousa-Silva, interpreted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">as a possible sign of life on the planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>).</p>





<p>The detection itself and its interpretation as a sign of life <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works">have since been called into question</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/20</em>), including by Sousa-Silva herself. But the announcement got scientists thinking more seriously about phosphine. Researchers have continued to debate what detecting phosphine might mean, on Venus or an exoplanet, and to understand possible abiotic sources of the gas. As interest in the molecule grew, Sousa-Silva’s deep expertise drew her into the spotlight and “really put her on the map,” Burgasser adds.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to talk about biosignatures</h4>



<p>While Sousa-Silva still spends much of her time puzzling out the individual spectra of molecules scientists might spot in space, she has plenty else on her agenda.</p>



<p>She thinks a lot about how scientists can identify molecules more reliably. One of her students is currently working on a new way to quantify how astronomers can be certain that they’ve detected a gas — any gas — in a planetary atmosphere based on spectral data.</p>



<p>She also wants to find better ways to talk with the public about the uncertainties that come with biosignatures. “There&#8217;s an expectation that if we find aliens, we&#8217;ll know — we’ll be so sure. And that is so deeply unlikely,” Sousa-Silva says. “I think we&#8217;re so unprepared to communicate that.”<br><br>And mentorship has a big place in Sousa-Silva’s packed calendar. While at MIT, she ran the Science Research Mentoring Program at MIT and Harvard, which pairs high school students with astrophysicists to do research for a year. It’s not the first time she has worked with high schoolers; before heading to MIT, she founded the ORBYTS science outreach program (which also pairs scientists with high schoolers), and taught science in London high schools.</p>



<p>Within her own lab, Sousa-Silva focuses on preparing her students to step up, train each other and carry on the multigenerational project of filling in the “missing spectra.” In the long term, she sees her students leading more and more research.</p>



<p>However, she does admit that she wouldn’t mind continuing to lead some “less respectable” science projects. For instance, there’s some evidence that will-o’-the-wisps — bobbing ghost lights from folklore — might be phosphine-powered fireballs.</p>



<p>She spent much of her early career “just trying to be taken seriously — I wouldn&#8217;t even say the word <em>alien</em>,&#8221; she says. “As a woman in science … I felt like I really couldn&#8217;t afford to lose any respectability.”</p>



<p>Things have changed. Alien hunting is still off the table. But, she says, “I really would like to do some ghost-busting.”</p>

<p>A prominent physician-scientist in South Korea may soon be facing his fourth retraction. Last month, <a href="https://yonsei.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/huinam-pak">Hui-Nam Pak</a> of Yonsei University was found guilty of duplicate publication, a form of academic misconduct, according to a report from the school&#8217;s committee on research integrity Retraction Watch has obtained.</p>



<p>Pak, a cardiologist, has had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Hui-Nam+Pak%22">dozens of papers flagged</a> on PubPeer. As we reported in February, journals pulled two of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/03/prominent-korean-heart-doctor-earns-two-retractions-in-a-month/">his papers</a> the previous month after a whistleblower pointed out problems with the articles. One was retracted for &#8220;a number of issues related to scientific misconduct,” while the other was a duplicate publication. A third paper by Pak was retracted years earlier after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/10/youve-been-duped-results-so-nice-the-journals-published-them-twice/">mistakenly being published twice</a> by the same journal.</p>



<p>Our February story triggered a flood of comments, many of them malicious. Some likened whistleblowing to &#8220;academic vandalism.&#8221; Others asserted that &#8220;whistleblowers deserve strong legal penalties&#8221; and that “immoral whistleblowers” seemed bent on ruining Pak&#8217;s &#8220;outstanding career.&#8221; Many comments were rejected for not adhering to our commenting policies, in particular making unsubstantiated claims.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/%EB%B3%B8%EC%A1%B0%EC%82%AC-%EA%B2%B0%EA%B3%BC%ED%86%B5%EB%B3%B4%EC%A0%9C%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%90.pdf">September 12 report from Yonsei University</a> (in Korean) explains that an &#8220;informant&#8221; reported two of Pak&#8217;s papers to the school&#8217;s Research Ethics Integrity Committee on March 7. </p>



<span id="more-127883"></span>



<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273(11)00477-3/fulltext#articleInformation">Impaired mobilization of bone marrow derived CD34 positive mononuclear cells is related to the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after radiofrequency catheter ablation</a>&#8221; was published online in 2011 in the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em>. According to a machine translation of Yonsei&#8217;s report, the article overlaps significantly with the paper &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/europace/article/11/8/1024/425545">Non-ischaemic titrated cardiac injury caused by radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation mobilizes CD34-positive mononuclear cells by non-stromal cell-derived factor-1α mechanism</a>,&#8221; published in 2009 in <em>EP Europace</em>.</p>



<p>The latter paper &#8220;is listed in the references of paper No. 1,&#8221; the report states, &#8220;but the research subjects of the two papers are the same, and the research results of the comparative paper are part of the research results of paper No. 1 … so it is a substantially similar work. Nevertheless, the [second paper] was recognized as a separate research achievement … so it was an unfair duplicate publication.&#8221;</p>



<p>We emailed the editor-in-chief of the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em> and Elsevier, its publisher, but did not immediately hear back.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The second paper reported to Yonsei University, “<a href="https://eymj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=406858&amp;code=0069YMJ&amp;vmode=FULL">eNOS3 Genetic Polymorphism Is Related to Post-Ablation Early Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation</a>,” was the one retracted in January due to scientific misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The informant claimed <a href="https://www.ellinorlab.org/team/patrick-t-ellinor-md-phd/">Patrick T. Ellinor</a>, a professor at Harvard Medical School, had been listed as a coauthor of that paper &#8220;even though he did not contribute to the research.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the committee found: &#8220;According to the explanation of the person under investigation, Professor Patrick T. Ellinor contributed to the research by presenting the research methodology and conducting a review of the research results, so it is difficult to say that the person under investigation committed research misconduct equivalent to unfair author indication.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neither Pak nor Ellinor responded to requests for comments.</p>



<p>The informant also alleged Pak might have doctored the data in the article. But those concerns &#8220;appear to be about simple errors in the research and scientific validity rather than issues of ethics, so it is difficult to say that the person under investigation committed research misconduct equivalent to forgery and falsification,&#8221; the report states.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s been only three years since we launched our first partnership models at PLOS. After adding five new journals to our portfolio in 2021, and introducing our Global Equity model to support regional equitable Open Access publishing, we saw explosive growth in our partnerships program and we&rsquo;re very excited to report that we&rsquo;re still growing!</p>



<p>Since our last <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">progress update</a>, we&rsquo;ve welcomed 107 new institutions to our program&ndash;including our first partners in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/05/plos-expands-footprint-in-europe-with-a-publishing-agreement-in-italy/">Italy </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/plos-announces-publishing-agreement-with-the-largest-research-institution-in-mexico/">Mexico</a>. As of today, we have nearly 300 partners across 28 countries, working alongside PLOS to reduce the burden of APCs on authors and eliminate barriers to Open Access publishing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="417" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21590" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png 800w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-300x156.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>



<p> Authors based in Research4Life countries also automatically publish in our journals at <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">reduced or no cost</a>.  </p>



<p><strong>Why are PLOS models different?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has always been a nonprofit, fully Open Access publisher working to ensure anyone can access, learn from, share and reuse rigorous, high-quality research. While our articles have always been open to everyone to read, lack of consistent funding for APCs has created a barrier for many researchers. In the wider industry, the dominance of pay-per-article models has increased pressure on academic volume output to generate profits, and created opportunities for exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to do things better.</p>



<p>Our models are designed to address critical challenges to inclusion in Open Access publishing that are a byproduct of the APC system: equitably distributing the cost of selective publishing, providing regionally equitable ways to ensure our inclusive journals represent researchers from all backgrounds; and streamlining the support system for libraries to reduce administrative burdens. All PLOS journals offer APC-alternatives through these partnerships, including our new launches <a href="https://plos.org/complex-systems-research-journal/?utm_id=408&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=407csy0623&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwjaWoBhAmEiwAXz8DBbnUOXtGnjGfcKJ5B8PjSFT__b_kpcYIn0mr3wcXOMLaEyJbNSf1ixoC0Y0QAvD_BwE"><em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> </a>and <em><a href="https://plos.org/mental-health-research-journal/">PLOS Mental Health</a></em> which will be supported by our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee Agreements</a> respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited by the enthusiasm we&rsquo;ve seen from the scholarly community for these models, and to have the opportunity to welcome so many new partners. Each new partnership is a step towards making Open Access publishing more equitable and inclusive. As we expand our portfolio this year, and continue to innovate on our models and services for both authors and their institutions, we hope to see this trend continue until cost is no longer a barrier for any author who wants to make their work open.<br></p>



<p><strong>Together, we&rsquo;re building the future of Open Access publishing</strong></p>



<p>Our work wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the support of the librarians who work with us now, and who we hope to work with in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To truly change the scholarly landscape, we need to work together on solutions that are sustainable for all stakeholders. Since we developed our first APC-alternative models in 2020, we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to improve our services, understand and support their needs so that the cost of Open Access publishing is managed more equitably and sustainably through effective partnership. Together we can rewrite the system.</p>



<p>Your feedback and support is what makes this growth possible. We want to thank all of our partners for their commitment to Open Access and support of their researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/catalog-human-cells-math-pattern">A catalog of all human cells reveals a mathematical pattern</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human body is made up of a complex community of trillions of cells of diverse shapes and sizes, all working together to keep you alive. The smallest of these cells, like platelets and red blood cells, are dwarfed by massive muscle cells. When it comes to size, it’s like comparing a shrew to a blue whale.</p>



<p>Now, after collecting data on all of the major types of cells in the body, researchers have revealed a familiar mathematical pattern in these cells’ relationship. There is an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303077120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inverse relationship between cell size and number</a>, meaning smaller cells are more numerous than larger cells. What’s more, cells of different size classes all have a similar total mass, such that small, numerous cells such as red blood cells contribute the same amount to the body’s total mass as the largest cells, the researchers report September 18 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“We see this pattern all over the place,” across disparate fields, says Ian Hatton, an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal.</p>



<p>The pattern between size and number “has lots of different names,” he says. In ecology, it’s often called the Sheldon spectrum after marine ecologist Raymond Sheldon. Sheldon and his colleagues discovered that when you <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.4319/lo.1972.17.3.0327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort plankton by size</a> in orders of magnitude on a logarithmic scale, each size class has the same mass of organisms. As you go up in size, the number of individuals in a class drops, but the overall mass is unchanged.</p>



<p>In 2021, Hatton and colleagues showed that the same pattern exists when you sort <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abh3732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biomass of ocean organisms generally</a> on a logarithmic scale, “from bacteria to whales,” not just plankton.</p>



<p>A parallel trend may also be seen in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-014-0585-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequency of words used in language</a>, where it’s known as Zipf’s law after linguist George Zipf. &nbsp;For example, if you analyze the words used in a book, you’ll find it dominated by a few, short, high-frequency words (like “the” and “of”) with many longer, low-frequency words (like “trombone” and “parliament”) making up the rest.</p>



<p>Finding this pattern in human cells took a <a href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colossal amount of data.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It might sound surprising that we still don&#8217;t understand cell size well,” says Evgeny Zatulovskiy, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study. The new study “provides a very comprehensive catalog of different cell types in our body regarding their counts and their size.”</p>



<p>Independent researcher Jeffery Shander first started assembling this data more than a decade ago. Much of it comes from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which has autopsied countless cadavers and weighed their organs to build a reference model of a person.</p>



<p>But “the ICRP focused on the male model,” Hatton says. He and his colleagues wanted to estimate information for a typical human female and child as well. That, along with the fact that the ICRP was focused on organs and tissues rather than cells, meant turning to the scientific literature.</p>



<p>In total, the researchers gathered data from more than 1,500 sources to show that the inverse size-number pattern is present in the cells of a typical man, woman and child. Overall, the researchers estimate that an adult male is made up of around 36 trillion cells, on average, while a female is composed of 28 trillion cells, and a 10-year-old child has 17 trillion cells.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bodys-bacteria-dont-outnumber-human-cells-so-much-after-all">estimates are similar to ones from prior studies</a>, including ones that looked at fewer cell and tissue types, because of the overwhelming presence of small blood cells (<em>SN: 1/8/16</em>).</p>





<p>It’s important to understand how many of each type of cell there is. For instance, the team found that the total number of lymphocytes in the body had been severely underestimated — instead of 500 billion, there may be as many as 2 trillion. “Lymphocytes are implicated in all sorts of defense against disease,” Hatton says, and understanding their total number is important for individuals with conditions like leukemia and HIV.  </p>



<p>What’s more, cell number is determined by cell division, a process that, when it goes haywire, leads to cancer. Understanding basic features of cells like size and number, Hatton says, “could help us understand abnormalities.”</p>



<p>Even though it’s been seen in language, ocean biomass and now human cells, the origins of the inverse size-number pattern are still a puzzle. But Hatton says its commonality “might be implying that there&#8217;s some deep, underlying mechanism that could be common to all these different things. But we&#8217;re not there yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-gyroscope-length-day-earth-physics">A laser gyroscope measured tiny variations in the lengths of days on Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some days really are longer than others. And now scientists know by precisely how much.</p>



<p>Using a laser gyroscope, scientists have measured variations in Earth’s rotation rate smaller than a millionth of a percent. The technique could help scientists understand the complex flows of water and air that cause the tiniest of tweaks to the planet’s spin.</p>



<p>Earth’s rotation isn’t perfectly steady. The planet speeds up and slows down as it twirls, making a day slightly shorter or longer by several milliseconds. Many of those variations are well understood. For example, one such variation is caused by tidal forces, created by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, that deform the planet. Scientists know how to predict those effects on Earth’s rotation. But other variations, caused by the fluctuating flows of Earth’s atmosphere and waters, are more difficult to estimate.</p>





<p>The gyroscope, known as “G” and located at the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell in Germany, is designed to measure those tiny effects. It’s what’s called a ring laser gyroscope. Within it, laser beams travel around a square-shaped ring that is 4 meters on each side. One beam circulates clockwise while another goes counterclockwise. Beams aligned with the direction of Earth’s rotation have their wavelength stretched out, while those traveling against it shrink. When combined, the two beams at slightly different wavelengths create a “beat” signal, just as two slightly out-of-tune notes do. That beat reveals the rate of Earth’s rotation, allowing G to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01286-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure the length of a day to better than a millisecond</a>, the researchers report September 18 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>.</p>



<p>Other methods for measuring the Earth’s rotation rate rely on outside references. For example, telescopes can use the locations of distant quasars — the bright cores of active galaxies — to determine how much Earth has rotated. But those techniques give results averaged over a day. G measures a rotation rate every few hours. And its measurements are made from an underground lab. No view of the outside world is needed, says physicist Ulrich Schreiber of the Technical University of Munich, “because a gyroscope measures rotation, absolute.” That is, it measures rotation not relative to some other reference but the rotation itself.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously measured Earth’s spin and tilt with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-underground-motion-sensor-germany-earth-rotation-spin-tilt">other laser gyroscopes</a>&nbsp; (<em>SN: 7/17/20</em>). But they haven’t measured the length of day to the high precision achieved by G. The gyroscope is also stable enough to operate for months on end, allowing researchers to tease out variations that occur on long timescales.</p>



<p>G’s capabilities are unique: “It is a measurement which was considered not possible with other detectors,” says physicist Angela Di Virgilio of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Pisa, Italy, who was not involved with the new study. “So it is good that they have obtained some results from this impressive instrument.”</p>



<p>Such measurements could help scientists refine their models of Earth’s air circulation and ocean currents. In the future, scientists hope to be able to measure even more elusive effects with improved ring laser gyroscopes. According to Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a rotating planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wobbling-orbit-pulsar-proves-einstein-right-again-relativity">drags spacetime along with it</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/20</em>). Ring laser gyroscopes might one day sense the twists and turns of spacetime.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/iStock-1352980421-3-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Brain-injured patients are more likely to develop respiratory disorders and vice versa because the brain and the lungs communicate through complex bi-directional pathways which are not yet fully understood. There is a need for increased knowledge of the neuroanatomical, humoral, immune and metabolic pathways that the brain and lung use to talk to each other. Therefore, <a class="is-external" href="https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</em></a> has launched a call for papers to bring together research on the mechanisms underlying crosstalk between the brain and the lungs as well as studies investigating the epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of lung disorders in brain-injured patients to create an open access resource for all those interested in the field.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Collection&#8217;s scope, read the opening <a href="https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-023-02484-7">editorial</a> written by the Guest Editors, which discusses recent advances, knowledge gaps and challenges faced by researchers investigating crosstalk between the brain and the lungs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">Interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (experiments)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (<strong>BTSP</strong>) is a form of <strong>single-shot learning</strong> observed in hippocampal place cells in mice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015,</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan3846">2017</a>). The idea is that post-synaptic activations (“<strong>eligibility traces</strong>”) are potentiated by a <strong>dendritic plateau potential/burst </strong>(“<strong>instructive signal</strong>”) that comes up to several seconds after the first signal. This result turned out to be one of the most reproducible findings of recent systems neuroscience, being replicable across labs and across stimulation protocols (via single-cell electrophysiology (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015</a>) but also via optogenetic induction (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1670">O’Hare et al., 2022</a>)). Many different labs are working in this interesting field, and here are a few recent papers on this topic.</p>



<p><strong>A role for CaMKII in BTSP</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.18.537377">Xiao et al. (2023)</a> from the Magee lab report on a “critical role for CaMKII” in BTSP. “CaMKII” is known as a promotor fragment that is specific for excitatory neurons, but CaMKII is more than that – CaMKII is a calcium-dependent kinase (but see the recent paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06465-y">Tullis et al. (2023)</a>) with important functions for plasticity. After phosphorylation, CaMKII remains in this activated state for several seconds and is therefore a candidate actor for BTSP, which acts on a timescale of several seconds as well. I learnt from this paper’s introduction that there is a CaMKII sensor based on FRET which revealed a shorter decay time for CaMKII’s phosphorylated state when it carried a specific mutation in CaMKII.</p>



<p>The authors take advantage of an established mouse line with this specific mutation, which resulted in deficits of memory and synaptic plasticity. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.18.537377">Xiao et al.</a> found, using in vivo patch clamp, that <strong>BTSP was prevented or reduced in these mutated mice </strong>(Fig. 3), suggesting an indeed critical role of CaMKII for the induction of BTSP.</p>



<p>As a side-finding, the authors describe that intrinsic burst propensities of CA1 neurons were quite different for mutants and wildtypes (unfortunately, they only show few example traces of such bursts), and they follow up on this result by characterizing the intrinsic properties in slices.<br />A question that came up and was partially addressed by the authors are the possible side-effects of chronically mutated CaMKII on the entire development and on other brain regions or also the hippocampus before the start of the experiment. However, the main finding of the manuscript (prevention of BTSP in CaMKII-mutated mice) seems to be solid despite these non-avoidable confounds. Of course, the study does not address how exactly CaMKII is involved in BTSP. The way to address this question will probably require using fluorescent reporters of CaMKII activity and very tedious dissection of molecular signaling pathways.</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring of place cell induction via BTSP with calcium imaging</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05378-6">Grienberger and Magee (2022)</a> conducted a simple and elegant study using calcium imaging that confirms and connects previous ideas on hippocampal plasticity and BTSP.<br />It had been known since a long time that hippocampal place cells are more abundant around more important locations, for example, reward locations. Here, the authors observe the transition from similar representation of all locations towards preferred representation of reward location using calcium imaging. They find evidence that this transition is induced by BTSP. To this end, they<strong> identify putative BTSP burst events in single neurons from calcium imaging data</strong> and track the activities of these neurons before and after such burst events. Moreover, they use optogenetics to show that <strong>input from entorhinal cortex (EC3) is required</strong> for the transformation of equal to reward-preferring representation of space. This finding is in line with the existing ideas about EC3 projections to provide the instructive signal that triggers bursts in apical dendrites and BTSP in CA1 neurons.</p>



<p>One of the most critical parts of this study is the identification of bursts to induce place fields using calcium imaging (in previous studies, this was usually done by in vivo whole-cell recordings). There is some uncertainty about the identification of these induction events (see the “CA1 place cell identification” subsection in the Methods section; check out a more recent preprint by the same lab, which uses much more complex criteria to detect BTSP events from calcium imaging; see the Methods subsection “BTSP Analysis” from &nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.01.526663">Vaidya et al. (2023)</a>). It would be very interesting to thoroughly study &#8211; for example with simultaneous calcium imaging and single-cell electrophysiology in vivo -, which calcium events correspond to BTSP/burst events and which calcium events correspond to “regular” spiking. However, this seems technically too challenging, and the more ad-hoc methods to identify such events in this study seem fully adequate for the question addressed. P.S. If you find this paper interesting, check out the publicly available reviewer reports.</p>



<p><strong>Voltage imaging of BTSP with optogenetic perturbations</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al. (2023)</a> use an impressive combination of voltage imaging and optogenetics techniques in vivo to study BTSP. Let me cite the abstract to give an idea about the methodological craziness of this study: “We combined genetically targeted <strong>voltage imaging</strong> with targeted <strong>optogenetic activation</strong> and <strong>silencing</strong> <strong>of pre- and post-synaptic</strong> neurons to study the mechanisms underlying hippocampal behavioral timescale plasticity.” Optogenetic induction of place cells in hippocampus has been done before, but not combined with voltage imaging. This together with simultaneous silencing of specific projections sounds like a completely crazy project. Several interesting findings: Excitability of pyramidal neurons (as measured with combined optogenetic activation and voltage imaging) did not increase upon BTSP. CA2/3 to CA1 inputs were potentiated upon BTSP (optogenetic activation of, although only contralateral, CA2/3 with a fiber during voltage imaging of CA1 neurons). And the activity of CA2/3 cells projecting to CA1 was required for BTSP (optogenetic silencing of projection-specific CA2/3 neurons while voltage imaging in CA1).</p>



<p>Overall, I would have loved to read more about these experiments and their interpretation.<br /><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05378-6">Grienberger and Magee (2022)</a> showed that (ipsilateral) EC3 input is necessary for BTSP, while <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al. (2023)</a> showed that (contralateral) CA2/3 input is required. The idea is that both CA2/3 (for the eligibility trace) and EC3 input (for the instructive signal) are required, and both results are consistent with the standard theory of BTSP. It is only a bit surprising that even the contralateral CA2/3 input, as reported by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al.</a> was sufficient. In their study, the contralateral side was inhibited to enable fiber placement at CA2/3 and voltage imaging in CA1. This must be kept in mind because the authors, to access CA1 with 1P voltage imaging, also removed the central part of the external capsule; I wonder whether this removed part of the corpus callosum does not contain some of these contralateral projections.</p>



<p><strong>A plasticity rule in cortex reminiscent of BTSP</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.29.547097">Caya-Bissonnette et al. (2023)</a> from Jean-Claude Béïque’s lab in Ottawa used slice physiology and modeling to show that <strong>a variant of BTSP exists in layer 5 pyramidal cells of cortex</strong> (S1) in mice. I have to admit that the often very long and complicated sentences in the Results section and the slightly overcrowded figures make it a tough paper to read, but it is worth it.</p>



<p>The authors use <strong>pre- and post-synaptic stimulation pairing paradigms</strong> as they were used extensively since the 1990s – but with the crucial difference that pre- and post-synaptic events were not separated by milliseconds but <strong>by 0.5-1.0&nbsp;s</strong>. Using this approach, they found a potentiation of synapses that did not depend on the temporal order of pre/post stimulation. Therefore, they call this plasticity rule “associative”. The authors furthermore show that the <strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong> (ER, reminiscent of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1670">O’Hare et al. (2022)</a>) and several related calcium signaling pathways are involved in the latent “eligibility trace” that holds the memory of first stimulation before the second stimulation arrives, by extending the decay time constant of calcium (Fig. 4). The decay time is not extended by much, but maybe this slight increase is enough to induce plasticity.</p>



<p>Altogether, this is a very interesting study focusing on slice physiology. On one side, this is a limitation since the paper claims to have found a cortical variant of hippocampal BTSP, an effect that was primarily convincing because it had been shown in behaving animals. Therefore, one should critically inspect the choices of the plasticity protocol. For example, I noticed that the authors used a 10&#215;20 Hz stimulation that seemed to me maybe a bit too strong and repetitive a stimulation and does not resemble typical BTSP events in vivo; moreover, during BTSP events, bursting and the associated plateau potentials were shown to be involved in the <em>post</em>-synaptic not the <em>pre</em>-synaptic cell in vivo (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015)</a>. Maybe I missed it, but I did not find this aspect discussed in the paper.</p>



<p>On the other side, the study is, despite this limitation, very interesting since it demonstrates how powerful slice physiology can be and how much we miss by only focusing on processes accessible in vivo. Moreover, it shows under which condition <strong>a classical STDP protocol can be transformed into a longer-timescale “BTSP”</strong> (Fig. 1F). To my knowledge, a plasticity rule with such long delays has not been convincingly demonstrated in cortex before, neither in slices nor in vivo. It may be a stretch to call the observed effect “BTSP”, drawing the analogy to the results seen in hippocampus in vivo, thereby gradually diluting the meaning of &#8220;BTSP&#8221;. However, this is just naming conventions &#8211; the science in the paper is interesting.</p>



<p>That’s it from my side about interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannibal-pirate-spiders-web-arachnid">Some cannibal pirate spiders trick their cousins into ‘walking the plank’</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Costa Rican pirate spider lives up to the family name: It tricks closely related orb weaver spiders into &#8220;walking the plank,” right to their doom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world’s many pirate spiders exploit a very particular food source — other spiders. But while most pirate spiders invade the webs of other arachnids, <em>Gelanor siquirres </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347223001665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dupes potential prey into building a web right into a trap</a>, researchers report in an upcoming <em>Animal Behaviour</em>.</p>



<p>Like any respectable pirate, pirate spiders have an extensive bag of tricks. Some species delicately strum the threads of other spiders’ webs to convince the arachnids they’ve caught an insect, only to strike when the web owner comes to collect its prey. Others mimic on a web the signature rhythms of a different spider’s courtship dance, luring would-be suitors to their deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>On a trip several years ago to a biological reserve in Costa Rica, researchers were the first to witness a hunt by a little-known species called <em>G. siquirres</em>. It cleverly exploits the way other spiders make their webs to get a meal, the team realized.</p>



<p>At nightfall in the steamy lowland rainforests of Costa Rica, orb weavers let loose “floating lines” — single strands of silk that blow in the breeze until the free end sticks on another surface, such as a tree branch. The orb weaver then scurries across to secure the second anchor point, and this first moored line serves as the foundation for the web.</p>



<p>But when&nbsp;<em>G. siquirres&nbsp;</em>strikes, the orb weaver does not scuttle across this bridge line to some welcoming vegetation. Instead, it walks into a trap; <em>G. siquirres </em>has already cast its own silk lines, not with the intention of building a web, but to intercept that of the orb weaver.</p>



<p>During their trip, arachnologist Laura Segura-Hernández and colleagues came upon a perplexing scene: An unusual configuration of multiple strands of silk converged at a single leaf. The group also noticed another spider’s floating line caught on one of those strands. Then, as the floating line’s owner — a juvenile orb weaver — scuttled across, a pirate spider emerged from behind its leaf hideout and crept down toward the intersection.</p>



<p>Probably feeling vibrations from the approaching pirate spider, the orb weaver attached a dragline — the arachnid’s version of a bungee cord — and flung itself off its bridge line. The pirate spider was close on its heels, pursuing from its own dragline.</p>



<p>“They’re hanging there, fighting,” says Segura-Hernández, who recently finished her Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. It was a dramatic scene, she says, like two swashbuckling pirates exchanging blows while swinging from the rigging. The encounter ended with a surprisingly swift attack from the pirate that instantly immobilized its prey.</p>



<p>The hunting strategy comes as a total surprise, says Gustavo Hormiga, a biologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who helped name and describe <em>G. siquirres </em>in 2016. Exploiting how other spiders build their webs is “actually pretty sophisticated,” he says. “I don’t know of anything like that in any [other] spider group.”</p>



<p>This new study helps bring <em>G. siquirres </em>to life<em>, </em>Hormiga says. Until now, the spider was known to science through only a dead specimen collected in 1994<em>.</em></p>



<p>The finding also underscores the need for old-school natural historians, Hormiga says, the kind of scientists who wander out at night with a head lamp to see what there is to find. “For many of us, this is really what brought us into science,” he says. “Not pipetting. Just being out there.”</p>

<p>The economist behind a controversial study showing attractive female students got lower grades after classes moved online during the pandemic has been acquitted of research misconduct, according to a report from his former institution.</p>



<p>But the researcher, Adrian Mehic, did not get off without reproof: Even if the work kept to the letter of the law, it may still have had &#8220;unethical consequences,&#8221; Erik Renström, vice-chancellor of Lund University in Sweden, wrote in the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/outcomeletter-1.pdf">June 8 report</a> (in Swedish).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2022.110782">the study</a>, a jury made up largely of final-year high schoolers rated the looks of university students based on pictures taken from social media accounts. The ratings were then linked to other publicly available data about the students, including academic performance. The findings, published in the journal <em>Economics Letters</em> in August 2022, made <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/teachers-discriminate-against-unattractive-females-remote-learning-study-suggests">headlines</a> <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/research-links-good-looks-good-grades-3970160">across</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11409063/Attractive-female-students-no-longer-earned-higher-grades-classes-moved-online-COVID-19.html">the</a> <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/attractive-female-students-lower-grades-online-classes-584450.html">globe</a>.</p>



<p>But the students had not consented to the research, nor were they informed about it. The revelation unleashed &#8220;<a href="https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2022-10-31/uppmarksammad-snygghetsstudie-skapar-kritikstorm-pa-universitetet">a storm of criticism at the university</a>,&#8221; according to local media.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127873"></span>



<p>Some study participants <a href="https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/studenters-utseende-bedomdes-i-studie/">expressed shock and discomfort</a> at having had their attractiveness rated without their knowledge. Others complained the raw data had not been properly anonymized, alleging they were able to identify themselves in <a href="https://www.lundagard.se/2022/11/01/snygghetsstudie-inte-anonym-student-identifierade-sig-sjalv-pa-tre-minuter/">just three minutes</a> giving them access to their beauty ratings.</p>



<p>In October, Mehic, then a PhD student at Lund University, was reported to the school&#8217;s ethics committee for &#8220;suspected deviation from good research practice,&#8221; according to the report. The charges focused on how Mehic collected and handled personal data and whether he should have obtained ethics approval for his study and consent from the participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do understand that beauty is a sometimes controversial topic,&#8221; Mehic, who is now an assistant professor at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm, told Retraction Watch by email. &#8220;However, the subjects have voluntarily decided to share their data online. This data may be used by others for certain purposes, including commercial (social media outlets are well-known to sell data to companies), or research.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lund University asked the national Ethics Review Appeals Board to decide whether the study would have needed ethics approval. In February, the board found the personal data collected in the study were not of such sensitive nature as to require such review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school also requested an external expert, Jane Reichel of Stockholm University, to review the case. She concluded in March that the study had not deviated from good research practice, was consistent with European <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">data-protection rules</a> and had followed the ethics standards of the journal that published the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The university decides that Adrian Mehic [and his supervisors] were not guilty of deviating from good research practice,&#8221; the report concluded.</p>



<p>The document does level some criticism against the researcher, however, noting that he could easily have notified the participants that he was conducting the study. Moreover, the report stated:</p>



<p><em><em>It may also reasonably be considered as an invasion of personal integrity to have one&#8217;s looks rated the way it was done in the study. The execution of the study might thereby have had unethical consequences even if the letter of the law has been followed. For this, the execution of the study deserves criticism.</em></em></p>



<p>Asked about this point, Mehic said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is a lot of research that can make people uncomfortable, e.g. animal studies. The Scandinavian countries also allow researchers to use detailed administrative data on income, debt, mental health, medicine use, and so on. Probably, not everyone is okay with this, but the public use of such data is enshrined in our Constitution (at least in Sweden). At the end of the day, it’s a question about balance between integrity and scientific progress.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Anders Ahlberg, director of graduate studies at the faculty of engineering at Lund University, was one of the people who reported the study to the school&#8217;s ethics committee. He told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I did find it interesting that the study was both acquitted and criticized. There seem to be some wiggle room between what is formally deemed unethical and what may be allowed but still is considered inappropriate.</p>



<p>My impression of the ruling is that there was less focus on the intent of the underlying philosophy behind the European code for research integrity (ALLEA norms concerning reliability, honesty, respect and accountability), and more focus on legal technicalities (various aspects and limitations of GDPR).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that he found it “strange” that photos and stored ratings of study participants&#8217; attractiveness are &#8220;not considered sensitive personal information or psychologically harmful (lack of respect). The students should have been asked for consent prior to the study.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to a June 14 press release from Lund University, the&nbsp;Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct has also <a href="https://www.lusem.lu.se/news/the-beauty-study-follow-up-and-closure">cleared the study</a> of &#8220;all the previous charges,&#8221; noting that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>An expert for the board has concluded that no mistakes have been made regarding, for example, the issue of consent, dissemination of information, respect for research subjects and data handling. All this together thus concludes that the research study by Adrian Mehic was done in a completely correct way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-detection-lasers-atoms">Scientists have two ways to spot gravitational waves. Here are some other ideas</a></h4>

              
                <p>Until recently, gravitational waves could have been a figment of Einstein’s imagination. Before they were detected, these ripples in spacetime existed only in the physicist’s general theory of relativity, as far as scientists knew.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have not one but two ways to detect the waves. And they’re on the hunt for more. The study of gravitational waves is booming, says astrophysicist Karan Jani of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “This is just remarkable. No field I can think of in fundamental physics has seen progress this fast.”</p>





<p>Just as light comes in a spectrum, or a variety of wavelengths, so do gravitational waves. Different wavelengths point to different types of cosmic origins and require different flavors of detectors.</p>



<p>Gravitational waves with wavelengths of a few thousand kilometers — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction?mode=magazine&amp;context=1679">those detected by LIGO</a> in the United States and its partners Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — come mostly from merging pairs of black holes 10 or so times the mass of the sun, or from collisions of dense cosmic nuggets called neutron stars (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). These detectors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-searching-sources-gravitational-waves">could also spot waves</a> from certain types of supernovas — exploding stars — and from rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>In contrast, immense ripples that span light-years are thought to be created by orbiting pairs of whopper black holes with masses billions of times that of the sun. In June, scientists reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">the first strong evidence for these types of waves</a> by turning the entire galaxy into a detector, watching how the waves tweaked the timing of regular blinks from pulsars scattered throughout the Milky Way (<em>SN: 6/28/23</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>With the equivalent of both small ripples and major tsunamis in hand, physicists now hope to plunge into a vast, cosmic ocean of gravitational waves of all sorts of sizes. These ripples could reveal new details about the secret lives of exotic objects such as black holes and unknown facets of the cosmos.</p>



<p>“There’s still a lot of gaps in our coverage of the gravitational wave spectrum,” says physicist Jason Hogan of Stanford University. But it makes sense to cover all the bases, he says. “Who knows what else we might find?”</p>



<p>This quest to capture the full complement of the universe’s gravitational waves could take observatories out into deep space or the moon, to the atomic realm and elsewhere.</p>



<p>Here’s a sampling of some of the frontiers scientists are eyeing in search of new types of waves.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go to deep space</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-022-00041-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laser Interferometer Space Antenna</a>, or LISA, sounds implausible at first. A trio of spacecraft, arranged in a triangle with 2.5-million-kilometer sides, would beam lasers to one another while cartwheeling in an orbit around the sun. But the European Space Agency mission, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/satellite-trio-will-hunt-gravitational-waves-space">planned for the mid-2030s</a>, is no mere fantasy (<em>SN: 6/20/17</em>). It is many scientists’ best hope for breaking into new realms of gravitational waves.</p>



<p>“LISA is a mind-blowing experiment,” says theoretical physicist Diego Blas Temiño of Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and&nbsp;Institut de Física d&#8217;Altes Energies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="526" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1.jpg" alt="Illustration showing three spacecraft connected by red lasers orbiting the sun. Colliding supermassive black holes in a distant galaxy also emit gravitational waves in the background." class="wp-image-3131203" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-495x383.jpg 495w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-582x450.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-240x186.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131203">The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, will be made up of a trio of spacecraft orbiting the sun (illustrated in foreground). LISA will observe gravitational waves from orbiting supermassive black holes in distant galaxies (illustrated in background).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131203">Simon Barke/University of Florida (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a gravitational wave passes by, LISA would detect the stretching and squeezing of the sides of the triangle, based on how the laser beams interfere with each other at the triangle’s corners. A proof-of-concept experiment with a single spacecraft, LISA Pathfinder, flew in 2015 and demonstrated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/space-based-probe-passes-tests-gravitational-wave-detection">the feasibility of the technique</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/16</em>).</p>



<p>Generally, to catch longer wavelengths of gravitational waves, you need a bigger detector. LISA would let scientists see wavelengths millions of kilometers long. That means LISA could detect orbiting black holes that would be enormous, but moderately so — millions of times the mass of the sun instead of billions.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go to the moon</h4>



<p>With NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis program</a> aiming at a return to the moon, scientists are looking to Earth’s neighbor for inspiration (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>). A proposed experiment called the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, or LILA, would put a gravitational wave detector on the moon.</p>



<p>Without the jostling of human activity and other earthly jitters, gravitational waves should be easier to pick out on the moon. “It’s almost like a spiritual quietness,” Jani says. “If you want to listen to the sounds of the universe, these is no place better in the solar system than our moon.”</p>



<p>Like LISA, LILA would have three stations beaming lasers in a triangle, though the sides of this one would be about 10 kilometers long. It could catch wavelengths tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers long. That would fill in a gap between the wavelengths measured by the space-based LISA and the Earth-based LIGO.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2.jpg" alt="An illustration shows three lasers in a triangle formation around a crateron the moon's surface." class="wp-image-3131204" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131204">The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, LILA, is a proposed gravitational wave detector on the moon.

<p>Because orbiting objects like black holes speed up as they get closer to merging, over time they emit gravitational waves with shorter and shorter wavelengths. That means LILA could watch black holes close in on one another during the weeks before they merge, giving scientists a heads-up that a collision is about to go down. Then, once the wavelengths get short enough, earthly observatories like LIGO would pick up the signal, catching the moment of impact.</p>



<p>A different moon-based option would use lunar laser ranging — a technique by which scientists measure the distance from Earth to the moon with lasers, thanks to reflectors placed on the moon’s surface during previous moon landings.</p>



<p>The method <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.064021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could detect waves</a> jostling the Earth and the moon, with wavelengths in between those seen by pulsar timing methods and LISA, Blas Temiño and a colleague reported in <em>Physical Review D </em>in 2022. But that technique would require improved reflectors on the moon — another reason to go back.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go atomic</h4>



<p>LISA, LIGO and other laser observatories measure the stretching and squeezing of gravitational waves by monitoring how laser beams interfere after traversing their detectors’ long arms. But a proposed technique goes a different route.</p>



<p>Rather than looking for slight changes in the lengths of detector arms as gravitational waves pass, this new technique keeps an eye on the distance between two clouds of atoms. The quantum properties of atoms mean that they act like waves that can interfere with themselves. If a gravitational wave passes through, it changes the distance between the atom clouds. Scientists can tease out that change in distance based on that quantum interference.</p>



<p>The technique could reveal gravitational waves with wavelengths between those detectable by LIGO and LISA, Hogan says. He’s part of an effort to build a prototype detector, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abf719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called MAGIS-100</a>, at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3.jpg" alt="Photo of part of the MAGIS-100 prototype" class="wp-image-3131205" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131205">A new type of gravitational wave detector could be based on clouds of atoms.

<p>Atom interferometers have never been used to measure gravitational waves, though they can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gravity-sensor-atoms-quantum-physics-underground">sense Earth’s gravity</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-gravity-experiment-atoms-general-relativity-einstein">test fundamental physics rules</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/22</em>; <em>SN: 10/28/20</em>). The idea is “totally futuristic,” Blas Temiño says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go back in time</h4>



<p>Another effort aims to pinpoint gravitational waves from the earliest moments of the universe. Such waves would have been produced during inflation, the moments after the Big Bang when the universe ballooned in size. These waves would have longer wavelengths than ever seen before — as long as 10<sup>21</sup> kilometers, or 1 sextillion kilometers.</p>



<p>But the hunt got off to a false start in 2014, when scientists with the BICEP2 experiment proclaimed the detection of gravitational waves imprinted in swirling patterns on the oldest light in the universe, the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-erases-evidence-gravity-wave-detection">claim was later overturned</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>An effort called <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMB-Stage 4</a> will continue the search, with plans for multiple new telescopes that would scour the universe’s oldest light for signs of the waves — this time, hopefully, without any missteps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="343" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4.jpg" alt="cosmic microwave background based on data from the Planck satellite" class="wp-image-3131206" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4-330x166.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131206">Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (data from the Planck satellite shown) could reveal gravitational waves stirred up just after the Big Bang.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131206">Planck Collaboration/ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go for the unknown</h4>



<p>For most types of gravitational waves that scientists have set their sights on, they know a bit about what to expect. Known objects — like black holes or neutron stars — can create those waves.</p>



<p>But for gravitational waves with the shortest wavelengths, perhaps just centimeters long, “the story is different,” says theoretical physicist Valerie Domcke of CERN near Geneva. “We have no known source … that would actually give us [these] gravitational waves of a large enough amplitude that we could realistically detect them.”</p>



<p>Still, physicists want to check if the tiny waves are out there. These ripples could be produced by violent events early in the universe’s history such as phase transitions, in which the cosmos converts from one state to another, akin to water condensing from steam into liquid. Another possibility is tiny, primordial black holes, too small to be formed by standard means, which might have been born in the early universe. Physics in these regimes is so poorly understood, “even looking for [gravitational waves] and not finding them would tell us something,” Domcke says.</p>



<p>These gravitational waves are so mysterious that their detection techniques are also up in the air. But the wavelengths are small enough that they could be seen with high-precision, laboratory-scale experiments, rather than enormous detectors.</p>



<p>Scientists might even be able to repurpose data from experiments designed with other goals in mind. When gravitational waves encounter electromagnetic fields, the ripples can behave in ways similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-light-axion-particle-search-event-horizon">hypothetical subatomic particles called axions</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/22</em>). So experiments searching for those particles <a></a>might also reveal mini gravitational waves.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The gamut of gravitational waves</h3>



<p>Gravitational waves come in a spectrum of shorter and longer wavelengths. Each wavelength range is generated by different sources. Pulsars and exploding stars, or supernovas, generate some short wavelength ripples. Other waves are produced by pairs of neutron stars, or by pairs of stellar mass black holes, with masses less than 100 times that of the sun. Still longer wavelengths are generated by pairs of supermassive black holes.</p>



<p>Different wavelengths can be spotted using different types of detectors, including ground-based detectors such as LIGO, space-based detectors such as LISA, and measurements of blips from dead stars called pulsars. Especially long wavelengths may be detected by studying the light released shortly after the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background. Other detector types (not pictured) could fill in the gaps.</p>

To provide context, the diagram also notes some key distances: Earth&#039;s diameter is 13,000 kilometers, the distance from Earth to the sun is 150 million kilometers, and the Milky Way&#039;s diameter is 992 quadrillion kilometers." decoding="async" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-510x450.jpg 510w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-434x383.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-211x186.jpg 211w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-657x580.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 680px" data-attachment-id="3131263" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev.jpg" data-orig-size="680,600" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-434x383.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline5_mobile_rev-510x450.jpg" /></picture><figcaption><span class="credit mobile-credit wp-credit-3131263">C.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A new view</h4>



<p>Catching gravitational waves is like paddling against the tide: tough going, but worth it for the scenic views. “Gravitational waves are really, really hard to detect,” Hogan says. It took decades of work before LIGO spotted its first swells, and the same is true of the pulsar timing technique. But astronomers immediately began reaping the rewards. “It’s a whole new view of the universe,” Hogan says.</p>



<p>Already, gravitational waves have helped <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">confirm Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a>, discover <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">a new class of black holes</a> of moderately sized masses and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">unmask the fireworks</a> that happen when two ultradense objects called neutron stars collide (<em>SN: 2/11/16; SN: 9/2/20; SN: 10/16/17</em>).</p>



<p>And it’s still early days for gravitational wave detection. Scientists can only guess at what future detectors will expose. “There’s way more to discover,” Hogan says. “It’s bound to be interesting.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063099951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Deepest Map</a><br><em>Laura Trethewey</em><br><em>Harper Wave, $32</em></p>



<p>In 2019, the multimillionaire and explorer Victor Vescovo made headlines when he became the first person to visit the deepest parts of all five of Earth’s oceans. But arguably the real star of the expedition was marine geologist Cassie Bongiovanni, the lead ocean mapper who ensured Vescovo piloted his submersible to the actual deepest depths.</p>



<p>Today, only 25 percent of the seafloor is well mapped. When Vescovo set out to score his record, the exact deepest location in each ocean was unknown. Bongiovanni, Vescovo and their crew had to chart these regions in detail before each dive.</p>





<p>“Traditionally, captains never cared about the seafloor as long as it stayed far enough away from the hulls of their ships,” journalist Laura Trethewey writes in <em>The Deepest Map</em>. The book explores humankind’s quest to map the seafloor, framed around Bongiovanni’s adventures.</p>



<p>Seafloor topography has been a big concern for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-how-military-funding-shaped-science-oceanography">militaries patrolling Neptunian frontiers with nuclear submarines</a> and companies facilitating intercontinental communication via subsea cables (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 28</em>). In recent decades, seafloor data have become crucial to the deep-sea mining industries searching for metals needed to produce green technology.</p>



<p>Satellites have revealed many of the knobs and crevices visible in the deep blue of Google Maps. But with that relatively coarse information, entire mountains can be missed. To see the seafloor in high resolution requires a sophisticated sonar system aboard a big ship that sends sound signals from the sea surface into the abyss. </p>



<p>Mappers like Bongiovanni calculate depth from the time it takes for the signal to travel down and bounce back to the surface. These state-of-the-art sonar systems transform “the satellite-predicted blur into a sharp three-dimensional terrain of ripples, cracks and tears in the seafloor,” Trethewey writes. “The seafloor is ‘heard,’ rather than seen.”</p>



<p>Through Trethewey’s tale, she twines stories of tagging along with scientists and ocean mappers. That includes her inaugural adventure at sea, which a crew member noted was “pretty rough for a first-timer,” as he and Trethewey clung to a doorframe in near gale force winds. On this cruise aboard research vessel E/V<em> Nautilus</em>, which was surveying a poorly mapped stretch of California’s coast, Trethewey (and readers) are introduced to the art and science of seafloor mapping. On this day, Trethewey learned that mapping is especially difficult — and sometimes impossible — when the ocean is angry.</p>



<p>Trethewey’s insightful writing helps readers understand just why mapping the ocean — even in shallow coastal waters — is crucial to so many endeavors. She visits a remote Inuit village on the western bank of Canada’s Hudson Bay, where she joins hunters who map ever-changing coastlines for their own safety. Later, she scuba dives with archaeologists in Florida who use underwater maps to explore remnants of early human history that have been submerged for thousands of years.</p>



<p>A distant, possibly unreachable goal envisions creating a complete map of the entire seafloor by the end of this decade, an effort known as <a href="https://seabed2030.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seabed 2030</a>. Because the oceans are vast and replete with remote and dangerous places that people simply can’t or shouldn’t go, this effort will almost certainly require autonomous surface vehicles armed with sonar. Such devices are already probing the depths and sending back data. </p>



<p>Staring at computer screens in a sun-filled conference room, Trethewey watches as a drone outfitted with cameras, environmental sensors and a sonar system maps a bit of seafloor off California as she sips her coffee. “The future of ocean mapping weirdly felt a lot like checking social media or doing anything else on your phone these days,” she wryly observes.</p>



<p>Trethewey’s book is about more than just mapping the oceans. It’s also about what can go wrong when explorers explore. It’s hard to read <em>The Deepest Map</em> without being reminded of the recent implosion of the Titan submersible in the North Atlantic that killed everyone on board in June. Indeed, Trethewey describes how, during Vescovo’s first solo dive, his colleagues endured 25 minutes of apprehension-turned-alarm when they didn’t hear from him.</p>



<p>She also reminds us how easily exploration can turn into exploitation. In the not-so-distant past, Europeans “discovered” the so-called New World and mapped it, Trethewey writes. Exploitation followed. Scientists and environmentalists alike are now concerned that a full, detailed map of the ocean floor might lead to the destruction of delicate, mostly unknown habitats if deep-sea miners are allowed to extract metals. </p>





<p>Trethewey envisions a different outcome. Seabed 2030’s mapping effort may help people see that “the weird, wonderful deep-sea world is not a blank space, another frontier to use up and throw away,” and should be safeguarded for scientists “to uncover our past and protect our future.”</p>

<p>In the midst of a tumultuous year, the journal <em>Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications</em>, a Sage title, is retracting 21 papers after an investigation identified signs of “compromised” peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">delisted</a> the journal from its Web of Science index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">in March</a> for failing to meet editorial quality criteria. Founding editor Biren Prasad, who managed the journal since 1992, also retired earlier this year, and the publisher took over management of peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s online presence also needs attention: Neither of the associate editors listed on its <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/CER">website</a> have been involved for many years, both told Retraction Watch – and one has threatened to sue the journal if she isn’t removed.</p>



<span id="more-127865"></span>



<p>The investigation that led to the 21 retractions began after Clarivate notified Sage about quality issues in multiple papers, a spokesperson for the publisher told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation “revealed peer review that didn’t meet the standards set by Sage for publication and the potential involvement of a paper mill,” the spokesperson said. More papers may be retracted as the investigation continues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions were announced in a single <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1063293X231200990">notice</a> posted on September 10. It stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage found that the peer-review process for these articles was compromised and contains indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>As the peer-review process has not met Sage’s expectations of high quality and ethical peer-review, the publisher cannot uphold the integrity of the research. In line with COPE guidelines and Sage policies, these articles are retracted.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The language of the notice is nearly identical to another notice about a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/21/sage-retracting-three-dozen-articles-for-compromised-peer-review/">batch of 37 retractions</a> from another Sage engineering journal in July, also for compromised peer review. The two sets of retractions are not related, the spokesperson said, but “both cases reflect wider issues we are facing as an industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the nearly two dozen papers retracted from <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>, only one had been flagged on PubPeer. “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1063293X211010542">An efficient approach for brain tumor detection and segmentation in MR brain images using random forest classifier</a>,” which appeared in 2021, contained “tortured phrases,” sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8474723A4A94F23D35F7F095835956#1">commented in 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such phrases “typically result from an attempt to avoid plagiarism detection using a paraphrasing software,” he wrote. For example, the authors used the phrases “amiable tumor” and “bogus positive” rather than the commonly used “benign tumor” and “false positive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Meenal Thayumanavan, listed as an associate professor at Kongunadu College of Engineering and Technology in India, did not respond to our request for comment on the retraction or PubPeer post.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to the two associate editors listed at the top of <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/CER">editorial board</a> for more information about what led to the retractions. Both told us they were no longer involved with the journal, and hadn’t been for many years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alice Agogino, an emeritus professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;ve asked many times years ago to be taken off the CERA editorial board. I have not been involved in this journal in over 2 decades. I do not review articles. I do not attend editorial board meetings, nor have I had any correspondence on this.</p>



<p>I just sent email threatening&nbsp; legal action if this is not changed soon on their website. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other people listed as editors are no longer involved as well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mark Fox, a professor of industrial engineering and computer science at the University of Toronto in Canada, said he was not aware he was listed as an associate editor of the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have had zero interaction with Concurrent Engineering for many years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Agogino said she had been involved with the journal when it began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>At the start of the journal I reviewed papers and helped define this new field. It had a legitimate start. As my research changed directions, I asked to step down.</p>

<p>Four other researchers Agogino knows who are also listed on the website told her they “had not been contacted in over a decade,” she said. “No editorial review meetings, nada.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked about the status of the website and editorial management of the journal, the Sage spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sage has been in contact with the Editorial Board with the intention of clarifying status and will be reflecting changes to the board on the website as soon as possible. Furthermore, we have now brought management of peer review for the journal in-house under the leadership of a new Managing Editor.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Prasad, listed as the founding editor on <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>’s website, told us he had retired earlier this year, but had managed the journal and owned the editorial rights since starting it in 1992.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stood by his management of the journal and its peer review process:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When I was managing the editorial office, I was very fair and honest in seeking independent reviews from at least 4-5 professional reviewers on each paper. In each and every paper, we sought out 4-5 independent reviews, (subject matters experts carefully),&nbsp; and only when I was satisfied that those (at least 4-5) returned reviews were genuine and professionally performed, I moved on to accept or reject each and every paper.</p>



<p>Since all those reviewers were independent reviewers (having the expertise in subject matters), who performed their written evaluations, I trusted them. Those 4-5 independent reviewers were randomly selected by me using SAGE Track Reviewers Database, I have no reasons to doubt any of the (reviewers) haven’t performed their professional duties fairly with great integrity.</p>



<p>As far as I could see, there was nothing wrong on our part in accurately and professionally processing those papers for CERA Journal? [sic] No compromises were ever made by me in my life-time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also mentioned a software tool called “the UADT system,” that Sage began using in 2022, which seems to have analyzed submissions and reviews for potentially suspicious activity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For instance, the UADT computer system generated results were mostly based on choice of non-institutional email-addresses used in correspondences (like Gmail or Yahoo email address) and IP addresses used during manuscript-submission time. It is reasonable to suspect such manuscript submissions perhaps may be belonging for [sic] a Paper Mills category, but rejecting all those submissions as unauthentic, at the outset, purely based on a set of partial users’ data (on authors and reviewers), I considered wrong and unprofessional.</p>



<p>As such, when I was managing the Journal, we further investigated and analyzed the UADT data manually to see if those reviews were professionally done or not and were genuine or fabricated. Only after ascertaining that the reviews were genuine and when there was no doubt about any collaborations between authors and reviewers, that might have taken place I accepted those papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was not involved in the investigation that led to the retractions, he said, and learned about them from our email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel sorry for the authors of those retracted papers,” he said. “As far as I could see, I have made no compromises in ensuring the professionalisms [sic] and carrying our [sic] my professional duties towards CERA to the best of my ability and knowledge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-complex-vocal-skills-problem-solvers">Birds with more complex vocal skills are better problem-solvers</a></h4>

              
                <p>By now, it’s no secret that the phrase “bird brain” should be a compliment, not an insult. Some of our feathered friends are capable of complex cognitive tasks, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">tool use</a> (<em>SN: 2/10/23</em>). Among the brainiest feats that birds are capable of is vocal learning, or the ability to learn to mimic sounds and use them to communicate. In birds, this leads to beautiful calls and songs; in humans, it leads to language.</p>



<p>The best avian vocal learners, such as crows and parrots, also tend to be considered the most intelligent birds. So it’s natural to think that the two traits could be linked. But studies with smart birds have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219300168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found conflicting evidence</a>. Although vocal learning may be linked with greater cognitive capacity in some species, the opposite relationship seems to hold true in others.</p>





<p>Now, a massive analysis of 214 birds from 23 species shows that there is indeed a link between <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh3428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal learning and at least one advanced cognitive ability</a> — problem-solving. The study, described in the Sept. 15 <em>Science,</em> is the first to analyze multiple bird species instead of just one.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Birds with more complex vocal skills are better at problem-solving | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI2-AfLzgJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">More than 200 birds from 23 species were given different cognitive tests to gauge their intelligence. One of the problem-solving tasks asked birds to pull a cork lid off a glass flask to access a tasty treat (bottom left). Comparing these tests with birds’ ability to learn songs and calls showed that the better vocal learners are also better at problem-solving.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To compare species, biologist Jean-Nicolas Audet of the Rockefeller University in New York City and colleagues had to devise a way to assess all the birds’ vocal learning and cognitive abilities.</p>



<p>For vocal learning, the team scoured the scientific literature to find how many songs and calls a particular species could learn, whether it could learn vocalizations throughout its life or just for a set developmental period and whether it could mimic other bird species. “Our novel way of measuring vocal complexity integrates those three features together,” Audet says.</p>



<p>The researchers next developed cognitive tests that could be adapted for different birds. A test built for a tiny house wren (<em>Troglodytes aedon</em>), for instance, might not work for a bulky mourning dove (<em>Zenaida macroura</em>). Audet and research assistant Mélanie Couture ultimately presented birds with seven cognitive tasks over six days.</p>



<p>Four of the tasks tested problem-solving ability. For example, one task involved pulling a cork lid off a flask to access food inside. The other three tasks assessed learning and self-control, other hallmarks of advanced cognition.</p>



<p>The team then analyzed whether the bird species with more complex vocal learning abilities, such as bigger song repertoires, mimicry and lifelong learning, also performed better on their intelligence tests.</p>



<p>Problem-solving, but not learning or self-control, is strongly associated with more complex vocal learning in birds, the researchers found. “The more advanced vocal learning ability, the more advanced problem-solving skills,” says study coauthor Erich Jarvis, a biologist at Rockefeller University.</p>



<p>Take the tufted titmouse (<em>Baeolophus bicolor</em>). This species learns around 63 vocalizations and can learn throughout its life. It completed the problem-solving tasks faster than the brown-headed cowbird (<em>M</em><em>olothrus ater</em>), which learns only about nine vocalizations within a set developmental window.</p>

Couture</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new finding is a “very convincing, positive result,” says William Searcy, a biologist at the University of Miami <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219300168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who studies birdsong</a>. Audet’s team also found a link between complex vocal learning, better problem-solving ability and bigger brains relative to body size. That could partially explain the result, Searcy says. A bigger brain is likely necessary to excel at both vocal learning and problem-solving.</p>



<p>The researchers saved the brains of some of the birds, so they next hope to search for the genes underlying the linked traits. That work could have implications for scientists’ understanding of how human language evolved. “There is a chance that we will discover genes related to problem-solving and vocal learning that are possibly also used in humans for those same behaviors,” Audet says.</p>
