<p><a href="https://geologia.ufpr.br/administracao/recuros-humanos/dr-carlos-conforti-ferreira-guedes/">Carlos Conforti Ferreira Guedes</a>, a geology professor at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil, came across a paper in the <em>Journal of South American Earth Sciences </em>earlier this year with irrelevant, and in some cases nonexistent, references.</p>



<p>Made-up citations can indicate the <a href="https://osf.io/5vknq">use of generative AI</a> in crafting the paper – but another detail caught his attention as particularly odd: The researchers on the paper, a study on the transformation of the Brazilian coastline, all listed affiliations in India. Guedes reached out to one of the editors-in-chief of the journal at the time, Andres Folguera, on March 10 to notify the journal about the issues. </p>



<p>As Guedes and his colleagues noted in a <a href="https://www.abequa.org.br/alerta-de-integridade-cientifica-referencias-inexistentes-em-artigo-sobre-a-costa-do-parana/">May 19 blog post</a> on the Brazilian Association for Quaternary Studies (ABEQUA) website, “there were no citations of work conducted in Brazil or by researchers who had previously worked in the region.”</p>



<span id="more-132986"></span>



<p>According to the August 3 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124003845?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>, the authors “were asked to comment upon the presence of these references in their work and acknowledged that the references were not correct.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vishnu.edu.in/my_profile.php?eid=VIT0611">Phani Babu K</a>, the corresponding author on the paper and assistant professor at Vishnu Institute of Technology in Bhimavaram, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981125004353">changed its editorial board</a>, which Monica Heilbron, one of the journal’s two editors-in-chief, told Guedes may have contributed to why it took five months to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guedes and his colleagues also looked at other articles in the journal for similar problems and found <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JSAES-Flagged-Papers.pdf">11 papers</a> with authorship issues, citation concerns and signs of potential data fabrication. He raised the concerns with the journal on August 6, according to emails we have seen. </p>



<p>Rebecca Clear, a communications director from Elsevier, confirmed <em>JSAES</em> “became aware of some concerns” and told us an investigation “is underway.” The editors-in-chief did not respond to our request for comment regarding the peer review process or post-publication spot checks.</p>



<p>Among those Guedes brought to the attention of the journal is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124002104?via%3Dihub">2024 paper</a> on urban sprawl in Vila Velha, a city in Brazil. The article has “existing citations that are unrelated to the text” and “nonsense regional references,” Guedes told us. The references include urban dynamics papers for Italy, India and Ethiopia, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guedes&nbsp; told us several of the papers show “invented geology” or “fabricated” data. He said two of the figures in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2024.105272">a January paper</a> — figures 4 and 3 — had “fabricated rainfall data.” He also pointed out a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124002116?via%3Dihub">September 2024 paper</a>, in which authors claimed João Pessoa, a city in Brazil, had experienced erosion and elevation gains of “tens of meters over a decade,” which he described as “unrealistic results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the authors on the papers were from universities in Saudi Arabia and India, including 14 from universities <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/10/bibliometrics-universities-publication-metrics-authorship/">researchers identified</a> this January for anomalous citation metrics, including King Saud University in Riyadh and King Khalid University in Abha, Saudi Arabia. Only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124005534?via%3Dihub">one paper</a> listed two researchers from the same university. And all except one list a researcher with affiliations at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, also in Riyadh and also on the list for anomalous metrics. There are 97 retracted papers in the Retraction Watch Database that include authors from that university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Clarivate’s Web of Science, <em>JSAES</em> has increased its annual article output in the last 10 years, publishing 149 papers in 2015 to a high of 692 in 2021 to more than 400 in the last three years. The journal has published over 300 articles so far this year.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/09/suicide-prevention-awareness-month/">Suicide Prevention Awareness Month </a></h4>

              
                <p>In a recent post on <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/09/29/the-death-of-the-lgbtq-suicide-prevention-line/?informz=1&amp;nbd=&amp;nbd_source=informz">Scholarly Kitchen</a>, three writers shared personal stories expressing concern over the White House&rsquo;s decision to eliminate federal funding for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline&rsquo;s LGBTQ+ youth services, effective on Wednesday.&nbsp; As a nonprofit organization committed to advancing open science and fostering inclusive, equitable access to knowledge, we applaud their efforts to bring attention to this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This specialized service has provided life-saving support to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people since its inception in 2022. Its closure comes at a time when LGBTQ+ youth face disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and mental health challenges, often exacerbated by discrimination, stigma, and lack of culturally competent care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We stand firmly behind the principles of openness, inclusion, and equity&mdash;values that are foundational to our mission. We believe that science and public health must serve all communities, especially those most vulnerable. The decision to defund LGBTQ+-specific crisis services undermines evidence-based public health policy and disregards the urgent needs of a population at elevated risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are committed to publishing and promoting research that informs compassionate, inclusive, and scientifically sound health interventions. Below is a list of studies from PLOS journals, specific to this topic, and a list of resources that LGBTQ+ people can access if they need help (these resources were mentioned in the Scholarly Kitchen post).&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on September 30, 2025</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a publishing agreement with Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), enabling its researchers to have unlimited publishing in all PLOS Journals. MAHE is participating in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/global-equity/">Global Equity</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/flat-fee/">Flat Fee</a> models that shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions. The publishing agreement runs through 2026.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Manipal Academy of Higher Education, recognized as an Institute of Eminence by the Government of India, is proud to partner with PLOS under an institutional agreement, which aligns seamlessly with our commitment to fostering open, accessible, and impactful research. This collaboration removes financial barriers of the paywall, allowing researchers across the globe to freely access the content published by MAHE researchers,&rdquo; said Dr. Santhosh KV, Open Access Coordinator, MAHE. &ldquo;As one of India&rsquo;s most prestigious academic institutions, we believe this step will significantly enhance the global visibility and reach of research emerging from MAHE and empower our scholars to contribute more robustly to the global scientific community.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are proud to partner with MAHE as they share our vision of realizing a more equitable and barrier-free form of publishing,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development &amp; Sales at PLOS. &ldquo;This agreement expands our footprint in India but, more importantly, helps to provide open science opportunities for researchers in the region.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are incredibly proud to announce an exclusive partnership with PLOS, a pioneer in open access publishing, bringing their innovative institutional models to India for the first time,&rdquo; said Sameer Puri, Founder &amp; CEO, SPUR Infosolutions. &ldquo;This partnership&rsquo;s first major initiative is an agreement with MAHE, fostering greater participation and collaboration by enabling them to share their work with the global research community.&nbsp;Our reach and comprehensive understanding of the Indian market, combined with PLOS&rsquo; commitment to open science, will create a powerful synergy that benefits India&rsquo;s entire research community. We look forward to bringing similar opportunities to more institutions across India.&rdquo;</p>



<p>MAHE joins SURF in the Netherlands, Jisc in the UK, NorthEast Research Libraries (NERL) and the Center for Research Libraries (CRL) in the USA, CRKN in Canada, Leibniz Information Center for Science and Technology (TIB) in Germany, Irish Research Library (IReL) in Ireland and Couperin in France in signing agreements with PLOS to facilitate open access publishing for their member institutions.</p>

<p>Eight papers by two emeritus researchers from Duke University have been retracted in recent months for alleged image duplications. Although the researchers had worked at the university for decades, Duke officials have not responded to repeated inquiries about the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers were published between 2004 and 2014 in <em>The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry</em> and <em>PLOS One.</em> According to the retraction statements, the articles contained images and figures that appeared similar or identical to others in the same paper or published elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two researchers, Salvatore Pizzo, a former chair of Duke’s Department of Pathology, and his colleague Uma Kant Misra, spent much of their careers studying prostate cancer.&nbsp; From 1993 to 2015, Pizzo and Misra published 70 papers together, with 26 where they are the only authors. Pizzo did not respond to repeated emails from Retraction Watch asking for comment. Misra <a href="https://www.poolefuneral.com/obituaries/Dr-Uma-Kant-Misra-Ph-D?obId=45480361">died Sept. 18</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132977"></span>



<p>Multiple emails and phone calls to members of the Duke media relations team and to research integrity staff over the course of five weeks have gone unanswered. Duke has been at the center of several misconduct cases that have resulted in, among other penalties, sanctions from the National Institutes of Health following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/22/nih-to-lift-duke-sanctions-stemming-from-misconduct/">revelations about misconduct in cancer trials</a>, a $112.5 million settlement in <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910871?form=fpf">a whistleblower lawsuit</a>, and a rare <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/31/feds-ban-ex-duke-lab-tech-from-funding-after-she-faked-data-linked-to-60-nih-grants/">permanent ban</a> from federal funding by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, commenters <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59082D6520B852EEBE23AFA834D825">noted</a> that several papers authored by Pizzo and Misra contained images or figures that appeared to be similar or identical to images used in other papers by the two scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry</em>, where five of the retracted articles appeared, told us the company was aware of the critiques and had “received numerous secondary concerns from third parties.” The articles, retracted July 15-16, all had image duplication issues. “In all instances, these image elements have been used to represent different experimental conditions,” three of the five notices stated.</p>



<p>The retracted Wiley papers are:</p>

</ul>



<p>&nbsp;<em>PLOS One </em>&nbsp;decided to retract three articles by the pair “due to unresolved image concerns that call into question the integrity and reliability of the reported results and conclusions,” Maria Zalm, senior editor of publication ethics at PLOS, told us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zalm said the journal’s investigation began after “multiple readers” brought concerns to the editors about images in the articles.</p>



<p>According to Zalm, Pizzo responded to early editorial communications related to the concerns, but he did not respond to the decision to retract the work. Misra did not respond to any of the journal’s communications, she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the three retracted articles, PLOS found problematic images in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098021">another article</a> by the two researchers, but decided that these concerns should be addressed with an editorial note rather than a full retraction. The publisher also performed an “initial assessment” of other articles by Pizzo and Misra and did not identify similar concerns.</p>

<p>Taylor &amp; Francis has threatened legal action against an online group that has made allegations, based largely on vague insinuations rather than evidence, about the publisher and a member of its research integrity team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group, <a href="https://scienceguardians.com/">ScienceGuardians</a>, is an anonymous organization whose website serves as what they call an online “journal club.” On X, it has been posting so-called “investigations” of several sleuths, publishers and organizations, what it calls “perpetrators of the PubPeer Network Mob.” Its targets have included sleuths <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1965472156869173461">Kevin Patrick</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1916204920329670817">Reese Richardson</a>, and others such as <em>Science </em>editor-in-chief <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1965804281761558759">Holden Thorp</a>, and its posts are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/wafik-el-deiry-nci-director-candidate-science-guardians-twitter-pubpeer-sleuths/">often amplified</a> by those whose work has been questioned on PubPeer or retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 7, the group published <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1964740406853185692">a string of claims</a> on X about Nick Wise, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">a sleuth</a> who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/">joined Taylor &amp; Francis</a> in January as a research integrity manager. The ScienceGuardians post characterized the move as Wise “infiltrated” the publisher’s research integrity office. The post states he is responsible for 1,300 posts on PubPeer (which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">we have noted</a> he does under <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=n.+h.+wise">his real name</a>), and, ScienceGuardians claims, more than 100 others under the name “Simnia avena.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132954"></span>



<p>“These inflammatory words suggest that something illegal or secret has occurred, although it seems more likely that T&amp;F hired Nick because of his sleuthing experience,” said sleuth Elisabeth Bik, who has also been <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1945513864142946338">called out</a> by ScienceGuardians. “They also accuse Nick and other sleuths of using &#8216;fake accounts&#8217; on PubPeer, even though many of us sleuths might use or have used pseudonyms out of fear of being sued. It is not a crime or fraud to use a pseudonym. In fact, ScienceGuardians are hiding behind one as well.”</p>



<p>On September 8, the group sent a “formal notice” to Taylor &amp; Francis, which they <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/formal-notice-regarding-conflicts">also posted on Substack</a>, to the attention of Laura Wilson, head of research integrity and ethics, and Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics and integrity. Among its “material concerns,” the letter cites “conflicts of interest,” referencing Wise’s PubPeer posts, and whether he “disclosed his PubPeer activity” to the publisher. They also cite “collaboration with external actors,” referencing an exchange on Bluesky between Wise and Bik. The letter was signed by “Elias Verum, on behalf of ScienceGuardians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alam responded 10 days later in an email, the text of which ScienceGuardians posted online. “Your email and social media posts include several significant allegations about a particular individual at Taylor &amp; Francis,” Alam wrote. The integrity team “committed to upholding the highest standards of research integrity and publishing ethics, as well as identifying and preventing unethical practices.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis takes such allegations very seriously. However, we note that you have not provided any evidence to support these allegations. If you have evidence to verify your claims, please share this with us and we will investigate accordingly. If you do not have such evidence, the substance of your email and social media posts are serious and highly defamatory, and have been disseminated by you to more than 3000 followers on the social media platform X. If you cannot substantiate these claims, then we insist that you retract these claims immediately.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>If you continue to make these serious allegations without providing evidence of same, then we will have no choice but to refer this matter to our legal department and consider pursuing legal action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the publisher verified the correspondence reproduced in the posts as accurate but did not respond to further questions regarding the matter. Wise did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ScienceGuardians has sent <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/taylor-and-francis-under-notice-their">two</a> <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/taylor-and-francis-formal-notice">subsequent</a> replies to the publisher for what it deems “extremely significant concerns.”</p>



<p>In its response on September 20, ScienceGuardians repeated and linked to the allegations they posted on X, calling them “specific, archived evidence that supports the material concerns set out in our notice.” They continued, “For clarity, your threat of legal action does not relieve Taylor &amp; Francis of its duty of care to the academic community.”</p>



<p>In a second follow-up email sent September 22, ScienceGuardians requested Taylor &amp; Francis tell them whether Wise has access to the <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/what-we-do/strategic-areas/research-integrity/integrity-hub/">STM Integrity Hub</a>, and if so, what permissions, data access and activity he has carried out, among other details of integrity research and work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In past posts, the group has also singled out Retraction Watch, with <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1934331058272772585">claims</a> <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1964740406853185692">including</a> that this site is the “institutional-level predatory arm of the PubPeer Network Mob.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is disturbing that ScienceGuardians not only post their vague insinuations on X, but that they also send emails to the employers of &#8216;sleuths&#8217; in a clear attempt at defamation,” Bik told us. The account “uses accusatory language such as &#8216;malicious activities&#8217;, &#8216;entrapment&#8217;, &#8216;implicated&#8217;, and &#8216;exposing&#8217;, without actually showing any proof of fraudulent activities. “It is likely that these vague insinuations are costing the sleuths&#8217; employers a lot of time and headaches.”</p>

                <p>Today (September 25, 2025) arXiv login was down from about 12:00 to 15:00 EDT. This occurred due to a confluence of technical issues, the majority of which we have now fixed. Some of these technical issues have been plaguing the arXiv system for the past week, but we believe this current fix will allow for smooth and uninterrupted service for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>During the outage, only submissions, account maintenance (such as email or password changes) and Postscript downloads were affected. arxiv.org was still available to readers, and finding and viewing papers was not affected.</p>
<p>One of fixes we have implemented is the temporary suspension of the ability to download Postscript files. While this is a rarely used legacy feature, the excessive amount of requests from harvesting bots overwhelmed the feature, which also exacerbated inefficiencies in our ancient implementation. This feature is only temporarily suspended &#8211; as arXiv continues to update and modernize our technology systems, Postscript downloads will be restored when we are better able to support them efficiently.</p>
<p>We apologize for the interruption, and we will keep readers and authors updated as our development team implements fixes and updates to arxiv.org. As always, any outages, issues, or interruptions of service to arxiv.org will be promptly posted and updated on the <a href="https://status.arxiv.org/">arxiv.org Operational Status page</a>.</p>

<p><em>PLOS One</em> has retracted a paper linking vitamin D levels and COVID-19 morbidity three years after a critic flagged the data in the study as “deeply bizarre.” The authors objected to the retraction, with one calling it “outrageous” and pointing to flaws in the published notice.</p>



<p>The article, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069">which appeared</a> in February 2022, claimed people with low levels of vitamin D were at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and were more likely to die of the disease than other patients. It has been cited 65 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper had a “huge, immediate impact,” said <a href="https://gidmk.substack.com/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, a senior research fellow from the University of Wollongong in Australia, citing the fact that the paper had been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069#viewedHeader">viewed over 1 million times</a> within six weeks of being published. The article <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/24/paper-recommending-vitamin-d-for-covid-19-retracted-four-years-after-expression-of-concern/">join</a>s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/22/covid-19-vitamin-d-paper-retracted-by-springer-nature-journal/">others</a>, many also flagged by Meyerowitz-Katz, purporting to find links between vitamin D intake and COVID-19 severity that have been retracted or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/19/widely-shared-vitamin-d-covid-19-preprint-removed-from-lancet-server/">removed</a>.</p>

<p>In an April 2022 <a href="https://x.com/GidMK/status/1519084394840952832">thread on X, </a>Meyerowitz-Katz noted the study’s “MASSIVE effect, whereby virtually everyone who died” had vitamin D levels below the normal range, he wrote at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz also wrote that, while the paper had “no obvious signs of fakery,” the data were “deeply bizarre.” He noted all of the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the study also had hypertension, a trend not in itself unusual besides the complete overlap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study considered low vitamin D levels to be less than 20 ng/mL, and 15 people had a vitamin D level of exactly 10 ng/mL. Ten of those 15 died, a larger percentage than any other bracket. “This makes having a vitamin D of exactly 10ng/mL the most dangerous range seen in the study,” Meyerowitz-Katz wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331693">September 8 notice</a> cites a “fatal flaw” with the study design “which prevents testing of the hypothesis.” David Knutson, the head of communications at PLOS, told us the flaw refers to the fact the authors included only patients who had already been tested for vitamin D. The notice states the fact the patients had been previously assessed for vitamin D levels and that that level may have changed prior to COVID-19 infection may have introduced “confounding factors” or bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://medicine.biu.ac.il/en/node/1934">Eyal Sela</a>, director of the Otolaryngology Head &amp; Neck Surgery Department at Galilee University in Israel, and the senior author of the article, called the journal’s decision “outrageous.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We did the research during COVID, which put all of us in a position to examine any patient who entered the hospital without any selection,” he told Retraction Watch, maintaining patient selection was unbiased. The research was conducted in Sela’s lab at the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After <a href="https://x.com/PLOSONE/status/1519242110939144192">responding</a> to Meyerowitz-Katz’s posts on X, the journal asked a member of the editorial board and an independent statistical expert to reassess the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz had followed up with the journal in March 2023 and was told by Maddy Ghose, an editor at <em>PLOS One,</em> the journal was still investigating. He said he hasn’t heard anything since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for why the retraction ultimately took three years, “the case was delayed at different points for various reasons,” Knutson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">All but three of the study’s 18 authors disagreed with the retraction. The rest did not respond, the retraction notice states.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Author-Response-Edelstein-et-al._Redacted.pdf">An email to Retraction Watch</a> signed by three of the authors — Amiel Dror, Michael Edelstein and Orly Yakir, writing “on behalf of the authors” — says the possibility of “measurement and selection bias is there and acknowledged in the paper.” They also noted the patients’ vitamin D values the researchers used weren’t recorded as part of their study; instead, they included patients who both tested positive for COVID-19 and had existing prior levels available in the hospital database. </p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amieldror/?originalSubdomain=ca">Dror</a> — the study’s corresponding author — and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Orly-Yakir-2135798680">Yakir</a> are researchers at Galilee University, and <a href="https://medicine.biu.ac.il/en/Edelstein#:~:text=Prof.,Michael%20Edelstein&amp;text=Professor%20Michael%20Edelstein%20is%20a,infectious%20disease%20and%20vaccine%20epidemiology.">Edelstein</a> is a professor of public health and epidemiology at Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because of these limitations we were very cautious regarding claims of causation, and we also explicitly state that our findings should not be interpreted as evidence for using vitamin D therapeutically for COVID patients,” the authors told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice also mentions a delay in measurement of vitamin D and COVID-19 infection — anywhere from 14 to 730 days — which the authors said is “relatively short compared to other papers using a similar approach” but was mentioned in the study limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also pointed out what they considered errors in the retraction notice, including the statement “the analyses performed were inadequate to test the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels at the time of infection and severity of COVID-19 illness.” The authors told us in their email the “association tested is NOT about levels at the time of infection (since the acute infective process affects vit D levels) but PRE-infection- this is even in the title.”</p>



<p>The researchers continued their “offer to conduct additional analyses to check for the extent of were rejected as coming too late” and the retraction came &#8220;without a warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We think our results have been a useful addition to the literature, especially in the context of the acute phase of a pandemic,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz told us the reasons cited in the retraction notice “make little sense” to him as well and “are very straightforward limitations to the methodology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And yet, the journal has now retracted the paper for reasons that were immediately obvious on a quick perusal of the manuscript, three years too late,” he continued.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz has <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/this-questionable-study-caught-fire-in-anti-vaccine-circles-how-did-it-get-through-peer-review">flagged</a> several papers from the COVID-19 literature, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y">attempting</a> to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809">debunk</a> the controversial drug ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">By our count</a>, nearly 600 COVID-19 studies have been retracted so far, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/30/research-integrity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-book-excerpt/">bringing into question</a> how robust the publishing process was in the midst of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Correcting COVID-19 literature has been largely <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001572">slow and laborious</a>. A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/article/abs/retractions-of-covid19related-research-publications-during-and-after-the-pandemic/DB251754B6349E7E928CE71CD022A396">study published in April</a> in the<em> Cambridge University Press, </em>coauthored by Ferric Fang, who is on the board of <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a>, of our parent nonprofit organization, noted more than half of COVID-19 retractions “resulted from problems that could have been detected prior to publication.”&nbsp;</p>
