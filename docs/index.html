<p>Clarivate, the company that assigns journals Impact Factors, this year will not give four journals updated versions of the controversial metric used by many institutions and publications as a shorthand for quality. </p>



<p>The journals will remain indexed in Web of Science, but won’t have an Impact Factor for this year in Clarivate’s 2023 Journal Citation Reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Clarivate, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mtq"><em>Marketing Theory</em></a>, a SAGE title, has been suppressed for self-citation. Three other journals have been suppressed for citation stacking, sometimes referred to as “citation cartels” or “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">citation rings</a>.” The other journals are as follows: </p>



<span id="more-127390"></span>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dgsgenetika.org.rs/publications/"><em>Genetika</em></a> (the Serbian Genetics Society)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.isisn.org/Bioscience_Research.htm"><em>Bioscience Research</em></a><em> </em>(Innovative Scientific Information &amp; Services Network)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/toc/jbibn/current"><em>Bioinspired, Biomimetic, and Nanobiomaterials</em></a> (ICE Publishing)</li>
</ul>



<p>Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, told Retraction Watch that Clarivate’s decision not to give <em>Genetika</em> an Impact Factor this year was “truly devastating.” Milasin also disputed that the journal had participated in a citation stacking scheme:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We tried to explain to the Clarivate staff that we were absolutely unaware of the situation with the citations and that Genetika did not have any kind of relationship with the journal Bioscience Research nor with authors of cited and citing papers (we never heard of that journal). We neither had any influence on the editorial policy of the Bioscience Research journal nor the authors’ decision which papers to cite. Also, none of the papers published in Genetika in 2021 and 2022 cited any article from Bioscience Research.</p>



<p>So, basically, it seems to me quite unfair to be punished for something that was beyond our control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Milasin said that the suppression decision came in spite of the editors of <em>Genetika</em> offering to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, to blacklist authors who “misused the papers published in Genetika by citing them unjustifiably,” as well as the authors of the cited papers, and to no longer ask scientists identified as engaging in peer review misconduct to review for the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The listing for <em>Genetika</em> in Clarivate’s Master Journal List indicates that the publication is “On Hold,” meaning that “concerns have been raised about the quality of the content,” and Clarivate is reevaluating whether the title meets its <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">selection criteria</a> for inclusion in Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors and publishers of the other suppressed journals have not yet responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">suppressed three journals</a> for self-citation. In 2021, it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">suppressed 10</a>, and 33 the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">year before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Clarivate refreshed its Master Journal List in March, the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisted 50 journals</a> for failing to meet quality criteria, including 19 from the open-access publisher Hindawi. Delisted journals are no longer included on the Master Journal List or indexed in Web of Science, and Clarivate does not count their citations or assign them Impact Factors. All these changes can have negative effects for authors, because universities often use the metrics to judge researchers’ work for decisions about tenure and promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, later announced that it would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">close four of the journals</a> that had been delisted, as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">retract approximately 1,200 articles</a> for compromised peer review. The company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publication</a> of Hindawi special issues for three months ending in mid-January, and lost $9 million in revenue as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">published a list</a> of 82 journals Clarivate delisted in March, which also included those removed for production-related rather than editorial reasons, the company <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/building-trust-through-transparency-our-pledge-to-provide-more-clarity-around-web-of-science-journal-coverage/">announced</a> that it would publish the changes it makes to the Master Journal List each month, which it had not done before. No journals have been delisted this month.</p>



<p>This year’s Journal Citation Report includes 9,136 titles that have an Impact Factor for the first time, following Clarivate’s <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/clarivate-announces-changes-to-the-2023-journal-citation-reports-release/">decision</a> to expand the metric to journals in its Arts and Humanities Citation Index and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The company also is now publishing Impact Factors to one decimal place, rather than three. The move “introduces more ties, which will encourage users to consider additional indicators and descriptive data when comparing journals,” the company said in a press release.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flowers-pollinate-honeybees-low-seeds">Flowers pollinated by honeybees make lower-quality seeds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flowers pollinated by honeybees make fewer and lower-quality seeds than flowers visited by other pollinators.</p>



<p>That could be because honeybees spend more time buzzing between flowers of the same plant than other pollinators do. As a result, more of the plant’s own pollen is deposited back on itself, leading to more inbred seeds, researchers report June 28 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Honeybees command a lot of attention in insect conservation circles, in part because they are important for pollinating our food supply. But the findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing pollinators like wild, native bees, moths and butterflies in conservation efforts too, the researchers say.</p>





<p>For the study, ecologists Joshua Kohn and Dillon Travis, both of the University of California, San Diego, painstakingly tracked the pollination of flowers from three native plant species — white sage (<em>Salvia apiana</em>), black sage (<em>Salvia mellifera</em>) and <em>Phacelia distans — </em>in San Diego County<em>.</em></p>



<p>Often Travis sat for hours waiting for a single pollinator, honeybee or wild bee or otherwise, to come and go from a flower. Then he put a mesh bag on the flower and came back later to collect its seeds. He also collected the seeds of flowers he had cross- or self-pollinated by hand — also covered with a bag to prevent any new visitors.</p>



<p>Despite boasting over 650 native bee species, San Diego County’s most frequent flower visitor is the western honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>), which isn’t native, the researchers say. “Whatever native plants [are] blooming abundantly, they’re just dripping with honeybees,” Kohn says.</p>



<p>Back in the greenhouse, the team grew the seeds, analyzing characteristics that reflected their&nbsp; quality, such as how many seeds germinated and survived and how many leaves or flowers seedlings grew.</p>



<p>The white sage and <em>P. distans</em> plants produced roughly half the amount of seeds from flowers pollinated by honeybees compared with other pollinators, mostly native insects. And <em>P. distans</em> seeds from honeybee-pollinated plants grew into seedlings with fewer flowers. The black sage plants didn’t get enough non-honeybee visitors for comparison but did produce fewer seeds when pollinated by honeybees compared with cross-pollination by hand.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that honeybees visited about twice as many flowers on one plant before moving to the next than the average of other pollinators. That suggests the fewer, lower-quality seeds may arise because honeybees transfer more pollen between flowers of the same plant, resulting in more inbred seeds. Other pollinators more often flitted between different plants, probably transferring more diverse pollen.</p>



<p>The new finding is concerning, Travis says. Because of honeybees&#8217; methodical pollination habit, it’s likely the results are relevant to other plants. But it’s difficult to know how things will play out in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One potential consequence could be that native plant populations decline as subsequent generations become more inbred, reducing biodiversity. It would be illuminating to see how inbred plants fare after several generations, says Maria van Dyke, a pollinator ecologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>For now, this study is an example of why more conservation focus should be on native bees and other pollinators, which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-bees-pollinators-billion-yields-six-u-s-crops">vital to ecosystems and agriculture</a>, in addition to honeybees, van Dyke says. (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Honeybees, wild bees and many other insects are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/much-worlds-honey-now-contains-pesticides-harm-bees">threatened by pesticide use</a> and climate change (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It is time to actually shift our dependence for pollination from largely honeybees to … native species as well,” says Jaya Sravanthi Mokkapati, an entomologist at Penn State University. Growing native flowers is one way to support native pollinators, she says, as is adding nesting habitat — like twigs and decaying wood — to yards.</p>

<p>A neurology researcher in Australia is no longer employed at his former university in the midst of a research misconduct investigation, Retraction Watch has learned. And the work of a co-author at another institution also is being assessed for possible research misconduct after sleuths alerted the university to comments on PubPeer about potential data issues in his papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-014-9557-9">Changes in Cathepsin D and Beclin-1 mRNA and protein expression by the excitotoxin quinolinic acid in human astrocytes and neurons</a>,” was published in <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> in 2014 and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Gregory Konat, retracted the paper because several of the western blots appeared to be duplicated and he no longer had confidence in the results, according to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-023-01241-3">retraction notice</a>. The six authors are researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Macquarie University and St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127373"></span>



<p>All but one of them agreed with the retraction; first author <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/our-people/dr-nady-braidy">Nady Braidy</a>, a senior research fellow at UNSW’s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, did not respond to correspondence from the editor, according to the notice. The corresponding author, Gilles Guillemin, is no longer employed as a neuroscience professor at Macquarie University as the institution investigates some of his work, Retraction Watch has learned. Guillemin is a <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2009388">Member of the Order of Australia</a>.</p>



<p>Anonymous commenters on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/33ECDD6D3F1978854948927C58B5FA#1">first pointed out</a> potential data anomalies in the paper in September 2021. Two Australian researchers, <a href="https://neura.edu.au/researchers/prof-simon-gandevia">Simon Gandevia</a>, deputy director of NeuRA, and <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a>, an honorary research fellow and retired deputy director of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, contacted the editor of <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> to ask for an investigation into the paper in October 2021, citing the PubPeer comments. (Vaux is also on the board of directors of Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, the Center for Scientific Integrity.)</p>



<p>In March 2023, the journal’s publisher wrote back to Gandevia confirming that an investigation was underway by their in-house research integrity group. Three months later, the paper was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux says he became interested in the paper after reading a post about Guillemin on Leonid Schneider’s <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2021/09/07/none-of-the-work-has-not-been-done-in-my-lab/">blog</a>. By <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGuillemin%252c%2bGilles%2bJ">our count</a>, one of Guillemin’s papers has previously been retracted, and another marked with an expression of concern. Vaux noticed several papers that were flagged for potential data duplication <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Gilles+Guillemin">on PubPeer</a> were also co-authored with Braidy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don&#8217;t know which of the authors are responsible, whether it&#8217;s Braidy or whether it&#8217;s one of the other authors,” Vaux says. “We&#8217;re just ringing the alarm bell.”</p>



<p>This retraction is Braidy’s first. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9673782/">Two of his</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00134/full">publications</a> have been corrected, one has received an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263555">expression of concern</a>, and another is <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/10905/text/">under investigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I saw all of these postings about all of these papers,” Vaux says. “I thought well, given past history, it&#8217;s quite likely that the universities won&#8217;t take any action unless somebody makes an official complaint.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Gandevia &#8212; who has taken an <a href="http://retractions.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active interest in scientific integrity</a> &#8212; and Vaux alerted UNSW to the PubPeer comments about Braidy’s papers in September 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter to several university officials they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The evidence presented on PubPeer is very difficult to dismiss as the result of chance of innocent mistake, leaving the remaining explanation deliberate falsification or fabrication of data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2023, Vaux was told that the case was still in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/researchmisconductproc.pdf">preliminary assessment stage</a> – an assessment of whether the complaint constitutes a breach of the university’s code and requires further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He wrote to Attilla Brungs, UNSW’s vice chancellor, in March, alleging that the university’s handling of the case was not timely and constituted a breach of the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018">Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brungs wrote back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I do appreciate that this investigation is taking a significant amount of time, as warranted by its complexity. I would also like to highlight again for you that UNSW has a far more extensive and rigorous preliminary assessment process that perhaps some other institutions do not have. This allows UNSW to generally ensure more efficient outcomes in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we emailed Brungs to follow up on the case, a spokesperson for UNSW responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>UNSW Sydney is aware of the concerns, and we are managing these concerns in accordance with our Research Misconduct Procedure. It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I think the problem is that the university&#8217;s office for handling research misconduct allegations is not competent,” Vaux said.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In September 2021, Vaux also forwarded the PubPeer comments on Guillemin’s papers to the research integrity office at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, Macquarie University’s director of research ethics and integrity wrote to Vaux that their preliminary assessment had found ten of Guillemin’s papers had a potential breach of the university’s research code, and that four of them required further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for the university wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Macquarie University is aware of the concerns, and they are being managed in accordance with the University&#8217;s Research Code Procedure. We note that Professor Gilles Guillemin has ceased employment at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have not received confirmation of when or why Guillemin left Macquarie. According to the spokesperson, “it is not the University&#8217;s place to disclose that information.” But since we started reporting this story on June 14, the webpage for Guillemin’s lab is now <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research/our-people2/genetics">no longer accessible</a> and has been removed from the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research">website</a> of Macquarie University’s Centre for Motor Neuron Disease Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Braidy and Guillemin did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities in Australia self-regulate cases of research misconduct. Vaux says the <a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-an-office-for-research-integrity-to-catch-up-with-the-rest-of-the-world-176019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of a national office for research integrity</a> makes this process inefficient. “Australia should be embarrassed because we&#8217;re behind, falling further behind the rest of the world,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">Megalodon sharks may have become megapredators by running hot</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massive, megatoothed <em>Otodus megalodon</em> ran hot — the ancient shark was at least somewhat warm-blooded, new evidence shows.</p>



<p>Chemical measurements from fossil <em>O. megalodon</em> teeth suggest <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2218153120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sharks had higher body temperatures than their surrounding waters</a>, researchers report June 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Analyses of carbon and oxygen in the teeth of these and other sharks, both living and extinct, revealed that the giant shark’s body temperature was about 7 degrees Celsius warmer than estimated seawater temperatures at the time.</p>





<p>That warm-bloodedness may have been a double-edged sword. The trait may have helped <em>O. megalodon</em> become a swift, fearsome apex predator and grow up to 20 meters long, making it among the largest carnivores to ever live on Earth. But the shark’s voracious appetite may have also spelled the species’ ultimate doom. Gigantism has a high metabolic cost, says UCLA marine biogeochemist Robert Eagle: Bigger bodies require more food, and the massive sharks may have been particularly vulnerable to extinction when the climate changed and food became scarcer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mammals are well known for being able to metabolically elevate and maintain their body heat, even in colder environments, a trait called endothermy. But some fish lineages, both living and extinct, are capable of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-marine-reptiles-losing-their-cool">regional endothermy</a>, maintaining some body parts at higher temperatures than the surrounding water (<em>SN: 6/10/10</em>). For example, many modern lamniform sharks — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">the group that includes species like mako and great white sharks</a> — have this ability (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>).</p>



<p>“Indeed, regional endothermy is one of just two known evolutionary pathways toward giant sizes in sharks,” says Jack Cooper, a paleobiologist at Swansea University in Wales who was not involved in the new study. (The other, Cooper says, is filter feeding, employed by gentler giants such as whale sharks.)</p>



<p>Scientists have long thought that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">megalodon was regionally endothermic</a>, Eagle says, based on a variety of evidence such as estimates of the megashark’s body shape, as well as its likely swimming speeds and energy requirements. The shark was also known to have a very large geographic range around the globe, actively hunting in colder as well as warmer waters, which argues for some warm-bloodedness. A recent study by Cooper and colleagues that modeled the shark’s body in 3-D estimated that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adult <em>O. megalodon</em> was a transoceanic superpredator</a>, able to swim faster than any living shark species and fully consume prey the size of today’s largest predators.</p>



<p>The question, Eagle adds, isn’t really whether <em>O. megalodon</em> was endothermic — it’s <em>how</em> endothermic it was. In particular, the team wondered how its body temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-megatooth-sharks-food-chain-apex-predator-ocean">compared to one of its primary ocean competitors</a>, which appeared on the scene late in the shark’s reign: <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, better known as the great white shark (<em>SN: 6/29/22</em>).</p>



<p><em>O. megalodon</em> appeared around 23 million years ago and went extinct sometime between 3.5 million and 2.6 million years ago. Great white sharks emerged around 3.5 million years ago, and they competed for food with their massive cousins. One hypothesis has been that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">this competition helped drive <em>O. megalodon</em> to extinction</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/22</em>). Climate change during the Pliocene Epoch, which spanned 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, led to a collapse in the population of marine mammals, the primary food source for both sharks.</p>



<p>“The <em>Carcharodon</em> were much smaller … and persisted, whereas the <em>Otodus</em> went extinct,” Eagle says. “<em>Carcharodon</em> probably had a lower requirement for food to maintain its metabolic rate.”</p>



<p>To get more direct evidence of the body temperatures of these shark species, and therefore better understand their respective metabolisms, the team turned to the only fossils the sharks have left behind: their teeth.</p>



<p>Fossilized teeth offer a wealth of encapsulated environmental data. The tooth enamel contains both heavier and lighter forms, or isotopes, of carbon, oxygen and other elements, and the relative abundances of these isotopes is linked to body temperature. Eagle and his colleagues used a technique that examines the abundance of “clumped isotopes” — bonded-together heavy forms of carbon (carbon-13) and oxygen (oxygen-18) — as a kind of ancient geochemical thermometer. The abundance of these bonds is “only affected by temperature,” offering a more unambiguous thermometer than using a single element’s isotopic abundance, Eagle says.</p>



<p>The team used this technique on teeth from the different sharks, as well as fossil samples from other ancient ocean contemporaries including whales and mollusks. (Mollusks, being entirely cold-blooded, represent the ocean water temperature, Eagle says). The data show that both sharks were a bit endothermic, but not only was&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>’s average body temperature (about 27⁰ C) higher than its surrounding waters, it was also higher than the average body temperature of great whites (about 22⁰ C) living in similar waters. Neither shark was as warm-blooded as marine mammals, such as the whale groups <em>Odontoceti</em> and <em>Mysticeti</em>, the team determined.</p>





<p>It’s “a very interesting finding, and it is fantastic that we have more evidence for regional endothermy in megalodon,” Cooper says. <em>O. megalodon’s</em> higher body temperature would have allowed it “to swim further and faster, increasing its chances of encountering prey,” he says. “But it also means that if food availability declines, megalodon would not have been able to meet its huge energetic requirements.” And when changing sea levels in the Pliocene led to a decline in the sharks’ prey about 3 million years ago, “it may well have starved into extinction.”</p>



<p>Eagle and colleagues are now delving into the chicken-or-egg question of which came first for <em>O. megalodon</em>: warm-bloodedness or apex predator status. “You need a high trophic level to become gigantic,” Eagle says. But is warm-bloodedness necessary to get to that high trophic level (apex predator status)? “We’re hoping to fit it all together into an evolutionary story as to what drives what.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper entitled &quot;Few-shot Object Counting with Similarity-Aware Feature Enhancement&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This work studies the problem of few-shot object counting, which counts the number of
exemplar objects (i.e., described by one or several support images) occurring in the query
image. The major challenge lies in that the target objects can be densely packed in the
query image, making it hard to recognize every single one. To tackle the obstacle, we
propose a novel learning block, equipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature
enhancement module. Concretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a
score map by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score maps
regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across both the
exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable similarity map. We
then enhance the query feature with the support features by employing the developed point-
wise similarities as the weighting coefficients. Such a design encourages the model to
inspect the query image by focusing more on the regions akin to the support images,
leading to much clearer boundaries between different objects. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks and training setups suggest that we surpass the state-of-the-art
methods by a sufficiently large margin. For instance, on a recent large-scale FSC-147
dataset, we surpass the state-of-the-art method by improving the mean absolute error from
22.08 to 14.32 (35%↑). Code has been released in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount">https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, are seeking to establish a multi-stakeholder working group to identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing. The aims of this working group and the eligibility criteria that interested parties must meet in order to apply are outlined below.</p>



<p>We anticipate that the group will consist of a maximum of twelve individuals and will represent the three key stakeholders &ndash; funders, institutions/library consortia and publishers &ndash; in roughly equal proportions.</p>



<p>Once established, the working group is expected to convene up to six times. The key outcome from this collaborative effort will be the development of a model (or multiple models) that, if implemented, would enable equitable participation in knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>Interested parties should apply using the form available at <a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup">https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup</a>. <strong>Applications must be submitted by 25th August 2023.</strong></p>



<p>The organising committee will review the applications and strive to ensure a well-balanced representation of different stakeholders within the working group. Efforts will also be made to achieve a broad and diverse membership. The first meeting of the working group will be held by videoconferenceon Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> September, from 14.00 BST to 15.30 BST.</p>



<h2><strong>Multi-stakeholder working group overarching aims</strong></h2>



<ol type="1"><li>To identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing</li><li>To consider how the &lsquo;per unit&rsquo; payment model (i.e. APCs) can be replaced by more equitable payment models</li><li>To explore how funds made available by research funders to support Open Access can be used to best support a non-APC publishing ecosystem</li><li>To address the possible unintended consequences of publishing funding streams being locked up in individual grants</li><li>To encourage Open Science practices</li></ol>



<h2><a></a><strong>Background: from Open Access to Equitable Participation</strong></h2>



<p>The OA movement aimed to provide equitable access to research outputs. The push to include the cost of publication in research budgets was intended to reduce the overall cost of access to published research.<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Twenty years on, what we see is that:</p>



<ul><li>APCs are established as the predominant OA business model in those countries /regions/ disciplines where this economic argument worked but also where they create barriers to participation for those with limited funds.</li><li>The rate of article growth is leading to ever-increasing costs for funders and research-intensive institutions.</li><li>The article embedded as the research output of value, blocking progress towards an Open Science ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>Viewed through an economic lens, separating responsibility for choice (the researcher) from responsibility for payment (the librarian or funder) creates a dysfunctional system, as has been raised by funders, including Research England. Giving researchers responsibility for the budget to cover the cost of their publications on a &lsquo;publication-by-publication&rsquo; basis, at first sight, appears to address this problem. However, this approach overlooks the deeper incentive system at work while simultaneously negating the ability of libraries or funders to engage in collective negotiation on researchers&rsquo; behalf.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>The incentives problem</strong></h2>



<p>We continue to operate in a world where:</p>



<ul><li>The majority of research outputs are not accessible, either because they are behind a paywall (in the case of articles) or because they are not shared (non-article outputs).</li><li>The research assessment and incentive systems rely on numbers: number of articles published and Journal Impact Factors (or journal names/&rsquo;prestige&rsquo;) in a hypercompetitive environment that rewards quantity and prestige (or falsely equates it with quality).</li></ul>



<p>These factors reinforce each other, leading to a self-perpetuating state in which the research community feels shackled and is resistant to change. The current model, firmly centred on the event of publication of an article&rsquo;s Version of Record (VoR) as the desired outcome of research and marker of scientific achievement, exacerbates this problem.</p>



<p>In this current system, the majority of scholarly publishers operate, in the words of Uli Dirnagl,<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> as &lsquo;an industry mining the currency of the academic reputation economy&rsquo; and, as such, &lsquo;a lifeline for those who want to keep the status quo.&rsquo; Publishers defend themselves from this criticism by positioning themselves to be in the service of the research community, unable to move until researchers change.</p>



<p>Of course, none of us is free of constraints and incentives: funders need to show that they have invested in worthwhile research; institutions need to generate funding income and need the prestige of researchers and research outputs to attract students; researchers need money, infrastructure and support networks to carry out research; all publishers need a revenue stream, submissions and stakeholder partnerships for sustainability and stewardship of the community&rsquo;s trust. And everyone in the system expects a salary and recognition in some form for work done.</p>



<h3><a></a><strong>What are we aiming for?</strong></h3>



<p>APCs have got us this far. They have usefully shown that OA is possible. But they create perverse incentives, administrative expenses, and burden for researchers, and they embed the article as the primary research artefact. Waivers are not a sustainable solution: researchers do not want to be viewed as &ldquo;charitable cases&rdquo; in need of funds.</p>



<p>At the same time, libraries unintentionally perpetuate this situation, with existing (decreasing) budgets predominantly going towards the largest publishers via &ldquo;transformative agreements&rdquo;, a model which locks in the APC/published unit payments and locks out those publishers trying to progress different (more equitable) OA business models.</p>



<p>So, if we weren&rsquo;t &lsquo;starting from here&rsquo;, how would we design a model, or models, to support born-digital Open Science?</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>What can research funders, publishers and libraries/consortia do to drive change?</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we outline what the three key stakeholders in scholarly communication &ndash; funders, publishers and institutions &ndash; can do to drive change and develop new publishing models and arrangements that are not based on per unit payment systems such as APCs.</p>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Research funders and research performing organisations</u></strong></h4>



<p>Although many research funders are providing financial support to cover publication costs for articles which arise from their funding, in many cases, this funding is held in the research budget.</p>



<p>However, if we are to move away from a per-unit business model &ndash; and empower institutions to negotiate arrangements which are non-APC based and have equity at their core &ndash; funders will need to explore how their funds can be made accessible to institutions (and not tied up in individual grants).</p>



<p>Research funders interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ensure that funds made available to cover publication fees are NOT allocated to individual research grants but instead are aggregated and directed to those who procure publishing services, typically the university library.</li><li>Incentivise Open Science behaviours in research dissemination in line with Open Science best practices and <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/">research assessment reform</a> by emphasising in the grant application process that all research outputs &ndash; preprints, articles, data, peer review reports, methods etc. &ndash; are valuable and will be recognised via the research assessment process.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Publishers</u></strong></h4>



<p>Publishers are another key stakeholder, as ultimately, it is in their gift to develop and implement new business models which are not based on APCs.</p>



<p>Publishers interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to supporting <strong>all </strong>the actions below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Developing financially transparent business models which are not based on &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; payments (such as APCs) and which place equity at their core.</li><li>Supporting Open Science practices, for example, by enabling the publication of a wide variety of research outputs, including data, negative findings etc.</li><li>Reimagining quality assessment and peer review processes, for example, by supporting journal independent peer review.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Libraries/consortia</u></strong></h4>



<p>The third key stakeholder for this working group is libraries and library consortia. They are key players in negotiating fully OA publishing agreements and thus can play a critical role in supporting the move to non-APC based business models.</p>



<p>Libraries/consortia interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate ways in which they are already working toward their implementation:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Allocate a growing portion of (aggregated) budgetary spend for OA business models, which are not based on a per published unit&rsquo; payments and which place global equity at their core.</li><li>Support and facilitate Open Science practices, for example, by encouraging the sharing/deposition of a wide range of research outputs.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong>Potential questions for the group to consider</strong></h4>



<ul><li>What other stakeholder groups might need to be involved in the discussion?</li><li>What does an equitable business model look like?</li><li>How can each stakeholder group facilitate business models that move &ldquo;beyond the article&rdquo; and &ldquo;beyond APCs?&rdquo;</li><li>What are the costs to each stakeholder group of swimming against the current tide of an APC/article-based economy?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trick-snow-flies-survive-self-amputation">A grisly trick helps snow flies survive freezing: self-amputation</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few years ago, John Tuthill was trail running in the Cascade mountains in Washington state when he spotted something dark skittering across the snow.</p>



<p>It was about the size of a wild blueberry, with an elongated body and six legs that moved in a blur.</p>



<p>Tuthill was surprised to see an insect out and about on that cold October day. “I was kind of blown away that there was this animal out running around,” says Tuthill, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was a <em>Chionea</em> fly, he later learned. Also known as a snow fly, it could somehow walk around at temperatures well below what most other insects can tolerate.</p>





<p>Now, Tuthill and colleagues have shown that a grisly trick helps snow flies survive sub-zero conditions. When a leg begins to freeze, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.29.541388v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the insects can rapidly self-amputate it</a>, preventing ice crystals from creeping up into their bodies, the team reports in a paper posted online May 30 at bioRxiv.org.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snow flies may drop one or more legs to prevent themselves from freezing. Even missing multiple limbs, one fly (shown here) can navigate over snow in the wild.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many animal species, including spiders, lizards and crabs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can drop a limb or tail</a> to escape a predator (<em>SN: 2/17/22</em>), but the new work is the first to show an animal using this life-saving measure in response to the cold, says Christine Miller, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The study describes “a new phenomenon that hadn’t been documented before and a very interesting species that we know very little about.”</p>



<p>Snow flies are a type of flightless crane fly, relatives of the “big, spindly, goofy-looking flies that you see bumbling around in your house,” Tuthill says. The insects, which can live up to two months, aren’t easy to study: They can’t be bred in the lab, and they’re tough to collect from the wild. Snow flies can live in alpine areas that are difficult for people to reach, where the threat of avalanche looms.</p>



<p>The best way to find them, Tuthill says, is to spend a lot of time wandering around, looking at snow. Backcountry skiing fit the bill. In an eight-hour trip, he says, “probably seven hours of that is walking slowly uphill.” From 2020 to 2022, he, his wife, and some friends and volunteers collected hundreds of snow flies, scooping them into plastic tubes they brought back or mailed to Tuthill’s lab. Most of the snow flies that arrived alive came from excursions in Washington.</p>



<p>Tuthill’s team used a thermal camera to record 77 snow flies as they walked on cold plates. The insects kept trekking even when their body temperature fell to an average of –7° Celsius, the researchers found. But more than half of the snow flies tested dropped at least one leg during the experiments.</p>



<p>A sharp-eyed research tech, Dominic Golding, noticed a temperature spike in the flies’ legs just before they fell off. That spike is a sign of ice formation, Tuthill says. Liquid water releases heat as it crystallizes into ice. Neurons in the leg may sense this temperature shift and trigger amputation, preventing the icy crystals from spreading, the team suggests. The flies “have about half a second to get rid of their leg before that wave of ice crashes into their body and then freezes all of their internal organs,” he says.</p>



<p>Snow flies didn’t lose their limbs when the researchers tugged on them — only in response to freezing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thermal camera can pick up the moment ice begins to form in a snow fly’s leg and track when the insect self-amputates it. Colors represent temperatures, shown from warmer (yellow) to colder (purple).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other animals have devised different strategies to fend off frost, says Katie Marshall, an entomologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Some insects pump out antifreeze proteins; certain snails and frogs simply withstand ice forming in their bodies.</p>





<p>“The cool thing about snow flies is that they don’t actually follow either strategy,” says Marshall, who provided feedback on the team’s manuscript, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. They let ice form in their legs, she says, and “self-amputate to get rid of it, which is just completely strange to me.”</p>



<p>Snow flies that amputated their gelid limbs survived more than a minute longer than flies that didn’t, the team found. That extra time may not seem like much. But in the wild, when night is falling and the temperature is dropping and the insects are “looking furiously for a place to hunker down,” Tuthill says, it could be the difference between life and death.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-cosmic-dawn-julian-munoz-scientists-to-watch">Julian Muñoz has a ‘ruler’ that could size up the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Julian Muñoz has come up with a ruler to measure the early universe.</p>



<p>A theoretical physicist, Muñoz studies the distant, dim period in the universe’s history known as cosmic dawn. That’s when stars first began flickering on, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, infusing the universe with initial glimmers of starlight and forming the first galaxies.</p>



<p>Before the first stars, the universe was cold and dark — as Muñoz describes it, “boring.” Then, starlight began to reshape the universe. “It is a very dramatic epoch,” says Muñoz, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>That epoch is also poorly understood. Cosmic dawn is so unexplored that Muñoz compares it to an uncharted area on early maps of Earth. There, Muñoz says, “there could be dragons.” By studying this era, he hopes to reveal the behavior of one dragon of the cosmos, dark matter, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">inscrutable substance</a> whose mass binds galaxies.</p>



<p>But to understand the cosmos, scientists have to be able to measure it. Looking far into space means looking deep into the past. The trouble is our 2-D view of the sky doesn’t readily reveal how far away things are. “When we look at the night sky, we’ve got no depth perception,” says cosmologist Adrian Liu of McGill University in Montreal.</p>





<p>Scientists have devised a variety of methods to get a handle on distances, including standard candles and standard rulers — objects of known brightness or length. If you know how bright an object is (compared with how bright it appears) or you know how long a particular feature is on the sky (compared with its apparent length), you can tell how far away it is. A ruler looks smaller from 20 meters away than from 10 meters away, and a 20-watt lightbulb looks dimmer the farther away it is. The same applies over cosmic distances.</p>



<p>Scientists use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-one-way-explode-star">certain types of exploding stars</a>, for example, to estimate distances, because the blasts put out a predictable light show (<em>SN: 5/8/12</em>). Standard rulers or standard candles can be used to trace out how far away other objects of interest are and reveal how rapidly the universe has expanded over its history.</p>



<p>But none of the known standard objects reach back to the cosmic dawn era. That’s where Muñoz’s ruler comes in. “This ability to reach that far back,” Liu says, “that’s the really valuable thing.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sizing up cosmic dawn</h4>



<p>No one has ever seen a conclusive signature of cosmic dawn — the very first galaxies are too distant to observe directly. But there’s another way to spot cosmic dawn’s effects, one that’s been a long-sought target for astronomers. As the first stars formed, their light heated the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing it to absorb light with a wavelength of 21 centimeters, a number that results from the separation between energy levels in hydrogen atoms. Observing that 21-centimeter absorption signal is the aim of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, or HERA, collaboration, an effort that Muñoz and Liu both work on, using a radio telescope in South Africa.</p>



<p>If it can be detected, this absorption signal should have <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.131301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtle, ring-shaped patterns imprinted in it</a>, Muñoz reported in 2019 in <em>Physical Review Letters.</em></p>

Regions with more absorption (red) correspond to denser pockets of stars, compared with sparsely populated regions with less absorption (blue). Sparse areas tend to be separated by distances of about half a billion light-years (arrow indicates one example); the same goes for dense areas.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125372">J.B. Muñoz</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Those patterns, the basis of his ruler, result from the differing behavior of dark matter and normal matter during an even earlier period, less than 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Sound waves careening through the plasma at that time would have pushed normal matter to high speeds while leaving dark matter at a standstill.</p>



<p>This mismatch in velocities affected where galaxies formed during the later cosmic dawn era. To create a galaxy, dark matter must gravitationally reel in normal matter. But where the velocities differed, the normal matter zipped right on by. The early universe was left with sparsely populated regions of the sky, arranged in ring-shaped patterns with a predictable distance scale. The rings, which are too subtle to pick out by eye from the data but show up in statistical analyses, have radii of half a billion light-years – that’s one long measuring stick.</p>



<p>The new standard ruler could reveal how fast the universe was expanding back then. That information can tell scientists what that youthful universe was made of, revealing the amount of dark matter, normal matter and dark energy, another hidden piece of the cosmic puzzle.</p>





<p>A new expansion measurement could also add fuel to one of the fiercest debates in cosmology. Currently, different measurements of the universe’s expansion rate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">clash with one another</a>, leaving scientists pondering whether there are flaws in our understanding of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Seeking to understand the unknown, including these shadowy cosmic realms, is “an integral component of human nature — like art and poetry,” Muñoz says. “You could live without it, but I really hope you don’t have to.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking into dark corners</h4>



<p>Muñoz’s interest in dark matter drew him to the cosmic dawn. The first galaxies grew off a scaffold of dark matter. So information about how and when those galaxies formed can reveal dark matter’s properties. In a report published in 2018 in <em>Nature</em>, for example, Muñoz and colleagues suggested that, if some of the universe’s dark matter had a tiny electric charge, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0151-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a millionth of an electron’s</a>, that could alter the expected cosmic dawn signal.</p>



<p>He has also developed important computational tools, like a new technique that allows for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/523/2/2587/7174391?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lightning-fast simulations</a> of the cosmic dawn, reported in May in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The time it takes to perform these simulations has previously limited what scientists can study.</p>



<p>“He’s got an eye for interesting ideas,” says theoretical physicist Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, Muñoz’s Ph.D. adviser. But the cosmic ruler, “that’s probably the most singular idea that he’s had.”</p>



<p>Becoming a physicist, in itself, was uncharted territory for Muñoz. As a child, he liked science. He recalls being amazed by fossilized shark teeth that were millions of years old — perhaps his first experience grappling with such grand timescales.</p>



<p>But Muñoz didn’t have a scientific role model; his parents didn’t finish high school. He focused his attention on video games and coding until a high school physics teacher encouraged his scientific streak. He turned to physics, he says, where “it was possible to channel all this nerdy energy for knowledge.” That’s what drives Muñoz to explore the questions that swirl around dark corners of the cosmos. “I do it because I think the answers enrich the human experience.”</p>

The findings were based on Laliotis’ own admissions as well as reports from The Ohio State University and Johns Hopkins University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/22/fired-postdoc-faked-recommendation-letters-from-supervisor-osu-alleges/">previously reported</a>, Ohio State terminated Laliotis from his postdoc position in November of 2021, and he apparently resigned from another postdoc position at Johns Hopkins University that same month. Whether both universities employed him at the same time is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis has also been charged in Franklin County, Ohio – home to Ohio State –&nbsp; with forgery, identity theft, and telecommunications fraud in connection with allegations he created a fake email address in the name of Philip Tsichlis, his PI at Ohio State, and used it to send letters of recommendation purportedly from Tsichlis to prospective employers. Laliotis has pleaded not guilty to all charges.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127380"></span>



<p>Issues with Laliotis’ work came to light after researchers who attempted to replicate the findings of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24795-1"><em>Nature Communications</em> paper</a> on which he was the first author contacted Tsichlis and shared that they could not confirm the results, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">emails we obtained</a> through a public records request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Tsichlis looked into the matter, he discovered “evidence of data manipulation,” as he put it in an email to the editor of <em>Communications Biology</em> requesting the retraction of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02668-z">related paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Communications Biology </em>paper was retracted in December 2021, less than one month after Tsichlis contacted the editor. He also contacted <em>Nature Communications </em>around the same time, but that paper was not <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31445-7">retracted</a> until June of 2022, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/29/seven-months-after-an-author-request-journal-retracts/">two weeks after we published our initial story</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the two retracted papers, ORI identified data fabrication in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.12.454141v3">bioRxiv preprint</a>, which has since been withdrawn, two unpublished manuscripts, and two NIH grant applications, one of which garnered Tsichlis and co-PI Vincenzo Coppola $626,476. Laliotis’ misconduct affected research funded by five grants from the National Cancer Institute, ORI said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s finding states that Laliotis “knowingly and intentionally” faked sequencing data in the <em>Nature Communications</em> paper “by splicing two sequencing chromatograms together to falsely represent a novel identification of a previously undescribed” RNA transcript, and subsequently falsified conclusions about the fabricated variant. He also falsified experimental conditions and methods, as well as additional data and conclusions in the other identified manuscripts and grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis has not immediately responded to our request for comment. He agreed to a three year period of supervision for his research, which began on June 12, according to ORI.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bottlenose-dolphin-mom-calf-baby-talk-whistle">Bottlenose dolphin moms use baby talk with their calves</a></h4>

              
                <p>When speaking to young kids, humans often use squeaky, high-pitched baby talk. It turns out that some dolphins do, too.</p>



<p>Bottlenose dolphin moms <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300262120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modify their individually distinctive whistles when their babies are nearby</a>, researchers report June 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. This “parentese” might enhance attention, bonding and vocal learning in calves, as it seems to do in humans.</p>



<p>During the first few months of life, each common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>) develops a unique tune, or signature whistle, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphins-name-themselves-whistle">akin to a name</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/13</em>). The dolphins shout out their own “names” in the water “likely as a way to keep track of each other,” says marine biologist Laela Sayigh of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.</p>





<p>But dolphin moms seem to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/90/3/638/874710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweak that tune in the presence of their calves</a>, which tend to stick by mom’s side for three to six years. It’s a change that Sayigh first noticed in a 2009 study published by her student. But “it was just one little piece of this much larger study,” she says.</p>



<p>To follow up on that observation, Sayigh and colleagues analyzed signature whistles from 19 female dolphins both with and without their babies close by. Audio recordings were captured from a wild population that lives near Sarasota Bay, Fla., during catch-and-release health assessments that occurred from 1984 to 2018.</p>



<p>The researchers examined 40 instances of each dolphin’s signature whistle, verified by the unique way each vocalization’s frequencies change over time. Half of each dolphin’s whistles were voiced in the presence of her baby. When youngsters were around, the moms’ whistles contained, on average, a higher maximum and slightly lower minimum pitch compared with those uttered in the absence of calves, contributing to an overall widened pitch range.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dolphin ‘parentese’</h3>



<p>When their babies are around, bottlenose dolphin moms modify their signature whistles to include higher pitches and a wider pitch range than normal. The first audio clip presents a mother’s typical whistle. The second clip is of her whistle with her calf nearby. Both clips were slowed to one-eighth normal speed to make the high frequency vocalizations audible to human ears.</p>

<p>These whistle adjustments echo baby talk because human caregivers use real words and language, just with certain inflections, Sayigh says. Formally called child-directed communication, these inflections typically involve higher pitches and a wider pitch range, like what was observed in the dolphins.</p>



<p>“Bottlenose dolphins are a prime candidate for child-directed or calf-directed communication,” says Quincy Gibson, a marine mammal behavioral ecologist who was not involved with the study. Similar to humans, these dolphins form strong mother-baby bonds and learn vocalizations.</p>



<p>But to confirm this study’s results, scientists should analyze signature whistles of freely swimming, unrestrained dolphin moms, notes Gibson, director of the University of North Florida Dolphin Research Program in Jacksonville. “We do need to look at this question in more natural and undisturbed conditions.”</p>



<p>And although researchers speculate dolphin parentese could have the same functions as in human speech, no one can be certain “until the day we can ask the dolphins what they’re actually doing,” says behavioral ecologist Mauricio Cantor of the Oregon State University Marine Mammal Institute in Newport, who was also not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Still, Sayigh says, “the idea that there might be similar forces driving [parentese] in such different species is just really cool.”</p>

                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>This week, PLOS shares the latest update to our Open Science Indicators (OSIs) dataset. We&rsquo;ve added an additional three months of data, bringing the data current through the end of the first quarter of this year. The complete dataset now covers the period from January 1 2019-March 31 2023.</p>



<h2>About Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS Open Science indicators are a large public dataset&mdash;the latest version has data on 82,298 articles&mdash;that uses Natural Language Processing to identify and measure key Open Science practices in the published literature, including the entire PLOS corpus, plus a smaller comparator dataset drawn from PubMed Central. The current indicators include data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.</p>



<h5 class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Download the dataset</a></h5>



<h2>Who are Open Science Indicators for?</h2>



<p>PLOS initially created Open Science Indicators to help meet our own needs&mdash;to better understand researchers and their sharing practices, and how these differ across groups. An improved understanding of the communities we serve helps us to better support researchers, develop new solutions, and advance our mission of Openness.</p>



<p>By sharing the data openly, we hope to help meet the needs of individuals and organizations <em>outside</em> PLOS as well. So far, users of the dataset have included funders, institutions, academic librarians, and meta researchers. As of this writing, the dataset on Figshare has attracted over 5,600 views and more than 700 downloads and been cited in multiple scholarly preprints.</p>



<p>Let us know how you use the dataset, and what would be helpful to support you! If the data isn&rsquo;t useful for you, we want to hear about that, too. Comment below, or email us at community (at) plos.org.</p>



<h2>Open Science Indicators trends</h2>



<p>In the first quarter of 2023 Open Science Indicator trends for PLOS articles have remained largely stable compared to the previous quarter and 2022 as a whole. Comparator rates are more varied, likely due to the smaller sample size, and show increases following a drop off at the end of last year across all indicators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After reading an <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720583">economics paper</a> that claimed to document an increase in the rate of rape in European countries following the passage of prostitution bans, a data scientist had questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientist, who wishes to remain anonymous, sent a detailed email to an editor of the <em>Journal of Law and Economics</em>, which had published the paper last November, outlining concerns about the data and methods the authors used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them: the historical rates of rape recorded in the paper did not match the values in the official sources the authors said they used. In other cases, data that were available from the official sources were missing in the <a href="http://www.huashenggao.net/uploads/1/1/1/9/111968909/gaojle2022_publishedversion.pdf">paper</a>, the researchers didn’t incorporate all the data they had collected into their model, and a variable was coded inconsistently, the data scientist wrote. (We’ve made the full critique available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/JLE-reader-questions.pdf">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Given the consequences the conclusions of the article could have for people in the sex industry, the data scientist wrote, “I hope that someone takes this very seriously and looks into it the [sic] validity of the analysis and the data they used.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127362"></span>



<p>In response, <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/emeriti/sam-peltzman">Sam Peltzman</a>, an editor of the journal and a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, instructed the data scientist to contact the authors of the article:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The email raises serious questions but without any specific request. Your questions can better be answered by the authors than editors who, as you must know, cannot give each submission the kind of careful attention reflected in your email. Accordingly, we ask that you contact the authors directly if you have not already done so.</p>



<p>If you mean the email as a prologue to a critique, I am happy to discuss our relevant policies or any other question about our editorial process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data scientist wrote back with a specific request:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have just informed you, the editor, that it appears that the authors made an error in at least one of their models that resulted in a substantive difference in the conclusions of the article you edited … <strong>I am requesting you investigate if these models are correct and if so, at very least issue a correction.</strong><strong> </strong>[emphasis original]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response, Peltzman reiterated his refusal to investigate:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can only repeat what was in my last letter. You should take this up with the authors first. The editors cannot become involved unless your conversation with the authors fails to resolve the issues and a comment is received through the usual submission process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The University of Chicago Press, which publishes the <em>Journal of Law and Economics</em>, states on its <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/publication-ethics-statement">publication ethics page</a> that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When notified of possible errors or corrections, the editor(s) of the journal will review and resolve them in consultation with the Press and according to the Press’s best practices.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Peltzman why he refused to investigate the concerns the data scientist had raised. He told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The JLE does not have the resources to investigate concerns about data procedure used by authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We select referees knowledgeable about the topic of any submission.&nbsp; Occasionally a referee might comment on some detail of data used by authors.&nbsp; more often the referee and editors have to take data details at face value and focus their efforts on evaluating empirical results and analysis.&nbsp; While I can only speak for the JLE it is my impression that these procedures are common among economics journals that publish empirical articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Peltzman also explained that the journal’s standard procedure for considering critiques of published articles, “designed to avoid misunderstanding and excessive burden on editors’ and referees’ time,” starts with the critic contacting the authors directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the authors don’t respond, or if their response is unsatisfactory, the critic could then submit a comment to the journal along with their correspondence with the authors, which the editors would handle as any other submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Editors obviously cannot be expected to look at raw data for every paper they review,” the data scientist acknowledged, “but when concerns are brought directly to them it is their responsibility to take them seriously. If readers can’t trust that editors will address serious concerns appropriately, it will undermine their faith in the scientific process.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We contacted the authors of the paper, <a href="https://fisf.fudan.edu.cn/en_show-112-67.html">Huasheng Gao</a> and <a href="https://fisf.fudan.edu.cn/en_show-112-133.html?k=fmF3%EF%BC%89">Vanya Stefanova Petrova</a> of Fudan University’s Fanhai International School of Finance in Shanghai, and shared the data scientist’s critique. They responded with an 11-page PDF, available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reply-Letter-20230618.pdf">here</a>, standing by their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the differences between the data and their paper and the official sources, they said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the data we have used in the paper were the most up-to-date data available at the time we started the empirical work in 2018 … Eurostat is constantly revising its data. It is possible that the data contained in its current version are different from the historical version</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data scientist was unimpressed, and noted that the authors had not responded to a key aspect of the critique:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even if the authors believe it was a reasonable strategy to only assess two years post policy change, the relative year variable for year 2— the year in which they identified a large causal increase in rape in the criminalized prostitution countries and a reduction in the prostitution decriminalized countries &#8212; was coded incorrectly (or differently for some reason). When the coding is consistent with their original coding scheme, a reduction in rape is seen in the criminalized prostitution group. I&#8217;m not sure why they didn&#8217;t address this in their response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors also did not directly respond to the data scientist’s concern that if they had incorporated every year of data they had on rape rates into their model, instead of only the two years following a change in prostitution laws, they would not have gotten the same results, the scientist said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To check whether data values had indeed changed since the authors started their work, the scientist went to the website of the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, where the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/26462">survey data the authors</a> used is available for download, and found that no substantive changes had been made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientist told us:&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-hominids-stone-age-cannibalism">Fossil marks suggest hominids butchered one another around 1.45 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 1.45-million-year-old hominid leg fossil sports previously unrecognized <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35702-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of our ancient evolutionary relatives butchering and possibly eating one another</a>, a new study claims.</p>



<p>An ancient individual used a stone tool to make nine incisions on the fossil, which preserves the shin and knee. Analyses of 3-D models of these marks peg them as resembling damage produced by stone tools rather than by large predators’ bites or by animal trampling, researchers report June 26 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>





<p>Those incisions are the oldest convincing example of such butchery and possibly cannibalism among ancient hominids, says paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. But there’s debate about that interpretation.</p>



<p>Pobiner first examined the incised leg bone while studying fossils held at the Nairobi National Museum in Kenya. She wanted to identify which nonhuman predators hunted and ate ancient hominids. But marks on the leg bone looked to her like butchery damage.</p>



<p>Pobiner sent molds of 11 incisions on the fossil to paleoanthropologists Michael Pante of Colorado State University in Fort Collins and Trevor Keevil of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. The pair created 3-D scans of the bone marks and compared them with 898 bone marks known to have been made by stone cutting tools, stone pounding implements, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crocs-take-bite-out-claims-ancient-stone-tool-use">the teeth of crocodiles</a>, lions and other nonhuman predators, or cows trampling the ground (<em>SN: 11/6/17</em>).</p>

<p>Nine marks closely matched stone-tool damage, Pobiner says. The other two marks resulted from the bite of a big cat, perhaps a saber-toothed cat.</p>



<p>No consensus exists on the species identity of the ancient leg fossil. It might represent <em>Homo erectus</em>, <em>H. habilis</em> or a relatively small-brained species called <em>Paranthropus boisei</em>, Pobiner and colleagues say. There is also no way to tell whether a hominid from the same species or a different species left stone-tool marks on the leg fossil.</p>



<p>The incisions on the fossil cluster around a spot where a calf muscle attached to bone, consistent with the removal of a chunk of flesh, Pobiner says. Reasons for that act remain hazy, especially with only a single, fragmentary bone in hand. “We assume the intention of whichever [hominid] inflicted the cut marks was simply to cut off meat from the bone to eat it, based on hunger,” Pobiner says.</p>



<p>Zooarchaeologist Raphaël Hanon of Wits University in Johannesburg agrees. Cutting into the fleshy part of a lower leg probably reflected a need for food rather than a ritual act of some kind, says Hanon, who was not part of Pobiner’s team. There is no way to know whether flesh from meatier body parts, such as the shoulder and upper leg, was also removed, he says.</p>



<p>But stone-tool incisions on a partial leg bone do not provide enough evidence to determine whether hunger motivated flesh removal, counters zooarchaeologist Palmira Saladié of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain. Pobiner’s findings may reflect scenarios such as cannibalism to supplement other food sources, some sort of ritual practice that did not include cannibalism or the consumption of a defeated enemy following a fight between groups, suggests Saladié.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Yonatan Sahle of the University of Cape Town in South Africa agrees that the interpretation remains up in the air.&nbsp; Although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-cutups-deathly-rituals-emerge-neandertal-site">Stone Age cannibalism may have occurred</a>, “the present evidence is not strong enough to enable such an inference,” he says.</p>





<p>Further complicating matters, the original context of the leg fossil is unknown. It was found on the surface of a site in northern Kenya after coming loose from eroding sediment. The fossil’s age estimate derives from its position just above a volcanic ash layer dated to between around 1.5 million and 1.6 million years ago. Researchers have thus presumed that the leg bone originally rested in sediment slightly younger than that ash deposit.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200004)111:4%3C579::AID-AJPA12%3E3.0.CO;2-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A possible earlier case of a butchered hominid</a>, reported in 2000, also triggered debate. Researchers described incisions on a partial upper jaw found at a South African site — with age estimates ranging from 1.5 million to 2.6 million years old — as having resulted from slicing through a muscle to remove the lower jaw. But Hanon and colleagues have argued that animal trampling or accidental rubbing of the fossil against jagged rocks before it was excavated could have produced the incisions.</p>



<p>Pobiner’s group did a good job of excluding such factors as causes of nine of the 11 incisions on the hominid leg fossil, Hanon says. There is a “very high probability” that a hominid used a stone tool to create those ancient marks, he concludes.</p>



<p>But even if further research strengthens that probability, such evidence falls far short of demonstrating butchery or cannibalism, says Tim White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cannibals-signature">who has long studied skeletal clues to cannibalism</a> (<em>SN: 1/2/93</em>). White calls the Kenyan fossil “an interesting scientific curiosity that changes nothing of significance.”</p>

<p><strong>Comets, novas and the Mayans </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/archaeoastronomy"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 30, 1973</p>



<p>Did the Mayans record novas and comets? … Comparing dates of known historic novas and comets with [20] Mayan dates, [a researcher] found no acceptable correlation. Nevertheless, [the researcher] believes that the Mayans probably did record such events and that a record will eventually be found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Solid evidence that ancient Maya people marked dying stars or passing comets continues to elude archaeologists. Several early codices and stones may have recorded hieroglyphs that together mean “comet.” But Spanish conquistadores destroyed many of the originals, and only copies made well after the Maya empire’s collapse clearly depict comets. </p>



<p>In 2017, an analysis of Maya records and astronomical data hinted that the Maya indirectly marked at least one comet by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063316302951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting when meteor showers would dazzle the sky</a>. Between the years 250 and 909, six royal coronations happened within days of the annual Eta&nbsp;Aquariid meteor shower, researchers found, which occurs when Earth passes through the tail of Halley’s comet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-fossil-lost-world-microbe-life">1.6-billion-year-old steroid fossils hint at a lost world of microbial life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular fossils found in ancient sedimentary rocks have unveiled a lost world of primitive eukaryotes that dominated aquatic ecosystems from at least 1.6 billion to 800 million years ago.</p>



<p>The findings, published June 7 in <em>Nature</em>, come from laboratory analyses of rock samples from around the world that revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06170-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of primitive compounds called protosteroids</a>. The majority of these molecules, which form in the process of creating steroids, were likely produced by primordial eukaryotes, relatively complex life-forms that today include animals, plants, algae and fungi, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Almost all eukaryotes produce molecules called steroids, like cholesterol, that are crucial components of cell membranes. Steroids don’t degrade easily and their remnants can be detected in sedimentary rocks as molecular fossils.</p>



<p>The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes lived around 1.2 billion to more than 1.8 billion years ago. But scientists know almost nothing about the abundance, ecology and habitats of those early microorganisms. Molecular and physical fossils of eukaryotes dated to 800 million years ago have been found. But farther back in time, their physical fossils become scarce and molecular fossils of the steroids become undetectable. The existence of protosteroids had been predicted but it was unclear what they would look like — or if they could even be detected — until the researchers figured out a way to re-create those molecular footprints in the lab.</p>



<p>“This study explains why we don’t see footprints of these guys in the rocks, as researchers were looking for the wrong thing,” says biologist Laura Katz, a biologist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who was not involved with the new work. “It fills a void in the fossil records.”</p>



<p>A dearth of obvious eukaryote fossils before 800 million years ago led scientists to speculate that the ecosystem at that time was dominated by bacteria. Alternatively, primordial eukaryotes may have simply lacked strength in numbers to leave behind detectable steroid remnants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists had a different explanation: What if some intermediate molecule in the chemical pathway that produces modern steroids was actually the end product of the process in primordial eukaryotes? This theory had been proposed by the biochemist Konrad Bloch, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1964 for discovering the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol.</p>



<p>To test this, geochemist Jochen Brocks of the Australian National University in Canberra and colleagues artificially matured molecules made in the first few steps of steroid biosynthesis, including lanosterol and cycloartenol. That revealed what the compounds’ molecular fossils would look like. Then the researchers looked for these fossils in tarlike bitumens and oils extracted from ancient rocks from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers discovered a deluge of the protosteroids in samples ranging from deep to relatively shallow water environments. The oldest sample, dating back to 1.6 billion years ago, came from the Barney Creek Formation in Australia.</p>



<p>“One of the greatest puzzles of early evolution is, why didn’t our highly capable eukaryotic ancestors come to dominate the world’s ancient waterways? Where were they hiding?” says Benjamin Nettersheim, a geobiologist at University of Bremen in Germany. “We show that the protosteroid-producing microorganisms were hiding in plain sight and were in fact abundant in the world’s ancient oceans and lakes all along.”</p>



<p>While most bacteria produce a different molecule, called hopanoids, some bacteria also have the chemical tools to kick-start protosteroid production. But these bacteria exist in niche environments, such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. And their molecular footprints have not been found in sediments older than 800 million years, leading the researchers to conclude that eukaryotes dominated the ancient ecosystems.</p>



<p>“Konrad Bloch would have been delighted, had he lived, to see this,” says MIT geobiologist Roger Summons, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This paper has elegantly confirmed his prediction that biosynthetic precursors to cholesterol reflect ancient life’s quest for improvement.” (Bloch died in 2000.)</p>





<p>Making these steroid precursors requires less oxygen and energy, so that may have given the primordial eukaryotes an advantage in thriving in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fascination-earths-boring-billion">early Earth’s harsh low oxygen conditions</a>, the researchers propose (<em>SN: 10/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>“If true, [this study] suggests that we may be able to examine the stepwise evolution of eukaryotes at [an] unprecedented level of detail,” says evolutionary biologist Yosuke Hoshino of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, who was not involved in the study. “This is such a great opportunity to understand the evolution of complex life, which biologists have always dreamed of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-cluster-milky-way-old-universe">A star cluster in the Milky Way appears to be as old as the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the oldest known objects in the universe is wandering around the Milky Way.</p>



<p>Star cluster M92, a densely packed ball of stars roughly 27,000 light-years from Earth, <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2306.02180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about 13.8 billion years old</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted June 3 to arXiv.org. The newly refined age estimate makes this clump of stars nearly the same age as the universe.</p>



<p>Refining the ages of clusters like M92 can help put limits on the age of the universe itself. It can also help solve cosmic conundrums about how the universe evolved.</p>





<p>The age is “on the edge of the age of the universe, as estimated by other groups,” says astronomer Martin Ying of Dartmouth College. “It helps us set the lower bound of the age of the universe. We don’t expect M92 to be born before the universe, right?”</p>



<p>Globular clusters like M92 are tight knots of stars that are thought to have all formed at the same time. That makes it easier for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">astronomers to measure the stars’ ages</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). Stars that are born at different masses have different fates: The big ones use up their fuel quickly and die young, and the small ones linger. Figuring out how many of the cluster’s stars have aged out of the main parts of their fuel-burning years gives a sense of when the whole cluster was born.</p>



<p>But those estimates rely on assumptions about how stellar evolution works. Ying and colleagues wanted to find an age measurement that would sidestep those assumptions.</p>



<p>Using a computer, the team created 20,000 synthetic stellar populations for M92, each for a different possible cluster age. They then compared the colors and brightnesses for each of these populations with Hubble Space Telescope observations of M92 and calculated the age that fit the collection best.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time astronomers have measured M92’s age, but previous estimates relied on just one synthetic collection of stars. Comparing thousands of them reduced the uncertainty introduced by the assumptions baked into each one. The new technique reduced the uncertainty of the cluster age by about 50 percent, Ying says. The team found the cluster is 13.8 billion years old, give or take 750 million years. That’s strikingly close to the best estimate of the age of the universe: a smidge over 13.8 billion years, plus or minus 24 million years, according to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-planck-refines-cosmic-history">the Planck satellite’s measurement of the first light</a> emitted after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 12/20/13</em>).</p>



<p>The age of clusters like M92 is important partly because of a rising tension over how fast the universe is growing. Astronomers have known since the 1990s that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, thanks to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">a mysterious substance dubbed dark energy</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/22</em>). But recent measurements of the rate of that expansion, a figure called the Hubble constant, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">disagree with each other</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>One way around that tension is to accept a different age for the universe, says cosmologist and study coauthor Mike Boylan-Kolchin of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>“We often think about it as, Moses came down from Mount Sinai with ‘13.8 billion years’ written on some tablets or something, but it’s not quite like that,” he says. “If one takes the Hubble tension seriously, then one also has to say we don’t know the age of the universe that well.”</p>



<p>That’s where M92 comes in. Before spacecraft measured the cosmos’ earliest light, globular cluster ages were the best way to place limits on the age of the universe. That practice had fallen out of fashion for a while, says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>But improvements in computing, theory, and measurements of the distances to clusters like M92 make it worth trying again.</p>





<p>“The Hubble tension itself is a really challenging nut to crack,” Freedman says. This measurement alone isn’t precise enough to settle the debate. But “the more kinds of constraints we have, the better,” she says. “It’s showing a way for the future.”</p>

                <p>Runoff from irrigation has moved so much water from land to sea that Earth’s rotation might have measurably shifted.</p>



<p>Computer simulations suggest that from 1993 through 2010, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irrigation alone nudged the North Pole by about 78 centimeters</a>, researchers reported in the June 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters. </em>That would make irrigation the second largest contributor to polar drift after the ongoing rebound of Earth’s surface following the retreat of glaciers since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Researchers have long known that the North Pole wanders across the Arctic seascape in a circle a few meters in diameter. Seasonal weather patterns cause part of this cyclical drift, and long-term variations in the temperature and salinity of ocean water help drive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solving-one-mystery-polar-wander">a 14-month-long oscillation dubbed the Chandler wobble</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/03</em>).</p>





<p>But those repeated vacillations aren’t the only things that move the pole around, says Clark Wilson, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. There is also a subtler, noncyclic polar drift caused by the movement of land-based water to the sea from melting glaciers worldwide and from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, he says.</p>



<p>Runoff from irrigation also plays a role — and a surprisingly large one at that.</p>



<p>In the first study to try and tease out the contributions of these water movements, Wilson and colleagues used computer simulations to assess how the impoundment of water behind dams, glacial melt, irrigation and several other factors might affect polar drift. Previous studies have suggested that irrigation shifted about 2 trillion metric tons of water from land-based aquifers to the oceans from 1993 through 2010 — enough to raise global sea level more than 6 millimeters.</p>



<p>Although seemingly minuscule, that redistribution of water was enough to shift the North Pole just over four centimeters each year on average during that period, the team found.</p>



<p>When all sources of water movement are considered — including the runoff of meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets — the North Pole drifted about 1.6 meters toward the east coast of Greenland in that time. The impact of irrigation was mostly to nudge the pole generally east of where it would have gone otherwise, the team found. Without irrigation, the pole would have drifted nearly the same amount, but toward the center of Greenland instead.</p>



<p>Unlike other drivers that vary over the course of a year, Wilson says, the polar drift due to irrigation is permanent and probably growing each year.</p>



<p>“The team’s findings all make sense,” says Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “It’s important to realize that water is heavy, and when it moves around it’s going to affect Earth’s rotation.”</p>



<p>Besides shifting the North Pole, large-scale irrigation can also affect local and regional climates. Studies have shown that irrigation cools temperatures and boosts humidity in California’s Central Valley, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watering-fields-california-boosts-rainfall-southwest">increasing rainfall in the Four Corners area</a> of the American Southwest and enhancing flow volumes in the Colorado River (<em>SN: 1/22/13</em>).</p>

<p>Two years after it was quietly retracted &#8220;due to plagiarism,&#8221; a <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">paper</a> by a prominent researcher in Latvia has set the country&#8217;s media ablaze, drawing comments from, among others, <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/04/06/caksa-un-kalvins-par-plagiatu-lu-pilnas-atbildes/">the minister of education and science</a> and <a href="https://www.la.lv/plagiats-ir-viens-no-smagakajiem-noziegumiem-akademiskaja-vide-tam-nav-noilguma-ta-lu-rektors">the rector of a leading university</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plagiarized paper came to public attention in March when the Latvian magazine <em>Ir</em> <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/03/22/profesors-petnieks-un-plagiats/">published serious allegations</a> against <a href="http://ww3.lza.lv/scientists/klavinsm.htm">Maris Klavins</a>, a professor and former dean at the University of Latvia. The allegations concern “possible fraud&#8221; in an EU-funded project headed by Klavins and include not only plagiarism but data falsification, budget irregularities and suspicious cash payments.</p>



<p>According to <em>Ir</em>, the Latvian police have opened a criminal investigation into the case. Klavins told the magazine he has not been charged in the matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Klavins called the allegations &#8220;lies&#8221; and said the &#8220;person responsible&#8221; for &#8220;my defamation and persecution&#8221; was his former PhD student <a href="https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/dmitrijs-porsnovs">Dmitrijs Porsnovs</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127339"></span>



<p>&#8220;Presently this case is under investigation within a legal process,&#8221; Klavins added. &#8220;Considering this, I cannot give comments on the case.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the article in <em>Ir</em>, Porsnovs discovered in 2021 that parts of an internal report he had written about the processing of algae for energy production had been <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">published</a> earlier that year by Klavins and others in the journal <em>Agronomy Research</em> – without listing him as an author or citing his work. Porsnovs, who is now a graduate student at the University of Stavanger in Norway, did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>The magazine article includes examples of similar text and identical data in Porsnovs&#8217; report and Klavins’ paper, titled &#8220;Algae processing for energy production: development of waste pyrolysis technology.&#8221; <em>Ir</em> also notes that an ethics committee at the University of Latvia found &#8220;elements containing plagiarism&#8221; in the work of Klavins and his coauthors, according to a Google translation.</p>



<p>The university did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly complained to the journal, which pulled the paper &#8220;due to plagiarism&#8221; on June 20, 2021, according to a note on the retracted article.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Ir</em> also published anonymous allegations from another former student of Klavins accusing the professor of stealing student work on a previous occasion.</p>



<p>Klavins, who is currently a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies/special_issues/R274PNLK26">guest editor of a special issue</a> of the journal <em>Energies</em>, has made perplexing statements to the media. He reportedly told <em>Ir</em> that the paper in <em>Agronomy Research</em> had &#8220;never been published,&#8221; but also claimed that he retracted it himself because it turned out to contain &#8220;erroneous data.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Klavins asserted that the right to use the text in Porsnovs&#8217; report &#8220;belongs to Linnaeus University in Sweden, on whose behalf the study was conducted,&#8221; according to a Google translation of <a href="https://www.tvnet.lv/7747703/lu-profesors-klavins-parmetumus-plagiatisma-sauc-par-apmelojosiem">an article</a> published April 5 by <em>TVNET GRUPA</em>.</p>



<p>A press officer at the university said she was not familiar with the case and referred us to acting university director Thorbjörn Nilsson, who could not be reached.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly harbored suspicions toward the EU-funded research project from the beginning. He has alleged that two of Klavins&#8217; coauthors on the now-retracted paper were &#8220;fictitiously employed&#8221; and that one of them gave part of his salary to Klavins.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have seen with my own eyes several cases of transfer of cash,&#8221; Porsnovs wrote last year in a letter to an ethics committee for the University of Latvia, according to <em>Ir</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Porsnovs is currently involved in extensive litigation with the University of Latvia, the magazine said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">The first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy has been approved for some kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first gene therapy for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The therapy can be used in 4- and 5-year-olds with the degenerative muscle disease, the agency <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-gene-therapy-treatment-certain-patients-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> June 22.</p>



<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common form of the muscle disease, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which normally makes a large protein that acts as a shock absorber to keep muscle cells intact.</p>





<p>Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy don’t make this shock-absorbing protein and “damage themselves literally every time they contract their muscles,” Douglas Ingram, president and chief executive of Sarepta Therapeutics, the company that makes the newly approved gene therapy, said in <a href="https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/elevidys-delandistrogene-moxeparvovec-rokl-fda-accelerated-approval-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conference call</a> discussing the approval.</p>



<p>The disease becomes fatal when heart muscles and muscles that control breathing also deteriorate. About 6 of every 100,000 people in Europe and North America has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It mostly affects males.</p>



<p>The gene therapy is a shortened form of the dystrophin gene. This microdystrophin gene produces a protein about one-third the size of the original protein. The shortened gene is packed into harmless viruses for delivery to muscle cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The therapy “is groundbreaking as it … is designed to target the underlying cause of the disease,” Sharon Hesterlee, chief research officer for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, said in a statement.</p>



<p>Three other companies — &nbsp;<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-doses-first-participant-phase-3-study-duchenne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pfizer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genethon.com/our-pipeline/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genethon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solidbio.com/about/media/press-releases/pathway-development-consortium-announces-publication-in-human-gene-therapy-on-the-application-of-fdas-accelerated-approval-pathway-for-aav-gene-therapies-for-patients-with-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Biosciences</a>&nbsp; — are also developing shortened dystrophin gene therapies to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>



<p>Sarepta won approval by showing that children treated with the gene therapy make the shortened dystrophin protein. But Sarepta hasn’t yet completed an ongoing clinical trial to demonstrate whether the therapy actually works to restore muscle function. Results of that trial are expected this fall.</p>



<p>If the results are disappointing, the FDA or the company could decide to withdraw the therapy from the market. If the data show that the therapy is safe and effective, its use could be expanded to children and people of other ages.</p>



<p>Encouraging results might allow doctors to treat babies shortly after birth before their muscles are damaged, says Jerry Mendell, a neurologist at Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He helped develop the gene therapy and has been conducting the clinical trials sponsored by Sarepta, but said he has no financial stake in the company.</p>



<p>Even better gene therapy for muscular dystrophy is on the horizon, Mendell says. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done now is open the window for treatment for muscular dystrophy, we haven&#8217;t closed it. This isn&#8217;t the end. You&#8217;re going to see many improvements as time goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780393867305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under Alien Skies</a><br><em>Philip Plait</em><br><em>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Why is the sky blue? I remember asking my parents that question as a kid. When the sun’s rays hit the blanket of air that encircles the Earth, they told me, blue light scatters more than other colors. Despite my fascination with the cosmos, I never thought to ask what the sky would look like on other worlds.</p>



<p>Luckily, astronomer and science writer Philip Plait has. His new book, <em>Under Alien Skies</em>, is a bewitching cosmic ride through the solar system and beyond, transporting readers aboard futuristic starships to discover what the sky might look like above faraway landscapes. </p>





<p>Plait is the perfect captain on this expedition, vividly bringing these alien worlds to life while deftly weaving in the science to support the scenery. He even includes explanations of the space suits you’d need to stand and gaze at the skies on the moon, Mars, Pluto and other orbs.</p>



<p>In some cases, it’s not too hard to imagine the views. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">Thanks to rovers</a>, we’ve seen actual images of Mars’ sky (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 20</em>). It’s typically the color of rust, because the Red Planet’s atmosphere is chock-full of dust that tends to scatter red light the most. Pluto’s sky is vastly different. It’s so far away from the sun that, even at midday, the sky is utterly black and the stars are visible. </p>



<p>Contrary to what some articles on the internet say, the sun would not look like any other star in the sky. Standing on Pluto, the sun would appear one-fiftieth its size from Earth’s viewpoint. But it would blaze as a “painfully bright” dot, Plait writes, about 160 times as bright as the moon looks to us, and it would have a faint, deep-blue halo because Pluto’s thin air scatters short, blue wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>One of my favorite stops on Plait’s tour is the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, a two-lobed object shaped like a big rubber ducky. He lands readers on the larger lobe. Looking up toward the sky means seeing the rocks of the smaller lobe. “ ‘Smaller’ seems like the wrong word; it looks like an entire planet hanging over your head,” Plait writes.</p>



<p>Jetting to the smaller lobe, Plait points out a metal pole jutting from the rocks. The pole is attached to a box, turned off-kilter. It’s Philae, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosetta-mission-lander-set-explore-surface-comet">the lander that bounced</a> and crashed on the comet in 2014 (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 13</em>). “Oh Philae,” Plait writes. “It’s so good to see you.” Finding Philae and exploring the aftermath of its crash would show just how fragile the comet is, Plait explains. The lander shattered the rocks it hit on impact, even though it was moving slower than a typical walking speed. The loose rock and ice would appear as wispy as piles of pixie dust.</p>



<p>The book ends with an aptly named final chapter, “The last sky you’ll ever see,” which contemplates the view from close to a black hole. Going inside a black hole is out of the question; you’d be toast. But from a safe distance, a starship can get a good peek with some telescopes — good enough that it feels like you’re hovering just above <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-boundary">the event horizon</a>, the black hole’s point of no return (<em>SN: 5/31/14, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p> Sitting there, you see … nothing. “No, that’s not fair,” Plait writes. After the long journey and the suspense of experiencing such a beast, you’d feel cheated if you saw seemingly empty space. Take a closer look, he says. If you squint, you can make out the rim around the black hole, where stars jostle, and then one slides along the curve of the horizon until its light flickers into that nothingness. You have a front-row seat to see the star’s light being bent by the black hole’s gravity. “It’s mesmerizing, if a bit disconcerting,” Plait writes. </p>



<p>If you could zoom in all the way to the center of the black hole, you’d see even weirder stuff. Exactly what, I won’t reveal; I’ll let you read the book and find out. I highly recommend you do.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-high-altitude-lightning">The Hunga Tonga eruption sparked the highest-altitude lightning ever recorded</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Hunga Tonga volcano eruption continues to break records. Its latest? The highest altitudes that lightning has ever been known to start.</p>



<p>The plume from the eruption <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL102341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced lightning flashes</a> that kicked off 20 to 30 kilometers above sea level, researchers report in the June 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>The explosion of the underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, in the island nation of Tonga, occurred in January 2022. The newly reported stratosphere-scraping flashes join the eruption’s growing list of standout stats, which include producing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">greatest concentration of lightning ever detected and a plume so tall it touched space</a> as well as generating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">a tsunami the size of the Statue of Liberty</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/22; SN: 8/29/22</em>).</p>





<p>Volcanic lightning occurs when colliding ash particles make static electricity. To estimate the altitudes of the eruption’s flashes, volcanologist Alexa Van Eaton and colleagues analyzed data from ground-based lightning detection networks, infrared maps of lightning captured by satellites and satellite images of the plume.</p>



<p>Though some types of lightning can extend much higher into the atmosphere, a lightning flash doesn’t typically get started more than 20 kilometers above sea level. That’s because the air pressure is too low to form “leaders,” the channels of hot plasma that make up the lightning typically seen in thunderstorms.</p>



<p>The rising plume from the eruption may have raised the air pressure enough to create lightning at unusually high altitudes, says Van Eaton, of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.</p>



<p>In the Hunga Tonga eruption data, “we’re seeing stuff that we’ve never seen before,” says Jeff Lapierre, a study coauthor and principal lightning scientist at the company Advanced Environmental Monitoring, based in Germantown, Md. “Hunga has completely changed the way we think of how natural events can change the atmosphere, and the environment where we thought lightning could exist.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-milky-way-phosphorus-habitable">Alien life may be possible even at the Milky Way’s edges</a></h4>

              
                <p>The discovery of phosphorus in a cloud at the edge of the Milky Way has extended the region in our galaxy where life might be found.</p>



<p>Phosphorus is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">one of six essential elements for life on Earth</a>, along with nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur (<em>SN</em>: 12/16/22). Until now, it had been the only one of those elements missing from the farthest reaches of our galaxy. Finding phosphorus that far out could extend the galaxy’s habitable zone out from its center by roughly 22,000 light-years, researchers reported June 8 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Albuquerque. That in turn could motivate astronomers to look in the hinterlands of the Milky Way for planets and any life they might harbor.</p>





<p>The team pointed two radio telescopes at a cool, dusty gas cloud at the edge of the galaxy. The cloud is a frigid –248° Celsius — a mere 25 degrees above absolute zero. It sits about 74,000 light-years from the galactic center, nearly triple the distance Earth is from the Milky Way’s core. And it has signatures of phosphorus monoxide and phosphorus mononitride, astrochemist Lilia Koelemay said at the meeting.</p>



<p>Looking for phosphorus in that distant cloud was a long shot, says astrochemist Lucy Ziurys, Koelemay’s collaborator at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The element is produced only in supernovas. But there’s not a lot of material in the outer Milky Way, so it’s hard to build stars big enough to end their lives in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">massive, element-spewing explosions</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/21</em>). Beyond 49,000 light-years from the galaxy’s center, there is only one supernova remnant known, Ziurys says.</p>



<p>One way phosphorus could have ended up in the outer galaxy is through a supernova closer to the center that launched a &#8220;galactic fountain,&#8221; Ziurys says. “A supernova explodes, the material gets thrown out of the galactic plane, then settles back down near the galactic edge.” The material would be very diluted there, but “if there are different supernovae going off, they&#8217;re going to keep polluting the outer galaxy,” she says.</p>



<p>“The detection of the phosphorus-bearing molecules … seems clear and compelling,” says Francesco Fontani, an astrophysicist at the Italian Institute for Astrophysics in Florence, who was not involved in the study. He has observed <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/04/aa42923-21/aa42923-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the other essential elements for life</a> in the outer galaxy, but never phosphorus.</p>

<p>Because astronomers had not found the six life-essential elements so far from the galactic center, they assumed the region where life could exist in the Milky Way — what’s called the galactic habitable zone — extended at most to the farthest supernova they’d found, about 52,000 light years from the galactic center. There’s an assumed inner edge as well at about 6,500 light-years from the galaxy’s core. The relatively large numbers of supernovas occurring there would expose any planets in the region to intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, making it difficult for life to last for long.</p>



<p>&#8220;This detection, together with previous detections of organic molecules at similar large distances from the galactic center, supports the idea that the outer boundaries of the galactic habitable zone could be wider than what we previously thought,” Fontani says.</p>



<p>For life to emerge so far from the galaxy’s center, planets would need to exist out there. So far, they have been observed only relatively close to the solar system — most within a few thousand light-years. “I don&#8217;t think we know right now whether they can form at larger galactic-central distances,” Ziurys says. Finding the six elements for life at the galaxy’s edge, she says, will hopefully spur on the search for the most distant places where it could thrive.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a financial advisor published a paper purporting to find that his colleagues who had pursued accreditation as “Certified Financial Planners” (CFPs) were more likely to engage in misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the paper didn’t mention: That he had sued the CFP Board, the organization that offered that certification, and given up his own CFP marks “over a dispute regarding the integrity of the CFP Board&#8217;s disciplinary process,” according to a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jfr/fjad005/7102504">correction</a> to the article published in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The editors have determined its disclosure would not have impacted the peer review process, but it has since been added to the article for the benefit of readers,” the notice stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jfr/fjac012/7044787">Badges of Misconduct: Consumer Rules to Avoid Abusive Financial Advisers</a>,” was published in the <em>Journal of Financial Regulation</em> in February. In the abstract, the authors described their findings:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127334"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using an adviser misconduct scoring framework we report specific misconduct ratings for each of the 625,980 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) advisers, finding elevated misconduct for Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) professionals and commission/fiduciary licensees.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors concluded that their findings “suggest that consumers who rely on a single market signal should avoid CFP® professionals if they wish to reduce misconduct risk.” But one of the group’s former collaborators has raised concerns that aspects of the methodology make the findings unreliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s first author and the subject of the correction notice, <a href="https://www.camarda.com/about/team/dr-jeff-camarda/">Jeffrey Camarda</a>, a financial advisor with his own firm in Jacksonville, Fla., told Retraction Watch that “my CFP disciplinary issues are pretty ancient history,” and he considers them “unrelated” to the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Camarda and his wife sued the CFP board alleging the organization had unfairly attempted to <a href="https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional/certification-and-background/f2ebc5b3-5447-48cd-bf66-b75835ebaad3?limit=20&amp;pg=1&amp;lastName=camarda&amp;firstName=jeffrey">discipline them</a>. This attempt, they alleged, amounted to breach of contract, unfair competition and violations of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act">Lanham Act</a>, which established federal trademarks and forbids false advertising. The CFP board, which has not responded to our request for comment, denied the allegations in a legal filing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A judge dismissed the Camardas’ case in 2015 at the request of the CFP board, writing that “Plaintiffs have identified no facts that demonstrate that defendant failed to follow its own procedures… In reviewing a disciplinary action by a private organization, courts do not ‘second-guess’ the organization’s interpretation of its own rules or its evaluation of the evidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Camardas appealed the dismissal, but the appeals court upheld the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2017, after the legal battle ended, the CFP board <a href="https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional/certification-and-background/f2ebc5b3-5447-48cd-bf66-b75835ebaad3?limit=20&amp;pg=1&amp;lastName=camarda&amp;firstName=jeffrey">published</a> its disciplinary findings that the Camardas had misrepresented their advisory business as offering “fee-only” investment management and financial planning. This representation was inaccurate, the board determined, because they had a related business that received insurance commissions, and the businesses paid each other referral fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the process was bullshit,” Camarda told Retraction Watch. “We can demonstrate conclusively we were at all times in compliance with CFP® Board’s rules during the years we were licensed.” He and his wife voluntarily resigned their certifications because they had “lost respect for the integrity of the organization,” he said.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffcamarda/2019/09/23/americas-broken-financial-advisor-promisewhats-wrong-with-the-cfp-board--why-youd-better-check-twice-before-trusting-a-certified-financial-planner/?sh=3a4be61e3712">2019 article</a> for Forbes, titled “America’s Broken Financial Advisor Promise &#8211; What’s Wrong with the CFP Board &amp; Why You’d Better Check Twice Before Trusting a Certified Financial Planner,” Camarda included an extensive disclosure about the CFP Board disciplining him and his wife and their lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Camarda said he didn’t see how his history with the CFP Board was related to his recent paper, because the research wasn’t about the organization’s disciplinary processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, Dan Awrey, a co-managing editor of the <em>Journal of Financial Regulation</em> and professor at Cornell Law School, wrote to one of Camarda’s co-authors in March, asking why the authors had not disclosed the potential conflict of interest as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441">they had in previous work</a>. In response, Camarda elaborated:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research for you is not about CFP Board per se, but about the many factors (13 x 3 measures) that can be correlated to the documented misconduct we presented in the study; less than half of the studied independent variables include the CFP, and I note that some of the findings were actually favorable to CFPs, concluding&nbsp; CFPs with fiduciary investment licenses demonstrated the generally greatest degree of misconduct <em>suppression</em>. I am not really sure what the conflict would be, other than my past association and travails with them – about which <em>I</em> don’t feel conflicted at all. [emphasis original]</p>



<p>After discussion with the other managing editors and Oxford University Press, the journal’s publisher, Awrey wrote back to Camarda with the plan to publish the correction and add the conflict of interest statement to the article, which Camarda approved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to Awrey for comment, and got an auto-reply that he is on sabbatical. We also reached out to co-editor Geneviève Helleringer of the Essec Business School Paris-Singapore and University of Oxford, and did not hear back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his lawsuit’s relevance to an article that critiqued the CFP Board, Camarda told Retraction Watch he wasn’t the only one criticizing the organization, pointing to coverage in the financial press. “It’s not like I’m the lone voice out there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After communicating the decision to publish a correction, Awrey sent Camarda another email on March 27 with the news that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The individual who brought the conflict of interest issue to the attention of the JFR Editorial Board has raised another objection to the paper, this time based on how you and your co-authors count the number of financial advisors in your study.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Awrey quoted a paragraph apparently from the “objection” he had received:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no credible source that claims there are 600,000+ financial advisors in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132052.htm">estimates there are 263,030</a>; Zippia <a href="https://www.zippia.com/finance-advisor-jobs/demographics/">estimates there are 241,225</a>; Cerulli Associates &#8212; largely considered the most reliable industry source &#8212; <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/financial-advisor-headcount-total-addressable-market-tam-technology-hiring-growth/">estimates there are 311,305</a>… The authors knew there are not 626,000 financial advisors. Their own prior work described this issue in great depth. They included 300,000+ non-advisors because it created the illusion they wanted to create.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Camarda responded the next day that he thought the quote from the person who had contacted the journal was “delusional if not deceptive,” and attached papers that he said found similar numbers of financial advisors as he and his coauthors used in their work. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To be clear, our data includes all individuals licensed by FINRA to sell securities on a commission basis: “brokers”. This is the actual regulatory count, not a mere estimate&nbsp; and should trump “estimates” of financial advisors, itself a squishy term that, for instance, often includes CPAs or life insurance sales agents that are not FINRA licensed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On March 30, Awrey wrote back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We really appreciate your continued cooperation. From our perspective, we now consider this matter closed. My sincere apologies for the runaround and any anxiety or frustration it may have caused.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A former collaborator has also publicly raised concerns about the paper’s methodology. Soon after the article was published, Derek Tharp, a CFP and assistant professor of finance at the University of Southern Maine, published a <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/">blog post</a> pointing out issues in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, Tharp wrote that it was likely that less than half of the nearly 626,000 professionals registered with FINRA Camarda and his co-authors analyzed were financial advisors, so the relationship they found between CFP certification and advisory-related misconduct was “a classic spurious correlation.” He cited a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441?journalCode=rael20">paper</a> he had published previously–with Camarda–that had proven the same point about using the FINRA data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is simply untrue to state as fact that our data was so tainted by non-advisors as to be invalid,” Camarda wrote in an extensive <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/#comment-6140601960">comment</a> responding to Tharp’s post. “Even a casual reading of our paper makes clear we only include those with the Series 7 or 6 commission sales licenses all in the industry should appreciate are associated with retail ‘advisors.’”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/#comment-6150062136">reply</a>, Tharp wrote that “your method of limiting an analysis to only Series 6/7-licensed individuals is not remotely sufficient for removing non-advisors from your dataset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Camarda’s response also critiqued the other <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441?journalCode=rael20">paper</a> Tharp cited in the post on which he was a coauthor. The additional data Tharp used to limit FINRA’s list of licensees to only financial advisors was “unreliable” and not suitable for research, Camarda said, and Tharp had thrown out a lot of the data. Camarda sent the critique to Mark P. Taylor, the editor of <em>Applied Economics Letters</em>, which published the paper. He said he had not received a response, and neither did we when we reached out for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Camarda also told Retraction Watch that he was “not happy” his name was on the paper, as he had withdrawn from the research project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tharp disputed that Camarda had withdrawn from the project, and that the data he had used was not good enough for research. As far as the data he excluded, he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The purpose of limiting the sample to only those working solely as financial advisors was not to try and claim that we had provided a comprehensive identification of all advisors within this market. It was to examine whether the observed positive correlation between CFP status and misconduct persisted when the analysis was limited to only those solely working as financial advisors. If we would have found that this relationship persisted, then this would have cast serious doubt on my suspicion that the positive correlation was being driven by a spurious relationship.</p>

<p>On paper, data scientist Gunasekaran Manogaran has had a stellar scientific career. He earned an award as a young researcher from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and landed a series of postdoctoral and visiting researcher positions at universities in the U.S, including the University of California, Davis; Gannon University in Pennsylvania; and Howard University in Washington, D.C. His h-index — a measure of a researcher’s impact and productivity — is 60, a number that by one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283832/">model</a>&nbsp;would mark him as “truly unique” if achieved within 20 years. He did it in fewer than 10.</p>



<p>Emails obtained by Undark<em>,&nbsp;</em>however, suggest some researchers have doubts about his publishing record. The correspondence includes an initial message from someone claiming to have previously worked with Manogaran. It was sent to some 40 editors of scientific journals, many owned by major scientific publishers: Elsevier, Springer Nature<em>,&nbsp;</em>Wiley<em>,&nbsp;</em>and Taylor &amp; Francis among them.</p>



<p>The sender alleges that Manogaran and others run a research paper publishing scam — one that both generates revenues and artificially burnishes the scientific bona fides of individual and institutional participants. In particular, the alleged scheme targets what are known in the scientific publishing industry as “special issues” — self-contained special editions that are not part of a journal’s regular publishing schedule, typically focused on a single topic or theme.</p>



<p>The email, dated April 12, 2022, informs the journal editors that they may have partnered with members of this alleged scheme and urges them to take action. “If you don’t do that there would be a next group doing the same scam in name of different persons,” the email states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parachute-paleontology-science-colonialism-fossils">Paleontology has a ‘parachute science’ problem. Here’s how it plays out in 3 nations</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the Cretaceous Period, roughly 100 million years ago, the dinosaur <em>Ubirajara jubatus</em> probably turned heads with its feathers, shoulder rods and flashy displays. In 2020, the petite theropod made headlines as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fuzz-rods-feathers-first-southern-hemisphere">the first feathered dinosaur discovered in the Southern Hemisphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>Today, the dinosaur is notorious for different reasons: Shortly after the news of its discovery, its backstory quickly drew some red flags.</p>



<p>The fossil had been unearthed in Brazil’s Araripe Basin, yet no Brazilian researchers were involved in its study. The researchers initially said they found the fossil in a Brazilian museum and brought it to a German museum in 1995 for further study, yet that museum later revealed it bought the fossil in 2009 from a private company. That company imported the fossil to Germany in 2006, yet it’s not clear if that import was legal.</p>





<p><em>U. jubatus</em> isn’t unique in this sense. A supposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/museum-fossil-links-snakes-lizards">four-legged, 120-million-year-old snake (<em>Tetrapodophis amplectus</em></a>), for example, also made an unsanctioned trip from Brazil to Germany (<em>SN: 7/23/15</em>). And then there’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-shark-fossil-weird-fins-manta-ray-underwater-flight"> a roughly 90-million-year-old shark (<em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>) from Mexico with a fantastic wingspan</a>, which may have been purchased by a private collector through a legal loophole<em> &nbsp;</em>(<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>These and many other cases of fossil fishiness are part of a long trend of what some call “parachute science” (or in this case “parachute paleontology”) and “scientific colonialism.” </p>



<p>These umbrella terms describe practices where scientists from high-income countries travel to middle- and low-income countries to study or collect fossils and fail to collaborate with or involve local experts. Or they skirt local laws around fossil collection and export. Sometimes the fossils are removed from their home countries under dubious or outright illegal circumstances. In other cases, the scientists purchase fossils from dealers, smugglers or private collectors in their own countries. The trend is linked to the legacy of colonialism, as many of the lower-income countries also happen to be former European colonies, while the higher-income ones are former colonizers.</p>



<p>“We’re talking about 21st century science here … so it shouldn’t be happening. It’s just too much,” says Juan Carlos Cisneros, a paleontologist at Universidade Federal do Piauí in Teresina, Brazil.</p>



<p>When researchers ignore local expertise, obtain fossils illegally or just buy specimens outright, it encourages corruption in communities near fossil beds, discourages early-career scientists from pursuing their profession and can result in unethical or poor-quality research. Illegally traded fossils not only violate the laws of their home countries, but they might also be separated from their geological context or modified by collectors.</p>



<p>To some degree, these practices were long seen as part of <a href="https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/commentary_benefit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how paleontology and geology work</a>, says Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. “I’ve heard it described as a conquest culture, where the Earth is there to be explored and exploited to further advance our understanding of the history of Earth,” she says. While other fields have raised their standards for field research, Dunne and others see paleontology as behind the times.</p>



<p>To understand the extent of parachute paleontology, Dunne and her colleagues compiled a database that tracked where the authors of more than 26,000 fossil publications were based. The team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97 percent of these papers came from researchers based in high- and upper-middle-income countries</a>. The United States, Germany and the United Kingdom top the list of countries with the most publications on foreign fossils, the researchers reported in the February 2022 <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. Some countries’ fossil deposits were also being studied more than others, either because those countries had more funds to do their own research or because foreign researchers wanted to travel there, says coauthor Nussaïbah Raja, a paleobiologist also at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biggest publishers</h3>



<p>The authors of most papers on fossils are from North America and Europe, researchers reported in 2022. The United States leads, with similar amounts of foreign and domestic research. The next three countries — Germany, the United Kingdom and France — all conduct more research abroad than they do domestically. The analysis was based on more than 26,000 publications from <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Paleobiology Database</a> that have author affiliations. The catalog has caveats, however: Submissions are voluntary, which makes it an incomplete picture of the field.</p>

<p>Based on ratios of publications that include local authors and those that don’t, the team developed an index for countries most at risk for parachute paleontology. Those countries include places like the Dominican Republic, Myanmar and Namibia, the team reported in the same study<em>.</em> But the problem is widespread, they found.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At risk</h3>



<p>To measure how parachute paleontology impacts countries, paleobiologist Nussaïbah Raja and colleagues created an index number, based on the ratio of the number of domestic to foreign authors on papers about fossils from those countries. The Dominican Republic and Myanmar, which top the list, are both hot spots for fossils preserved in amber, which have become highly commercialized.</p>

<p>“As soon as you give people cold, hard numbers, they suddenly just turn around and listen. And that was our whole aim,” Dunne says. Researchers used similar methods to dig into how those numbers play out in three countries: Brazil, Mexico and Myanmar. Each country acts as a case study showing a spectrum of the different ways parachute paleontology hurts communities where fossils are found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Brazil</h4>



<p>Brazil passed a law in 1942 that defines fossils as property of the federal government and another law in 1990 that regulates foreign research efforts within the country. The country allows exporting but requires a permit and a partnership with a Brazilian science institution. Commercial trading of fossils within the country is prohibited.</p>



<p>Yet an analysis of papers from 1990 to 2020 on Cretaceous vertebrate and plant fossils discovered in the Araripe Basin showed that over half of those 72 publications described <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossils that ended up in a different country</a>. And of the nearly 60 percent of papers on exported fossils, none mention export permits, Cisneros and colleagues reported in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em> in 2022. While one included details about fieldwork performed by the authors, details on collection permits were lacking.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exported heritage</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-6">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow">
<p>Since Brazil does not allow fossil exports without permission, paleontologist Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at where some of the country’s fossils are housed. They analyzed 72 papers from 1990 to 2020. Each paper described the fossils of a new Cretaceous vertebrate or plant species found in Araripe Basin. The researchers limited their analysis to publications on holotypes, go-to specimens that represent a species, because of the sheer volume of publications on this basin and the importance of those types of fossils to paleontology. The majority of these holotypes are no longer in Brazil, the team found, making it much harder for Brazilian researchers to access them. To study a fossil at a museum in Germany, Cisneros says, “I will be asked for a visa, I will need to spend money in a currency that is six times more expensive than my own.”</p>

<p>Over half of all the publications described fossils that were probably bought, and many did not include local authors. Less than half of the publications were led by Brazilian researchers. Notably, those that were led by local scientists contained fewer issues, such as missing permit information or references to purchasing fossils.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parachute problems</h3>



<p>Brazil also regulates fossil excavations and what happens to specimens after they’re excavated. In their analysis of 72 papers on Cretaceous fossils from Araripe Basin, Cisneros and colleagues looked at the prevalence of different issues linked to parachute paleontology. These issues included whether the study mentions permits to excavate or export the fossil and any evidence that fossils may have been purchased (despite the sale of fossils being illegal in Brazil). The team also looked at whether local paleontologists were involved in or led the work. The most prevalent issues in Brazil appear to be the export of fossils without permission and the purchase of fossils despite local regulations.</p>

<p>The infamous <em>T. amplectus</em> exemplifies many of these trends. Originally <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa9208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a four-legged snake</a>, the fossil was discovered in Brazil and subsequently made its way to Germany without the involvement of Brazilian researchers. The original research team claimed that the fossil was permanently housed in a museum, when in fact it belonged to a private collector, and the researchers could not produce evidence that the specimen had been exported legally. To top it off, a team that included a Brazilian scientist later <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772019.2021.1983044?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;role=tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputed the claim</a> that the ancient critter was even a snake.</p>

<p>To date, the original paper has not been retracted and the fossil remains in Germany. After the specimen was reportedly damaged in a CT scan, the private collector temporarily <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-fossil-of-a-snake-like-lizard-has-generated-controversy-beyond-its-identity-171568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoked access to researchers</a>, and now paleontologists <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/update-controversial-four-legged-snake-may-be-ancient-lizard-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can study</a> the specimen only at the private museum where it’s currently on loan.</p>



<p>“Overall, these [issues] have an effect of making younger generations become less interested in science,” Cisneros says. “Students become frustrated, because they see that foreigners are basically doing their research.” In Brazil, fossils are considered part of the national heritage. When fossils are housed in other countries, he says, it becomes incredibly difficult for local researchers to study their own heritage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mexico</h4>



<p>As in Brazil, fossils are considered property of the federal government in Mexico and cannot be exported permanently without permission or commercially traded. The country also has guidelines for foreign researchers that include working with local scientists.</p>



<p>And yet, many of the issues found with Brazilian fossils <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cropped up here as well</a>, Cisneros, Dunne and colleagues reported in the same 2022 study.</p>



<p>The team focused on 126 publications from 1990 to 2021 on Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils of vertebrates, invertebrates and other species from sites in the Sabinas, La Popa and Parras basins. Nearly half of these studies were not led by Mexico-based researchers. And most were missing information on collection permits, whether they were headed by local or foreign scientists.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common problems</h3>



<p>In their analysis of 126 papers on fossils from select sites in Mexico, Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at the same set of publication issues as they did with papers on fossils from Brazil. In Mexico, paleontology appears to have benefitted from a long history of regulation and enforcement around archaeological artifacts, with generally fewer issues across the board. The country still struggles with specimens ending up in private collections and an absence of collection permit information among work led by both local and foreign scientists.</p>

<p>Unlike in Brazil, most of the fossil specimens in the study range stayed in Mexico. The country’s success in preventing fossil smuggling could simply come down to stricter enforcement, Cisneros says, and a long history of regulation in paleontology’s sister field, archaeology.</p>



<p>Interestingly, compared with Brazilian fossils, a slightly higher fraction of fossils from Mexico ended up in private collections, which present their own access challenges. “In private collections, you depend [on] the goodwill of some millionaire,” Cisneros says. When fossils are sold to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">private owners like millionaires</a> or <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/nicolas-cage-and-leonardo-dicaprio-owned-dinosaur-skulls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood celebrities</a>, scientists lose access, and thus, the ability to study the specimens (<em>SN: 12/2/22</em>).</p>

<p>For fossils from Mexico, Cisneros and colleagues analyzed 126 papers from 1990 to 2021. Each paper described one or more Jurassic or Cretaceous fossils of a vertebrate or invertebrate organism — or nontraditional fossil specimens such as dinosaur tracks or petrified wood — from one of three basins. Compared to Brazil, Mexico appears to have a much better record on illicit fossil export, the team found. Most of the fossils from the publication dataset remain in Mexico. Just one paper describes fossils that were collected in the 1930s and exported to the United States.</p>

<p>The long-finned fossil shark described in 2021 came under scrutiny when researchers initially claimed it was housed in a museum that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-19/mexican-millionaire-builds-controversial-replica-of-mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been built yet</a>; it <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ancient-shark-fossil-exquisite-some-researchers-wonder-if-they-ll-be-able-study-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actually in a collector’s stash</a>. They later updated the paper to say that the shark <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would temporarily be housed</a> in a different museum. The collector also told <em>Science</em> that the rock that contained the fossil had been purchased, not the fossil itself, and that the sale was thus legal.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-aligncenter">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="461" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline3.jpg" alt="Picture of a shark fossil, Aquilolamna milarcae" class="wp-image-3125256" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline3-565x383.jpg 565w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline3-664x450.jpg 664w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline3-274x186.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125256">This fossil of a shark, <em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>, was unearthed in a quarry in northeastern Mexico.

<p>In an ideal world, these fossils would be studied and stored in museums near where they are discovered. “If they go to the to the local museums, they will improve the local economy, the social conditions of the community,” Cisneros says. But even within Mexico, that’s not the case. Many fossils are housed in museums in big cities far from the rock formations where they existed for millions of years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Myanmar</h4>



<p>Myanmar has always been renowned as a source of fossilized insects, plants and reptiles preserved in amber. But in recent years, the country has experienced an extreme case of colonialism in paleontology.</p>



<p>The volume of Myanmar amber publications over the past several decades experienced <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03847-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge spike beginning in 2014</a> that appears to correlate with political shifts in the country, Dunne and colleagues reported in September 2022 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. “It just suddenly explodes,” she says. “And that&#8217;s eye-catching. It gives you a sense that something else is fueling it, rather than just research interest.”</p>



<p>Amber exports exist in a legal gray area because amber is classified as a gemstone, which can be exported legally while fossils cannot. News reports suggest that scientists who study Myanmar amber might buy it across the border in Chinese markets, from dealers or from internet websites. And there are concerns about where the money from those sales ends up.</p>



<p>In 2010, the Myanmar military began taking over the country’s gemstone mines, where amber deposits are often discovered. By 2017, it had complete control. Over the decade or so since, publications on amber fossils started piling up, as have reports of the Myanmar military’s human rights violations and conflicts with ethnic militias. Then in 2021, military leaders staged a political coup and overthrew the government.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conflict fossils</h3>



<p>Around 2014, the worldwide number of papers on fossils preserved in Myanmar amber began to spike, paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues reported in 2022. The timing coincides with some gemstone markets opening near the Chinese border with Myanmar. The trend also tracks with the military’s gradual takeover of gemstone mines beginning in 2010. The increase in paleontologists accessing Myanmar amber through those markets was probably very gradual at first, Raja says. It could have been as simple as “a paleontologist, by coincidence, sees something that&#8217;s really cool, and then [they] tell their paleontologist friends, and then more and more people start going to these markets to find more [amber specimens].” The team opted to look at three-year rolling averages of publications to account for the fact that peer review and publishing takes time.</p>

	>
	</iframe></div>



<p>Both the military and ethnic militias have used these mining operations to fund their operations, and ethical questions about researchers acquiring Myanmar amber specimens began to mount even before the coup. While there’s no paper trail to connect the Myanmar military or militias to amber fossils described in journals, the study rings alarm bells that paleontologists who purchase fossils might be inadvertently helping fund a military coup and human rights violations. “Even if it&#8217;s the tiniest little impact that you&#8217;re making, why make it at all?” Dunne asks.</p>



<p>The authors on Myanmar amber studies published during that spike from 2014 to 2021 were predominantly based outside the country. Even over a broader period from 1990 to 2021, just five out of 872 publications on Myanmar amber included researchers from Myanmar. Over the same period, publications on fossils from Myanmar that were not preserved in amber did not see the same disparity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Local collaboration</h3>



<p>Paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues looked at who was publishing papers on both amber and nonamber fossils from Myanmar after amber publications began to spike in 2014. While local authors were rarely involved in work on amber fossils, they were much more involved in work on nonamber fossils, often primate species. Foreign collaboration with local researchers tends to be more common on nonamber fossil work because those studies often involve fieldwork in remote areas and access to local museum collections. Political conditions in Myanmar have made foreign travel to the country more difficult, so local collaborators make that research possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reversing these research trends <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01472-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have positive ripple effects in Myanmar</a>, two of the study’s coauthors, Myanmarese geologists Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein of the University of Mandalay and Khin Zaw of the University of Tasmania in Australia, wrote in a letter to <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em> in 2021. By working with scientists within Myanmar, “not only will scientific research standards improve within the country, but Myanmar’s people will gain a better understanding of the importance and scientific value of their own natural heritage rather than being robbed of it.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h4>



<p><em>U. jubatus </em>— the flamboyant theropod — might get a happy ending. The journal <em>Cretaceous Research</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667120303736?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew</a> the discovery paper. And after an investigation and public outcry, Germany <a href="https://bnn.de/karlsruhe/karlsruhe-stadt/innenstadt/naturkundemuseum-muss-dino-fossil-an-brasilien-zurueckgeben-ubirajara-jubatus-ministerium-rio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed in July 2022 to return the fossil to Brazil</a>. The fossil <a href="https://www.gov.br/mcti/pt-br/acompanhe-o-mcti/noticias/2023/06/apos-retorno-ao-brasil-fossil-ubirajara-jubatus-e-levado-para-o-ministerio-da-ciencia-tecnologia-e-inovacao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally returned home</a> in June, and <em>U. jubatus </em>will ultimately become part of collections at the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens near where it was first excavated in Ceará, Brazil. “It symbolizes a new phase in the way of doing science with respect for national laws and the rights of societies,&#8221; the museum&#8217;s director Allyson Pinheiro said in a statement. </p>



<p>The field itself hasn’t changed overnight and still has work to do to achieve lasting change. The pressure to publish papers that make splashy headlines, which drives some of this bad behavior, as Dunne notes, isn’t going away.</p>



<p>Many of the same names and foreign institutions keep cropping up in the analyses. In some cases, by purchasing a fossil or failing to get permission from local governments to excavate, those individuals appear to have broken local laws. “Some groups of researchers have always been notorious for conducting parachute science in the most unethical ways. And they just get a free pass by the community,” Dunne laments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="508" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2.jpg" alt="Fish fossils from Brazil sit in a gift shop in a German museum, surrounded by other rocks and trinkets." class="wp-image-3125257" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2-513x383.jpg 513w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2-602x450.jpg 602w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2-249x186.jpg 249w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/032223_ht_parachute-paleontology_inline2-263x197.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125257">These fish fossils (<em>Dastilbe</em> sp.) from the Araripe Basin in Brazil were for sale at a gift shop in the Staatliche Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe in Germany in 2011 — the same museum that acquired the fossilized therapod <em>Ubirajara jubatus</em>.

Cisneros <em>et al</em>/<em>Royal Society Open Science</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Combating the issue will require work on all fronts, Dunne and Cisneros agree: Journals must raise the bar on the information they require on a fossil’s origin and chain of custody; funders need to require that their grant recipients work with local experts and follow the laws of the country where the fieldwork is taking place; governments have to enforce those laws; and foreign researchers should collaborate with and credit their local counterparts.</p>



<p>In response to the recent data, social media campaigns and wider public awareness, some journals have changed their policies to require evidence of a fossil’s origins or necessary permits, but changes have been sporadic. <em>Cretaceous Research</em> previously declared it would not publish studies of fossils with unclear provenance, yet articles about Myanmar amber deposits still appear in that journal. The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology took a strong stance on Myanmar amber, initially issuing a moratorium on publications based on specimens collected after 2017 and later amending it to amber acquired after the coup in 2021, with guidelines for how to handle specimens collected before then. But vertebrates are only one slice of the fossil record, and many amber fossils preserve insects and plants.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01479-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-out moratoriums</a>. Some paleontologists have argued that laws aimed at protecting fossils suppress science by <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/November-2011/Protect-and-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting the number of fossils that are excavated</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/why-palaeontologists-must-break-the-law-a-polemic-from-an-apologi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourage amateur fossil collecting</a>. “If you are in a country that bans fossil collecting and you find a really nice ichthyosaur jaw lying on the beach … are you going to leave it there for the tide to wash it away? The hell you are,” David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England and a coauthor on the <em>U. jubatus </em>paper, <a href="https://www.geocurator.org/images/resources/geocurator/vol10/geocurator_10_10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in <em>The Geological Curator</em> in 2018</a>. </p>



<p>Legal commercialization of fossils in some countries complicates the issue. Raja recalls recently walking into a main street shop in a German city and seeing Moroccan sharks and a Mongolian dinosaur egg for sale just a few doors down from big brands like H&amp;M. While a dealer might have some documentation on the fossil’s legality, it’s hard to say for sure. “It’s really widespread in some countries,” Raja says. “I can go to a shop in Germany and just buy a fossil.”</p>

                <p>One of the most famous messages ever beamed to space was a string of 1,679 bits sent by the Arecibo radio telescope in 1974. But if E.T. sent us such a string, how could we Earthlings even begin to decode it? A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new mathematical approach</a> proposes a way.</p>



<p>For anyone trying to interpret the Arecibo message — a drawing depicting a person, the DNA double helix, the solar system and the telescope itself, among other information — they’d first have to understand that it was an image at all, and that the image was 23 pixels wide and 73 pixels tall. </p>

<p>As it sent the signal, the radio antenna encoded the 1,679 bits by flipping between two different frequencies, representing one and zero respectively. If you line the bits up differently — placing more or fewer than 23 pixels per row — the image looks like a random mess.</p>



<p>We’d face a similar challenge if aliens sent us a message. How would we know the number and size of its dimensions?</p>





<p>The Arecibo scientists built a clue into the transmission: 23 and 73 are prime numbers — a scheme other intelligent life might recognize, if they too find primes to be interesting. But alien messages could come in many forms and have many dimensions, says Brian McConnell, a computer scientist at Notion Labs in San Francisco, and author of <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-74845-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alien Communication Handbook</a></em>. A message might be a database in which each element is not just a value but a list of values, or a list of lists. A message in the form of a physics simulation could include a series of measures for each point in spacetime.</p>



<p>The new decoding method, developed by Hector Zenil, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and the founder of Oxford Immune Algorithmics, and colleagues, takes a string of bits — an incoming message — and looks at every possible combination of dimension number and size. 100 bits, for example, might be 1&#215;100 or 10&#215;10 (two dimensions) or 4x5x5 (three dimensions) or 2x2x5x5 (four dimensions) and so on.</p>



<p>It then looks at each possible configuration’s orderliness in two ways. To get a measure of local order, it breaks the message into patches. For each patch, it searches a catalog of trillions of tiny computer programs the researchers had previously created to explore algorithmic space, and counts how many programs generate an identical patch. (The programs’ outputs were precomputed and saved, making searches fast.) The more programs that create an identical patch, the higher the patch’s score for local order. The patch scores are averaged to get an overall local order score for the entire configuration. The researchers also measure each possible configuration’s global order by seeing how much an image compression algorithm can shrink it without losing information — mathematically, randomness is less compressible than regular patterns. By combining the local and global scores, the researchers have a sense of how likely each configuration is to be the correct one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="213" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg" alt="An image of a black background with a rainbow of different colors scattered across the frame." class="wp-image-3125373" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2-330x103.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125373">Arranging the string of Arecibo bits into an image 73 pixels wide by 23 pixels tall would scramble the intended visuals (color added). But a mathematical approach could still reveal the message.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125373">Jarmo Kivekas/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team tested the method on a version of the Arecibo message that had been expanded to six times its size, so the width was now 138 pixels. In one analysis, the researchers arranged the sequence of bits into images ranging from 0 to 200 pixels across, a subset of possible configurations. Graphing image width on the x axis and the likelihood score on the y axis for each configuration, there were a few sharp spikes, the most prominent at 138. The method showed similar success when parsing other messages encoded as bits, including several other images, an audio file and a 3-D MRI scan.</p>



<p>The new approach could also handle the kind of noise that might be introduced as a message travels through space. In another analysis, the original Arecibo message’s width of 23 pixels stood out even when a quarter of the bits had been flipped from 1 to 0 or vice versa.</p>



<p>“This paper is quite exciting, because what we have shown is that if you have a piece of information that is not completely random, then it actually encodes the original space in which it was intended,” Zenil says. In other words, the message tells you its own geometry.&nbsp;He notes that in Carl Sagan’s sci-fi novel <em>Contact</em>, and the movie based on it, the characters spend a lot of time figuring out that a message received from aliens is in three dimensions (specifically a video). “If you have our tools, you would solve that problem in seconds and with no human intervention.”</p>



<p>Even if aliens send a continuous signal rather than bits, he says, the method could help find the right sampling frequency for digitizing it. It would just add more configurations to try.</p>



<p>“What I like about it is that it’s a mathematically rigorous approach to characterizing a transmission,” McConnell says of the technique, which has not yet been peer reviewed. What’s more, “most of the people in the SETI community” — referring to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — “focus on signal detection. They don’t tend to give a lot of thought to what would come after that.”</p>



<p>SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch, the president of METI International, a nonprofit that studies how we might message extraterrestrial intelligence, notes that the new approach frees prime numbers to serve a secondary purpose in parsing a message. “Instead of being a guide to&nbsp;<em>discover</em>&nbsp;the format, they can now be used to&nbsp;<em>confirm</em>&nbsp;that the decoders found the correct solution,” Vakoch wrote via email.</p>





<p>(“Primes are somehow very special in a mathematical sense,” Zenil notes, “because they can be thought of as a compressed version of the natural numbers.” But there are also other types of interesting numbers to choose from, many listed in the <a href="https://oeis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.)</p>



<p>Of course, even if we could detect and format the message, we’d still need to interpret it correctly. Might a shape indicate an alien body, a spacecraft, an equation or a smudge?</p>



<p>Zenil notes that the approach has potential terrestrial applications, for instance in deciphering intercellular signaling. He’s also already used conceptually similar methods to identify important components in gene regulatory networks — if you perturb one part, does it make the overall system less intelligible? An algorithm that pieces together smaller algorithmic components in order to explain or predict data — this new method is just one way to do it — may also help us one day achieve artificial general intelligence, Zenil says. Such automated approaches don’t depend on human assumptions about the signal. That opens the door to discovering forms of intelligence that might think differently from our own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are actively recruiting a Co-Editor-in-Chief for <em>Complex Systems</em>. Stay tuned for announcements from the journal!<br></p>



<h3><strong>Extending our mission to new communities</strong></h3>



<p>We see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> as an opportunity to give evolving research communities opportunities to forge a new path for research in the field. Whether that means welcoming new ways of sharing research transparently, or cementing new policies that enable research to be evaluated and rewarded more fairly, or simply finding a broader audience where research can make a greater real-world impact.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I&rsquo;m really excited to deepen our work with the research communities and stakeholders who will be a part of these journals. We have worked intentionally with these communities of researchers who have shared a need for venues that do more than help researchers share their work. Our journals will provide a space for experts of different disciplines to come together, to spark important discussions, and to explore and shape Open Science practices that will drive the field forward.</em></p><cite>Rebecca Kirk<br>Publisher, Portfolio Development</cite></blockquote>



<p>Our new journals will encourage open-sharing behaviors that support rigor, reproducibility, and rapid dissemination of research. And we&rsquo;ll hold ourselves accountable for that progress. As with all PLOS journals, we&rsquo;ll offer opportunities for authors to share preprints, improve access to data and transparency of methodologies, and choose to publish their peer reviews. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a> will allow us to establish benchmarks for open-sharing behaviors in these fields for the first time, and to track changes over time to test whether our solutions are working.</p>



<p>We also very much want researchers to be active partners in shaping how we do this in responsible and inclusive ways that fit the needs of the community. We look forward to engaging with these stakeholders more deeply and working with them in evolving the new titles, as we have across our portfolio.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Enabling equitable opportunities to participate</strong></h3>



<p>A key element of expanding openness for PLOS is in bringing diverse voices together. Inclusivity and equity are core to a strong foundation of Open Science, and we need to hear from all perspectives in order to make science, the process of publishing science, and the solutions science inspires, more robust. <em>PLOS Mental Health</em> and <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> will strive to represent research from local experts around the world, and from across various disciplines.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also exploring which of our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">APC-alternative models</a> best serve the researchers who will publish in <em>PLOS Mental Health </em>or <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em>. We guarantee each journal will provide a mechanism for institutional support that enables more authors to publish Open Access, regardless of personal funding resources.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h3><strong>How you can get involved</strong></h3>



<p>As we build these journals, we&rsquo;ll be getting to know our new Editors-in-Chief, recruiting Editorial Board members from a diverse range of disciplines, and learning more about how we can best meet the needs of researchers in these communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the journals, applying to join the Editorial Board, or signing up for news and updates you can learn more by visiting our websites for <a href="https://plos.org/mental-health-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Mental Health</em></a> or <a href="https://plos.org/complex-systems-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Complex Systems</em></a>. </p>

<p>A journal co-published by two scientific societies is retracting nearly 80 papers after an “investigation into peer review fraud.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-electronic-imaging?webSyncID=eb6ce194-2379-30c5-2b52-a0c6e1339127&#038;sessionGUID=bdb0d55a-7e92-b7b9-9973-be69d5b3c006"><em>Journal of Electronic Imaging</em></a> is retracting the articles – all originally published in special sections between 2021 and 2023 – starting this week. The journal is co-published by &#8220;SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics,&#8221; and IS&amp;T, the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.</p>



<span id="more-127328"></span>



<p>According to a <a href="https://spie.org/news/journal-of-electronic-imaging-to-retract-papers?SSO=1">press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publishers found evidence of large-scale manipulation of the peer review process, including fake reviewer accounts, repeating reviewers, and generic reviewer reports throughout different special sections. In addition, many out-of-scope papers were discovered to have been published in these special sections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A review by external experts also:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>identified many instances of poorly formed experiments, out-of-date references, evidence of AI-generated language, and limited datasets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the release, Gaurav Sharma, vice president of publications at IS&amp;T and former editor in chief of the journal, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manipulation and subversion of the JEI peer review process by a handful of bad actors is deplorable, and we will not let them profit from their shameful actions. We will sanction the perpetrators and correct the scholarly record. We have also added new safeguards in our processes to thwart any future attempts at peer review manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The case is just the latest to shine a spotlight on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">special issues</a>, which seem vulnerable to paper mills. Such operations sell whole papers and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">authorships</a>.</p>

                <p>Note: This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the 3rd in a series of four blogs posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>In my earlier blogs, I centered the discussion around how overcoming institutional inertia and Open Science practices can be drivers in how we can collectively change the scholarly publishing industry for the better. But a large question remains. Better for whom? We tend to think that the US and the EU are &lsquo;centers of the universe&rsquo; for scientific knowledge.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>You can probably tell where I am going with this. Too much of the discussion about transitioning to Open Science frames these problems in the context of the Global North. There are global challenges in scholarly publishing that must be addressed. That&rsquo;s why PLOS is also focused on supporting new models for global recognition and inclusion.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.inasp.info/">International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications</a> recently released a study to understand the challenges and opportunities that Open Access (OA) presents to low- and middle-income countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While stakeholders believe that they clearly benefit from OA, the picture that emerges is significantly more complicated. There&rsquo;s a clear conflict between a desire to strengthen local platforms that better serve local needs and feeling pulled to &ldquo;play the game&rdquo; in which norms have been set by the Global North. I mentioned a crop scientist in Africa in my first blog. This is exactly the problem she ran headlong into.</p>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve begun to deepen our work with global research communities at PLOS, our approach is centered on listening, learning, and building together. Most critically, we know that our strategy and business models cannot be separated from our drive toward equity.</p>



<p>A rigid approach to Open Science won&rsquo;t foster equitable participation<strong> </strong>from all communities. We need to be malleable, so we&rsquo;ve designed our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> so that they:<strong></strong></p>



<p>o&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Represent diverse communities of Open Science practice</p>



<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Have inclusive publishing criteria and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">editorial policies</a></p>



<p>o<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/">Share costs more equitably</a> and factor in countries ability to pay</p>



<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a couple of examples.</p>



<p>The first is our work over the past few years to develop new business models for Open Science that move us away from APCs. Those are Article Processing Charges, a fee that authors pay to publish &ndash; instead of a subscription to read.</p>



<p>Back when PLOS was launched and focused in the biomedical sciences, charging authors a fee to publish seemed fair and reasonable. Those authors were awarded huge grants and if a nominal fee meant that anyone could read and reuse the paper, it was a price worth paying.</p>



<p>But we failed to anticipate how successful APCs would become, how commercial publishers would exploit this space, and how inequitable they would become. Waivers would not solve the problem. Continuing down an APC path will further disenfranchise researchers in less generously funded fields, as well as those in low- and middle- income countries and risks deepening existing inequality.</p>



<p>So, we&rsquo;ve chosen a different path. When we launched our new titles last year, we introduced our new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity Model.</a> This model provides a pathway for institutions to cover the cost of unlimited publications for their authors and eliminate APCs. What makes it different is that fees for each institution are adjusted by World Bank lending tier groups to be more reflective of <em>their </em>regional economy. The Global Equity model systematically acknowledges economic differences. It offers an appropriate solution so that authors in these regions do not need to <em>ask </em>for assistance, they are simply included.</p>



<p>We still have a robust <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/">publication fee assistance program</a> for any researcher who cannot afford APCs. But we hope that as our partnerships with institutions expand, this will no longer be the <em>only</em> recourse available to researchers<strong>, </strong>merely a backup option.</p>



<p>A second example is our policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research conducted in other communities. And to limit an action coined as<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> &ldquo;Parachute Science.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>&ldquo;Parachute science&rdquo; is a term describing how researchers sometimes drop down from an ivory tower in the wealthy Western world into a foreign community for field work. They gather their data, and then zip off home without engaging with or acknowledging the contributions of the local researchers.</p>



<p>This disparity has been reported as far back as 2 decades. One study illustrated that only 6.5% of research articles in general medical journals had a coauthor from the country where the study population lived. I find that number shocking, even if it is now somewhat dated.</p>



<p>The PLOS policy requires information about ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations as well as local authorship. This information is shared with editors and reviewers to help assess whether the research meets the PLOS&rsquo; standards for research integrity.</p>



<p>Our policy has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe and includes multiple research areas. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area. And I&rsquo;m delighted to say that several other publishers have reached out for our advice, and have implementing similar policies for their titles, most recently <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife">eLife.</a></p>



<p>There is also an important role for local solutions. Let&rsquo;s return again to that crop scientist in Africa. She decided to publish her findings in an African journal. The improved visibility and accessibility of her research influenced the Kenyan government in developing nutrition schemes for schools. Other African governments have also adopted the schemes. In a significant irony, wealthier countries are now adopting these nutrition findings to support balanced diets.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to publish Open Science research is only one part of the equation. Next month, I&rsquo;ll talk about what comes next with regards to how we can better change scholarly publishing for all researchers.</p>
