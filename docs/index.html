<p>On Feb. 18, a researcher in Italy sent a disgruntled email to the editorial board of a Wiley tourism journal. <a href="https://docenti.unisi.it/it/salvatorebimonte">Salvatore Bimonte</a> had waited more than a year for his manuscript to be peer-reviewed, he complained, and then months more while the editor-in-chief was “actively working on” the revised version Bimonte submitted. </p>



<p>When Bimonte’s paper was finally rejected after 18 months — for reasons such as the topic not being “highly suitable” and the work not being submitted in the form of a case study — the researcher felt compelled to vent his frustration to the entire editorial board of the <em>International Journal of Tourism Research</em> (<em>IJTR</em>).</p>



<p>“Maybe, I would have been treated better if I had cited some of the editor in chief&#8217;s papers,” Bimonte, of the University of Siena, wrote in boldface in the email, which we have seen. Two days later, an unhappy editor at the journal quit, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<span id="more-134271"></span>



<p>Since May 2023, the editor-in-chief of <em>IJTR </em>has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260221200950/https:/www.proftimothylee.org">Timothy J. Lee</a>. A professor at Macau University of Science and Technology in Macao, Lee <a href="https://timothylee.academia.edu/cv">promotes</a> that he’s among the world’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=jL-XuJQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra">top-cited</a> researchers in 2025, and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=search_authors&amp;hl=en&amp;mauthors=label:health_%26_wellness">number one</a> citation-reaper in the category “Health &amp; Wellness” on Google Scholar. He is a member of the editorial boards of “<a href="https://www.proftimothylee.org/about">12 leading academic journals</a>” and was the editor-in-chief of Taylor &amp; Francis’ erstwhile <em>International Journal of Tourism Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>For several years before Lee took the helm at <em>IJTR</em>, his research — on topics like the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212571X21000512?via%3Dihub">the economic value of urban forest parks</a>” and the “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.2477">influence of historical nostalgia on a heritage destination’s brand authenticity</a>” — received a small, but steady, trickle of citations in the journal he now oversees.</p>



<p>In 2024, that trickle became a gushing river.</p>



<p>A Retraction Watch analysis of data from Clarivate’s Web of Science shows that of the 186 papers the <em>IJTR </em>published that year, 134, or nearly three-fourths, cited Lee’s work, often multiple times. The editor’s outsize influence continued through 2025 and has held up so far this year as well. Excluding self-citations, a total of 55% of the papers published in <em>IJTR </em>from 2024 until today contain references to Lee’s research. That’s a “staggering” number, according to <a href="https://docenti.unisi.it/en/albertobaccini">Alberto Baccini</a>, a colleague of Bimonte at the University of Siena, who studies publication metrics. Baccini said he had not seen a similar citation pattern at any other journal.</p>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/27812986"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27812986/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="visualization" /></noscript></div>



<p>When first reached for comment, Lee told us that, “because the journal has been in transaction [sic] for a couple of years, the stat figures are not particularly stable or objectively reliable.”</p>



<p>“Just do not judge numbers based on a very subjective sample population over a short period of time,” he added.</p>



<p>After we sent him our full analysis, Lee explained that since he was “one of the very few editors of top-tier academic journals in the tourism discipline,” he had been invited to give lectures at “many mainland Chinese universities.”</p>



<p>“Over the last 2 to 3 years, half of all submitted papers came from China, and many were of high quality and suitable for publication,” he added. “Although I do NOT tell them to do so in an invited lecture, there was a strong myth among many Chinese researchers that, to be accepted, they had to cite papers published by the journal&#8217;s editor, and many papers published by Chinese authors cited my articles.”</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher is aware of the concerns about citation patterns at <em>IJTR</em>. Wiley has “introduced an additional layer of screening in this journal to evaluate papers before proceeding to publication,” the spokesperson said by email. “We are working closely with the editor-in-chief to ensure that best practices are being followed.”</p>



<p>Many of the authors who cited Lee are indeed based in China, often at Lee’s own institution, the Web of Science data show. But dozens work in other countries, including South Korea, United States, Malaysia, England and Turkey. All told, 107 of the 218 citing papers, or 49%, published from 2024 until today do not include an author in China.</p>



<p>Baccini said because the citations go to Lee’s work, wherever it may be published, the editor is the primary beneficiary, “not the journal.” While there is no evidence Lee coerced anyone to cite his work, Baccini added, such “evidence is nearly impossible to obtain because peer review is a completely secret process. Unless authors come forward to declare they were pressured to cite the editor-in-chief, the scientific community remains in the dark.”</p>



<p>For <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tx7FRYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Juan Gabriel Brida</a>, an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15221970/homepage/editorialboard.html">editor at <em>IJTR</em></a> and an economist at Universidad de la República in Montevideo, Uruguay, Bimonte’s email became the last straw. He resigned on February 20 over what he called Lee&#8217;s “poor management” of the journal. Lee “doesn&#8217;t involve other members of the editorial board, and articles sit for over a year before receiving reviews,” Brida told us.</p>



<p>Lee did not comment on Bimonte’s case, but said Brida and another editor who resigned before Bimonte’s email had “their own personal reasons to resign. They are not as fast as I am. I am finalising many papers this month instead of waiting for them to complete the process. Also, I plan to recruit another 5 new associate editors in a couple of months; almost 10 very good candidates worldwide applied. Once they are recruited, we will achieve very good teamwork and harmony among us.”</p>



<p>“I have a monthly meeting with Wiley staff at the end of each month to update and discuss current issues,” Lee added. “There has been a major change to the submission and review system at my journal over the last 12 months, which has also caused delays in the process. The number of submitted papers has almost tripled in the last 3 years.”</p>



<p>According to a machine translation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260223122714/https:/fhtm.must.edu.mo/id-1718/article/view/id-2335.html?locale=zh_CN">a press release</a> from Macau University celebrating Lee’s appointment to editor-in-chief, the professor’s “stated goal” was “to elevate the journal&#8217;s ranking to Q1 in [Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports] within the next three years, with an impact factor exceeding 10.”</p>



<p>Lee “encourages faculty and students of the Macau University of Science and Technology&#8217;s School of Hotel and Tourism Management to cite IJTR articles as extensively as possible in their academic works and to promote the journal to colleagues and students worldwide,” the press release stated.</p>



<p>To Baccini, the case illustrates what the publish-or-perish mantra has done to science: “This system has transformed the role of editorial boards – and especially editors-in-chief – from gatekeepers for the scientific community into operatives for publishers, rewarded for boosting metrics.”</p>

We reported at that time two of his papers were retracted from <em>Heart and Circulatory Physiology</em> at the request of the university, and that university officials had requested a third retraction. Thanks to a public records request, we now have access to the university’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20231120-Final-Investigation-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">2023 final investigation report</a>, which provides us much more information. </p>



<p>The released material shows a committee of the university’s research integrity officers found Ilangovan responsible for manipulating images in three papers. OSU redacted the total number of images in question, but the investigators deemed it “very concerning.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134246"></span>



<p>Ilangovan “failed to take any responsibility” for issues with the data, the report reads, and the committee requested he attend the PI Program through Washington University in St. Louis within one year. That program teaches researchers “decision-making skills, good lab leadership and management practices, and basic rules-of-the-road for the responsible conduct of research,” <a href="https://integrityprogram.org/">according to its homepage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p>In 2022, 14 months before the report was finalized, Ilangovan requested the misconduct proceedings be terminated “without an admission,” according to the document. Despite being shown “overwhelming evidence that there were serious issues” with his papers, Ilangovan maintained the validity of his papers’ conclusions.</p>



<p>“The primary concern for a scientist should be the integrity of the published research record and in these circumstances, the voluntary retraction of the questioned publications would be expected,” the research integrity officers wrote. They expressed “significant concerns that additional training will have a meaningful impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>C.K. Gunsalus, an expert on university research misconduct, told us sending someone to remedial training makes sense for “certain kinds of problems that are, in fact, remedial: recordkeeping, some supervision practices, compliance issues, time management, etc.” We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/08/poll-should-researchers-guilty-of-misconduct-go-to-rehab/">reported</a> in 2016 a three-day “researcher rehab” had a “lasting impact” on scientists with shortcomings like these, with the “vast majority” changing how they work in the lab.</p>



<p>Although she called OSU’s research integrity committee &#8220;diligent in the investigation itself,&#8221; Gunsalus said &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty odd that they&#8217;re saying we have concerns about this person&#8217;s commitment to fundamental integrity and so we think he ought to get management and logistics help.”</p>



<p>The committee &#8220;seems to have made some judgments and then flinched at the consequences,” said Gunsalus, Director of the National Center for Principled Leadership &amp; Research Ethics and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Booker, OSU’s director of media and public relations, told us Ilangovan is no longer affiliated with the university and would not comment further on the personnel matter. An email sent to Ilangovan’s OSU email address bounced back, and he did not respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>A representative for Washington University told us they could neither confirm nor deny whether Ilangovan attended the remedial program, because “clients and all information related to study participation is strictly confidential.” Similarly, Booker would not comment on whether Ilangovan attended the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the PI training, the OSU investigation committee recommended a three-person OSU panel review all Ilangovan’s data for grants and papers for three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Ilangovan’s two now-retracted papers had a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_COR">correction</a> in 2021 for a figure that was “inaccurate because of the reuse and relabeling,” as we previously reported. The recently obtained investigation report indicates Ilangovan falsified data in that correction.</p>



<p>The identity of the third paper OSU said should be retracted, as well as details of the investigation pertaining to the article, are redacted from the report. However, footnotes in both the 2022 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20220907-Final-Inquiry-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">preliminary inquiry</a> (which we also obtained through a public records request) and the final 2023 investigation report cite a December 2019 PubPeer comment, and only one of Ilangovan’s papers has drawn a PubPeer comment matching that description: a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/111/1/74/1744883">2016 article</a> appearing in <em>Cardiovascular Research.</em> The <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C0671222DAAB88141BC447719CA6">anonymous commenter</a> pointed out possible “[d]uplicate images representing different experimental groups.” </p>



<p>Booker did not respond when we asked whether the university requested retraction of the <em>Cardiovascular Research</em> paper. Tomasz Guzik, the editor-in-chief of the journal, also did not respond when we asked if he had heard from the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three papers together cite just shy of $1 million in National Institutes of Health grant funding given to Ilangovan. He told the investigating committee the grants were cited in the two retracted papers “just to describe the use of some equipment and other resources of the funded projects as used to carry out the experiments,” according to the 2022 inquiry report.</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-ohio-state-university-decided-go-public-about-misconduct">we reported in <em>Science</em></a> that, following criticisms about transparency failures, OSU proactively released materials about another researcher guilty of misconduct. In that case, the committee recommended the retraction of eight papers.</p>

<p>Racking up <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLouis%252c%2bHitler">35 retractions</a> in just 24 months, chemist Hitler Louis has scored a place on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers at issue, most of them published in Elsevier and Royal Society of Chemistry journals, exhibit a variety of problems, according to the retraction notices: identical plots supposedly representing different chemical systems, self-citations multiplying between manuscript submission and publication, compromised peer review and fundamental errors in chemical analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Louis – who also goes by Louis Hitler Muzong – did not respond to Retraction Watch’s requests for comment. Until recently, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-hitler-50115273">his LinkedIn page</a> named him as a Ph.D. student in computational chemistry at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom, with an expected completion date of October 2027. But retraction notices for two papers say Louis requested his Leeds affiliation be removed. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X24000343">states</a> “the research described in the article is not associated with that institution,” and the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11976393/">other</a> that the affiliation “was given incorrectly.” The University of Leeds did not respond to a request to verify whether he was a student there.</p>



<span id="more-134232"></span>



<p>Since we sent him questions, Louis’ LinkedIn profile appears to have been scrubbed. It no longer includes mention of Leeds, nor does it include previously listed affiliations to the University of Calabar in Nigeria or the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Now, the page identifies him only as working in chemistry in Nigeria. According to his profiles on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=REjDFWYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en#:~:text=Computational%20and%20Bio%2DSimulation%20Research%20Group%2C%20University%20of,9347%E2%80%AC%E2%80%AC%20%2D%20%E2%80%AADensity%20functional%20theory%E2%80%AC%20%2D%20%E2%80%AANanotechnology%E2%80%AC">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Louis-Hitler-Lab#:~:text=About%20the%20lab,Molecular%20Docking%2C%20MD%20Simulation%20etc.">ResearchGate</a>, however, Louis is a researcher in the Computational Chemistry and BioSimulation Research Group at the University of Calabar.</p>

<p>The most frequently named issue in the 35 retraction notices is that the authors use the same plots to represent different chemical systems, with duplications occurring in a single paper or across papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Innocent Benjamin, who appears as a coauthor with Louis on 19 of the retracted papers, graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a master’s in biology and biotechnology in 2025, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/innocent-benjamin-mrsc-mnsm-macs-/">his LinkedIn profile</a>. Benjamin told us editorial concerns about image duplication “were largely centred on figure presentation and interpretation, not on fabrication of computational data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was no intent to misrepresent results,” he wrote. “The issue concerned visual presentation and interpretability rather than generation of artificial data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In at least eight of the retractions, named problems include citation manipulation. By the time one paper went from submission to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12675098/">publication in <em>Heliyon</em></a>, the authors had added 28 citations that were “not relevant to the topic of the paper and benefit authors,” including Louis, according to the retraction notice. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023078908">another <em>Heliyon</em> paper</a>, between submission and publication, self-citations for Louis increased from seven to 38 and from two to nine for Benjamin. And in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023052751">a third Heliyon paper</a>, self-citations jumped from one to 14 for Louis and from two to 11 for Benjamin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices state the authors were asked to explain why these references were added but were unable to give satisfactory answers. Benjamin told us that the references were included to provide context within their stream of research.</p>



<p>Two of the retraction notices also point to compromised peer review. These include <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023052751">one in <em>Heliyon</em></a><em> </em>in which reviewers had asked for redundant references to their own papers, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X24000343">another in <em>Computational and Theoretical Chemistry</em></a><em>, </em>where editors expressed “significant doubts about the objectivity and thoroughness of the reviews conducted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of these journals, said the reviewers had provided “biased and inaccurate reviews,” resulting in “flawed” articles. “It was subsequently determined that the issues identified warranted retraction rather than a corrigendum,” the spokesperson said. Twenty of Louis’ 35 retractions come from Elsevier journals. The spokesperson said they found out about the issues from a whistleblower and that investigation is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021016479">One <em>Heliyon</em> retraction notice</a> identified “substantial” changes in authorship during the editorial process. Between submission and publication, five authors were added and one removed without adequate explanation or proof those added were qualified for authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several more of the retraction notices identify problems with the science. One paper retracted from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667022424000033"><em>Chemical Physics Impact</em></a> included incorrect chemistry, and the authors claimed in the abstract to have analyzed UV spectroscopy data — an analysis which wasn’t included in the paper or the supplementary information. Another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-23572-0">retracted paper</a> from <em>Scientific Reports</em> had basic errors related to the conversion of units and incorrect calculations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retractions that include Benjamin, Louis’ frequent coauthor, date to August 2024, when Benjamin was a student at the University of Portsmouth. A spokesperson for that institution told us, “The retractions you reference relate to publications outside the scope of [Benjamin’s] degree studies,” adding the university only investigates conduct related to work for a specific degree.</p>



<p>Benjamin said he is “cooperating fully” with ongoing investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While retractions are serious matters, they are part of the self-correcting structure of science,” he said. “As a relatively young researcher, I remain committed to research integrity and to maintaining rigorous methodological standards in all ongoing and future research.”</p>
