              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antidote-death-cap-mushrooms">Scientists may have found an antidote for death cap mushrooms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Death cap mushrooms get their name for a reason: The poisonous fungi can kill if ingested in even small amounts. But researchers may have found an antidote for one of the mushroom’s most deadly toxins.</p>



<p>A dye already used in medical procedures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37714-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can block damage from the mushroom’s alpha-amanitin toxin</a>, researchers report May 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The work was done with human cells grown in lab dishes and with mice. If the finding holds up in trials with people, the antidote has potential to save lives.</p>





<p>Death cap mushrooms (<em>Amanita phalloides</em>) are responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6621a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the majority of deaths from mushroom poisonings</a> worldwide. Symptoms may appear as soon as six hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If a person isn’t treated immediately, the toxins can cause liver and kidney damage that can lead to death within 48 hours after ingestion. There is no antidote currently available, but people can be treated with fluids, activated charcoal and other therapies.</p>



<p>How alpha-amanitin kills isn’t fully understood. A team of researchers in China and Australia used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9</a> to determine which human genes the toxin triggers to cause cell damage and death (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). One of those genes makes a protein called STT3B, which helps attach sugars to proteins. Scientists hadn’t known that that process was important for mushroom toxicity.</p>



<p>The team then screened a library of more than 3,000 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for molecules that could inhibit STT3B’s action. The team found that the dye indocyanine green could stop the protein from doing its job and prevent human cells in lab dishes from dying after being treated with alpha-amanitin.</p>



<p>In tests with mice poisoned with alpha-amanitin, the dye reduced liver and kidney damage and increased survival rates if given one to four hours after poisoning. Waiting eight to 12 hours to administer the antidote reduced its effectiveness, the team found, probably because irreversible organ damage had already occurred.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant emerging science—free  of charge, arXiv relies on members to support our mission with funding and expertise. The membership program is inclusive and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible, and complements arXiv’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">other funding sources, including affiliates and sponsors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  arXiv members—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">universities, libraries, research institutes, and labs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—contribute approximately 30% of arXiv&#8217;s operating budget, and this critical funding ensures arXiv&#8217;s ability to serve the global research community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A benefit of arXiv membership is access to an institution-specific </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard, containing an overview of the articles an institutions’ researchers have posted on the platform, including a subject category breakdown. We are happy to report that updated membership dashboards, based on data from 2020-2022, are now available to arXiv member institutions. In addition, </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/reports/2022_institution_submissions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated worldwide submission ranks by organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are openly available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information on how to access the dashboards has been provided to member institutions by email.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Member institutions who did not receive notification or who have questions about the dashboard should contact </span><a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">membership@arXiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your institution is not a member, find out about membership benefits and <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html">how to join here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated annually, the dashboards help institutions build a more holistic picture of the research activities taking place across their campuses. Members will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. For institutions, particularly librarians, this level of detail helps them to understand and report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. Importantly, arXiv helps institutions fulfill their mission of expanding access to scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As was the case in 2022, arXiv is using processed data from  </span><a href="https://www.scopus.com/home.uri"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scopus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deliberate-ignorance-knowledge-stasi">Deliberate ignorance is useful in certain circumstances, researchers say</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1961, renowned German novelist Günter Grass openly criticized communist East Germany for building the Berlin Wall ostensibly to prevent West Germans from infiltrating the country. In reality, the wall was more effective at preventing East Germans from defecting.</p>



<p>From that point on, East German secret police known as the Stasi shadowed Grass, a West German who frequently visited his neighbors to the East. In their notes, the Stasi refer to Grass with the code name “Bolzen,” or Bolt. When Germany was reunited in 1990, the Stasi’s file on Bolzen contained over 1,200 pages.</p>





<p>While extreme, Grass’ case was not unique. For 40 years, the Stasi wiretapped homes, bugged phones and encouraged people to come forward with information about potential government dissenters. Today, the Stasi Records Archives, housed throughout Germany, are so vast that if measured end to end, they would span 111 kilometers.</p>



<p>Following the reunification of Germany, government leaders made those records public. They assumed that most people living in former East Germany would want to find out if a file on them existed and, if so, read it. Knowledge, it was widely believed, would help people reclaim their life stories.</p>



<p>The East German regime controlled so many aspects of people’s lives, says cognitive psychologist and decision scientist Ralph Hertwig of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. Officials could decide whether someone in the country could go to university, or get a person fired from their job without explanation. They could arrest people in stealth so that their loved ones had no way of knowing where they had gone. Why would people not want to know what prompted such decisions or, perhaps, who betrayed them?</p>



<p>“At first glance, it seems there are many good reasons to want to find out,” Hertwig says.</p>



<p>That sentiment aligns with the conventional wisdom that knowledge tends to be always beneficial or desirable, say Hertwig and others. But that’s not what he and historian Dagmar Ellerbrock of the Technische Universität Dresden in Germany learned.</p>



<p>More people did not read their files than read them, the researchers found in an unpublished survey of over 2,300 residents of former East Germany. In a new paper, the team surveyed 134 former East Germans who opted out of reading their files to better understand their rationale. That survey, along with in-depth interviews with another 22 participants, revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722002359#:~:text=Our%20findings%20reveal%20a%20diverse,system&#039;s%20authority%20over%20the%20files." target="_blank" rel="noopener">people deliberately, rather than passively, chose ignorance</a>, the scientists reported in the December <em>Cognition.</em> &nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding aligns with other research showing that, under certain conditions, deliberate ignorance about certain matters also has merit.</p>





<h4>‘A veil of ignorance’ can be useful</h4>



<p>Imagine having to create a society from scratch, but with a hitch. You know nothing about yourself —&nbsp; such as your gender, economic status, nationality, education level or even appearance. What if you create a patriarchy and find out you’re female, or you block immigration only to find out you are an immigrant yourself? U.S. philosopher John Rawls developed this thought experiment in his 1971 book <em>A Theory of Justice </em>to show how operating behind a “veil of ignorance” could lead to a fairer society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The veil of ignorance is the idea that sometimes … knowledge may distract us, may bias us,” Hertwig says.</p>



<p>That thought experiment has played out in various ways in real life. For instance, in a seminal study, economists showed how creating a veil of ignorance around hiring decisions can override human bias. That is, placing music directors behind a shield — a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.90.4.715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literal veil of ignorance</a> — during auditions led to substantially more women gaining a seat in symphony orchestras, researchers reported in 2000 in the <em>American Economic Review.</em></p>



<p>In a similar vein, many East Germans chose their own veil of ignorance to protect themselves and others, Hertwig and Ellerbrock’s research suggests.</p>



<p>A survey of the 134 individuals who chose not to view their files revealed that more than 75 percent of participants cited the information as irrelevant because the past couldn’t be changed and thus didn’t need to be revisited. Over half said they did not want to know if their informants included colleagues, family or friends. And roughly 30 percent of respondents doubted their files would even reflect the truth. In effect, by denying the Stasi claim to their story, people stripped the regime of their power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That appears to have been Grass’ stance. “These Stasi files were like a poison because they were seen as valid documents. What they said had to be true,” Grass once said. “People trusted the statements and did not consider that large parts were exaggerated or even made up.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Choosing not to know</h3>



<p>After the fall of East Germany, officially known as the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, people were given access to the files kept on them by the East German secret police, the Stasi. But many chose not to read them. Researchers surveyed 134 individuals to find out why, offering 15 reasons. Here are the top 10 listed by percentage of individuals who cited each one.</p>

<h4>Why do people choose ignorance?</h4>



<p>The findings enhance a growing body of work by psychologists to understand when and why people choose to seek knowledge or, conversely, to remain ignorant.</p>



<p>In a study posted in January 2020 in <em>Nature Human Behaviour, </em>researchers suggested that people consider<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0793-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> three specific questions</a>: How useful is the information? How will the information make me feel? And does the information gel with my world view?</p>



<p>Those questions can help explain people’s decisions not to view their Stasi files, says study coauthor and cognitive neuroscientist Tali Sharot of the University College London. For one, the information was no longer useful or relevant once the East German regime fell. And the information in the files had a high likelihood of containing information that would make people feel bad. Knowing, in other words, felt more harmful than not knowing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rob MacCoun, a psychologist and law professor at Stanford University, likens the decision to people deciding not to get genetic testing for diseases with no cure. “Both cases suggest that there are situations in which people intuit that learning something will lead them down a path they don&#8217;t want to walk. It is a kind of mental hygiene,” he says, “and maybe there’s some wisdom in that.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What to do when knowledge is necessary</h4>



<p>For Sharot and many researchers studying deliberate ignorance, focusing on situations where ignorance represents a poor choice, rather than a worthy one, is the more pressing area of inquiry.</p>



<p>For instance, when people actively avoid information that might conflict with their view of the world, they can create dangerous echo chambers. “If someone is skeptical of climate change, they may not go out and seek information that suggests climate change is real,” Sharot says. But that ignorance imperils the health of the planet.</p>



<p>Research also shows that 10 percent of people who take an HIV test <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5525219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never come back</a> for the results. Such individuals probably choose ignorance out of fear, but they also put others at risk of contracting the disease, Sharot says.</p>



<p>Tweaking the message, when it comes to medical information, overcomes people’s desire not to know, Sharot’s unpublished work suggests. She and her team wanted to see how to get more people to receive potentially scary information on their predisposition for certain genetic diseases.</p>



<p>One group of study participants was told that the additional information would help them take precautionary measures to ward off a given disease’s onset. Another group received a more neutral message. Those receiving the helpful message were more likely than others to overcome their fears and agree to receive such information.</p>



<p>Hertwig agrees this research is essential. But digging into instances where ignorance makes sense, and no change in behavior is needed, also has important implications, he says. The study of East Germans, for instance, provides clues about how societies handle periods of political upheaval. Across time, societies have had to grapple with how to move on from oppressive regimes. Should the leaders of a new regime make all former leaders and informants atone for their sins? Or should they mostly put the past behind them and move on?</p>



<p>“There is no simple answer to the question,” Hertwig says. What makes sense in one society may not make sense in another.</p>



<p>In the case of the Stasi files, people’s decision to ignore information en masse was a way of taking power away from their former tormentors, Hertwig says, allowing citizens in the reunified Germany to build a new and more peaceful future.</p>

<p>In my prior career as an investigative science journalist and now as a whistleblower lawyer, I’ve seen institutions react to allegations of scientific fraud in two ways. </p>



<p>The first could be called “Investigate and Disclose.” This strategy was exemplified by Bell Laboratories’ 2002 investigation of allegations that Jan Hendrik Schön, a member of the technical staff, mishandled data. The allegations were published in <em>The New York Times</em> in May. In September, Bell Labs released a thorough report on its inquiry revealing fabrications in multiple <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em> papers, which were promptly retracted. The report made possible a 2009 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Fantastic-Biggest-Scientific-MacMillan/dp/0230224679">book</a> I wrote about the scandal, because once a proper investigation began (and it took a while to get going), the company clarified within months that Schön had faked his data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second, more common response is “Delay and Deny” or “Delay and Downplay,” which is a more common – but insidious – strategy. A Delay and Deny response is not helpful to anyone outside a tiny inner circle of administrators, irrespective of the merit of the allegations.</p>



<span id="more-127109"></span>



<p>Strategies in Delay and Deny/Downplay include taking years to conduct investigations and issuing platitudes about what was <em>not</em> found (no criminal intent, no pattern, no effect on scientific conclusions), as opposed to disclosing the facts that the investigation has uncovered, along with any conclusions that independent experts have drawn. The lack of detail from institutions compares unfavorably with the hard work from many whistleblowers to document their concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the legal system can shake out information or data that is otherwise being hidden. As a journalist, I once sued under the Freedom of Information Act and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/475020a">shed light on what had gone wrong in a fraud case</a> even without obtaining the record I originally sought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a legal context, Delay and Deny/Downplay can also become a costly institutional strategy. In 2019, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/duke-university-agrees-pay-us-1125-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations-related">Duke University paid $112.5 million</a> to settle a False Claims Act (“FCA”) lawsuit brought by a whistleblower who knew of multiple instances of data fabrication affecting federal grants. (John Thomas, the lead lawyer in that case, has written a three-part series about the FCA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/john-thomas/">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Duke case contrasts with a government investigation I participated in during law school in 2016. The investigation began after Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Harvard teaching hospital, disclosed internal concerns about the work of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/harvard-brigham-retractions-stem-cell/">Piero Anversa</a>, a stem cell pioneer. The amount of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/partners-healthcare-and-brigham-and-women-s-hospital-agree-pay-10-million-resolve">the eventual settlement</a> was $10 million – a favorable outcome when compared with Duke’s $112.5 million, for what I would estimate was fraud of a similar scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going public with allegations of misconduct can sometimes produce an appropriate community reckoning, as I found as a reporter. But after working for many years as an investigative journalist, I was propelled towards getting my law degree by research institutions that were so shameless about Delay and Deny/Downplay that they either did not care about negative media coverage or reacted to it by doubling down.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Recently, I&nbsp; created a new kind of whistleblower law firm, <a href="http://www.eugeniereichlaw.com/">Eugenie Reich Law LLC</a>. My new firm has two objectives that are especially relevant to whistleblowers of scientific fraud.</p>



<p>First, the firm will provide legal services, advice, and education to whistleblowers of research misconduct that will be independent of any research institution or journal, and that will not involve charging fees (unless the case results in a financial recovery, as discussed below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many scientists think too many lawyers are involved in research misconduct investigations already, the majority are paid by journals, research institutions, or scientists accused of fraud (who are sometimes but not always defended by institutions).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The imbalance in access to legal services between these organizations and the whistleblowers has resulted in many whistleblowers of scientific fraud being intimidated by libel threats, cease-and-desist demands, and confidentiality strictures. Indeed, even critics of bad science – put aside whistleblowers of fraud – sometimes feel afraid to call out mishandled data. Ironically, the greater the evidence for fraud, the harder it is to point out errors.</p>



<p>I intend the existence of my firm to go some way to change the imbalance. With the caveat that everything in this guest post is intended as general comments and not legal advice for any specific reader, I observe common mistakes by whistleblowers such as providing inadequate documentation (even when they possess more), or lack of clarity about what is being alleged and what steps are needed to investigate further. I also see situations in which it has been hard to nip retaliation in the bud, because it was not clear at the start that the critique being offered was, or might become, a fraud allegation. That said, I would still put the majority of the blame for the struggles of whistleblowers on aggressive tactics from institutional attorneys or administrators that warrant strategic rather than idealistic thinking in response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A second objective of my firm will be to seek legal accountability for research organizations that cover-up allegations of misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recoveries in egregious cases that I will bring using the FCA will be a lever for accountability and a source of revenue to sustain my firm, as whistleblowers can qualify for a percentage of the funding agency’s recovery and their lawyer can get paid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I expect that around half of the FCA cases I bring will involve frauds in fields that have more money in them than academia, areas such as technology, healthcare, and the pharmaceutical industry. At my former firm, for example, I served as a core member of <a href="https://www.taf.org/2022-lawyers-of-the-year-recipients/">a team that achieved a record settlement of $900 million</a> in a whistleblower lawsuit alleging kickbacks by a pharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Duke case shows, grant frauds can also be large. And I hope to encourage more scientists to consider the FCA to target small grant frauds in the interests of institutional transparency, even if the dollar amounts are modest.</p>



<p>I understand that some academic scientists feel that whistleblowers should not make any money from their allegations, but I am not afraid that recovering money discredit their motives, for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the timelines of events in good cases usually make clear that the whistleblower started asking questions long before they knew of any financial incentive to litigate the answers. Second, I detect a social shift in academia, with increasing recognition that many scientists are underpaid, and that too much of the funding and rewards are associated with hyping results rather than troubleshooting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It takes time to document a concern, fully investigate a situation, and explain the problems with other people’s data. If those who do so end up getting paid for that work by means of a law firm taking up their cause, that’s more likely than ever before to be seen as a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, nothing requires the whistleblowers who receive major windfalls to keep the money. A successful whistleblower can put their share of a government recovery back into research, or into a nonprofit dedicated to research transparency or other values that they care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, the share that goes to reward a whistleblower is less significant than the much larger amount deducted from institutional budgets. That’s a metric even the most cynical administrators or board of trustees understand.</p>

Colella is Professor and the McFarland Distinguished Chair in Business at Tulane University, and Eden B. King is Associate Professor of Industrial Organizational Psychology at George Mason University. Their work synthesizes research across psychology, sociology, and management, and inspires a new era of scientific practice on understanding and reducing workplace discrimination.</em></p><p><em>Adrienne and Eden share their insights on workplace discrimination and the future of work.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>What can organizations do to tackle workplace discrimination?</h2><p>Workplace discrimination cannot be eradicated by a single policy or process. Instead, organizations need to develop strategic, comprehensive initiatives that cut across levels, units, and talent management cycles. Aligned with such strategy, leaders need to be visibly committed and held accountable to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Ongoing transparent assessment and accountability for DEI will help to ensure positive change. Finally, organizations need to create and sustain a culture where respect, empathy, and justice are core values. &nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Leaders need to be visibly committed and held accountable to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>How can academic research practically reduce discrimination within organizations? &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><p>Academic research can help to inform practice by providing robust evidence regarding the unique experiences of people who face discrimination as well as the strategies that are most effective in addressing these issues. In other words, good science can inform good practice.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</h2><p>Leader development requires the opportunity to engage in a variety of challenging tasks and to receive feedback about performance. The specific nature of the experiences, and the ways in which feedback is transmitted, are constantly evolving with technology and the environment. At the core, then, leader development will be the same—challenging tasks and feedback—but the conditions will evolve. It is yet to be seen whether the nature of leadership and the traits and behaviors which make leaders effective will also change in a more remote world.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Like most things, the increase in remote work has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, many people have found flexibility for opportunities to engage with family and leisure activities. In addition, people with disabilities and chronic health conditions have found better access to work. On the negative side, however, remote work can create challenges for human connections, increase loneliness, and blur the lines between work and home in a manner that is exhausting. And, of course, many types of work (especially low wage jobs) cannot be done remotely, potentially exacerbating socioeconomic divides. Experience and evidence in the upcoming months and years will help us understand for whom, how, when, and where flexibility can yield the most positive effects.</p><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?&nbsp;</h2><p>Given the rapid, unexpected changes we have experienced in the last few years, this question is really difficult to answer. We expect that rapid advances in technology will come with both unforeseen advantages and disadvantages for employers and employees and that the notion of “going to work” will change. Beyond this, we can’t predict.&nbsp;</p><p><em><sub>Feature image credit: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/740890361/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/740890361/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f05%2fDiscrimination-Stock-Image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-joe-ungemah/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Joe Ungemah</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/05/an-inflation-proof-methodology-to-measuring-policy-effects-on-poverty/">An inflation-proof methodology to measuring policy effects on poverty</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/studying-ancient-tsunamis-is-all-about-glasses/">Studying ancient tsunamis is all about glasses</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radiation-belt-outside-solar-system">The first radiation belt outside the solar system has been spotted</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have spotted a band of radiation surrounding an object outside our solar system.</p>



<p>A belt of energetic electrons <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06138-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encircles a Jupiter-sized body about 18 light-years from Earth</a>, astronomers report May 15 in <em>Nature</em>. As the electrons move, they radiate radio waves. Such radiation belts give insight into the shape of a cosmic object’s magnetic field, its interior structure and maybe even whether it has moons.</p>



<p>In our solar system, every planet with a worldwide magnetic field has radiation belts. Earth has the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/how-earths-radiation-belt-gets-its-stripes">Van Allen belts</a>, rings of electrons captured from the sun (<em>SN: 3/19/14</em>). Jupiter’s radiation belts get most of their particles from the volcanic moon Io. In these cases, the planet’s magnetic field traps electrons in a bubble around the planet, like fireflies in a jar.</p>





<p>To find similar belts outside the solar system, astronomer Melodie Kao and colleagues observed a Jupiter-sized object called LSR J1835+3259 with a network of 39 radio dishes spanning from Hawaii to Germany. Together, the dishes effectively created a radio telescope about as wide as Earth, letting the team zero in on the object’s environment.</p>



<p>The team spotted a belt that looks a lot like those of Jupiter’s but 10 million times as bright, says Kao, of the University of California, Santa Cruz. The object is nearly 80 times as massive as Jupiter, making it either a diminutive star or a massive brown dwarf, a dim starlike body not hefty enough to sustain hydrogen fusion.</p>



<p>One big mystery is where the electrons come from. The object doesn’t orbit a star, and it doesn’t seem to emit flares. A volcanic satellite would fit the bill, Kao says, but that’s still speculative.</p>



<p>Knowing that LSR J1835+3259 has a radiation belt will help researchers interpret data from&nbsp;exoplanets in the future, even if astronomers can’t see such belts directly.</p>



<p>“Exoplanet magnetism is truly at its infancy,” Kao says. “Until we can characterize exoplanet magnetic fields, we&#8217;ll miss entire segments of their life stories.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-mutation-alzheimers-gene">A rare mutation helped one man stave off Alzheimer’s for decades</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rare genetic mutation never seen before protected a man with an inherited form of Alzheimer’s from developing the disease for decades.</p>



<p>He is the second person found to have such protection, following a report in 2019 of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colombia-family-genetic-mutation-alzheimers-dementia-treatment">a woman with a different mutation</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/20</em>). Both mutations may have staved off the disease for years by acting in similar ways in the brain, an insight that could lead to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02318-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new treatments for all forms of Alzheimer’s</a>, scientists report May 15 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>





<p>But some researchers are cautious about concluding too much from just two cases. “The results look very promising, but it would be useful to see replication in more samples,” says neurologist Rudolph Tanzi of Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new study. Still, the work is important as “it can serve as a useful guide for drug discovery,” he says.</p>



<p>Both the man and woman were members of a Colombian family who have a mutation in the <em>PSEN1</em> gene that causes the rare inherited variety of Alzheimer’s. People with “familial” Alzheimer’s usually start showing signs in their 40s. The more common “sporadic” form does not cause symptoms until people are in their 70s or 80s.</p>



<p>The woman stayed sharp into her 70s, while the man described in the new study was still mentally healthy at 67. “That means they were protected, because they should have gotten the disease 30 years earlier, and they didn’t,” says Diego Sepulveda-Falla, a neurologist at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany.</p>



<p>The woman had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a protective mutation in a gene closely linked to Alzheimer’s</a>, <em>APOE</em>. This mutation is known as the Christchurch variant, after the city in New Zealand where it was first found. The mutation identified in the new study was in a gene called <em>RELN</em>. Sepulveda-Falla and colleagues named this new mutation <em>RELN-COLBOS</em>, after a joint Colombia-Boston study that the man participated in. He died three years ago, at age 74, from other causes, and his family donated his brain for study.</p>



<p>The researchers compared the two cases, finding striking similarities and differences. Amyloid plaques, thought by many researchers to be deeply involved in Alzheimer’s, were abundant in both patients’ brains. But the woman had low levels of another possible Alzheimer’s culprit, clusters of proteins called tau tangles. The researchers think this is what spared her from dementia for decades, as tau is more tightly linked to symptoms than amyloid, researchers suspect.</p>



<p>In the Colombian man’s brain, the researchers found a different picture for tau. “Unlike the Christchurch case, this case was severely affected by tau,” Sepulveda-Falla says. “This shocked us initially, then we figured out we needed to roll our sleeves up and dig deeper.”</p>



<p>Some brain regions, notably the entorhinal cortex, which is important for memory and one of the earliest areas affected in Alzheimer’s, had been spared from the tau buildup, the team found.</p>





<p>The difference in tau between the two cases is due to where the two protective genes are active in the brain. In adults, <em>RELN</em> is active in only a few places, including the entorhinal cortex. <em>APOE</em> is active everywhere. “Since APOE is ubiquitous, in one patient you get protection all around,” Sepulveda-Falla says. “In this other, the protection is localized to [certain] neurons, and by chance they happen to be the neurons that are key for preserving cognition.”</p>



<p>Despite affecting different genes, both mutations produce proteins that attach to the same molecules on cells, and, ultimately, appear to reduce the formation of tau tangles. Sepulveda-Falla and colleagues confirmed this for the new mutation using mice genetically engineered to produce tau. Introducing the <em>RELN-COLBOS</em> mutation into these mice prevented tau buildup. This mechanism, common to both mutations, could be targeted by new treatments aiming to stave off all types of Alzheimer’s, the researchers say.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781250850881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Once Upon a Prime</a><br><em>Sarah Hart<br>Flatiron Books, $29.99</em></p>



<p>“Mathematical symbolism and metaphor are present in every kind of literature, from the humblest of fairy tales right through to <em>War and Peace</em>,” claims mathematician Sarah Hart. In <em>Once Upon a Prime</em>, she lays bare some of this hidden math and meaning in a host of poetry, novels and folklore.</p>



<p>She starts with nursery rhymes, often rife with counting — such as “One, Two, Buckle My Shoe” — showing how numbers bleed into our very first encounters with the world of words. This is not just through counting but also more subtly through the rhythms and rhyme patterns. It’s also through trebling — where a word or phrase is repeated three times, such as “Row, row, row your boat.”</p>





<p>The number three has a special hold on Western literature and languages in general. It pervades common phrases — “Three cheers for…,” “Ready, Set, Go,” “Learning your ABCs.” It’s also central to story structure; for example, trilogies are more prevalent than tetralogies. Characters tend to come in threes too, like “The Three Little Pigs,” and even in jokes like “A priest, a minister and a rabbi…”</p>



<p>Hart suggests this emphasis on three has some basis in geometry. Three is the minimum number of points that can define a two-dimensional shape, and the minimum number of sticks that can be bound to make a stable rigid structure, that is, a triangle. And the equilateral triangle is the only shape with both equal-length sides and equidistant corners. These geometric properties give the number three “a sense of strength and completeness, and also often of equitability,” Hart writes.</p>



<p>It’s a poetic argument, if not completely convincing. To bolster her case, she also points to trichotomies. Take a number, any number, and every other number is either more, less or equal to that number — a trichotomy that has direct parallels with Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean: “Every ethical virtue is a golden mean (just right) between two vices — one an excess, the other a deficiency,” as Hart describes it. This doctrine is playfully illustrated in Goldilocks’ experiences with porridge, chairs and beds.</p>



<p>For a book about math and literature, it’s not surprising that Hart focuses quite a bit on poetry, which is often defined by patterns of some sort. Perhaps more revelatory is her look at how math also molds the structure or pace of novels. </p>



<p>For example, I had noticed Amor Towles was not moving through time in a strictly linear fashion when I read his 2016 book <em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em>, but I completely missed how the number two orchestrates the story’s structure. The novel takes us through 32 years in the protagonist’s life, starting in 1922 when he begins living under house arrest. Each chapter advances in a roughly doubling interval of time since his sentence begins: the first day after, then the second, fifth, 10th, three weeks after, six weeks after and so on. Then from the middle of the book, the intervals climb down again, reversing the sequence.</p>





<p>Some readers may wonder if Hart’s love of math simply leads her to find patterns like this everywhere. But the odds must be astronomically high for the examples she presents to be mere chance.</p>



<p>Among the numerous math-loving authors Hart cites is Herman Melville, who steals the limelight for a good 10 pages that are sheer joy to read. Melville tended to lace his novels with so much philosophy and mathematics that his publisher worried about profitability. At one point, Melville promised his next novels would have “no metaphysics, no conic-sections, nothing but cakes &amp; ale.” He did not keep that promise. One of his next books was <em>Moby-Dick</em>. The novel is thick with math, from the concept of a quoin — a kind of lopsided wedge, which the main character Ishmael defines through geometric descriptions of a sperm whale’s head — to the analogy for how such a creature must see two distinct views of the world from eyes on either side of its head, “as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid.”</p>



<p>Cover to cover, Hart’s love of math fizzes off the page, such as when she implores readers to put down the book and twist a line of paper into a Möbius strip. She admits it’s a bit of a detour, but in her defense, it is leading up to a discussion of a 1974 short story called “Mobius the Stripper,” which has a particular kind of circular narrative.</p>



<p>Hart’s simple breakdowns of both math and literature make the book easy for anyone to follow, no matter their proficiency in either subject, though a familiarity with some of the math and literature references might make for a slightly more satisfying read. Not everyone will finish the book primed (ha!) to discover the mathematical gems hidden in a book or poem. But that takes little away from the charm of reading <em>Once Upon a Prime</em>, a joyous tour de force of mathematical and literary delights.</p>

<p>An article based on results from an online survey has been retracted for data issues, and an Australian university is investigating what happened.</p>



<p>The<em> </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471595323001142">article</a>, “International nursing students’ perceptions and experiences of transition to the nursing workforce &#8211; A cross-sectional survey,” became available online on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>



<p>Published in the journal <em>Nurse Education in Practice</em>, the study reported 110 responses to an online survey of nursing students who came to Australia from other countries and planned to remain there to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, posted this month, stated:</p>



<span id="more-127103"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the authors because the data reported in the manuscript are likely to have been compromised. It came to the co-authors’ attention after the publication of the article that a large proportion of the surveys reported in the study had been completed by a respondent using the first author’s IP addresses.</p>



<p>The authors would like to apologize to readers for this error.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Della John McKitterick of the University of South Australia, and the first author on the paper, seemed to dispute the information in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the respondents has used my username (not my IP address) to enter the data,” McKitterick told us. McKitterick, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5413-806X">whose ORCID profile</a> indicates she is a PhD student at the university, did not tell us how she learned of the data breach or respond to our follow up query about the discrepancy between the retraction notice and her statement regarding the IP address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of South Australia is investigating the matter, which McKitterick cited as her reason for not divulging further details. None of the article’s other authors replied to requests for comment.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the University of South Australia confirmed the ongoing investigation to <em>Retraction Watch</em> but declined to comment further.</p>



<p>Roger Watson, the editor-in-chief of <em>Nurse Education in Practice, </em>was unaware of McKitterick’s disagreement with the retraction notice but expressed an interest in correcting the note after we asked him about it.</p>



<p>Watson said he does not believe McKitterick was aware of the survey fraud in advance or its perpetrator.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The issue with this article was brought to our attention by the corresponding author of the article. They did the right thing as soon as they became aware of the problem with the data &#8211; beyond that we don’t know how they found this themselves. They helped us draft the retraction notice.</p>

<p>Mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, affect approximately one third of cancer patients and can negatively affect cancer prognosis. Despite the availability of effective psychological and pharmacologic treatments, around half of affected cancer patients globally do not access support for mental health disorders. Reasons include prioritization of cancer treatment and accepting mental distress as a normal state.</p>
<p>Supporting patients in their decision-making process can increase the uptake of mental health treatment. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools to assist patients by providing information about benefits and downsides of potential treatment options. While there are PDAs available for cancer treatment decisions and for mental health treatment decisions in the general population, there is no PDA to support cancer patients considering mental health treatment.</p>
<p>To address this gap, the authors of this paper developed a prototype PDA for cancer patients with anxiety and/or depression. They then sought feedback from both clinicians and patients as to the accuracy, acceptability, and usability. This feedback was used to improve the PDA so that it would provide clear and comprehensive information to support decision making for cancer patients with mental health disorders.</p>

<p>Ichthyosaurs were giant reptiles who roamed the seas in the Mesozoic era. Unlike most reptiles alive today, ichthyosaurs are thought to have been viviparous, giving birth to live young rather than to eggs. The prevailing theory on ichthyosaur birth has been that the fetus is oriented tail-first as an adaptation to being born underwater, due to asphyxiation risk.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper investigated the evolutionary origin of viviparity and the prevalence of tail-first vs. head-first birth in ichthyosaurs. Examining three fossils, they found that two showed tail-first orientation of the fetus and one showed head-first orientation.</p>
<p>The authors then compared ichthyosaur birth orientation to that of other viviparous reptiles, extant and extinct, and aquatic mammals. Based on their findings, they conclude that asphyxiation risk is unlikely to be a driver of selection for birth orientation in ichthyosaurs or more generally. Rather, body shape likely determines preferred birth orientation, with features such as neck flexibility and pelvic girdle width affecting birth dynamics.</p>

<p>Suicide is a major health concern in Pakistan, with pesticide poisoning reported as one of the leading causes of death by suicide. However, the problem is understudied, partially due to a lack of national suicide data.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the scope of the problem and to determine the most commonly used pesticides for suicide, the authors of this study conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. The pesticides identified in the studies were grouped by hazard level and legal status in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The review identified two commonly used pesticides responsible for the majority of the identified cases of self-poisoning, but found that the reported data was incomplete. The authors propose changes to regulation and availability of highly hazardous pesticides that could reduce their use in suicide, as well as comprehensive data collection to allow the problem to be studied more closely and better policies to be enacted.</p>

<p>Preterm birth, before 37 weeks gestation, is a risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. While many pregnant women who present with threatened preterm labor go on to deliver at term with no intervention, women who progress to preterm labor require timely interventions to delay birth and support fetal development. Ultrasound measurement of the cervix can allow for accurate prediction of risk and determining which women require intervention, however it is difficult and not universally available.</p>
<p>Another way to measure preterm birth risk in women with threatened preterm labor is with biomarkers. The authors of this paper studied the use of quantitative measurement of fetal fibronectin in vaginal secretions in order to predict preterm birth in women with symptoms of preterm labor. They found that increasing concentrations of fetal fibronectin correlated with increasing rates of preterm birth. They also determined specific thresholds for reliable prediction of birth within two days and within two weeks of testing.</p>
<p>These thresholds allow for classifying risk of preterm birth into very low, intermediate, and high. Women at very low risk of preterm birth could be managed with monitoring only, rather than with interventions, reducing the use of unnecessary interventions.</p>

While it is known that simpler spots on the wings of pierid butterflies share some genetic circuitry with nymphalid eyespots, they have not been as thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>To facilitate investigation into the genetic basis of pierid spots, the authors of this study generated a high-quality draft genome for <i>Pieris canidia</i>, the Indian cabbage white butterfly. They then used differential gene analysis on very small pieces of pupal wing tissue sampled from in and around the developing spot region to identify the genes involved in spot formation and compared these to those involved in eyespot formation in nymphalid butterflies.</p>
<p>Among the genes identified as contributing to spot development were pigmentation genes, transcription factors, and signaling pathways. Some of these signaling pathways are also used in nymphalid eyespot development. Further research is needed to determine if these are evolutionarily conserved pathways or represent convergent evolution in different lineages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sonoran-desert-toad-psychedelic-animal-chemistry">The Sonoran Desert toad can alter your mind — it’s not the only animal</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The adage “all attention is good attention” may be true for marketers — not so for the Sonoran Desert toad. Last fall, the U.S. National Park Service sent out a message on Facebook asking visitors to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=503416565159338&amp;set=a.227456602755337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“refrain from licking” the toad</a> (technically <em>Incilius alvarius</em> but commonly called <em>Bufo alvarius</em>). That message came months after a <em>New York Times </em>article covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/toad-venom-psychedelic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the booming interest in the psychedelic compound</a> that the toad excretes from its skin — along with the “poaching, over-harvesting and illegal trafficking” that have accompanied that interest.</p>



<p>People don’t typically lick the toads to get high, says Robert Villa, a community outreach specialist at the University of Arizona’s Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill. The secretions the toads produce are toxic when ingested. They “work orally, through the mucous membranes, and cause really dangerous side effects, like cardiac arrest,” Villa says.</p>





<p>Instead, for decades, people have been collecting the secretions, then drying and smoking them. When inhaled, a compound within, 5-MeO-DMT, can cause auditory and visual hallucinations. “It’s a very powerful psychedelic sometimes called the ‘God molecule,’ ” says pharmacologist and chemist David Nichols of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>The drug’s growing popularity could be bad news for toad populations. “If you relocate it outside of its home territory,” Villa says, which often happens when people collect a toad for its secretions, “it gets lost and its chances for survival go way down.” What’s more, collecting large numbers of toads increases the risk of disease transmission, like chytrid fungus, between toads.</p>



<p>We at <em>Science News</em> heard the PSA loud and clear: Just leave this toad alone. But we couldn’t help but wonder: What other amazing animals may have psychedelic potential? Join us on a tour, by land and sea, of some of the world’s mind-altering fauna.</p>



<h4>Sonoran Desert toad (<em>Incilius alvarius</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>The Sonoran Desert, in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="471" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of a Sonoran Desert toad siting on small rocks." class="wp-image-3124366" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-553x383.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-650x450.jpg 650w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-269x186.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124366">The Sonoran Desert toad secretes an enzyme that converts bufotenine, a compound also made by other toads, into 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful hallucinogen related to the psychedelic drug DMT.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124366">HOLGER KRISP/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 3.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>All toads secrete toxins from their skin. These secretions, whose specific compounds vary from species to species, probably evolved as a way to keep a toad’s body moist. Over time, the compounds, which can also act on the brain and affect heart muscle when ingested, came to aid in self-defense.</p>



<p>But the Sonoran Desert toad, also known as the Colorado River toad, appears to have taken evolution one step further.</p>





<p>The toad, one of the largest in North America, secretes an enzyme that converts bufotenine, a compound also made by other toads, into 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful hallucinogen related to the psychedelic drug DMT.</p>



<p>A frightened Sonoran Desert toad gushes its toxic mix, which includes 5-MeO-DMT, from its parotoid glands — located behind each eye — and from glands on its legs. It’s a way to say, “Please don’t eat me! I don’t taste good!” When swallowed in large quantities by a potential predator, the toxins can cause coma, cardiac arrest and even death.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t yet sure why the Sonoran Desert toad produces 5-MeO-DMT, and why it is the only toad known to make it. “There’s a lot of mystery,” Villa says.</p>



<h4>Giant monkey frog (<em>Phyllomedusa bicolor</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>The Amazon Basin in South America</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2.jpg" alt="A photo of a giant monkey frog resting on the fingers of a person." class="wp-image-3124367" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124367">Some people who use kambô, the toxic secretion produced by the giant monkey frog, report having spiritual experiences.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124367">© BEASTMASTER/INATURALIST (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s no scientific consensus on whether kambô, the name for the toxic secretion produced by the giant monkey frog, should be considered a psychedelic. The term psychedelic comes from Greek meaning “mind manifesting,” Nichols says. “You can imagine, it’s enhancing the properties of your mind, rather than just intoxicating you.” Other compounds such as stimulants and depressants modify the activity of the brain, but they don’t leave users with the kind of new insights and memorable experiences that come with psychedelics.</p>



<p>Wuelton Monteiro, a tropical medicine researcher at the Universidade do Estado do Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, points to a 2020 study in <em>Scientific Reports</em> as an example of why the classification has been unclear. In the small study, nearly half of participants <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who reported using kambô</a> said they had a spiritual experience, and some experiences came with what resembled the afterglow often associated with hallucinogens. But kambô doesn’t activate the 5-HT2A receptor, a protein that senses the chemical messenger serotonin, while classic psychedelics do.</p>



<p>Among Indigenous populations in the southwestern Amazon, the frog’s skin secretions have been used for centuries as a stimulant in shamanistic rituals. According to Villa, the secretions are usually applied on small, superficial burns on the body to increase the stamina of hunters.</p>



<p>In predators attempting to gobble the frog, kambô might cause regurgitation, seizures and a change in heart function. Researchers are still trying to decipher the specific compounds that explain these effects, but they do know that species of <em>Phyllomedusa</em> collectively produce over 200 short protein fragments that can influence body function. Some might <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be promising for future medicines</a>.</p>



<h4>California harvester ant (<em>Pogonomyrmex californicus</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>Southwestern United States and northern Mexico</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3.jpg" alt="A close up photo of eight California harvester ants standing on sand." class="wp-image-3124368" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124368">Indigenous peoples of central California once ate California harvester ants during rituals including vision quests.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124368">© MATT REALA/INATURALIST (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The venom of the California harvester ant is made up of enzymes that aren’t known to cause hallucinations on their own, but the Indigenous peoples of central California once ate them during rituals including vision quests. Ethnographic reports suggest people would swallow hundreds of live ants in balls of eagle down feathers. No doubt the people were stung, likely on the insides.</p>



<p>Justin Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwestern Biological Institute and University of Arizona in Tucson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/science/justin-o-schmidt-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who died in February</a>, said the pain of being stung by so many ants, along with extreme cold, fasting and in some cases sleep deprivation, triggered hallucinations that connected the people with spiritual guides.</p>



<p>A harvester ant’s sting is “nothing like a bee sting,” Schmidt wrote in<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-books-deliver-double-dose-venomous-animal-facts"> <em>The Sting of the Wild</em></a> (<em>SN: 8/6/16, p.&nbsp;26</em>). “The pain is intense, comes in waves, and is deeply visceral.” Lasting from four to eight hours, the pain is accompanied by a numb sensation at the site of the sting. The ants deliver stings to defend their colonies from large predators, including lizards, birds and people. (Smaller enemies such as other insects and spiders are bitten.)</p>



<p>A person who eats 1,000 ants would probably die; according to Schmidt’s book, one ant is enough to kill a mouse. But some predators have defenses: The regal horned lizard (<em>Phrynosoma solare</em>) has a mucus lining its mouth and digestive system that allows it to eat hundreds of ants and a substance in its blood that neutralizes the venom. Some birds somehow avoid getting stung too.</p>



<p>It’s hard to get more information on how the ants were used in rituals and the nature of the experience. Disease and violence that came with Westerners during California’s gold rush destroyed the Indigenous communities in the Central Valley and their way of life.</p>



<h4>Salema (<em>Sarpa salpa</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>Temperate and tropical ocean waters, from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-675x450.jpg" alt="A close up photo of a Sarpa Salpa fish on a black background." class="wp-image-3124369" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124369">Some fish including <em>Sarpa salpa</em> can cause auditory and visual hallucinations when eaten.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124369">BRIAN GRATWICKE/FLICKR (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 2.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fishes including this species of sea bream, as well as some sea chubs and clownfish, can cause auditory and visual hallucinations when eaten, though reports are rare. <em>Sarpa salpa</em> was known as the “dream fish” in ancient Rome, according to<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00153/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a 2018 review of psychedelic fauna</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em>. Two cases of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16615678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hallucinatory fish poisoning</a> were documented in 2006 in the journal <em>Clinical Toxicology</em>. In one case, a 40-year-old man ate baked <em>S. salpa</em> and later experienced hallucinations of screaming animals and giant arthropods surrounding his car. The symptoms went away, with medical attention, 36 hours after he ate the fish.</p>



<p>Researchers don’t know what compounds cause this ichthyoallyeinotoxism, or fish poisoning, which can include nightmares. Evolutionary biologist Leo Smith of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, who studies fish history and diversification, says he and other scientists suspect that the compounds are a by-product of the fishes’ diets.</p>



<p>But ichthyoallyeinotoxism is distinct from two other forms of fish poisoning. Symbiotic bacteria within puffer fish produce a neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, or TTX, that can cause paralysis and death. And ciguatera fish poisoning comes from eating fish contaminated with a neurotoxin produced by some dinoflagellates. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting and weakness, as well as a reverse sensory disruption, where hot things seem cold and vice versa. But it does not cause hallucinations, says Sandric Leong, a biological oceanographer at the National University of Singapore.</p>



<p>How and why many of these neurotoxins are produced is still being worked out. “There are so many relationships with the marine environment which we are not very sure of,” Leong says.</p>

<p>The pitted sponge and some other sponges including <em>Smenospongia aura</em> and <em>S. echina</em> contain 5-bromo-DMT and 5,6-dibromo-DMT. Because of their relationship with the psychedelic drug DMT, these compounds are plausible psychedelics. American chemist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/dr-ecstasy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Shulgin</a>, famous for his research into psychedelic compounds and for introducing the world to the synthetic hallucinogen MDMA, or ecstasy, and his wife Ann Shulgin wrote in <em>TIHKAL: The Continuation</em> that they don’t know whether the sponge compounds are activated by smoking or not. They are, however, “quantitatively reduced to DMT by stirring under hydrogen in methanol, in the presence of palladium on charcoal.”</p>



<p>The pitted sponge is known to concentrate in its tissue chemicals called monoamines that can modify the behavior of nerve cells. Not only can these compounds make the sponge taste bitter, but they can also alter the behavior of predatory fish that dine on the sponge.</p>



<p>“They wouldn’t prevent the fish from ever trying to take a bite, but it would prevent it from persisting or consuming the sponge any beyond an initial several bites,” says Mark Hamann, a pharmacologist from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</p>



<p><em>V. rigida</em>’s ability to alter animal behavior intrigued Hamann, who reported in a 2008 study in the <em>Journal of Natural Products</em> that 5,6-dibromo-DMT <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918908/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acted like an antidepressant</a> in rats, while 5-bromo-DMT acted like a sedative. Hamann says that related compounds may one day be isolated and might make for promising antidepressants, anxiety-reducing drugs or pain relievers in people.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-electric-vehicle-program">There’s good and bad news with California’s electric vehicle program</a></h4>

              
                <p>A worldwide gearshift from fossil fuel–powered cars to electric vehicles could significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that humans emit to the atmosphere. But current strategies for vehicle electrification can also shift some pollution to communities already suffering under higher economic, health and environmental burdens, researchers warn.</p>



<p>California, which leads the United States by a mile when it comes to EV adoption, offers a window into this evolving problem. The state is aggressively seeking to reduce its carbon footprint and has made substantial increases in wind and solar power generation as well as in the promotion of electric vehicle purchases. One tool the state has used is the California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, or CVRP, which kicked off in 2010 and offers consumers money back for the purchase or lease of new EVs.</p>





<p>Now, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis of the CVRP’s impact on the state’s air quality</a> from 2010 to 2021 reveals both good and bad news, researchers report May 3 in <em>PLOS Climate.</em></p>



<p>To assess the impact of the CVRP on a community and statewide level, the team developed a computer model that incorporates data on where the rebates went, how much additional electricity would be required to power those vehicles, which of the state’s electric generating units would provide that power and how much pollution they might produce.</p>



<p>The team then overlapped these data with a mapping tool called CalEnviroScreen that identifies which of the state’s more than 8,000 census tracts — county subdivisions used in population assessments — are the most vulnerable to pollution. That vulnerability measure is based not only on exposure to pollutants such as power plant emissions and unsafe water but also on factors such as income, education level, access to health care and linguistic isolation.</p>



<p>The good news is that the CVRP is responsible for making a dent in the state’s overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, reducing them by about 280,000 metric tons per year on average, says environmental scientist Jaye Mejía-Duwan of the University of California, Berkeley. In 2020, transportation in California produced about 160 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, about 40 percent of the total 370 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the state that year.</p>



<p>The program has also reduced the state’s overall emissions of other types of air-polluting gases, including sulfur dioxide and several nitrogen oxide gases collectively called NOx.</p>



<p>The bad news is that the most disadvantaged communities in the state didn’t see the same overall improvement in air quality, Mejía-Duwan and colleagues found. Those communities didn’t have the same decreases in sulfur dioxide and NOx gases — and in fact saw an increase in one type of air pollution, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">tiny particulates</a> known as PM<sub>2.5 </sub>(<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>). “These particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and cross over into the bloodstream,” increasing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular problems and cognitive decline, Mejía-Duwan says. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where the power is</h3>



<p>California uses a computer model called CalEnviroScreen, currently in its fourth version, to determine levels of vulnerability to the impacts of pollution. The most disadvantaged communities (darker blue) are determined by both pollutant exposure and socioeconomic factors. The state&#8217;s electricity-generating units (EGUs, circles) are disproportionately located in the most disadvantaged communities. That reveals how increasing electrification, which includes power generated by nonrenewable sources, could increase pollution in many of the most disadvantaged communities.</p>



<h5>Pollution impact by community</h5>

<p>That increase may be indirectly related to putting more EVs on the road. Although electric vehicles themselves don’t produce PM<sub>2.5 </sub>from their tailpipes, increased electricity generation, if it’s not fossil fuel–free, can. Renewable resources, including rooftop solar cells, supplied about half of California’s electricity in 2022. But natural gas–fired power plants still provide a hefty chunk of the state’s power.</p>



<p>“Electric vehicles are often incorrectly referred to as ‘zero-emission vehicles,’ but they’re only as clean as the underlying electric grid from which the energy is sourced,” Mejía-Duwan says. The most disadvantaged 25 percent of the state&#8217;s communities also contain 50 percent of the power plants, the team found.</p>





<p>EVs also tend to be relatively heavy due to their hefty batteries. And “heavier vehicles can produce as much if not more particulate matter” than equivalently sized fossil fuel-powered cars, due to brake, tire or road wear, Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>Increasing the cleanliness of the electric grid would help, as would changes to the management of the state’s generated power, the researchers say. California’s solar, wind and hydroelectric energy production has grown rapidly. But the battery technology to store and use that energy later lags behind. Most of that energy is generated during the day, so some researchers have suggested plugging in electric vehicles while it’s light out to take advantage of the daytime glut of electricity — and then using the vehicles to help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">power houses at nighttime</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>But, clever as that idea is, it doesn’t address the underlying factors behind these inequities. Since 2010, the CVRP has provided over 400,000 rebates for EVs of up to $7,500, depending on income. Yet, as it turns out, those rebates have disproportionately gone to the least disadvantaged communities. “That’s a major driver of these inequities,” Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>Changing that isn’t an easy fix. The state has tried several ways to address the issue, such as by imposing an income cap on eligibility.</p>



<p>But those efforts have had little effect, particularly given strong barriers that stand in the way of the adoption of EVs by people in disadvantaged communities. One roadblock is that prospective EV buyers must have enough money for a down payment, and then fill out forms and be able to wait several months for the rebate money. Another is that car manufacturers are trending toward producing larger, more expensive EVs. Chevrolet, for example, announced in April that its most affordable EV, the Bolt, will be discontinued as the company pivots to producing electric SUVs.</p>



<p>There’s also a lack of equitable access to vehicle charging infrastructure. And then there are subtler but no less insidious issues, such as “a lack of sufficient multicultural and multilingual outreach about EVs, plus the fact that people of color and minoritized communities report facing discrimination at dealerships,” Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>These findings echo and support researchers’ longtime concerns about how current programs to encourage vehicle electrification will disproportionately impact people. “It’s not a surprise,” says Román Partida-López, senior legal counsel for transportation equity at The Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif. “What [California] is doing is a move in the right direction, but it’s not enough.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-climate-change-bill-legislation-clean-energy">California and other states pursuing aggressive zero-emissions policies</a> need to shift their thinking, Partida-López says, to be more intentional about targeting their efforts toward the communities experiencing the greatest impacts (<em>SN: 12/14/22</em>). Rebates, in particular, are known to be an inequitable approach, he says, because they “assume you have the money up front to be able to put down a down payment of several thousand dollars.”</p>



<p>A better strategy to reduce the barriers to EV adoption, he says, would be to provide other types of incentives, such as vouchers that low-income households could use at the time of purchase as well as accessible financing programs.</p>



<p>After all, making EVs accessible to everyone is going to be essential to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">the big picture of transitioning to zero emissions</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/23</em>). “We’re not going to meet any of those goals unless we center equity” in program designs, Partida-López says. “The focus has always been, ‘How do we transform the market?’ We need to change the narrative to ‘How are we going to focus on the people most impacted, to help with this transition?’”</p>

<p><strong>Light flashes no danger for short space flights</strong> – <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-flashes-no-danger-short-space-flights"><em>Science News</em></a>, May 12, 1973</p>



<p>The light flashes and streaks seen by [Apollo] astronauts have long been attributed to high-energy, heavy cosmic particles (HZE) passing through the eyes&#8230;. A new report … concludes that the particles are not a serious hazard for short trips to the moon or Earth-orbital missions such as Skylab. </p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The mechanism behind the flashes <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720010081/downloads/19720010081.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described by Apollo astronauts</a> remains a mystery. Perhaps the particles, which are components of c­osmic rays, emit radiation as they pass through part of the eye. Or perhaps they trick nerve cells to create the illusion of light. However the flashes happen, they are still an issue for astronauts. In 2006, about 80&nbsp;percent of NASA and European Space Agency astronauts reported <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16676658/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiencing the flashes</a>. How the phenomenon impacts astronaut health after months or years in deep space <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is unclear</a>. As NASA plans crewed missions to Mars and the moon, scientists are devising new ways to <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2022/04/18/staying-safe-in-space--uw-researchers-work-to-protect-astronauts-from-cosmic-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect astronauts from radiation</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 18</em>), such as portable magnetic shields that can deflect cosmic rays.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lake-antarctica-ice-microbes-carbon">In one lake deep under Antarctica’s ice, microbes feast on ancient carbon</a></h4>

              
                <p>How microbes survive in lakes far beneath Antarctica&#8217;s ice sheet has been a mystery. Now scientists have figured out what’s on the menu for microbes in one buried lake in West Antarctica.</p>



<p>The lake’s bacteria and other microbial inhabitants get by on carbon that seawater left behind thousands of years ago, researchers report in the April <em>AGU Advances</em>. The find adds to existing evidence that, during a period of warming about 6,000 years ago, the ice sheet in West Antarctica was smaller than it is today. That allowed <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000846" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seawater to deposit nutrients in what is now a lake bed</a> buried under hundreds of meters of ice.</p>





<p>This study is among the first to provide evidence from beneath the ice that the ice sheet was smaller in the not-so-distant past, geologically speaking, before growing back to its modern size, says Greg Balco, a geochemist at the Berkeley Geochronology Center in California.</p>



<p>Understanding how the ice sheet changed during past periods of warming is crucial to predicting Antarctica’s future as the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, says Balco, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Hundreds of lakes pool under Antarctica’s massive ice sheet, the result of the underside of the ice ever-so-slowly melting due to heat from the Earth’s interior. The lakes tend to be pitch-black, near freezing and are almost all isolated from the outside world.</p>



<p>These less-than-ideal conditions should make them hostile to life. “If I were a microbe, I wouldn’t want to live in the cold, dark depths where I haven’t seen the sun or a new nutrient in thousands of years,” says Ryan Venturelli, a paleoglaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. Yet billions of microbes — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life">and even some animals</a> — have found a way to thrive in these subglacial waterbodies (<em>SN: 4/21/23</em>).</p>



<p>As the last glacial period came to a close, starting around 15,000 years ago, ice sheets around the world retreated. Computer simulations have predicted that as the climate warmed, the ice sheet in West Antarctica may have shrunk to an even smaller size than it is today. But working out what a smaller ice sheet might have looked like isn’t easy since most of the evidence for it is now locked under ice, Balco says.</p>



<p>In 2018, Venturelli joined a team of about 30 scientists headed to a remote corner of West Antarctica to drill for the past. The journey took them to Lake Mercer: a body of subglacial water that today sits 150 kilometers from the sea.</p>



<p>It took the expedition over a week of using a hot-water drill 24 hours a day to pierce through just over a kilometer of ice to reach the lake. “There was a lot of cheering and high-fiving” when the drill finally made it through, Venturelli recalls. Lake Mercer is only the second subglacial lake in the world that scientists have ever managed to reach.</p>

<p>The team collected and analyzed lake water and sediment samples from the lake bed. This work revealed traces of 6,000-year-old carbon-14, a form of the element that’s made in the atmosphere and then falls to Earth. For that carbon to get past the ice, the lake would have had to have contact with the outside world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t spot any telltale signs of ancient photosynthesizing plankton, suggesting that the area wasn’t open ocean when the carbon settled in the sediment. Instead, seawater carrying the carbon must have come to the lake. That means that ocean water had to have flowed under the ice about 250 kilometers farther inland than it does today, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“There’s no other way to get carbon-14 in there,” Balco says. “You can’t push it through ice. Organisms can’t tunnel through. The only way for it to get it there is for ocean water to get under the ice sheet.”</p>



<p>Seawater does flow under the ice today — but not as far inland as the lake’s location. So the edge of the ice shelf was probably closer to Lake Mercer several thousand years ago. That suggests, the team says, that the ice sheet over West Antarctica was probably smaller back then.</p>



<p>Microorganisms living in this area 6,000 years ago would have feasted on the inflow from the ocean. And their descendants still seem to as well. The researchers found traces of carbon-14 in the water samples as well as in the sediment, suggesting the microbes are recycling the ancient carbon deposited in the lake bed as food.</p>



<p>The new study emphasizes how much information is waiting to be found in Antarctica’s hidden lakes, Venturelli says. “There are about 675 lakes under the ice sheet, and we’ve only sampled two,” she says. “I would very much like to drill into every single one of them.”</p>

<p>An engineering journal has retracted an article that was posted on a website claiming to sell author positions. The retraction comes nearly two years after we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">reported on the website</a> and a whistleblower informed the journal.</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15397734.2020.1858870">On the dynamics of an ultra-fast-rotating-induced piezoelectric cantilevered nanodisk surrounded by viscoelastic foundation</a>,” appeared in <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines </em>in December 2020. It listed researchers at Sichuan University of Science and Engineering in China as authors. The article has been cited five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The study was retracted on March 16, 2023. The retraction notice stated:</p>



<span id="more-127091"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, concerns have been raised about the authorship of the article. When approached for an explanation, the authors have been unable to verify their original data.</p>



<p>It has also come to our attention that the full authorship list for this manuscript were [sic] changed during the submission and publication process. As determining authorship is core to the integrity of published work and given our concerns regarding the data, we are therefore retracting this article.</p>



<p>The authors listed in this publication have been informed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study was among several posted on the Iranian website Teziran in 2021. The site has claimed to sell authorship positions for scientific papers under review in various journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/13/paper-with-authorship-posted-for-sale-retracted-over-a-year-after-retraction-watch-report/">previously reported</a>, an anonymous whistleblower who goes by the name Artemisia Stricta identified articles from a cached version of Teziran after reading our post, and informed the editors and publishers of the journals in which the papers appeared.</p>



<p>In September 2021, Artemisia sent an email to Corina Sandu, editor in chief of <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines</em>, writing, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I am sure you will agree, the listing of authorship for sale is a major red flag, and, in many cases, is accompanied by outright falsification of the article for scalability of authorship sales.</p>



<p>The large number of authors certainly seems to indicate that some positions of authorship were sold. Are you able to review the point during the review process when the authors were added? If any were added after initial submission, this would be a strong indication of authorship manipulation, which may constitute grounds for retraction. Of course, it is also possible that authorship was sold prior to submission. In any case, I hope that you will investigate this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sandu eventually replied, saying that she had forwarded the concern to the journal’s publisher. Over the next few months, Artemisia’s attempts to follow up about the investigation yielded either assurances that the matter was still being investigated, or no reply.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In reply to an email from Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for Taylor and Francis, the publisher of <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines</em>, said of the March retraction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After concerns were raised about the article we conducted an investigation and found substantial authorship changes had been made. We reached out to the authors to confirm their individual contributions and also to provide the raw data and original figures for the article. Unfortunately the authors were unable to verify their original data and did not respond to further emails. Given our concerns regarding the data and authorship of the paper, we retracted this article. Since the publication of this article we have substantially improved our processes for authorship changes and, should significant authorship changes occur in the future, this would indicate that investigation is needed by the journal’s editorial team, with assistance from our publishing ethics and integrity team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson also clarified that Artemisia’s email brought this issue to the publisher’s attention, although the paper was only retracted after they had conducted their own investigation.</p>



<p>When asked why the investigation took as long as it did, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As with all investigations we must conduct due diligence and collect required evidence to ensure the outcome of an investigation is fair and unbiased. As a result, some cases take longer than others to resolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Sandu nor Mingjun Yang, the senior author of the paper, responded to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">None of the remaining papers posted on Teziran about which Artemisia raised concerns have been retracted or bear any indication that they are under investigation. The papers are:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>In reply to an email from Retraction Watch about the recent retraction, Artemisia wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In September 2021, I notified the journal that authorship of this paper had been listed for sale on Teziran. Given both the clear indication of misconduct, the severity of the allegations, and the comparative simplicity of the investigation (i.e., establishing that authors had been added following submission), I cannot understand why it took almost two years to retract the paper. It seems to me that journals ought to maintain easily-accessible records of when authors were added during the review process.</p>



<p>The scariest thing about this retraction is that the paper was only caught by a fluke. WayBack Machine caches sites irregularly, which makes it likely that other papers weren&#8217;t caught simply because their auction wasn&#8217;t cached. In light of this concern, I would be curious to know what steps Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines (and, more generally, Taylor &amp; Francis) is doing in order to identify other potentially-affected papers (e.g., searching for other cases of late-stage author addition or investigating other papers by the same authors).</p>

                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Renee Hoch, Managing Editor, PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>Journals&rsquo; and publishers&rsquo; authorship policies set expectations with regard to credit and responsibilities, and can help support researchers in making authorship decisions. By rooting our policies in industry-wide standards, journals across the sector can help to align authorship practices and safeguard the meaning of authorship within academia and the publishing industry. However, it is important to recognize, and adapt as needed, when the standards anchoring our policies fall short in serving our author communities.</p>



<p>On May 10, 2023, PLOS<strong> </strong>updated our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship">Authorship policy</a>. Among other changes, we updated our authorship criteria: all PLOS journals except <em>PLOS Medicine</em> now apply the authorship criteria put forth in a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1715374115">2018 PNAS article</a> by Marcia McNutt <em>et al</em>. (<em>PLOS Medicine</em> is an ICMJE member and continues to apply <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">ICMJE authorship criteria</a>.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="1024" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-791x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21300" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-791x1024.png 791w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-232x300.png 232w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-768x994.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-1187x1536.png 1187w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2.png 1545w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"></figure>



<p>Prior to this change, all PLOS journals followed the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship</a>. These criteria were developed by and for the clinical and biomedical research communities, and were the dominant standard in STM publishing when PLOS launched our initial journals and established our initial editorial policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, an alternative standard emerged from National Academy of Sciences efforts to develop standards relevant across a broader range of disciplines. The 2018 guidance aligns with ICMJE on core requirements of credit and accountability: both advise that substantial contributions should be credited with authorship, all who meet criteria should be listed authors, and authors must fulfill certain responsibilities before and after publication. However, the two standards differ on some specific details.</p>



<p>Importantly, the 2018 guidance takes a more inclusive position on what types of contribution warrant authorship: it supports authorship for software tool development, and does not require all authors to have made substantial contributions to the research <em>AND </em>to manuscript preparation or revision. The allowance that writing or substantial manuscript revision can in itself be deserving of authorship better reflects standards in place within some research disciplines. Given the breadth of communities that PLOS serves, we decided that the more inclusive 2018 standards are better suited for our journal portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newer guidance also aligns better with how PLOS journals approach authorship in practice. We generally entrust authors with authorship decisions, and we require that each author&rsquo;s individual-level contributions be described using CRediT terms. With these considerations in place, not all PLOS journals have rigidly enforced whether listed contributions satisfy all ICMJE criteria. Even so, our requirement for transparency around contributions, combined with other terms in our policies, help us to address authorship issues when they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this policy update, PLOS is continuing in our efforts to advance open science, serve diverse research communities, and promote an inclusive and transparent approach to credit within the published record. We also hope that this update will improve authorship access for individuals &ndash; including those involved in global research &ndash; who make substantial contributions to research or reporting but who may not have the opportunities, skills, or resources needed to satisfy all ICMJE criteria.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-gills-thermoregulate">Why some hammerhead sharks seem to ‘hold their breath’ during dives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even fish sometimes hold their breath in cold, dark, deep water.</p>



<p>Scalloped hammerhead sharks living near Hawaii spend their days basking in warm surface waters. But at night, these fish hunt for squid and other prey in the cold ocean depths hundreds of meters below the surface. The sharks may hold on to body heat in the frigid waters by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suppressing the use of their gills while diving</a>, essentially “holding their breath” for around an hour at a time, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Whales and other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuviers-beaked-whale-longest-record-dive">deep-diving mammals are known to hold their breath</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). But this is the first time the behavior has been spotted in diving fish, says Mark Royer, a shark physiology and behavior researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu.</p>



<p>Sharks and other fish are ectotherms, meaning that their body temperature is largely controlled by the warmth of the water around them. Fish lose and gain a lot of body heat while breathing through their gills, which snag oxygen from water passing through the organ.</p>



<p>“Gills are like giant radiators strapped to your head,” Royer says, explaining that they leak heat. Because of this, a lot of shark species in the tropics tend to stick to roughly the first 100 meters of sun-heated water near the ocean surface, where temperatures hover around 26° Celsius. But tags attached to scalloped hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>) — a species found in coastal waters all over the tropics — revealed that these sharks take nightly, hour-long dives up to 1,000 meters below the surface.</p>



<p>At these depths, water temperatures can get as low as 5° C — far too cold for a tropical shark. To find out how the sharks endured such frigid temperatures, Royer and his colleagues attached specially designed instruments to the backs of sharks that had gathered in a shallow bay off Oahu to mate.</p>



<p>For the next 23 days, these sensors tracked how the sharks moved, how deep they swam, and how their internal temperature changed. “It was kind of like attaching a Fitbit to a shark,” says Royer. “It allowed me to get precise details on what the shark was doing.”</p>



<p>Sharks, the data show, went on V-shaped dives to the depths — plunging hundreds of meters before firing straight back up “like a missile,” says Royer. But strangely, the body temperature of diving sharks barely budged for the bulk of the dive. It was only when the sharks slowed their ascent at a depth of around 290 meters, where the water is a little cooler than at the surface, that their body temperature dropped by an average of 2.8 degrees C.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fish had to be shutting off their gills for most of the dive to hold on to their heat, the researchers concluded. It was only when the sharks had returned to a safer depth temperature-wise that they may have reactivated their gills — taking in oxygen for the first time in around an hour and sucking in cold water in the process.</p>





<p>Holding on to their heat while diving could help sharks move quickly in the deep ocean, says Julia Spaet, a shark ecologist at the University of Cambridge. While it is “absolutely possible” that these hammerhead sharks do this by suppressing gill activity, scientists will need to get direct evidence using cameras or other means to prove that it is true, she says.</p>



<p>At least one video from a deep-sea dive hints that this is the case. The gills of a scalloped hammerhead roaming at a depth of 1,000 meters near Tanzania appeared to be closed in footage captured a few years ago, the researchers note in their paper. This, along with the new study’s find that hammerheads hold on to their body heat, makes Royer “very confident” that sharks are in fact holding their breath. “It just goes to highlight how extraordinary this species is,” he says.</p>

<p>Species of extinct, hefty, rhinoceros-like creatures called brontotheres <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade1833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved into both bigger and smaller forms</a> over their 22-million-year run, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science</em>. But big brontotheres seem to have enjoyed relatively uncrowded ecological niches compared with their smaller kin and so were less prone to extinction, explaining the group’s overall trend toward larger bodies over time.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s a more complex evolutionary world than what pure Darwinism would tell us,” says paleobiologist Juan Cantalapiedra of the University of Alcalá in Madrid. “It&#8217;s not this organized, predictable world where progress is a thing in nature and the better adapted always ended up surviving.”</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-last-days-extinction-book-destruction-recovery">nonavian dinosaurs were wiped out</a> about 66 million years ago, mammals got bigger — and some got really big (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>). Previously no larger than cats or coyotes, some mammals rapidly transformed into titans of a metric ton or more. Brontotheres were among the first mammals to grow to enormous size — their name comes from Greek words for “thunder” and “beast.”</p>



<p>But while more than half of the nearly 60 known brontothere species tipped the scale at over a metric ton, the first footfalls of these “thunder beasts” weren’t thunderous at all. When the earliest brontotheres appeared in the lush forests of ancient North America and Asia in the early Eocene Epoch, roughly 56 million years ago, they were about the size of a border collie — hardly the stuff of thundering herds.</p>



<p>Within about 16 million years, these modest mammals had grown into a family of giants.</p>

<p>This dramatic transformation played out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in other mammal lineages</a> too (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>). And the orthodox explanation for this trend, called Cope’s rule, holds that bigger individuals of a single species have a fitness advantage over smaller ones. Towering over predators is a good way to stay off the menu, and bigger bodies can enable bigger brains, expanded dietary options and many other advantages. “So populations will become larger over time, just because it&#8217;s better,” Cantalapiedra says.</p>



<p>Cope’s rule predicts that natural selection would lead to species and their lineages gradually getting larger over time. But the new study suggests that brontotheres followed a different evolutionary path to gigantism.</p>





<p>Cantalapiedra and colleagues tested how well three different evolutionary scenarios — including Cope’s rule — could explain the fossil record of brontotheres. They also used the fossil data to look for links between brontotheres’ size, ecology and the likelihood of going extinct or splitting into new species.</p>



<p>The new analysis suggests that brontothere species usually stayed about the same size until splitting off into new species, which could be either bigger or smaller than their forebears. But because smaller species branched into new species and went extinct more often, brontotheres overall tended to get bigger with time.</p>



<p>Comparing the family tree of brontotheres with a bonsai, Cantalapiedra says that this mechanism is a bit like letting the bonsai tree’s branches split normally while “cutting branches away from one side.” Cope’s rule, on the other hand, would be like using wires to continuously guide the tree in one direction.</p>



<p>“We often invoke Cope’s rule for large body size in mammals,” says Ryan Felice, an evolutionary biologist at University College London who was not involved in the study. “And maybe this is evidence saying: That’s not the end of the story.”</p>



<p>Beyond body size, there’s a wider question in paleobiology about how drastic evolutionary changes happen.</p>



<p>Going back to Cantalapiedra’s bonsai, does natural selection bend the branches of the tree of life gradually, shaping individual species á la Cope’s rule? Or do dramatic transformations happen when large-scale ecological or environmental processes cut away entire branches?</p>



<p>Brontotheres’ trend toward titanic proportions seems to suggest the latter. In a world with fewer big plant eaters than smaller ones, little brontotheres seem to have faced stiffer competition compared with their colossal kin. Big brontotheres won out because of their different ecology, not necessarily because bigger individuals had an advantage over smaller members of their own species, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Checking whether the same pattern holds for other groups of large animals would be an interesting next step, Felice says. He also suggests incorporating paleoclimate data into the analysis to look for any links between changes in climate and mammal evolution — patterns that could hint at possible rippling evolutionary effects of modern climate change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-universe-expansion-hubble-constant">A reappearing supernova offers a new measure of the universe’s expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cosmic camera hog is helping astronomers figure out the rate of the universe’s expansion.</p>



<p>Images of the supernova Refsdal have popped up multiple times in the constellation Leo, thanks to light from the stellar explosion wending its way through the gravitational field of a cluster of galaxies. Analyzing delays between Refsdal’s appearances provides <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new measurement of the Hubble constant</a>, researchers report online May 11 in <em>Science</em>. That constant describes how quickly galaxies are flying away from each other as the universe expands. The new measurement is now contributing to debate over how fast the universe is expanding.</p>





<p>Supernovas are massive explosions that come at the ends of some stars’ life cycles. They’re among the most violent and brilliant events in the universe. In 2014, astronomer Patrick Kelly of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis discovered the Refsdal supernova in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Instead of a single burst in the sky, Kelly says, “We saw four images of it.” They formed a pattern known as an Einstein Cross. The cross resulted because the gravity of a cluster of galaxies between the Earth and Refsdal distorts space and time to create a gravitational lens that deflects the light on its way to us.</p>



<p>The location and arrival times of the images we see depend on three things: the distribution of matter in the galaxy cluster that makes up the lens; the distances between Earth, the lens and the supernova; and the Hubble constant. The combined effect on the light from Refsdal is so strong that in 2014, Kelly predicted that one more image from the supernova would be delayed by another year. Sure enough, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/supernova-captured-quadruple-comes-back-encore">light from Refsdal showed up in the sky again in 2015</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/16</em>).</p>



<p>The new calculations from Kelly and colleagues greatly improve a 2018 measurement of the Hubble constant using Refsdal’s appearances, putting it at about 66.6 kilometers per second per megaparsec, based on gravitational lens models that most closely matched their observations. “The meticulous modeling of the [lens] system, along with the gravitational forces it generates, have allowed [the team] to decrease the margin of error in estimating the Hubble constant by more than a factor of two,” says astronomer Vivian Miranda of Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Studies that estimate the Hubble constant in other ways don’t agree well with each other. One method that relies on ancient light left over from early cosmic times suggests that the universe is expanding at about 67 km/s/Mpc. That’s close to the value Kelly’s group found. But an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">expansion estimate that uses the distances to supernovas</a> based on their brightness comes in around 74 km/s/Mpc (<em>SN 7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>“The predicted value of the Hubble constant is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the universe, both in the distant past and the recent present,” Miranda says. “If our understanding of the universe is accurate, all the various methods of measuring the Hubble constant should align.”</p>



<p>Settling the discrepancy between different values of the Hubble constant is crucial to explaining things like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">dark energy</a>, which appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe (<em>SN: 3/21/98</em>).</p>





<p>It will take another supernova and lens to make a big leap in precision over the Refsdal study. A <a href="https://www.sci.news/astronomy/hubble-multiply-imaged-gravitationally-lensed-supernova-09873.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recurring image of a supernova in the constellation Cetus</a> that’s expected to appear in 2037 might do the trick (<em>SN: 9/13/21</em>). In the meantime, Kelly says, further refinements in the model of the gravitational lens that caused the multiplied Refsdal images could improve estimates of the Hubble constant somewhat.</p>



<p>“This is the first example of this kind of measurement,” Kelly says. “It sets the stage for additional measurements and increased precision,” which could deepen astronomers’ insights into our ever-expanding universe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-explains-shout-wind-acoustics">Science explains why shouting into the wind seems futile</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shouting into the wind isn’t so ineffective after all.</p>



<p>The idiom is commonly used to describe an unsuccessful attempt to communicate. But it’s not actually more difficult to shout upwind, says acoustics researcher Ville Pulkki of Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. </p>



<p>Sending a sound upwind, against the flow of air, makes the sound louder due to an acoustical effect called convective amplification. Sound sent downwind is quieter. So, if you’re yelling upwind, a listener standing in front of you should have no problem hearing you — contrary to popular belief.</p>





<p>The misperception has a simple explanation, Pulkki says. “When you yell against the wind, you hear yourself worse.” That’s because, in this scenario, your ears are downwind of your mouth. That means your own voice sounds quieter to you.</p>



<p>Pulkki’s first attempt at testing the effect involved him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3DG8QPYEX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hollering with his head out the top of a moving vehicle</a> as microphones recorded the amplitude of his voice. The <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/143/2/1173/606458/Effects-of-flow-gradients-on-directional-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results were inconclusive</a> about the reason yelling upwind seems hard, so Pulkki and colleagues upped their technology game.</p>



<p>For the new study, the team put a simulated yeller — a cylinder and a speaker playing multiple tones — on top of a moving vehicle. Microphones measured sound amplitude at the location of the mouth and ears when the yeller was facing either upwind or downwind. The experiments together with computer simulations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32306-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the source of the misperception</a>, the researchers report March 31 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A similar effect occurs when an ambulance goes by. Most people are familiar with the sudden change of pitch of the siren’s sound due to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doppler-effect-takes-spin">Doppler effect</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/13</em>). But the siren is also slightly louder when moving toward a stationary observer than it is when it’s moving away. When you’re bellowing upwind, it’s not the source of sound that’s moving, but the medium in which the sound travels.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Whichever way the wind blows, acoustics can explain it.</p>

<p>An investigation at McMaster University found that Jonathan Pruitt, a behavioral ecologist by training who has <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dPruitt%252c%2bJonathan%2bN">had 15 papers retracted</a> in the last three years, “engaged in fabrication and falsification” including duplicating data, according to summarized findings sent to coauthors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kate Laskowski, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, shared on Twitter the summary McMaster had sent her about three papers she had coauthored with Pruitt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>McMaster’s investigation found Pruitt “generally failed to meet the requirements expected of a tenured professor” under the university’s research integrity policy, and had breached the policy in multiple ways:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee also found that Dr. Pruitt failed to exhibit the rigour, reasonably necessary to comply with the Policy, in the performance of their research or in reporting their data and findings in the various papers which were examined.

<p>Laskowski told us that multiple summaries of findings about other papers were sent out, and another she’d seen was “very similar” to the one she received. McMaster University has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, Pruitt would claim to have collected data in the field and then share it with collaborators at various institutions who took it on faith that the data were real. Laskowski was one of those collaborators who kicked off public scrutiny of Pruitt’s work in 2020 after being alerted to anomalies in the data. The case gained attention when she tweeted about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/20/im-starting-the-year-off-with-something-i-didnt-expect-to-ever-do-im-retracting-a-paper/">retracting</a> one of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKate%2bL%2bLaskowski">All three</a> she co-authored with Pruitt have since been retracted, as well as a dozen Pruitt coauthored with other scientists who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/29/authors-questioning-papers-at-nearly-two-dozen-journals-in-wake-of-spider-paper-retraction/">reevaluated their work after Laskowski came forward</a>.

<p>Pruitt <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/embattled-spider-biologist-resigns-university-post">resigned</a> from a prestigious Canada 150 Research Chair position at McMaster last summer after reaching a settlement with the university, <em>Science</em> reported at the time. Pruitt appears to be listed as a science teacher at Tampa Catholic High School in Florida, but the extension on their <a href="https://www.tampacatholic.org/team-member/jonathan-pruitt">faculty page</a> directs to a different person’s voicemail. Pruit has not responded to a request for comment sent to their school email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laskowski told us that McMaster’s lack of transparency in the case had been “frustrating.” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I honestly assumed we&#8217;d never hear anything about the results of McMaster&#8217;s investigation, so this is a pleasant, albeit highly delayed, surprise. I had come to the same conclusion on my own years ago, but it&#8217;s nice to have some measure of closure on the whole thing.</p>

<p>Update, 2100 UTC, 5/11/23: McMaster released a <a href="https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/worthmentioning/update-on-research-misconduct-case/">statement</a> about the findings and published a &#8220;<a href="https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/RI-Pruitt-summary-of-findings.pdf">copy of the committee&#8217;s key findings</a>.&#8221; The statement reads, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When the university received complaints about some of Pruitt’s research in early 2020. McMaster retained retired academic and prominent labour arbitrator William Kaplan to investigate the matter. Throughout the investigation more complaints surfaced that required the university to expand Kaplan’s mandate and required the review of thousands of documents. As well, Kaplan interviewed Pruitt eight times, along with 13 other people, including complainants, co-investigators, and witnesses. The university immediately began its hearing process after receiving Kaplan’s report.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soft-robot-flower-shape-brain-monitoring">A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive</a></h4>

              
                <p>A tiny, flexible machine might one day help neuroscientists eavesdrop on electrical activity in the brain, allowing them to pinpoint and potentially treat seizures.</p>



<p>Inserted into the skull through a hole just 1 to 2 centimeters wide, the flower-shaped device <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.add1002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfurls a flexible array of sensors that contact the brain’s surface</a>, allowing it to monitor electrical activity, researchers report May 10 in <em>Science Robotics</em>. A successful demonstration on a minipig suggests the device could be a less invasive way to place sensors directly on the brain, which currently can require removal of a large section of skull.</p>





<p>The device is known as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean">soft robot</a>: soft, because unlike traditional mechanical devices, it&#8217;s made of flexible materials, and robot, because its sensory apparatus moves, opening like a flower once implanted (<em>SN: 3/3/21</em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;Of all the soft robotics that I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s kind of the one that you say, ‘Wow, this is really going to change, potentially, the way we do things in neurosurgery,’&#8221; says Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. &#8220;The idea of a robot that kind of internally unfolds and goes over the brain is just very elegant.&#8221;</p>



<p>The robotic device consists of a central hub surrounded by six flat, petal-shaped sensors made of a soft, flexible material. At first, the petals are inverted into the hub. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit like a glove where &#8230; you flip it outside in,” says Stéphanie Lacour, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva.</p>



<p>Once inside the skull, a flow of saline solution through the hub gently forces the petals open, where they then lay flat against the surface of the cerebral cortex. Sensors in each petal signal when they’re in place and then start monitoring the brain, sending information back to a monitor via electrical wires.</p>



<p>Lacour and colleagues tested a prototype in the brain of a minipig, successfully deploying the roughly daisy-sized sensor array inside the skull and recording electrical activity. The technology could be sized up to cover a larger area for human use, Lacour says. Future versions could be bidirectional, she says, not only sensing brain activity but also stimulating it. That might allow the device to stop seizure activity before it begins, stimulate brain areas damaged by stroke or act as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">a brain-machine interface</a> to allow people to control devices (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers have created a company to further develop the technology and conduct the additional testing that will be required to gain approval for use in human patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity">The new human pangenome could help unveil the biology of everyone</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than 20 years after people got a peek at the first draft of the human genome, our genetic instruction book, researchers have unlocked the next level: the human pangenome.</p>



<p>In four studies published May 10 in <em>Nature</em>, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe the achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01793-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the pangenome was built</a> and some of the new biology scientists are learning from it.</p>



<p>The more complete reference book, which includes almost all the DNA of 47 people, will allow researchers to explore types of variation that could never be examined before, such as large chunks of duplicated, lost or rearranged DNA. That work could possibly reveal more details about the genetic underpinnings of heart diseases, schizophrenia and various other diseases and disorders.</p>





<p>The pangenome adds 119 million DNA bases — the information-carrying units of DNA — not present in the existing human genome, called the reference genome. Much of that DNA is in never-before-explored parts of the genome containing multiple copies of genes that are duplicated from originals elsewhere in the DNA.</p>



<p>Those duplicated parts are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05895-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing faster</a> than nonduplicated portions of the genome, says Evan Eichler, a human geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle and one of the leaders of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. What’s more, when Eichler and colleagues examined the types of variants that arise in these duplicated regions, they found “a very strong signal that the mutations that are occurring are fundamentally different from [mutations in] the rest of the genome,” he says.</p>



<p>Some of these duplicated regions include ones implicated in humans’ large brains relative to other species and other traits that set humans apart from other primates. Others have been implicated in certain traits or diseases.</p>



<p>Conversely, another study found that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05976-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very short arms of certain chromosomes</a>, including chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, are becoming more like each other as they swap DNA. Those short arms are important because they contain genes for making ribosomal RNAs, which serve as the scaffolds for ribosomes, the machinery responsible for building every protein in the body.</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest achievement of the pangenome project is that it is finally giving researchers a more complete look at the full spectrum of human genetic diversity.</p>



<h4>How was the pangenome built?</h4>





<p>The roughly two-decade-old human reference genome derives mostly from one man, but is a patchwork <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">quilt of more than 60 people’s DNA</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). It has been restitched and added to over the years but still has holes.</p>



<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">first fully complete human genome</a> was announced (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>). That genome contains all of the DNA from tip to tip, or telomere to telomere, of each human chromosome. Except that genome wasn’t from a person. It came from a type of tumor known as a hydatidiform mole. These unusual tumors result when a human sperm fertilizes an empty egg and the father’s chromosomes are duplicated.</p>



<p>The genetic information from such tumors represents “not even one individual. It&#8217;s from one half of one individual,” says human geneticist Timothy O’Connor of the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore who was not involved in either project.</p>



<p>The new pangenome draft is from actual people and contains almost complete DNA from 47 anonymous individuals from different parts of the world. That diversity is important “because it helps us to understand ourselves as a single human species, as a single human race,” O’Connor says.</p>



<p>Past genetics research has been criticized for relying too heavily on DNA from people of European heritage. Studying just one population of people could mean missing genetic variants that have arisen in specific populations, O’Connor says. “Having a pangenome reference allows us to assess that population-specific variation in a much more detailed way. And hopefully, that will then lead to greater insight into the biology of everyone.”</p>



<p>While the pangenome is a great first step to better represent all human genetic diversity, O’Connor says, “it still is missing key groups in the world. It&#8217;s still underrepresenting Latin Americans and Indigenous Americans, and … there&#8217;s nobody included from Oceania.… There&#8217;s still a lot more variation that needs to be added to the pangenome to really, truly be representative of everyone.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Added diversity is coming, human geneticist Karen Miga of the University of California, Santa Cruz said during a May 9 news conference. The consortium plans to complete a total of 350 genomes, including these 47, by mid-2024. The first phase of the project was aimed at developing the technology to build the pangenome.</p>



<p>Now, the consortium is in talks with Indigenous groups and scientists from around the world about “trying to develop a shared framework, so that it&#8217;s not the U.S. trying to set the table. It&#8217;s really providing a table and inviting other stakeholders who see the value in creating this type of reference resource to join us,” said Miga, who helped lead the pangenome project.</p>



<h4>How is the pangenome important for human health?</h4>



<p>Having a more complete understanding of human genetic diversity could help researchers begin to unravel the genetic underpinnings of various diseases and disorders.</p>



<p>What’s more, new DNA deciphering technologies have allowed pangenome researchers to examine types of genetic variants that have been difficult to study before.</p>



<p>In particular, duplicated regions of the genome were hard to study because researchers previously could read only short pieces of DNA. There was no way to tell where in the vast puzzle of the human genome those nearly identical pieces fit. Newer “long-read” DNA deciphering, or sequencing, technology makes it possible to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">read stretches of DNA many thousands of bases long</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>Being able to assess where some people have extra DNA and others are missing DNA, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shared-differences">structural variants</a>, adds a more nuanced view of human genetics,  O’Connor says, revealing more of its complexity (<em>SN: 4/10/09</em>).</p>



<p>For instance, researchers used the pangenome map to trace how chromosomes fold up so that different parts are touching each other. Scientists could see some folds and chemical marks in structural variants that may affect how genes are turned on and off. That could affect traits or health. Eichler’s group also mapped one version of a gene that has converted another copy into its own image. These gene conversions were surprisingly common with each person having, on average, more than 2,000 instances of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this more nuanced and complex view of human genetics comes a promise for improved genetics-based medicine. But it may take a while before the pangenome makes a difference in medical clinics, Eichler says.</p>



<p>Researchers hope the pangenome will help them more easily diagnose the genetic changes that contribute to rare diseases and find treatments for common disorders, he says. Once that happens, clinicians may start incorporating data from the pangenome in their practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruption-nitrogen-lightning-life">Ancient giant eruptions may have seeded nitrogen needed for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millions of years ago, giant volcanic eruptions in what’s now Turkey and Peru each deposited millions of metric tons of nitrate on the surrounding land. That nutrient <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-7027.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have come from volcanic lightning</a>, researchers reported April 24 at a meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna.</p>



<p>The discovery adds evidence to the idea that, early in Earth’s history, volcanoes could have provided some of the materials that made it possible for life to emerge, says volcanologist Erwan Martin of Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>





<p>Nitrogen is an essential ingredient in biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA. It makes up about 78 percent of the atmosphere. But nitrogen molecules in the air consist of two tightly bound nitrogen atoms. Only when these atoms are separated will they react with other elements and create <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-thin-air">forms of nitrogen useful to life</a>, such as nitrate (<em>SN: 4/8/08</em>).</p>



<p>Some microbes can tease apart the nitrogen molecules and provide “fixed nitrogen” to plants and fungi. Human chemists can do it too, creating fertilizer. But before life could start, some nonbiological process must have been at play.</p>



<p>Lightning is the obvious candidate, Martin says. These extremely energetic electric discharges can tear apart nitrogen atoms, which will combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides and eventually nitrate.</p>



<p>The lightning in thunderstorms, brought about by ice particles colliding and charging, separates nitrogen molecules every day, but at low rates and spread out over large areas. Volcanic plumes, in which dust particles do the colliding and charging, can provide localized lightning at staggering intensities. During one day of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai</a> volcano in Indonesia, for instance, there were about 400,000 discharges (<em>SN: 12/13/22</em>).</p>



<p>Even that large amount of lightning creates a relatively small amount of nitrate. But rare, huge eruptions, of the kind that happen only every 100,000 years or so, could create much more. The idea that such events could produce and deposit a lot of nitrate is not new, Martin says, but until now nobody had actually looked at the nitrogen content of volcanic deposits from these eruptions.</p>



<p>His group sampled outcrops in Turkey and Peru linked to 10 explosive eruptions that happened between 20 million and 1 million years ago. Their locations’ relatively dry climate helps ensure that any nitrate formed long ago, which is soluble in water, would not have all leached out by now.</p>



<p>The nitrate that the researchers found turns out to contain oxygen atoms with different masses, in a proportion similar to that of the three oxygen atoms that make up each molecule of ozone in the air. This shows that the nitrates were formed in the atmosphere and not by some process on the ground, the team says.</p>





<p>Based on their sampling, the researchers estimate that each eruption on average deposited about 60 million tons of nitrate.</p>



<p>Life may have begun <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-microfossils-suggest-life-thrived-earth-about-4-billion-years-ago">roughly 3.7 billion years ago</a>, long before the eruptions that Martin and colleagues studied (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>). But Earth’s early years were full of such extreme volcanism. Some researchers think that lightning over volcanic islands, in particular, played a role in the emergence of life, before even the continents were fully formed. On the young Earth, Martin says, similar amounts of nitrate as those estimated in the new study could have been produced on such islands, long since submerged.</p>



<p>The study&#8217;s concept is interesting, says marine chemist Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. But he thinks the researchers should have addressed the different composition of the atmosphere at the time that life first came on the scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;In today’s world, lightning on volcanic islands produces copious amounts of nitrogen oxides,” Bada says. “But in the early Earth, when the atmosphere had little oxygen in it, the product would have been probably ammonia.” Like nitrate, ammonia is a form of nitrogen that’s biologically usable.<br><br>But, Martin says, in a volcanic plume, there is a lot of water and other oxygen compounds coming from the magma, which could have supplied some of that oxygen. And in those early days, he says, “maybe it wasn&#8217;t nitrate but ammonia — it&#8217;s still nitrogen available for life. These are still things that need to be studied.”</p>

<p>A new report from a UK Parliament committee calls for scientific publishers to correct and retract papers much quicker than they currently do, for the sake of research integrity and reproducibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-and-technology-committee">Science, Innovation and Technology Select Committee of the House of Commons</a> issued its <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.html">report</a> today, following an inquiry to which Retraction Watch and one of our cofounders, Ivan Oransky, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/3142/html/">provided</a> <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/42152/html/">evidence</a>. Many others also gave evidence, including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">sleuth</a> <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/3142/html/">Dorothy Bishop</a>. </p>



<p>The report is an extensive look at current issues of reproducibility and research integrity, and includes many recommendations. About the role of scientific publishers, the report says:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127086"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Publishers should support academics who report issues with published research in their journals and should commit to timely publication of research error corrections and retractions where necessary—in our view this process should not take longer than two months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As readers of Retraction Watch know, the process of correcting or retracting a paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/17/what-took-more-than-five-years-elsevier-retracts-20-papers-by-worlds-most-prolific-fraudster/">often</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/05/why-did-all-of-these-retractions-take-more-than-three-years/">takes</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/23/which-takes-longer-to-produce-an-infant-who-can-sit-on-his-own-or-a-retraction/">years</a>. That average length of time <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ivanoransky/the-relationship-between-pubpeer-comments-and-the-speed-of-retraction">has not changed significantly</a> in years, either. In a passage quoted by the committee in its report, we note that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A growing group of ‘sleuths’ has found thousands of problematic papers, most of which have yet to be corrected or retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee also called for publishers to provide sufficient outlets for negative or confirmatory studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond recommendations for publishers, the report recommended funding for replication studies and for the inclusion of statistical experts and software developers on research teams, that researchers publish their data and code in open-access repositories, and that undergraduate, postgraduate, and early career researchers receive training on reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/san-francisco-plane-waste-covid-19-variant">San Francisco airport will monitor plane waste for COVID-19 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>International travelers can now contribute valuable data to COVID-19 surveillance efforts in the United States from above the clouds.</p>



<p>San Francisco International Airport has launched a new program to test airplane wastewater for variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, <a href="https://www.flysfo.com/about/media/press-releases/sfo-first-airport-launch-new-cdc-program-test-airplane-wastewater-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airport announced May 9</a>. The program is the first in the country to continuously monitor sewage from airplanes, after previous studies demonstrated the potential value of this work.</p>



<p>Airplane wastewater is a key source for COVID-19 surveillance because international travelers frequently bring new variants into the country, experts say. As fewer people get their noses swabbed in health care facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7219e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking for new ways</a> to keep tabs on how the coronavirus mutates. Searching for genetic material in airplane <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">bathroom waste</a> can help fill that data gap — and even provide early warnings for future health crises (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>).</p>





<p>“We know variants have been imported from around the globe,” says Alexandria Boehm, an environmental engineer at Stanford University who leads <a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WastewaterSCAN</a>, one of the biggest wastewater surveillance programs in the United States. Testing airplane waste “can give us a sense of which variants are being imported and help us prepare.”</p>



<p>For the new project, the San Francisco airport is collaborating with the CDC and Concentric by Ginkgo, a biosecurity and public health team in Boston.</p>



<p>Testing started on April 20, according to a spokesperson for the airport. Airport workers are taking samples from vacuum trucks that suck waste out of airplane bathrooms, using an automatic machine that plugs into a central dumping point. “We’re basically creating a composite sample of the trucks, which themselves are a composite sample of aircraft,” says Andrew Franklin, director of business development at Concentric.</p>



<p>The San Francisco airport has one dumping point dedicated to international flights, which are a priority for testing because passengers are more likely to use the restroom — and deliver solid samples — when they spend many hours on the plane. The airport is shipping one composite sample per day, six days a week, back to a lab, where scientists isolate the coronavirus’ genetic material and put the results through machines that map the virus’ genes.</p>



<p>The resulting data are complicated, says Casandra Philipson, director of bioinformatics at Concentric, as each sample includes hundreds of passengers from around the world. “Trying to figure out how to determine actual frequencies of mutations or variants” in the sewage samples will be a challenge, she says, though simply seeing certain variants pop up in the data will warn health officials about what to watch out for.</p>



<p>Concentric has worked with the CDC on <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring COVID-19 among international travelers</a> since fall 2021, when the company started offering free PCR tests to people returning from long flights. About 170,000 travelers have contributed to the program, which has picked up new variants before they spread widely in the United States.</p>





<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smruthi-karthikeyan-coronavirus-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">wastewater surveillance</a> is more efficient than voluntary nose swabs, leading scientists to focus on this approach for future monitoring efforts (<em>SN: 9/29/22</em>). In August and September 2022, Concentric and CDC researchers ran a pilot program at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to test the idea. Out of 88 samples collected from airplane bathrooms, the team was able to perform PCR tests on 80, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7208a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2</a>, the scientists reported in the Feb. 24 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Analysis of genetic material from 25 samples turned up a variety of coronavirus variants.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00129-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other research projects</a> and <a href="https://www.luminultra.com/blog/luminultra-participates-in-innovative-wastewater-surveillance-pilot-project-at-toronto-pearson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot programs</a> have similarly <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated this technique’s potential</a> for detecting variants. The <a href="https://wastewater-observatory.jrc.ec.europa.eu/static/pdf/Sampling%20Aircrafts_FINAL_Version%209%20Jan%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission has issued guidance</a> for airports in the European Union that may want to try it out. As with other forms of wastewater surveillance, though, scientists are still working to understand how they might interpret and act on the data. “It will be a new data stream that we’ll have to learn to use as it evolves,” Boehm says.</p>



<p>In addition to tracking coronavirus variants, scientists hope that future programs like the one at the San Francisco airport can lay the groundwork for monitoring new diseases that might enter the United States through international airports. “It’s easy to also test the samples for other emerging pathogens,” says Colleen Naughton, an environmental engineer at the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>The Concentric team is excited about this potential and looking for other types of health data that might come out of airplane waste. “We’re building this future technology,” Philipson says, “to expand the toolkit for pathogens of public health concern.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnets-meteorites-space">Why you shouldn’t use magnets when looking for meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s time to drop the magnets, meteorite hunters. The commonly used method for identifying space rocks can destroy scientific information.</p>



<p>Touching even a small magnet to a meteorite can <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JE007464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erase any record the rock might have retained about the magnetic field</a> of its parent body, researchers report in the April <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>. And the concern isn’t theoretical: a subset of the oldest known Martian meteorites appear to have already had their magnetic memories wiped, the team showed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists often turn to meteorites to get a closeup look at other worlds, as well as understand our own. The space rocks can contain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crushed-space-rocks-meteorites-exoplanets-early-atmosphere">traces of planetary atmospheres</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">chemical building blocks for life</a> and more (<em>SN: 1/26/21</em>; <em>SN: 4/26/22</em>).</p>



<p>Planetary scientist Foteini Vervelidou uses meteorites from Mars — chunks of the planet that were blasted into space by an impact and later captured by Earth’s gravity — to study its ancient past. Just <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few hundred</a> are known to exist. Rarer still are specimens that contain minerals carrying imprints of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sad-magnetic-state-solar-systems-rocky-worlds">the Red Planet’s magnetic field, which collapsed</a> about 3.7 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/7/15</em>). The oldest known Martian meteorites, which date to roughly 4.4 billion years ago, therefore present an “amazing chance to study the magnetic field,” says Vervelidou, of MIT and the Institute of Earth Physics of Paris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But such opportunities can be readily squandered, Vervelidou and colleagues have shown. The team’s numerical calculations and experiments with earthly rocks — stand-ins for meteorites — confirmed that bringing a hand magnet close to a rock can rearrange the spins of the rock’s electrons. That rearrangement overwrites the imprint of a previous magnetic field, a process called remagnetization.<br><br>What’s more, the process appears to happen frequently. The team examined nine meteorites found at different times and places on Earth. All of them are thought to have originated from the same oldest known chunk of Mars, which most likely broke up when it entered Earth’s atmosphere. All had been remagnetized. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding is unfortunate, but it’s not surprising, says Melinda Hutson, a meteoriticist at Portland State University in Oregon and the curator of the <a href="http://meteorites.pdx.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cascadia Meteorite Laboratory</a> who was not involved in the research. “Just about everyone wants to stick a magnet on the side of a potential meteorite.”</p>



<p>It is possible to evaluate a meteorite without destroying its magnetic properties. Vervelidou uses a lab instrument called a susceptibility meter, which measures how an object would respond to a magnetic field. And portable versions exist: She and a team of meteorite researchers used one to find nearly 1,000 meteorites on a recent expedition in Chile. Hopefully, Vervelidou says, some of those space rocks will shed light on Mars’ magnetic past.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pythagoras-math-reality-music-spheres">How Pythagoras turned math into a tool for understanding reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever heard the phrase “the music of the spheres,” your first thought probably wasn’t about mathematics.</p>



<p>But in its historical origin, the music of the spheres actually was all about math. In fact, that phrase represents a watershed in the history of math’s relationship with science.</p>



<p>In its earliest forms, as practiced in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, math was mainly a practical tool for facilitating human interactions. Math was important for calculating the area of a farmer’s field, for keeping track of workers’ wages, for specifying the right amount of ingredients when making bread or beer. Nobody used math to investigate the nature of physical reality.</p>





<p>Not until ancient Greek philosophers began to seek scientific explanations for natural phenomena (without recourse to myths) did anybody bother to wonder how math would help. And the first of those Greeks to seriously put math to use for that purpose was the mysterious religious cult leader <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pythagoras of Samos.</a></p>



<p>It was Pythagoras who turned math from a mere tool for practical purposes into the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. As the historian <a href="https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/geoffrey-lloyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Lloyd</a> noted, “The Pythagoreans were … the first theorists to have attempted deliberately to give the knowledge of nature a quantitative, mathematical foundation.”</p>



<p>Pythagoras was born in about 575 B.C. on Samos, an island in the Eastern Mediterranean near the coast of present-day Turkey. He traveled widely, to Egypt and Babylonia and perhaps even Persia, to learn how math was used in those ancient cultures. He may even have spent time in the city of Miletus (not far from Samos) to study with the aging Thales, the founder of the ancient Greek effort to explain the world rationally.</p>



<p>Around the age of 40 or so, Pythagoras headed west to southern Italy, settling in the Greek colony town of Croton. There he initiated a new phase of ancient science, mixing religion, music and math in a cult devoted to living in harmony with nature. For Pythagoras, the historian of Greek philosophy W.K.C. Guthrie wrote, philosophy ceases to be primarily about explaining nature but instead “becomes the search for a way of life whereby a right relationship might be established between the philosopher and the universe.”</p>



<p>Of course, if your goal is to live in harmony with the universe, you need to know something about the universe. So even though Pythagoras basically established a religious cult, he and his followers still expanded the Greek quest to explain the cosmos.</p>



<p>And that’s where math came in.</p>





<h4>The universe is made from numbers</h4>



<p>Pythagoras believed that, at its root, reality was made from numbers. That sounds crazy to modern minds taught that matter is made of atoms and molecules. But in ancient times, nobody really knew anything about what reality is. Every major philosopher had a favorite idea for what sort of substance served as reality’s foundation. </p>



<p>Thales, for instance, thought everything derived from water. His student Anaximander rebelled, arguing that reality at its root consisted of some infinite, featureless material called the apeiron, or the unlimited. Anaximenes, Anaximander’s successor, rejected the apeiron in favor of air — everything could be explained by air either rarefying or solidifying. A later philosopher, Heraclitus, insisted that everything ultimately came from fire.</p>



<p>Pythagoras chose numbers. Numbers, he taught his followers, are the seeds from which all reality grows. All members of the Pythagorean cult had to recite an oath crediting him with identifying the numbers “which contain the fount and root of ever-flowing nature.”</p>



<p>Specifically, Pythagoras identified the root of reality in what he called the <em>tetractys, </em>consisting of the first four integers: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Added together, those numbers equal 10. Ten, Pythagoras concluded, is the “perfect” number, the number that holds the key to understanding nature.</p>



<p>And why 1, 2, 3 and 4? Because those numbers were the key to creating harmonious sounds.</p>



<p>Imagine plucking a taut string of fixed length, producing a musical note. If you pluck a string half as long, you get another note, separated from the first note by an octave. If the strings are plucked simultaneously, the two notes are harmonious. In other words, a 2:1 ratio of string lengths produces a pleasing sound. In a similar way, other harmonious musical intervals called the fourth and the fifth represent string length ratios of 4:3 and 3:2. Pythagoras realized that these harmony-producing ratios all involved the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Therefore, he concluded, their sum, 10, was the key number for developing a theory of the universe.</p>

<p>Pythagoras himself may not have developed that theory fully, but his later followers produced a vision of the universe consisting of heavenly bodies revolving around a “central fire.” That fire was NOT the sun, which was just one of the other heavenly bodies. The sun shone brightly because it reflected the light from the central fire back to the Earth (and the inhabited part of the Earth always faced away from the fire).</p>



<p>The Pythagoreans surmised that the motions of the heavenly bodies generated pleasant music. As Aristotle later explained it, those bodies move rapidly and therefore they must make sound, because anything moving quickly on Earth makes sound (think arrows whizzing through the air). Proper ratios of the planets’ speeds (which depended on their distances from the central fire) guaranteed that the sounds would be harmonious. Hence the moving planets created a “harmony of the heavens.” Because later Greek writers supposed that each planet is carried on its orbit by a rotating sphere, eventually that harmony became known as “the music of the spheres.”</p>



<h4>The universe is a musical instrument</h4>



<p>So in a sense, the Pythagoreans believed that the universe itself could be regarded as a gigantic musical instrument. As Aristotle put it, the Pythagoreans thought “the whole heaven to be a musical scale and number.”</p>



<p>But this picture had a problem. The Pythagoreans knew of only eight heavenly bodies: Earth, moon, sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. A ninth, outermost sphere transported the fixed stars. But to be perfect, the cosmos needed a 10th body. So the Pythagoreans proposed the existence of another planet, a “counter-Earth,” orbiting the central fire inside the orbit of the Earth. Nobody could see that planet because it was always on the other side of the fire. Rather than limit their description of the cosmos to what could be observed, the Pythagoreans resorted to mathematical theory to infer the existence of an unseen reality.</p>



<p>This theory was wrong, of course. But it nevertheless foreshadowed the modern use of mathematics to predict unseen phenomena. In the 19th century, for instance, James Clerk Maxwell used equations to predict the existence of radio waves. In the 20th century, Paul Dirac used math to predict the existence of antimatter. And in the 21st century, astronomers detected gravitational waves, vibrating space itself, as physicists had expected based on the math of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Using math for understanding nature was unknown before Pythagoras. It was his idea. Previously math had been a tool for scribes or surveyors or cooks. “Pythagoras freed mathematics from these practical applications,” the Dutch mathematician B.L. van der Waerden wrote in his <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.134.3494.1975.a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classic history of ancient math</a>. “The Pythagoreans pursued mathematics as a kind of religious contemplation, as a way to approach the eternal Truth.”</p>



<p>As for the music of the spheres, one issue remained. If the heavens made harmonious sounds, why didn’t anybody hear them? Aristotle reported that the Pythagoreans “explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence.”</p>



<p>Aristotle rejected that explanation, just as he rejected the idea of a “counter-Earth” as well as the whole notion that everything was made from numbers. And yet, the importance of numbers in science, first expressed by Pythagoras, ultimately proved to be much more resilient than most of Aristotle’s ideas. As experts on early Greek philosophy André Laks and Glenn Most have written, “Of all the early Greek philosophers,” Pythagoras “without a doubt exerted the longest-lasting influence until the beginning of modern times.”</p>

<p>The authors of a 2018 nanoscience paper have retracted the article after three doctoral students highlighted a problem with its methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2018 study <a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/nanospears-may-revolutionize-gene-therapy/">attracted media attention</a> for suggesting that nanospears, microscopic structures similar to splinters, may be useful in delivering gene therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/weiss-paul-s/">Paul Weiss</a>, a nanoscientist and a corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://twitter.com/PSWnano/status/1643694132924383232">announced</a> the retraction on Twitter April 5, the same day the retraction notice appeared. Weiss holds several academic positions, including Presidential Chair of Chemistry and Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).</p>



<span id="more-127070"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b00763">study</a>, “Precision-Guided Nanospears for Targeted and High-Throughput Intracellular Gene Delivery,” was published in <em>ACS Nano,</em> of which Weiss was a <a href="http://archive.sciencewatch.com/inter/jou/2010/10sepACSNano/">founding editor-in-chief</a>. It has been cited 80 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.3c02453">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors retract this article (DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b00763) as the fluorescence method by which the transfection efficiency was determined is unreliable and incorrect and led to greatly overestimated values of efficiency. The original data are also no longer available and cannot be verified.</p>



<p>We thank Drs. Jason Belling, Alexandra Mendoza, and Natcha Wattanatorn for bringing the measurement issue to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Xiaodong Chen, the journal’s editor-in-chief and a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, for comment and heard back from an ACS spokesperson, who said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The issue you mention below was an author-requested retraction. For reference, we follow <a href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines">COPE’s retraction guidelines</a> in such situations.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three scientists the notice credited for flagging the error were PhD students at the time.&nbsp; One was an author of the original study, Weiss and his co-authors Hsian-Rong Tseng and Steven J. Jonas, both also at UCLA, told <em>Retraction Watch </em>in a joint email. All have since earned their degrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted Belling, Mendoza, and Wattanatorn, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>Weiss, Tseng, and Jonas said the three then-students flagged the error about a month after the paper was initially published, preventing it from creeping into other papers. They said they had planned to repeat the experiments properly, but “the equipment and people were not available,” so they retracted the paper. They added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We plan to repeat these experiments with the correct measurements to determine accurate efficiencies.</p>



<p>We did a thorough search for the original data and could not find it as, at the time, the data on the microscope used were not archived. We have addressed this issue throughout our laboratory.</p>



<p>We very much appreciate the support the community has shown since we published and publicized this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After Weiss posted the retraction note on Twitter, several scientists tweeted in support.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">The James Webb telescope revealed surprise asteroids in the Fomalhaut star system</a></h4>

              
                <p>The star Fomalhaut is ready for its close-up.</p>



<p>Rings of dust encircle the young star in stunning new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. The photos offer a clearer view of the star system — already famous for previous images of a purported, now widely disputed, planet. Features in the system include an oddly cockeyed asteroid belt, an expanding cloud of debris from a possible planet collision, and other unidentified bits <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01962-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that hint at a dynamic and crowded environment</a>, researchers report May 8 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“It’s the first time we’re actually looking at the inner system, and it looks really different than I think anybody expected it to,” says astrophysicist Meredith MacGregor of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. “The expectation was that there would be something like our solar system,” a place that is relatively mature and stable. “It really starts changing how we think about the dynamics of the [Fomalhaut] system.”</p>



<p>Fomalhaut, a scant 25 light-years away, is a young star at the center of a rapidly evolving planetary system. It was once thought to host one of the first planets to be photographed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">outside of our solar system</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/08</em>). However, the existence of the planet — dubbed Dagon — has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-faux-malhaut-b">long been in question</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/12</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new JWST images add to the growing evidence that Dagon is actually a cloud of dust. A collision among planets probably explains the dusty feature, says András Gáspár, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It is fading, and it is expanding in size,” he says, as it follows a trajectory consistent with dust blowing in the stellar wind from Fomalhaut. Those are all characteristics more indicative of dust clouds than planets.</p>



<p>But just because Dagon hasn’t seemed to have panned out, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other planets lurking around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>Indirect evidence for other worlds comes from an unexpected asteroid belt, seen for the first time in the new images. The belt is tilted at a jaunty 23 degrees from everything else seen in orbit around the star.</p>



<p>“This is a truly unique aspect of the system,” Gáspár says. The tilted belt, he says, could be the result of as-yet-undiscovered planets stirring up the debris around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>MacGregor agrees. “If you see a disk that&#8217;s like this, that has an [elongated] outer ring and a bunch of dust that&#8217;s getting dragged in, there are probably planets there,” she says. “I think the easiest explanation [for the tilted belt] is there&#8217;s a planet in there, and the planet is on an orbit that is not aligned with the disk.” The misaligned planet, in turn, is dragging the asteroid belt off-kilter with respect to the plane of the solar system, she says.</p>





<p>The JWST images also turned up a newly identified feature in the outer belt around the star.&nbsp; It’s a blob that Gáspár and his colleagues call the Great Dust Cloud. It’s not yet clear whether it’s a real feature, or just some bright object shining through from beyond the Fomalhaut system.</p>



<p>“It could easily be a background galaxy,” Gáspár says, “which would be a really cruel trick by nature.” Follow-up observations with JWST will help them decide, he says. If the object stays put while the Fomalhaut system keeps spinning, then it’s a cosmic photobomber, lurking in the background.</p>



<p>The latest images answer some questions about Fomalhaut while raising a host of new ones, Gáspár says. “This single observation of Fomalhaut revealed way too many aspects of the system that we need to understand and unpack,” he says. “We set out to spatially resolve the asteroid belt component but ended up opening a much greater box of surprises.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-pipistrelle-bats-echolocation">Pregnancy may hamper bats’ ability to ‘see’ in the dark</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy can do weird things to the body. For some bats, it can hamper their ability to “see” the world around them.</p>



<p>Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats (<em>Pipistrellus kuhlii</em>) <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01557-7#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20pregnant%20bats%20emitted%20longer,in%20hunting%20performance%20during%20pregnancy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">echolocate less frequently while pregnant</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>BMC Biology</em>. The change may make it harder for the tiny bats to detect prey and potential obstacles in the environment.</p>



<p>The study is among the first to show that pregnancy can shape how nonhuman mammals sense their surroundings, says Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.</p>





<p>Nocturnal bats like Kuhl’s pipistrelles famously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bat-brain-signals-illuminate-navigation-dark">use sound to navigate and hunt prey in the dark</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/17</em>). Their calls bounce off whatever is nearby and bats use the echoes to reconstruct what’s around them, a process aptly named echolocation. The faster a bat makes calls, the better it can make out its surroundings. But rapid-fire calling requires breathing deeply, which is something that pregnancy can get in the way of.</p>



<p>“Although I’ve never been pregnant, I know that when I eat a lot, it’s more difficult to breathe,” Yovel says. So pregnancy — which can add a full gram to a 7-gram Kuhl’s pipistrelle and may push up on the lungs — might hamper echolocation.</p>



<p>Yovel and colleagues tested their hypothesis by capturing 10 Kuhl’s pipistrelles, five of whom were pregnant, and training the bats to find and land on a platform. Recordings of the animals’ calls revealed that bats that weren’t pregnant made around 130 calls on average while searching for the platform. But bats that were pregnant made only around 110 calls, or 15 percent fewer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decline in calls among pregnant bats could impede hunting, the team says. A computer simulation showed that the study’s expectant moms would catch 15 percent fewer insects than nonpregnant bats. That finding could help explain why some bat species chase after larger and slower prey once they become pregnant, focusing their energy on easier-to-spot food. Figuring out whether diminished echolocating ability is responsible for these diet shifts will require more fieldwork, Yovel says.</p>



<p>However, the idea that carrying a fetus would interfere with echolocation makes a lot of sense, says behavior ecologist Erin Gillam of North Dakota State University in Fargo. “As a mammal who has been pregnant, I don’t think these results are surprising at all.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First successful enzyme therapy in humans</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-successful-enzyme-therapy-humans"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 28, 1973</p>



<p>Fabry’s disease … [is caused by] a faulty fat-metabolizing enzyme called alpha-galactosidase. Because the abnormal enzyme does not break down lipids in the blood as it should, they accumulate in the body. [Researchers] tried to purify the enzyme in its normal form from human placental tissue. Four months ago they got enough of the enzyme to inject into two patients…. The results look promising.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Though the trial showed that enzyme replacement therapy could work, it took decades before such treatments were cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 1991, an injection to treat a different rare inherited disorder called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/enzyme-therapy-another-success">Gaucher disease</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/altered-enzyme-reverses-gauchers-symptoms">became the first to gain approval</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/74; </em>SN: 5/25/91). Approval for an enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry&#8217;s disease followed in 2003. Scientists are still developing enzyme therapies. Last year, researchers reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-treated-rare-genetic-disease-womb">treating a developing fetus for Pompe disease</a>, which causes severe heart and muscle defects (SN: 11/9/22).</p>
