              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-chernobyl-dogs-revealed">What the first look at the genetics of Chernobyl’s dogs revealed</a></h4>

              
                <p>For generations of dogs, home is the radioactive remains of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.</p>



<p>In the first genetic analysis of these animals, scientists have discovered that dogs living in the power plant industrial area are genetically distinct from dogs living farther away.</p>



<p>Though the team could distinguish between dog populations, the researchers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not pinpoint radiation</a> as the reason for any genetic differences. But future studies that build on the findings, reported March 3 in <em>Science Advances,</em> may help uncover how radioactive environments leave their mark on animal genomes.</p>





<p>That could have implications for other nuclear disasters and even human space travel, says Timothy Mousseau, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. “We have high hopes that what we learn from these dogs … will be of use for understanding human exposures in the future,” he says.</p>



<p>Since his first trip in 1999, Mousseau has stopped counting how many times he’s been to Chernobyl. “I lost track after we hit about 50 visits.”</p>



<p>He first encountered Chernobyl’s semi-feral dogs in 2017, on a trip with the Clean Futures Fund+, an organization that provides veterinary care to the animals. Not much is known about how local dogs survived after the nuclear accident. In 1986, an explosion at one of the power plant’s reactors kicked off a disaster that lofted vast amounts of radioactive isotopes into the air. Contamination from the plant’s radioactive cloud largely settled nearby, in a region now called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</p>



<p>Dogs have lived in the area since the disaster, fed by Chernobyl cleanup workers and tourists. Some 250 strays were living in and around the power plant, among spent fuel-processing facilities and in the shadow of the ruined reactor. Hundreds more roam farther out in the exclusion zone, an area about the size of Yosemite National Park.</p>

<p>During Mousseau’s visits, his team collected blood samples from these dogs for DNA analysis, which let the researchers map out the dogs’ complex family structures. “We know who’s related to who,” says Elaine Ostrander, a geneticist at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md. “We know their heritage.”</p>



<p>The canine packs are not just a hodgepodge of wild feral dogs, she says. “There are actually families of dogs breeding, living, existing in the power plant,” she says. “Who would have imagined?”</p>





<p>Dogs within the exclusion zone share ancestry with German shepherds and other shepherd breeds, like many other free-breeding dogs from Eastern Europe, the team reports. And though their work revealed that dogs in the power plant area look genetically different from dogs in Chernobyl City, about 15 kilometers away, the team does not know whether radiation caused these differences or not, Ostrander says. The dogs may be genetically distinct simply because they’re living in a relatively isolated area.</p>



<p>The new finding is not so surprising, says Jim Smith, an environmental scientist at the University of Portsmouth in England. He was not part of the new study but has worked in this field for decades. He’s concerned that people might assume “that the radiation has something to do with it,” he says. But “there’s no evidence of that.”</p>



<p>Scientists have been trying to pin down <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/some-birds-adapt-chernobyls-radiation">how radiation exposure at Chernobyl has affected wildlife</a> for decades (<em>SN: 5/2/14</em>). “We’ve been looking at the consequences for birds and rodents and bacteria and plants,” Mousseau says. His team has found animals with elevated mutation rates, shortened life spans and early-onset cataracts.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to tease out the effects of low-dose radiation among other factors, Smith says. “[These studies] are so hard … there’s lots of other stuff going in the natural environment.” What’s more, animals can reap some benefits when humans leave contaminated zones, he says.</p>



<p>How, or if, radiation damage is piling up in dogs’ genomes is something the team is looking into now, Ostrander says. Knowing the dogs’ genetic backgrounds will make it easier to spot any radiation red flags, says Bridgett vonHoldt, an evolutionary geneticist at Princeton University, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“I feel like it’s a cliffhanger,” she says. “I want to know more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">The Yamnaya may have been the world’s earliest known horseback riders</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — The tale of the first horseback riders may be written on the bones of the ancient Yamnaya people.</p>



<p>Five excavated skeletons dated to about 3000 to 2500 B.C. show clear signs of physical stress that hint <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these Yamnaya individuals may have frequently ridden horses</a>, researchers reported March 3 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting and in <em>Science Advances</em>. That makes the Yamnaya the earliest humans identified as likely horseback riders so far.</p>





<p>Five thousand years ago, the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">Yamnaya migrated widely</a>, spreading <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-how-migrations-shaped-south-asian-language-farming">Indo-European languages</a> and altering the human gene pool across Europe and Asia (<em>SN: 11/15/17; SN: 9/5/19</em>). Their travels eventually stretched from modern-day Hungary to Mongolia, roughly 4,500 kilometers, and are thought to have taken place over only a couple of centuries.</p>



<p>“In many ways, [the Yamnaya] changed the history of Eurasia,” says archaeologist Volker Heyd of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>Horse <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">domestication</a> became widely established around 3500 B.C., probably for milk and meat (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>). Some researchers have suggested the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/horse-domestication-traced-ancient-central-asian-culture">Botai people in modern-day Kazakhstan</a> started riding horses during that time, but that&#8217;s debated (<em>SN: 3/5/09</em>). The Yamnaya had horses as well, and archaeologists have speculated that the people probably rode them, but evidence was lacking.</p>



<p>But the oldest known depictions of horseback riding are from about 2000 B.C. Complicating efforts to determine when the behavior emerged, possible riding gear would have been made of long-decayed natural materials, and scientists rarely, if ever, find complete horse skeletons from that time.</p>

<p>Heyd and colleagues weren’t seeking evidence of horsemanship. They were working on a massive project called the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/the-yamnaya-impact-on-prehistoric-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamnaya Impact on Prehistoric Europe</a> to understand every aspect of the people’s lives.</p>



<p>While assessing over 200 human skeletons excavated from countries including Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, bioanthropologist Martin Trautmann noticed that one individual’s bones carried distinct traits on the femur and elsewhere that he’d seen before. He immediately suspected horseback riding.</p>





<p>“It was just kind of a surprise,” says Trautmann, also of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>If it were a one-off case, he says he would have dismissed it. But as he continued analyzing skeletons, he noticed that several had the same traits.</p>



<p>Trautmann, Heyd and colleagues assessed all the skeletons for the presence of six physical signs of horseback riding that have been documented in previous research, a constellation of traits dubbed horsemanship syndrome. These signs included pelvis and femur marks that could have come from the biomechanical stress of sitting with spread legs while holding onto a horse, as well as healed vertebrae damage from injuries that could have come from falling off. The team also created a scoring system to account for the skeletal traits’ severity, preservation and relative importance.</p>



<p>“Bones are living tissue,” Trautmann says. “So they react to any type of environmental stimulus.”</p>



<p>The team deemed five Yamnaya male individuals as frequent horseback riders because they had four or more signs of horsemanship. Nine other Yamnaya males probably rode horses, but the researchers were less confident because the skeletons each displayed only three markers.</p>

<p>“Hypothetically speaking, it’s very logical,” says bioarchaeologist Maria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, who was not involved in the new study. The Yamnaya were very close to horses, she says, so at some point, they probably experimented with riding.</p>



<p>She now plans to check for the horse-riding traits in the Yamnaya skeletons she has access to. “The human skeletal system is like a book — if you have some knowledge, you can read it,” Mednikova says.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Ursula Brosseder, who also was not involved in the work, warns not to interpret this finding as equestrianism reaching its full bloom within the Yamnaya culture. Brosseder, formerly of the University of Bonn in Germany, sees the paper’s discovery as humans still figuring out what they could do with horses as part of early domestication.</p>



<p>As for Heyd, he says he has long suspected that the Yamnaya rode horses, considering that they had the animals and expanded so rapidly across such a large area. “Now, we have proof.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-spacex-problem-space-pollution">Half of all active satellites are now from SpaceX. Here’s why that may be a problem</a></h4>

              
                <p>SpaceX’s rapidly growing fleet of Starlink internet satellites now make up half of all active satellites in Earth orbit.</p>



<p>On February 27, the aerospace company <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl6-1-pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched 21 new satellites</a> to join its broadband internet Starlink fleet. That brought the total number of active Starlink satellites to 3,660, or about <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent of the nearly 7,300 active satellites in orbit</a>, according to analysis by astronomer Jonathan McDowell using data from SpaceX and the U.S. Space Force.</p>





<p>“These big low-orbit internet constellations have come from nowhere in 2019, to dominating the space environment in 2023,” says McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “It really is a massive shift and a massive industrialization of low orbit.”</p>



<p>SpaceX has been launching Starlink satellites since 2019 with the goal of bringing broadband internet to remote parts of the globe. And for just as long, astronomers have been warning that the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">bright satellites could mess up their view of the cosmos</a> by leaving streaks on telescope images as they glide past (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>Even the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits more than 500 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, is vulnerable to these satellite streaks, as well as those from other satellite constellations. From 2002 to 2021, the percentage of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01903-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble images affected by light from low-orbit satellites increased by about 50 percent</a>, astronomer Sandor Kruk of the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The number of images partially blocked by satellites is still small, the team found, rising from nearly 3 percent of images taken between 2002 and 2005 to just over 4 percent between 2018 and 2021 for one of Hubble’s cameras. But there are already thousands more Starlink satellites now than there were in 2021.</p>



<p>“The fraction of [Hubble] images crossed by satellites is currently small with a negligible impact on science,” Kruk and colleagues write. “However, the number of satellites and space debris will only increase in the future.” The team predicts that by the 2030s, the probability of a satellite crossing Hubble’s field of view any time it takes an image will be between 20 and 50 percent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="340" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1.jpg" alt="An photo from the Hubble Space Telescope with stars seen and three white lines on the left hand side of the image." class="wp-image-3122426" srcset="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1.jpg 680w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122426">Satellites sometimes photobomb the Hubble Space Telescope, leaving trails like the ones seen in this image. With the sudden traffic increase from satellite constellations in Hubble’s orbit, those streaks are becoming more common.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122426">European Hubble Science Archive/ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The sudden jump in Starlink satellites also poses a problem for space traffic, says astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada. Starlink satellites all orbit at a similar distance from Earth, just above 500 kilometers.</p>



<p>“Starlink is the densest patch of space that has ever existed,” Lawler says. The satellites are constantly navigating out of each other’s way to <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/two-satellites-collide-earth-orbit">avoid collisions</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/09</em>). And it’s a popular orbital altitude — Hubble is there, and so is the International Space Station and the Chinese space station.</p>





<p>“If there is some kind of collision [between Starlinks], some kind of mishap, it could immediately affect human lives,” Lawler says.</p>



<p>SpaceX launches Starlink satellites roughly once per week — it launched 51 more on March 3. And they’re not the only company launching constellations of internet satellites. By the 2030s, there could be 100,000 satellites crowding low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>So far, there are no international regulations to curb the number of satellites a private company can launch or to limit which orbits they can occupy.</p>



<p>“The speed of commercial development is much faster than the speed of regulation change,” McDowell says. “There needs to be an overhaul of space traffic management and space regulation generally to cope with these massive commercial projects.”</p>

<p>In November of 2020, an economics professor wrote to the editor-in-chief of a journal with two requests: remove his name from an online paper on which he was the corresponding author, and retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than two years later, neither of those things has happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijfe.2173">Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach</a>,” which appeared in August&nbsp; 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Finance and Economics</em>, was included in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10991158/2022/27/1">January 2022 issue of the journal</a>. It has been cited 10 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A scholar who was involved in the work but left off the paper has provided evidence, seen by Retraction Watch, that the published article contains falsified data. Two of the paper’s authors also have had another article they co-authored together retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126630"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The authors of the paper are listed as Azka Amin, an assistant professor of business administration at Iqra University in Pakistan, Sofia Anwar, a professor of economics and management sciences at Government College and University in Pakistan, and Xi-Hua Liu, a professor of economics at Qingdao University in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Nov. 30, 2020, Liu, the corresponding author on the work, emailed&nbsp; Michael P. Dooley, then the top editor of the journal, requesting retraction. In the email, which we obtained, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am writing this mail in a great hour of difficulty I would like to grab your attention toward a very sensitive issue. First of all, I request you to remove my name from “Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach, Int J Fin Econ, (2020),<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173"> https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173</a>” published recently on dated “6 July, 2020.”</p>



<p>Now I would like to explain the reasons for requesting the withdraw. The reason behind is that its first author Azka Amin and her classmate (a student named Usman Ali student of the Dalian University of Technology) disputed the ownership of this paper. I cannot actually judge their respective contributions to this paper. However, from their emails we should be able to judge that Usman Ali made an important academic contribution. More importantly, I did not even know about the paper that Azka Amin submitted to your journal, and I did not even know about listing me as the corresponding author.</p>



<p>Based on the above facts, I would like to request you to remove my name from the paper. In addition, I hope you will carefully consider Azka Amin’s academic ethics and withdraw this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ali, a postdoctoral fellow at Dalian University of Technology in China, told us that, in addition to not including him as an author, the study included “fabricated data and results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Ali, the research detailed in the paper was a collaboration between him, Amin, and Liu. The paper was originally submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, but the journal rejected it, which Ali said he was unaware of at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali discovered in September 2020 that the paper had been published without his knowledge. His name was left off the author list, and another author, Anwar, who Ali said was not involved in the research, was added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali said he asked Amin to withdraw the paper, but instead, she requested that the journal add an author to the paper, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. Ali said Amin did so without his consent.&nbsp; But Ali said he told her he did not want his name added to the paper because some of its results had been changed from the original and were “bogus.” In any case, Ali said the journal never reached out to him about adding his name to the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali also provided documents that he said show that data from the original, rejected manuscript were changed in the published study. For example, the published paper stated that its data cover the years between 1990 and 2019, but a screen capture of what Ali said was the original dataset seems to show a time period of 1990 to 2017. The original manuscript submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, which Ali also included, indicated the data were from 1990-2017, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the results in the published paper “are exactly the same as those in the original manuscript,” Ali wrote, “with some exceptions of the fabricated results.” Specifically, Ali said some standard error values and p values were changed from positive to negative, and he included screen captures as corroboration.</p>



<p>In 2021, a paper on which Liu and Amin were both authors was retracted from the journal <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>, because “an investigation by the Academic Committee of the School of Economics of Qingdao University established significantly overlaps with an unpublished manuscript by different authors,” according to the<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-18040-x"> retraction note</a>.</p>



<p>Amin, Anwar, and Liu did not respond to emails from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We don’t know if the journal ever responded to Liu. His name still appears as corresponding author on the online article, which has not been retracted or marked with any sort of editor’s note.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keith Pilbeam, the current editor-in-chief, told us the matter was still under investigation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This paper was published in the International Journal of Finance and Economics prior to the new editorial board taking over in November 2021. However, it is currently under investigation by Wiley Integrity in Publishing Group and as far as I know is currently being actively investigated so that a decision can be made on what to do in regards to this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, the journal’s publisher, responded to a follow-up email, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been actively investigating this article in accordance with COPE guidelines. The concerns shared here were not previously known to Wiley and will now be addressed as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Wiley nor Pilbeam answered questions from Retraction Watch about the reason for the years-long delay in retracting the study or why the journal has not added an indication of its investigation, such as an expression of concern, to the study.</p>



<p>Ali told us that trying to get the study retracted has been “a difficult and stressful experience”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is particularly concerning and disappointing when the journal chooses to publish a paper in a regular Issue despite having been informed of the serious ethical problems beforehand. I think it is a disregard for ethical considerations and a failure to take responsibility for the potential harm that may result from the publication of such research.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-particle-egypt-great-pyramid-void">Muons unveiled new details about a void in Egypt’s Great Pyramid</a></h4>

              
                <p>A nebulous void in Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has been unveiled thanks to strange subatomic particles called muons.</p>



<p>Scientists first identified the void in 2016 using muons, heavy relatives of electrons that can penetrate through solid materials. Thought to be a corridor-shaped hole, the void was located near a chevron-shaped structure visible on the pyramid’s north face. Further muon measurements revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new details of the void’s size and shape</a>, scientists from the ScanPyramids team report March 2 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>The new muon measurements indicate that the void is a 9-meter-long corridor about 2 meters wide by 2 meters tall, close to the pyramid’s north face. ScanPyramids researchers made additional measurements with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963869523000245?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ground-penetrating radar and ultrasonic testing</a>, they reported March 2 in <em>NDT &amp; E International</em>.&nbsp;The detailed measurements allowed the scientists to use an endoscope to take images inside the chamber, the team announced. The images reveal a corridor with a vaulted ceiling, presumably one that was hasn’t been seen by humans since the pyramid was built more than 4,500 years ago. The corridor’s purpose is still unclear.</p>

<p>Muons are created when high-energy particles from space called cosmic rays crash into the Earth’s atmosphere. Muons are partially absorbed as they rain down onto structures such as the pyramids. Using detectors placed inside the pyramid, scientists from ScanPyramids zeroed in on regions where more muons made it through, indicating they’d traversed less material, which let them map out the location of the void.</p>



<p>Scientists also recently used muons to probe an <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-scan-mystery-ancient-chinese-wall">ancient Chinese wall</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/23</em>), a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq8431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear reactor</a> and <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">various volcanoes</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-boreal-forests-record-co2-2021">Wildfires in boreal forests released a record amount of CO2 in 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>— In 2021, wildfires pillaged the world’s carbon-rich snow forests.</p>



<p>That year, burning boreal forests released 1.76 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, researchers reported March 2 in a news conference at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>That’s a new record for the region, which stores about one-third of the world’s land-based carbon. “It’s also roughly double the emissions in that year from aviation,” said earth system scientist Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine. The trend, if it continues, threatens to make fighting climate change even more difficult.</p>





<p>Boreal forests are part of the taiga, a vast region that necklaces the Earth just south of the Arctic Circle. <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/tropical-forests-have-flipped-sponges-sources-carbon-dioxide">Blazes in tropical forests</a> like the Amazon tend to garner more attention for their potential to contribute large amounts of climate-warming gases to the atmosphere (<em>SN: 9/28/17</em>). But scientists estimate that on a per area basis, boreal forests store about twice as much carbon in their trees and soils as tropical forests.</p>



<p>Climate change is causing the taiga to warm about <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219844110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast as the global average</a>. And wildfires are growing <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-forest-fires-climate-change">more widespread in the region</a>, releasing more of the trapped carbon, which in turn can worsen climate change (<em>SN: 5/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Davis and his colleagues analyzed satellite data on carbon emissions from boreal regions from 2000 to 2021. In 2021, emissions from boreal wildfires made up a whopping <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 percent of all the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by wildfires</a> around the world, the researchers report in the March 3 <em>Science</em>. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during an average year from 2000 to 2021 were about 10 percent.</p>



<p>The record-breaking emissions coincided with widespread heat waves and droughts in Siberia and northern Canada, probably fueled by human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>There’s no data yet to show if 2022 saw a similar surge in emissions. But, Davis said, “there’s not actually that much evidence that this record will stand for long.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-animal-pikobodies-crops-disease">Plant/animal hybrid proteins could help crops fend off diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new biological mashup just dropped.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pikobodies,&#8221; bioengineered <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune system proteins that are part plant and part animal</a>, could help flora better fend off diseases, researchers report in the March 3 <em>Science</em>. The protein hybrids exploit animals’ uniquely flexible immune systems, loaning plants the ability to fight off emerging pathogens<em>.</em><br><br>Flora typically rely on physical barriers to keep disease-causing microbes at bay. If something unusual makes it inside the plants, internal sensors sound the alarm and infected cells die. But as pathogens evolve ways to dodge these defenses, plants can’t adapt in real time. Animals’ adaptive immune systems can, making a wealth of antibodies in a matter of weeks when exposed to a pathogen.</p>





<p>In a proof-of-concept study, scientists genetically modified one plant’s internal sensor to sport animal antibodies. The approach harnesses the adaptive immune system’s power to make almost unlimited adjustments to target invaders and lends it to plants, says plant immunologist Xinnian Dong, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke University who was not involved in the work.<br><br>Crops especially could benefit from having more adaptable immune systems, since many farms grow fields full of just one type of plant, says Dong. In nature, diversity can help protect vulnerable plants from disease-spreading pathogens and pests. A farm is more like a buffet.</p>



<p>Researchers have had success fine-tuning plant genes to be disease-resistant, but finding the right genes and editing them can take more than a decade, says plant pathologist Sophien Kamoun of the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England. He and colleagues wanted to know if plant protection could get an additional boost from animal-inspired solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create the pikobodies, the team fused small antibodies from llamas and alpacas with a protein called Pik-1 that’s found on the cells of <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em>, a close relative of tobacco plants. Pik-1 typically detects a protein that helps a <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/how-crop-destroying-fungus-mutated-infect-wheat">deadly blast fungus</a> infect plants (<em>SN: 7/10/17</em>). For this test, the animal antibodies had been engineered to target fluorescent proteins</p>



<p>Plants with the pikobodies killed cells exposed to the fluorescent proteins, resulting in dead patches on leaves, the team found. Of 11 tested versions, four were not toxic to the leaves and triggered cell death only when the pikobodies attached to the specific protein that they had been designed bind. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, pikobodies can be combined to give plants more than one way to attack a foreign invader. That tactic could be useful to hit pathogens with the nimble ability to dodge some immune responses from multiple angles.</p>



<p>Theoretically, it’s possible to make pikobodies “against virtually any pathogen we study,” Kamoun says. But not all pikobody combos worked together in tests. “It’s a bit hit or miss,” he says. “We need some more basic knowledge to improve the bioengineering.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-ice-healing">Many Antarctic glaciers are hemorrhaging ice. This one is healing its cracks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even as some parts of West Antarctica rapidly melt, raising sea level, large swaths of the ice remain stable for the time being. Scientists have now explored one of those stable spots — an isolated nook where the ocean meets the ice. There, the team found the underside of the ice sculpted into strange grooves, ripples and globes.</p>



<p>This environment is “really at the edge” between melting and freezing, says planetary scientist Justin Lawrence. The delicate balance between these two processes is shaping the ice into those strange textures — similar to the way that minerals dissolve and recrystallize to form the beautiful shapes inside limestone caverns.</p>





<p>The result, at Kamb Ice Stream, is that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01129-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive cracks in the underside of the ice appear to be freezing back together</a> as the beach ball–sized globes fill in the crevasses from above, Lawrence and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>This refreezing differs from what’s happening at Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier. There, scientists recently reported that these cracks, known as basal crevasses, are instead sites of <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">rapid melting</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/23</em>).</p>



<p>Understanding what is happening at Kamb will help scientists predict how large parts of the Antarctic coastline that are not currently vulnerable might respond as the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change. Here’s what’s different about Kamb.</p>



<h4>Supercold water underlies the ice at Kamb, slowing melting</h4>



<p>In December 2019, two teams of researchers from New Zealand and the United States visited the Kamb Ice Stream — a type of glacier that consists of a channel of faster-moving ice surrounded by slower ice.</p>



<p>Kamb, like much of the rest of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on a bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level. The New Zealand team used hot water to melt a narrow hole through the ice, just downstream of the “grounding zone,” where the glacier lifts off its muddy bed and floats on the ocean.</p>



<p>The U.S. team then lowered a remote-operated vehicle called Icefin down through 580 meters of ice and into the seawater below. The researchers piloted Icefin as far as a kilometer from the borehole, navigating by video transmitted up through a cable. At the time of the expedition, the team operating Icefin was affiliated with Georgia Tech in Atlanta, but has since moved to Cornell University, except for Lawrence. He now works for Honeybee Robotics, a private company in Altadena, Calif.</p>





<p>Icefin found that much of the seawater beneath Kamb is about 0.3 degrees Celsius above freezing. But directly below the ice sits a colder layer, a mixture of seawater and glacial meltwater just 0.02 to 0.08 degrees C above freezing. Based on these measurements, Lawrence and his colleagues estimate that the exposed underside of Kamb is melting about 26 centimeters per year.</p>



<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent measurements at the increasingly unstable Thwaites Glacier</a>, about 1,400 kilometers to the northeast, found the seawater at the glacier’s grounding zone 1 to 2 degrees C warmer than at Kamb — and the ice melting 5 to 40 meters per year.</p>



<p>The new finding at Kamb makes sense, says New Zealand team member Christina Hulbe, of the University of Otago, because the seabed at Kamb is relatively shallow. So it is not exposed to the deep, warm ocean currents that are hitting Thwaites.</p>



<p>Much of Antarctica is fringed by cold ocean environments similar to Kamb, she says. “So just understanding that system is important.”</p>



<h4>Greenish globs of refrozen ice fill cracks at Kamb</h4>



<p>As Icefin glided along, its sonars detected massive basal crevasses up to 55 meters across in the ice above. These cracks probably formed as the floating part of the glacier, the ice shelf, flexes up and down with ocean tides.</p>



<p>Lawrence and his colleagues guided the ROV into one of these cracks, and found its white, icy sidewalls carved into narrow vertical grooves. Icefin ascended 40 meters up, until the grooves suddenly vanished — replaced by a jumble of ice globes, which seemed to fill the upper half of the crevasse.</p>



<p>The globes were greenish — a hue often seen in winter ice that forms on the surface of the ocean. This color makes Lawrence and his colleagues think that the globes form from the ultracold mixture of seawater and meltwater that circulates up into a crack and refreezes, gradually filling in the crack, from the top down, over many decades. They think that this is happening in all of the crevasses they observed. “These crevasses are effectively healing themselves,” he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="250" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/022823_DF_antarctic-kamb_inline.jpg" alt="Two photos side by side.

These probably formed as supercold seawater refroze — a process that is slowly mending the crack. Lower down, the crevasse walls were sculpted into vertical grooves (right). The grooves may have formed as concentrated brine, pushed out of the newly forming ice crystals above, slid down the walls, melting channels.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122365">Icefin/NASA PSTAR RISE UP/Schmidt/Lawrence</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This refreezing process might also explain the strange vertical grooves in the walls of the crevasse, Lawrence speculates. As the water freezes, salt is pushed out of the newly forming ice crystals, creating tiny pockets of highly concentrated brine. That dense brine streams down the walls, melting grooves into the ice — similar to the way that salt causes ice to melt when it’s sprinkled onto a sidewalk in the wintertime.</p>



<p>To observe the crevasses refreezing under Kamb “is pretty exceptional,” says Ginny Catania, a glaciologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not part of the project. Those cracks “can propagate all the way to the surface and cause calving” of icebergs, she says, which can shrink the ice shelf if it happens too quickly, destabilizing the glacier and raising sea level.</p>



<p>But if the crevasses can actually heal, this could make these ice shelves more resistant to calving — and more stable — than scientists realized, at least as long as the ice continues to be bathed in cold water on the underside.</p>



<p>A string of instruments installed in the hole continued to measure the temperature and salinity of the water beneath the ice — transmitting that data up a cable to the ice’s surface, and back home via satellite until the batteries ran out two years later. Those data show that conditions down below remained cool and comfortable for Kamb.</p>

<p>It took just a 9-volt battery and a little brain zapping to turn science writer Sally Adee into a stone-cold sharpshooter.</p>



<p>She had flown out to California to test an experimental DARPA technology that used electric jolts to speed soldiers’ sniper training. When the juice was flowing, Adee could tell. In a desert simulation that pit her against virtual bad guys, she hit every one.</p>



<p>“Getting my neurons slapped around by an electric field instantly sharpened my ability to focus,” Adee writes in her new book, <em>We Are Electric</em>. That brain-stimulating experience ignited her 10-year quest to understand how electricity and biology intertwine. And she’s not just talking neurons.</p>





<p>Bioelectricity, Adee makes the case, is a shockingly under­explored area of science that spans all parts of the body. Its story is one of missed opportunity, scientific threads exposed and abandoned, tantalizing clues and claims, “electroquacks” and unproven medical devices — and frogs. Oh so many frogs.</p>



<p>Adee takes us back to the 18th century lab of Luigi Galvani, an Italian scientist hunting for what gives animals the spark of life. His gruesome experiments on twitching frog legs offered proof that animal bodies generate their own electricity, an idea that was hotly debated at the time. (So many scientists repeated Galvani’s experiments, in fact, that Europe began to run out of frogs.)</p>



<p>But around the same time, Galvani critic Alessandro Volta, another Italian scientist, invented the electric battery. It was the kind of razzle-dazzle, history-shaking device that stole the spotlight from animal electricity, and the fledgling field fizzled. “The idea had been set,” Adee writes. “Electricity was not for biology. It was for machines, and telegraphs, and chemical reactions.”</p>

<p>It took decades for scientists to pick up Galvani’s experimental threads and get the study of bioelectricity back on track. Since then, we’ve learned just how much electricity orchestrates our lives, and how much more remains to be discovered. Electricity zips through our neurons, makes our hearts tick and flows in every cell of the body. We’re made up of 40 trillion tiny rechargeable batteries, Adee writes.</p>



<p>She describes how cells use ion channels to usher charged molecules in and out. One thing readers might not expect from a book that illustrates the intricacies of ion channels: It’s surprisingly funny.</p>





<p>Chloride ions, for example, are “perpetually low-key ashamed” because they carry a measly -1 charge. Bogus medical contraptions (here’s looking at you, electric penis belts) were “electro-foolery.” In her acknowledgements, Adee jokes about the “life-saving powers of Voltron” and thanks people for enduring her caffeine jitters. That energy thrums through the book, charging her storytelling like a staticky balloon.</p>



<p>Adee is especially electrifying in a chapter about spinal nerve regeneration and why initial experiments juddered to a halt. Decades ago, scientists tried coaxing severed nerves to link up again by applying an electric field. The controversial technique sparked scientific drama, but the idea of using electricity to heal may have been ahead of its time. Fast-forward to 2020, and DARPA has awarded $16 million to researchers with a similar concept: a bio­electric bandage that speeds wound healing.</p>



<p>Along with zingy Band-Aids of the future, Adee describes other sci-fi–sounding devices in the works. One day, for example, surgeons may sprinkle your brain with neurograins, neural lace or <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/neural-dust-can-listen-body-electrical-signals">neural dust</a>, tiny electronic implants that could help scientists monitor brain activity or even help people control robotic arms or other devices (<em>SN: 9/3/16, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Such implants bring many challenges — like how to marry electronics to living tissue — but Adee’s book leaves readers with a sense of excitement. Not only could bioelectricity inspire new and improved medical devices, it could also reveal a current of unexpected truths about the body. </p>



<p>As Adee writes: “We are electrical machines whose full dimensions we have not even yet dreamed of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/meningitis-causing-bacteria-invade-brain">How meningitis-causing bacteria invade the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bacteria can slip into the brain by commandeering cells in the brain’s protective layers, a new study finds. The results hint at how a deadly infection called bacterial meningitis takes hold.</p>



<p>In mice infected with meningitis-causing bacteria, the microbes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05753-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploit previously unknown communication between pain-sensing nerve cells and immune cells</a> to slip by the brain’s defenses, researchers report March 1 in <em>Nature</em>. The results also hint at a new way to possibly delay the invasion — using migraine medicines to interrupt those cell-to-cell conversations.</p>





<p>Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the protective layers, or meninges, of the brain that affects 2.5 million people globally per year. It can cause severe headaches and sometimes lasting neurological injury or death.</p>



<p>“Unexpectedly, pain fibers are actually hijacked by the bacteria as they’re trying to invade the brain,” says Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Normally, one might expect pain to be a warning system for us to shut down the bacteria in some way, he says. “We found the opposite…. This [pain] signal is being used by the bacteria for an advantage.”</p>



<p>It’s known that <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-infection-gut-immune-system">pain-sensing neurons and immune cells coexist in the meninges</a>, particularly in the outermost layer called the dura mater (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). So to see what role the pain and immune cells play in bacterial meningitis, Chiu’s team infected mice with two of the bacteria known to cause the infection in humans: <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>S. agalactiae</em>. The researchers then observed where that bacteria ended up in mice genetically tweaked to lack pain-sensing nerve cells and compared those resting spots to those in mice with the nerve cells intact.</p>



<p>Mice without pain-sensing neurons had fewer bacteria in the meninges and brain than those with the nerve cells, the team found. This contradicts the idea that pain in meningitis serves as a warning signal to the body’s immune system, mobilizing it for action.</p>



<p>Further tests showed that the bacteria triggered a chain of immune-suppressing events, starting with the microbes secreting toxins in the dura mater.</p>



<p>The toxins hitched onto the pain neurons, which in turn released a molecule called CGRP. This molecule is already known to bind to a receptor on immune cells, where it helps control the dura mater’s immune responses. Injecting infected mice with more CGRP lowered the number of dural immune cells and helped the infection along, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The team also looked more closely at the receptor that CGRP binds to. In infected mice bred without the receptor, fewer bacteria made it into the brain. But in ones with the receptor, immune cells that would otherwise engulf bacteria and recruit reinforcements were disabled.</p>





<p>The findings suggest that either preventing the release of CGRP or preventing it from binding to immune cells might help delay infection.</p>



<p>In humans, neuroscientists know that CGRP is a driver of headaches — it’s already a <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-new-migraine-drug">target of migraine medications</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/18</em>). So the researchers gave five mice the migraine medication olcegepant, which blocks CGRP’s effects, and infected them with <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. After infection, the medicated mice had less bacteria in the meninges and brain, took longer to show symptoms, didn’t lose as much weight and survived longer than mice that were not given the medication.</p>



<p>The finding suggests olcegepant slowed the infection. Even though it only bought mice a few extra hours, that’s crucial in meningitis, which can develop just as quickly. Were olcegepant to work the same way in humans, it might give doctors more time to treat meningitis. But the effect is probably not as dramatic in people, cautions Michael Wilson, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco who wasn’t involved with the work.</p>



<p>Scientists still need to determine whether pain-sensing nerve cells and immune cells have the same rapport in human dura mater, and whether migraine drugs could help treat bacterial meningitis in people.</p>



<p>Neurologist Avindra Nath has doubts. Clinicians think the immune response and inflammation damage the brain during meningitis, says Nath, who heads the team investigating nervous system infections at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md. So treatment involves drugs that suppress the immune response, rather than enhance it as migraine medications might.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chiu acknowledges this but notes there might be room for both approaches. If dural mater immune cells could head the infection off at the pass, it may keep some bacteria from penetrating the defenses, minimizing brain inflammation.</p>



<p>This study might not ultimately change how clinicians treat patients, Wilson says. But it still reveals something new about one of the first lines of defense for the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/plos-journals-update-their-human-subjects-research-policy/">PLOS journals update their Human Subjects Research Policy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Authors: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor, PLOS Publication Ethics Team; Emily Chenette, Editor in Chief, <em>PLOS ONE</em></p>



<p>PLOS and other publishers have recently seen a rise in large-scale cases involving manipulation of the publication process, and PLOS staff are working to increase the stringency of our processes to keep problematic articles out of the literature. As part of this work, we updated the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">Human Subjects Research Policy for</a> <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Water</em>: as of March 1, 2023<em>, </em>these journals require that <strong>authors of manuscripts reporting research involving human participants provide original ethics approval documentation at the time of submission. </strong>This also applies to studies that use human subjects&rsquo; data or primary tissue samples, except for studies that are exempt from ethics approval per institutional and/or national requirements.</p>



<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>



<p>The competitive nature of academic publishing, tenure, and hiring decisions can incentivize researchers to take shortcuts, compromising on ethics to boost or accelerate their publication records. In some cases, this might mean conducting research before all requisite approvals have been obtained. In others, it might mean purchasing authorship or article content, or compromising the integrity of the peer review process. These unethical practices can pollute the literature with problematic articles that are harmful to the broader community, including people endeavoring to replicate fraudulent research and those directly impacted by the published findings.</p>



<p>PLOS has always had high ethics standards for the research that we publish. Up to this point, PLOS journals have required that submissions of studies involving human participants include an Ethics Statement reporting information about the study&rsquo;s ethics approval and informed consent procedures. On occasion, journal staff have requested ethics approval documents for studies where there were concerns about adherence to the policy.</p>



<p>Recently, the PLOS Publication Ethics team has handled higher volumes of cases where documents received during our investigations raised concerns about whether ethics standards were upheld during the research process, whether measures were in place to protect participants in the research, or whether the reported findings were reliable.</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, <em>PLOS ONE</em> ran a trial in 2022 wherein cohorts of authors were asked to supply ethics approval documents before peer review. Compliance was high, but what journal staff found was deeply troubling: in one cohort, nearly two-thirds of submissions did not meet <em>PLOS ONE&rsquo;s</em> human subjects research requirements and were therefore rejected. Importantly, journal staff would not have detected the issues had they not requested the ethics documentation.</p>



<p>Given these observations, we are updating the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">Human Subjects Research Policy</a> for <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Water</em> (effective 1 March 2023), and we are considering similar updates for other PLOS journals. Under the new policy, original ethics approval documentation will be required at the time of submission and evaluated by journal staff before peer review. If there are any concerns about the ethics approval documents, if they are not provided, or if they indicate the study did not comply with our policies, the manuscript will be rejected without external review. Per our longstanding policy, we will continue to request ethics documents for manuscripts submitted before March 2023 if deemed necessary by journal staff or editorial board members. Submitted ethics approval documents will not be published.</p>



<p>We recognize that this updated policy alone will not identify all potentially fraudulent or unethical research. Nevertheless, it is an important advance in our efforts to safeguard the integrity of human subjects research publications, uphold our ethics policies, and ensure that the community can continue to trust, reuse, and build upon the work that we publish.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-ice-age-hunter-gatherers-europe">Ancient DNA unveils disparate fates of Ice Age hunter-gatherers in Europe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ice sheets expanded across much of northern Europe from around 25,000 to 19,000 years ago, making a huge expanse of land unlivable. That harsh event set in motion a previously unrecognized tale of two human populations that played out at opposite ends of the continent.</p>



<p>Western European hunter-gatherers outlasted the icy blast in the past. Easterners got replaced by migrations of newcomers.</p>



<p>That’s the implication of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05726-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest study to date of ancient Europeans’ DNA</a>, covering a period before, during and after what’s known as the Last Glacial Maximum, paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth and colleagues report March 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>As researchers have long thought, southwestern Europe provided refuge from the last Ice Age’s big chill for hunter-gatherers based in and near that region, the scientists say. But it turns out that southeastern Europe, where Italy is now located, did not offer lasting respite from the cold for nearby groups, as previously assumed.</p>



<p>Instead, those people were replaced by genetically distinct hunter-gatherers who presumably had lived just to the east along the Balkan Peninsula. Those people, who carried ancestry from parts of southwestern Asia, began trekking into what’s now northern Italy by about 17,000 years ago, as the Ice Age began to wane.</p>



<p>“If local [Ice Age] populations in Italy did not survive and were replaced by groups from the Balkans, this completely changes our interpretation of the archaeological record,” says Posth, of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>



<p>Posth and colleagues’ conclusions rest on analyses of DNA from 356 ancient hunter-gatherers, including new molecular evidence for 116 individuals from 14 countries in Europe and Asia. Excavated human remains that yielded DNA dated to between <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">about 45,000</a> and 5,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>Comparisons of sets of gene variants inherited by these hunter-gatherers from common ancestors enabled the researchers to reconstruct population movements and replacements that shaped ancient Europeans’ genetic makeup. For the first time, ancient DNA evidence included individuals from what’s known as the Gravettian culture, which dates from about 33,000 to 26,000 years ago in central and southern Europe, and from southwestern Europe’s Solutrean culture, which dates to between about 24,000 and 19,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, makers of Gravettian tools came from two genetically distinct groups that populated western and eastern Europe for roughly 10,000 years before the Ice Age reached its peak, Posth says. Researchers have traditionally regarded Gravettian implements as products of a biologically uniform population that occupied much of Europe.</p>



<p>“What we previously thought was one genetic ancestry in Europe turned out to be two,” says paleogeneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who did not participate in the new study. And “it seems that western and southwestern Europe served as a [refuge from glaciation] more than southeastern Europe and Italy.”</p>





<p>Descendants of the western Gravettian population, who are associated with Solutrean artifacts and remnants of another ancient culture in western Europe that ran from about 19,000 to 14,000 years ago, outlasted the Ice Age before spreading northeastward across Europe, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Further support for southwestern Europe as an Ice Age refuge comes from DNA extracted from a pair of fossil teeth that belonged to an individual linked to the Solutrean culture in southern Spain. That roughly 23,000-year-old adult <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-01987-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was genetically similar to western European hunter-gatherers</a> who lived before and after the Last Glacial Maximum, Max Planck paleogeneticist Vanessa Villalba-Mouco and colleagues, including Posth, report March 1 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the genetic evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers in what’s now Italy were replaced by people from farther east, probably based in the Balkan region. Those newcomers must have brought with them a distinctive brand of stone artifacts, previously excavated at Italian sites and elsewhere in eastern Europe, known as Epigravettian tools, Posth says. Many archaeologists have suspected that Epigravettian items were products of hunter-gatherers who clustered in Italy during the Ice Age’s peak freeze.</p>



<p>But, Hajdinjak says, analyses of DNA from fossils of Ice Age Balkan people are needed to clarify what groups moved through Italy, and when those migrations occurred.</p>



<p>Ultimately, descendants of Ice Age migrants into Italy reached southern Italy and then western Europe by around 14,000 years ago, Posth and colleagues say. Ancient DNA evidence indicates that, during those travels, they left a major genetic mark on hunter-gatherers across Europe.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about his paper &quot;An Evolutionary Ensemble Learning for Diagnosing COVID-19 via Cough Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Objective The spread of the COVID-19 disease has caused great concern around the world and
detecting the positive cases is crucial in curbing the pandemic. One of the symptoms of
the disease is the dry cough it causes. It has previously been shown that cough signals
can be used to identify a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, asthma, etc. In this
paper, we proposed an algorithm to diagnose via cough signals the COVID-19 disease.
Methods The proposed algorithm is an ensemble scheme that consists of a number of base
learners, where each base learner uses a different feature extractor method, including
statistical approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic feature
extraction. Features are extracted from the raw signal and some transforms performed it,
including Fourier, wavelet, Hilbert-Huang, and short-term Fourier transforms. The outputs
of these base-learners are aggregated via a weighted voting scheme, with the weights
optimised via an evolutionary paradigm. This paper also proposes a memetic algorithm for
training the CNNs in the base-learners, which combines the speed of gradient descent (GD)
algorithms and global search space coverage of the evolutionary algorithms. Results
Experiments were performed on the proposed algorithm and different rival algorithms which
included a number of CNN architectures in the literature and generic machine learning
algorithms. The results suggested that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance
compared to the existing algorithms in diagnosing COVID-19 via cough signals. Conclusion
This research showed that COVID-19 could be diagnosed via cough signals and CNNs could be
employed to process these signals and it may be further improved by the optimization of
CNN architecture.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/lemon-juice-get-rid-kidney-stones">Here’s how lemon juice may fend off kidney stones</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprise ingredient may explain how lemon juice puts the squeeze on kidney stones.</p>



<p>Lemons contain nanoparticles that, when fed to rats, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c05099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block stone formation</a>, scientists report in the Feb. 22 <em>Nano Letters</em>. If the tiny sacs do the same for humans, the nanoparticles might one day offer a way to prevent kidney stones in people, says pharmaceutical scientist Hongzhi Qiao of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine.</p>



<p>Lemon juice is a well-known home remedy for kidney stones, which form <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/kidney-stones-grow-and-dissolve-much-geological-crystals">when minerals crystalize and clump up</a> inside the kidney (<em>SN: 9/21/18</em>). These rocky lumps can knock around in the urinary tract, slicing and dicing tissues as <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/riding-roller-coasters-might-help-dislodge-kidney-stones">they eventually pass out of the body</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/16</em>). “It&#8217;s so, so, so painful,” says Jingyin Yan, a nephrologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not part of the new study. Patients may feel sharp pain in their back, side or lower abdomen when they pass a stone, she says. “People describe it as worse than delivering a baby.”</p>





<p>Though some medications can help treat kidney stones, many people end up needing surgery to remove them, says Thomas Chi, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, also not part of the study. People often imagine kidney stones as tiny pebbles, but sometimes they bulk up like boulders, he adds. “I’ve taken out stones the size of your fist.”</p>



<p>That’s why prevention is key. Scientists already knew that citric acid, which gives lemons their sour power, may do the trick by binding to the minerals that make up stones. But drinking mouth-puckering lemon juice is not so comfortable for patients, Qiao says.</p>



<p>A 2022 clinical trial found that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00508-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kidney stone patients had trouble downing 120 milliliters</a> — about a half cup — of lemon juice per day. Swilling loads of lemonade can cause dental problems, too. Chi has had patients drink so much that the acidic liquid ate away at their teeth.</p>



<p>So Qiao and colleagues looked for other, more palatable lemon-derived ingredients that might help prevent kidney stones. Inside edible and medicinal plants like ginseng, grapefruit and dandelion, his team has found extracellular vesicle-like nanoparticles, tiny sacs stuffed with molecules including fat, protein and DNA.</p>

<p>These nanoparticles exist in lemon juice, too­­ — and the team fed them to rats that had also ingested a substance that promotes kidney stone growth. The zesty particles slowed stone formation, Qiao and colleagues found. The finding suggests these particles curb development of calcium oxalate crystals, the most common culprit of kidney stones. The particles can also soften the stones and make them less sticky, the team showed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The new work challenges the conventional wisdom on how lemon juice works to combat kidney stones, Chi says. Using lemon nanoparticles to treat people is still a long way off, but the team’s results hold promise, he says. “The faster you can bring a finding like this towards a human clinical trial, the better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-pollen-insects-280-million-years">The oldest known pollen-carrying insects lived about 280 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oldest known fossils of pollen-laden insects are of earwig-like ground-dwellers that lived in what is now Russia about 280 million years ago, researchers report. Their finding pushes back the fossil record of insects transporting pollen from one plant to another, a key aspect of modern-day pollination, by about 120 million years.</p>



<p>The insects — from a pollen-eating genus named <em>Tillyardembia</em> first described in 1937 — were typically about 1.5 centimeters long, says Alexander Khramov, a paleoentomologist at the Borissiak Paleontological Institute in Moscow. Flimsy wings probably kept the creatures mostly on the forest floor, he says, leaving them to climb trees to find and consume their pollen.</p>



<p>Recently, Khramov and his colleagues scrutinized 425 fossils of <em>Tillyardembia</em> in the institute’s collection. Six had clumps of pollen grains <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trapped on their heads, legs, thoraxes or abdomens</a>, the team reports February 28 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. A proportion that small isn’t surprising, Khramov says, because the fossils were preserved in what started out as fine-grained sediments. The early stages of fossilization in such material would tend to wash away pollen from the insects’ remains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="521" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022823_sp_pollinator_inline1.jpg" alt="An image of a Tillyardembia fossil on the left and on the right a microscopic image of clumps of pollen." class="wp-image-3122318" srcset="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022823_sp_pollinator_inline1.jpg 680w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022823_sp_pollinator_inline1-500x383.jpg 500w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022823_sp_pollinator_inline1-587x450.jpg 587w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022823_sp_pollinator_inline1-243x186.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122318">This fossil of <em>Tillyardembia</em> (left) is one of six found with clumps of pollen (right) attached to the insect’s body.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122318">Alexander Khramov</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The pollen-laden insects had only a couple of types of pollen trapped on them, the team found, suggesting that the critters were very selective in the tree species they visited. “That sort of specialization is in line with potential pollinators,” says Michael Engel, a paleoentomologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who was not involved in the study. “There’s probably vast amounts of such specialization that occurred even before <em>Tillyardembia</em>, we just don’t have evidence of it yet.”</p>



<p>Further study of these fossils might reveal if <em>Tillyardembia </em>had evolved special pollen-trapping hairs or other such structures on their bodies or heads, says Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., also not part of the study. It would also be interesting, he says, to see if something about the pollen helped it stick to the insects.&nbsp;If the pollen grains had structures that enabled them to clump more readily, for example, then those same&nbsp;features&nbsp;may have helped them grab Velcro-like onto&nbsp;any hairlike structures on&nbsp;the insects’ bodies.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/snapping-shrimp-fastest-claw-biology">The fastest claw in the sea belongs to young snapping shrimp</a></h4>

              
                <p>Full-grown snapping shrimp were already known to have some of the fastest claws under the waves. But it turns out they’re nothing compared with their kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Juvenile snapping shrimp produce <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.244645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest known underwater accelerations</a> of any reusable body part, researchers report February 28 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.&nbsp;While the claws’ top speed isn’t terribly impressive, they go from zero to full throttle in record time.</p>



<p>To deter predators or competitors, snapping shrimp create shock waves with their powerful claws. The shrimp store energy in the flexing exoskeleton of their claw as it opens, latching it in place much like a bow-and-arrow mechanism, says Jacob Harrison, a biologist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>





<p>Firing the claw and releasing this elastic energy produces a speeding jet of water. Bubbles form behind it and promptly implode, liberating a huge amount of energy, momentarily <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/shrimps-spew-bubbles-hot-sun">flashing as hot as the sun</a> and creating a deafening crack (<em>SN: 10/3/01</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn&#8217;t know anything about how this mechanism developed.”</p>



<p>While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (<em>Alpheus heterochaelis</em>) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a young snapping shrimp shut its claw in slow motion | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rwmEvSOJMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It takes less than a millisecond for a juvenile snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) to slam its claw shut. But thanks to footage taken at 300,000 frames per second and then slowed down by 10,000 times, the human eye can capture this extreme acceleration and the imploding bubble it creates.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dracula ants (<em>Mystrium camillae</em>) and some termites produce more explosive bites but aren’t pushing against water. The stinging cells of jellyfish launch their venomous harpoons about 100 times as fast, but their firing mechanism is inherently single use. Snapping shrimp, on the other hand, can fire their claws again and again.</p>





<p>The juveniles’ firing and bubble creation weren’t very reliable at the smallest sizes, but the shrimp routinely tried snapping anyway. The team wonders if the young shrimp could be practicing and training the necessary musculature.</p>



<p>If so, that training might ultimately be crucial to the claw’s function, says Kate Feller, a visual ecologist at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who studies similarly ultrafast mantis shrimp and was not involved in the new study. “If you were to somehow manipulate the claws so that they couldn’t properly close and they couldn’t snap,” she wonders, “would that affect their ability to develop these mechanisms?”</p>



<p>Understanding the storage of elastic energy in biological materials and how it flows through them is “tricky,” Harrison says. Figuring out how such tiny claws store so much energy without fracturing may help researchers illuminate this superpower.</p>

<p>In April 2022, Ioannis Kalpouzos, a professor at Harvard Law, received an invitation to join the editorial board of the newly-launched <em>American Yearbook of International Law</em>. But something gave him pause.</p>



<p>“The title sounded a bit dodgy &#8211; it sounded like something I should have heard of,” Kalpouzos told Retraction Watch, adding that with some Googling he “found that it wasn’t really a thing.”</p>



<p>“If somebody’s not in the know, it’s easier for them to be duped, I suppose,” Kalpouzos said, but his instincts told him that such a yearbook would most likely be published by an established law review.</p>



<p>So he declined.</p>

<p>Saeed Bagheri, a professor at Reading Law School in Reading, England, responded by posting his editorial board invitation letter, and several other legal scholars noted they had received similar invitations:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The title is one of three new journals launched by Dimitris Liakopoulos, a legal researcher who at the time of this writing sits on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLiakopoulos%252c%2bDimitris">33 retractions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/14/legal-researcher-up-to-23-retractions-for-false-affiliations-plagiarism/">previously reported</a>, Liakopoulos had falsely claimed to be a professor at several universities, including Columbia Law School, Stetson University, and various European institutions. In 2020, a representative of Tufts University, where Liakopoulos had claimed to be on faculty, told us that he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Liakopoulos_nonaffiliate.pdf">had never been affiliated with the school</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the retraction notices on Liakopoulos’s work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/14/itinerant-legal-scholar-who-claimed-tufts-affiliation-up-to-10-retractions/">cite concerns</a> about his stated affiliations, and they often note plagiarism, such as the <a href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789047431145/Bej.9789004177710.i-234_001.xml">note</a> retracting an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/03/legal-researcher-who-claimed-false-affiliation-up-to-31-retractions/">entire book</a> Liakopoulos co-authored.</p>



<p>Under the auspices of the putative non-profit <a href="https://theceij.jimdofree.com/">Center of European and International Justice</a>, Liakopoulos has recently launched the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/ayil">American Yearbook of International Law</a>, the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yeucl/index">Yearbook of European Union and Comparative Law</a>, and the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yiecpl/index">Yearbook of International &amp; European Criminal and Procedural Law</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As yearbooks, the volumes appear annually rather than publishing articles throughout any given year. All three yearbooks have one volume so far, from 2022.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The web site for the Center of European and International Justice states its address as 777 UN Plaza, which is across the street from the United Nations building in New York City. That address is the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Center_for_the_United_Nations">Church Center for the United Nations,</a> which boasts a chapel regularly used for weddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the web address for the center includes the clause jimdofree.com. This indicates it is from a <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/">web domain service</a> that gives people free online hosting, rather than the .org domain one would expect from a legitimate non-profit.</p>



<p>Besides the dubious affiliation, at least two yearbook articles, both by Liakopoulos, have had concerns raised about plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A PubPeer sleuth notes that one article in the American yearbook <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B532E64DAAAE67C926196F9CC46592">lifts</a> from a doctoral thesis originally published in Italian, while an article from one of the European yearbooks <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/56C9F0E47EE3CB1197108D5778C45E">pulls</a> text from a previously published Italian paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The yearbooks are published by the National Documentation Center of Greece, a cultural heritage organization sponsored by the Greek government. We contacted the Documentation Center to ask about how they had vetted the reliability of the yearbooks but did not hear back.</p>



<p>We also used the contact email provided on the yearbook web pages (purportedly directed to a person named Sara Cristain) to ask Liakopoulos some questions about the journals.</p>



<p>A few days later, we received a vituperative note from one Klaus Volger, who assured us that the yearbooks are legitimate, citing among other things – all without evidence – the imprimatur of the Greek government. Volger also asserted that no article in the yearbooks is plagiarized, and said that <em>Retraction Watch </em>is only interested in this topic for “money and publicity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Volger, or someone using his name, had responded similarly after our previous posts.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-lightning-strike-wildfire-spark-risk-climate-change">An incendiary form of lightning may surge under climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>A form of lightning with a knack for sparking wildfires may surge under climate change.</p>



<p>An analysis of satellite data suggests “hot lightning” — strikes that channel electrical charge for an extended period — may be more likely to set landscapes ablaze than more ephemeral flashes, researchers report February 10 in <em>Nature Communications.</em> Each 1 degree Celsius of warming could spur <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 10 percent increase in the most incendiary of these Promethean bolts</a>, boosting their flash rate to about four times per second by 2090 — up from nearly three times per second in 2011.</p>





<p>That’s dangerous, warns physicist Francisco Javier Pérez-Invernón of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain. “There will be more risk of lightning-ignited wildfires.”</p>



<p>Among all the forces of nature, lightning sets off the most blazes. Flashes that touch down amid minimal or no rainfall — known as dry lightning — are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac84a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially effective fire starters</a>. These bolts have initiated some of the most destructive wildfires in recent years, such as the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">2020 blazes in California</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>But more than parched circumstances can influence a blast’s ability to spark flames. <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/21/17529/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Field observations</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711220301260?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laboratory experiments</a> have suggested the most enduring form of hot lightning — “long continuing current lightning”— may be especially combustible. These strikes channel current for more than 40 milliseconds. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some last longer than one-third of a second</a> — the typical duration of a human eye blink.</p>



<p>“This type of lightning can transport a huge amount of electrical discharge from clouds to the ground or to vegetation,” Pérez-Invernón says. Hot lightning’s flair for fire is analogous to lighting a candle; the more time a wick or vegetation is exposed to incendiary energy, the easier it kindles.</p>



<p>Previous research has proposed <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/lightning-strikes-will-surge-climate-change">lightning may surge under climate change</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/14</em>). But it has remained less clear how hot lightning — and its ability to spark wildfires — might evolve.</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón and his colleagues examined the relationship between hot lightning and U.S. wildfires, using lightning data collected by a <a href="https://www.goes-r.gov/multimedia/dataAndImageryImagesGoes-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather satellite</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfire</a> data from 1992 to 2018.</p>



<p>Long continuing current lightning could have sparked up to 90 percent of the roughly 5,600 blazes encompassed in the analysis, the team found. Since <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10 percent</a> of all lightning strikes during the summer in the western United States have long continuing current, the relatively high ignition count led the researchers to infer that flashes of hot lightning were more prone to sparking fire than typical bolts.</p>





<p>The researchers also probed the repercussions of climate change. They ran computer simulations of the global activity of lightning during 2009 to 2011 and from 2090 to 2095, under a future scenario in which annual greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2080 and then decline.</p>



<p>The team found that in the later period, climate change may boost updraft within thunderstorms, causing hot lightning flashes to increase in frequency to about 4 strikes per second globally — about a 40 percent increase from 2011. Meanwhile, the rate of all cloud-to-ground strikes might increase to nearly 8 flashes per second, a 28 percent increase.</p>



<p>After accounting for changes in precipitation, humidity and temperature, the researchers predicted wildfire risk will significantly increase in Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and Australia, and risk will go up most dramatically in North America and Europe. However, risk may decrease in many polar regions, where rainfall is projected to increase while hot lightning rates remain constant.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s valuable to show that risk may evolve differently in different places, says Earth systems scientist Yang Chen of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But, he notes, the analysis uses sparse data from polar regions, so there is a lot of uncertainty. Harnessing additional data from ground-based lightning detectors and other data sources could help, he says. “That [region is] important, because a lot of carbon can be released from permafrost.”</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón agrees more data will help improve projections of rates of lightning-induced wildfire, not just in the polar regions, but also in Africa, where blazes are common but fire reports are lacking.</p>

But there are countless other individuals who may benefit from knowing some of the “brain basics” concerning music that have been discovered over the past few decades. </p><p>Music communicates emotion, but sometimes the failure to wire musical information securely in the brain during practice, or experiencing anxiety about technique or memory during performance causes emotional communication to suffer. Some knowledge of brain basics can help us study and teach with greater efficiency and confidence, thus giving us more freedom in performance to concentrate on communicating the emotional essence of the music. Consider the following:</p><h2><strong>1. We are hardwired for music as we are for language</strong></h2><p>Infants are born with amazing musical abilities. They can detect a missing downbeat at the age of two to three days and begin moving to music as soon as they have control of their limbs. They prefer singing to speaking, can recognize variations in complex rhythms at six months, and have a very good memory for music. Many of these abilities are lost by the age of one because they are not nurtured, as is the case with language. Perhaps we should rethink “how” and “when” we begin teaching music to children because music is part of who we are as human beings. Or as well-known music educator Edwin Gordon said, “Music is as basic as language to human development and existence.”</p><h2><strong>2. Practicing drives brain neuroplasticity</strong></h2><p>We all have similar brains, but each person’s brain develops in a unique way based on his learning and experience. For example, the brain of a cardiac surgeon will look a bit different from that of a musician. Many areas of the brain are involved in making music, including the areas for processing visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and motor information, as well as areas for processing emotion and memory. As we practice an instrument or voice, connections develop among all of these areas through vast neural networks, and our brains change as a result. The more we practice, the more the brain changes. These changes in the brain are called neuroplasticity. There are some ways of practicing that lead to stronger wiring or greater neuroplasticity in the brain, meaning increasingly better technical and musical skills and stronger memory for music.</p><h2><strong>3. Practicing happens in the brain, not in the muscles</strong></h2><p>Motor imagery is a powerful practice technique that involves imagining all of the movements necessary to play or sing a piece of music. One hears the music in one’s mind and imagines making the movements to create the sound—“feeling” the movements in one’s mind. Research has shown that when we practice using motor imagery, all of the areas of the brain that would normally be involved when we physically practice are active—with the single exception of the motor cortex that sends signals to the muscles to make movements. So, if we imagine every aspect of making music, our brain is practicing, and the result is nearly the same as if we had physically practiced. Imagine the implications this technique has for being able to practice if injured, if one has no access to an instrument, or if needing additional practice on something technically demanding without the possibility of causing injury from physically over-practicing.</p><h2><strong>4. Sleep may be one of the most important practice strategies of all&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>What happens in the brain during sleep reinforces the idea that practicing occurs in the brain, not in the muscles. With the discovery in the 1950s of REM and NREM sleep, researchers realized that the brain is quite active during sleep, and they subsequently have found that several stages of the sleep cycle are vitally important for the encoding and consolidation of procedural memory (motor skill memory) as well as for encoding and consolidation of declarative memory (memory for a particular piece of music). Lack of sleep impairs both our initial learning of, as well as our memory for, a piece of music.</p><h2><strong>5. The visual is important in learning and making music</strong></h2><p>We think of music as being strictly about sound, but the visual is involved as well. Amazing brain cells called mirror neurons fire not only when we make a motion ourselves but also when we see someone else making that motion or hear the sound resulting from that motion (such as the sound of a musical instrument). If we are trying to learn the violin, our brain “learns” by watching someone else play and develops a template for that motion and for the sound that motion creates, a template on which we can build as we practice. So, observation and listening are tremendously important in teaching or learning an instrument or voice.

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/eye-drops-delay-nearsightedness-child">Medicated eye drops may delay nearsightedness in children</a></h4>

              
                <p>An eye drop a day could keep myopia at bay — at least temporarily.</p>



<p>Using nightly eye drops with 0.05 percent atropine, a medication that relaxes the eye muscle responsible for focusing vision, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may delay myopia onset in children</a>, researchers report February 14 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Myopia, also called nearsightedness, is an irreversible condition in which the eyeball grows too long front to back, causing blurred distant vision. It typically begins in childhood, and the earlier it starts, the worse eye health can become later in life. Elongated eyes increase the risk for ocular complications including cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.</p>





<p>The prevalence of myopia has risen rapidly over the last few decades. About one-fourth of the global population currently has the condition. It is expected to affect half of people worldwide by 2050.</p>



<p>Genetics plays a large role in the condition. A 2020 study found that <a href="https://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(20)30265-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myopia risk is more than 10 times as high in children of two highly myopic parents as in children of nonmyopic parents</a>, says ophthalmologist Jason Yam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>But he and other scientists speculate that environmental factors such as <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-eyes">less time outdoors</a> and more intensive education are causing the recent boom (<em>SN: 1/24/13</em>). “It’s happening too quickly to be a purely genetic or inherited issue,” says optometrist Kathryn Saunders of Ulster University in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, who was not involved in the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low-dose atropine eye drops are already used to slow myopia progression in several countries in Asia. Yam and colleagues wanted to see if the medication could also delay myopia onset. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team recruited nonmyopic children ages 4 through 9 who lived in Hong Kong. Each participant received nightly eye drops but was randomly assigned to receive drops with 0.05 percent atropine, 0.01 percent atropine or a placebo. Families and clinicians didn’t know which treatment group the children were in.</p>



<p>A total of 353 children used their assigned eye drops for two years. Only about 25 percent of children who took 0.05 percent atropine eye drops, roughly 30 kids, developed myopia in at least one eye, compared with about 50 percent of those who used 0.01 percent atropine or placebo eye drops, around 60 kids in each group. The percentages in each group were similar for eye elongation not severe enough to be considered myopia.</p>





<p>“It’s a great first step to encourage us to explore more,” Saunders says.</p>



<p>Scientists will need to conduct studies in more diverse populations and environments to reach generalizable conclusions since the trial took place in only Hong Kong. Eye color may also influence dosing, as lighter-pigmented eyes might be more susceptible to side effects, including sensitivity to light.</p>



<p>How atropine slows myopia onset and progression remains a mystery. The medication might improve blood circulation in the eye, Yam says, but that’s just one existing hypothesis.</p>



<p>The new study was too short to suggest that atropine eye drops can prevent myopia. But an ongoing follow-up period in which participants continue taking the medication through their teenage years — when eye length stabilizes — will help the team understand if atropine eye drops can ward off the condition altogether.</p>

                <p><em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-023-08002-8">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for long COVID (HOT-LoCO), an interim safety report from a randomised controlled trial</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13160 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/longcovid.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="136" />Post COVID-19 Condition or long COVID, can affect anyone exposed to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or severity of original symptoms. It is commonly defined as the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least two months. Such symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others.</p>
<p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is suggested to be effective in similar conditions, such as Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue syndrome, but is not an accepted treatment for patients diagnosed with long COVID. In a randomized controlled trial conducted at Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, Kjellberg et al. sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for individuals with long COVID symptoms.</p>
<p>Twenty previously healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a placebo treatment. Data on potential side effects or adverse events that occurred during the treatment were collected, and long COVID symptoms before and after the treatment were assessed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was found to be overall safe, with no serious adverse events reported during treatment or follow-up. The most common adverse effects were cough and chest pain or discomfort, however these were mild and transient.</p>
<p>Overall, this interim safety report published in <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> provides preliminary evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be a safe treatment for individuals suffering from long COVID and could help other researchers design similar trials.</p>

<p><em>BMC Endocrine Disorders</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-022-01208-y#Abs1">Lifestyle management in polycystic ovary syndrome – beyond diet and physical activity</a></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13161 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/lifestyle.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="147" />Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women. Women with PCOS might experience a combination of reproductive, metabolic, and psychological comorbidities. A review by Cowan et al. published in <em>BMC Endocrine Disorders </em>provides an overview of the evidence to date on lifestyle strategies used to optimize management of PCOS.</p>
<p>Modifying protein, carbohydrate or fat quality or quantity seem to affect similarly the presentation of the syndrome. Vigorous aerobic exercise, however, which has been shown to improve body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and insulin resistance, seems to benefit women with PCOS. Also, psychological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction, to support the specific mental health needs of women with PCOS warrant further investigation, while improving sleep quality might be critical for promoting healthy lifestyle changes and help reduce related symptoms. The authors of the review highlight, however, that while optimizing sleep and emotional wellbeing may aid symptom management, research exploring the efficacy of clinical interventions is lacking. The use of traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine approaches, including acupuncture and yoga, by women with PCOS has been growing fast; however, the research evidence is not sufficiently robust to support their integration into routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this review provides support for the idea that a holistic approach to lifestyle management is likely to be beneficial for managing PCOS symptoms.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13162 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/antenatal.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="148" />In a study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>, Cheng et al. aimed to evaluate the impact of the teach-back method on maternal health literacy, postpartum health behavior, and maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, pregnant women with limited maternal health literacy were randomly assigned to either the control group, where they received routine education sessions, or the intervention group, where they received routine education sessions <em>as well as</em> the teach-back method. This method involves pregnant women being asked to use their own words to restate what they have just learned. The educator then assesses women’s understanding of the subject, identifies any misunderstandings, corrects mistakes, and provides additional information, if needed, until all women can correctly restate what they have learned.</p>
<p>The researchers observed that the teach-back method led to positive postpartum health behavior and improved postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. In particular, women in the intervention group scored higher in terms of their knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy related to postpartum maternal-infant health, and also had significantly fewer postpartum complications compared to women in the control group.</p>
<p>Overall, the study provides support for the idea that the teach-back method can improve postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. The authors suggest that this method could be potentially incorporated into education programs to improve health outcomes for this population.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13163 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/VR.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="159" />Virtual Reality has been increasingly used in the training of healthcare professionals, with several studies showing that students who participate in activities that use Virtual Reality tend to be more engaged and motivated than students who are trained via traditional methods. A study published in <em>BMC Medical Education</em> aimed to compare the effectiveness of using Virtual Reality versus role-playing methodology in teaching Basic Life Support skills.</p>
<p>Professionals working in healthcare facilities in Catalonia who were enrolled in Basic Life Support courses were randomly assigned to either the Virtual Reality group or the role-playing group. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare learning outcomes in the two groups. Secondary aims included evaluating satisfaction levels in the two groups with regard to the training provided, as well as analyzing the costs associated with each type of training.</p>
<p>No significant differences between the two groups were observed in terms of learning outcomes. However, participants in the VR group reported greater satisfaction with the training compared to those in the role-playing group. Also, the costs of using Virtual Reality proved to be slightly higher per student than the costs of using traditional training. However, as noted by the authors, if Virtual Reality training were to be extensively used, platform costs would possibly decrease and such differences would likely disappear.</p>
<p>In sum, Virtual Reality can be particularly useful for online training programs. However, further research is needed to explore its potential benefits for different professionals.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13164 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/adolescents.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="66" />Longitudinal health studies investigating the transition from adolescence into early adulthood are critical for understanding developmental changes, and for providing insights as to how health behavior might change as a function of age. However, the success of such studies depends on participant recruitment and retention, which prove to be challenging factors when conducting research with adolescents. In a study published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em>, Jong et al. investigated adolescents’ perspectives regarding signing up and continued involvement in longitudinal health studies.</p>
<p>Forty-eight individuals from England between the ages of 15 and 20 years participated in nine in-person focus groups about recruitment and retention in research. The main reasons for signing up included joining with peer groups, being offered financial incentives, and receiving personalized feedback. Recruitment via social media with simple messages tailored to their needs, building trust and rapport with the research staff, and user-friendly and flexible data collection were further perceived as key factors to continued involvement.</p>
<p>The findings from this study highlight the importance of understanding adolescents’ interests and motivations behind study enrolment and dropout, and can help inform the development of effective strategies for recruiting and retaining adolescents in longitudinal health research.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/mommy-brain-transforms-pregnancy">‘Mommy brain’ doesn’t capture how the brain transforms during pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain. That sounds bad. Throw in the forgetfulness and fogginess, or “momnesia,” that many moms report, and what’s left is the notion that for the brain, the transition to motherhood is a net loss.</p>



<p>“I see it on social media all the time,” says neuroscientist and therapist Jodi Pawluski of the University of Rennes in France. “Your brain shrunk. This is why [you] forget everything.”</p>



<p>But that’s just not true, Pawluski says. The perception that the maternal brain is dysfunctional has gone on long enough: It’s time to “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2801288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start giving the maternal brain the credit it deserves</a>,” Pawluski and her colleagues write February 6 in in <em>JAMA Neurology.</em></p>





<p>Pregnancy does kick-start structural changes in the brain, including a loss of gray matter. But the loss isn’t <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">automatically a bad thing</a> — reductions can reflect a fine-tuning process that makes the brain more efficient (<em>SN: 3/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the transition to motherhood, the brain reorganizes its connections, strengthening those that are useful and letting go of those that aren’t, Pawluski says. This reorganization prepares the brain “to learn rapidly to keep a baby alive,” she says.</p>



<p>In a 2016 study, for example, researchers reported brain changes, including reductions, that appear to <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-linked-long-term-changes-moms-brain">foster attachment to a new baby</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>). Other work by this team found pregnancy-triggered decreases in the volume of the ventral striatum, a region involved in motivation and reward. Those reductions in mothers’ brains were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31757430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with a heightened responsiveness</a> toward their babies, the team reported in <em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Still, many pregnant and postpartum women do report memory loss. Studies haven’t found large differences when testing memory for new moms compared with nonmothers, Pawluski says, but more research is needed to understand the mental load of parenthood — the impact of endless tasks and distractions.</p>



<p>A possible explanation for “momnesia” or “mommy brain” is that new mothers turn their attention toward baby and away from other things. Indeed, pregnant women, in contrast to never-pregnant women, demonstrated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2021.2019280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a boost in learning about baby-related objects</a> as compared with adult-related items, researchers reported in <em>Memory</em> in 2022. Pregnant women also fared better with recalling relationships between objects and locations.</p>



<p>The changes in the maternal brain are akin to those seen during adolescence. A study of first-time mothers and female adolescents found that the reductions in volume in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal brain matched those seen in the teens</a>, researchers reported in <em>Human Brain Mapping</em> in 2019. “We accept adolescence as being a time of transition and a lot of neuroplasticity,” or the brain’s ability to change, Pawluski says. The shift to motherhood is just as impactful on the brain, she says.</p>





<p>Giving the maternal brain its due for its incredible adaptations does not mean that caregiving is a skill exclusive to those who give birth. While hormones trigger brain modifications during pregnancy, nonbirthing parents’ brains change with the experience of having a newborn. After the birth of their first child, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhac333/6691667?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new fathers’ brains showed a reduction in gray matter</a>, but childless men’s brains didn’t, researchers reported in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em> in 2022.</p>



<p>Changing misperceptions about the brain during the transition to motherhood “comes back to acknowledging the importance of caregiving,” Pawluski says, by all parents. “The ability for your brain to actually learn to keep a baby alive is a big deal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-impressionist-monet-painters">Air pollution made an impression on Monet and other 19th century painters</a></h4>

              
                <p>The 19th century landscape paintings hanging in London’s Tate Britain museum looked awfully familiar to climate physicist Anna Lea Albright. Artist Joseph Mallord William Turner&#8217;s signature way of shrouding his vistas in fog and smoke reminded Albright of her own research tracking air pollution.<br><br>“I started wondering if there was a connection,” says Albright, who had been visiting the museum on a day off from the Laboratory for Dynamical Meteorology in Paris. After all, Turner — a forerunner of the impressionist movement — was painting as Britain’s industrial revolution gathered steam, and a growing number of belching manufacturing plants earned London the nickname “The Big Smoke.”</p>



<p>Turner’s early works, such as his 1814 painting “Apullia in Search of Appullus,” were rendered in sharp details. Later works, like his celebrated 1844 painting “Rain, Steam and Speed — the Great Western Railway,” embraced a dreamier, fuzzier aesthetic.</p>





<p>Perhaps, Albright thought, this burgeoning painting style wasn’t a purely artistic phenomenon. Perhaps Turner and his successors painted exactly what they saw: their environs becoming more and more obscured by smokestack haze.</p>



<p>To find out how much realism there is in impressionism, Albright teamed up with Harvard University climatologist Peter Huybers, who’s an expert in reconstructing pollution before instruments existed to closely track air quality. Their analysis of nearly 130 paintings by Turner, Paris-based impressionist Claude Monet and several others tells a tale of two modernizing cities.</p>



<p>Low contrast and whiter hues are hallmarks of the impressionist style. They are also hallmarks of air pollution, which can affect how a distant scene looks to the naked eye. Tiny airborne particles, or aerosols, can absorb or scatter light. That makes the bright parts of objects appear dimmer while also shifting the entire scene’s color toward neutral white.</p>



<p>The artworks that Albright and Huybers investigated, which span from the late 1700s to the early 1900s, decrease in contrast as the 19th century progresses. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2219118120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That trend tracks with an increase in air pollution</a>, estimated from historical records of coal sales, Albright and Huybers report in the Feb. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our results indicate that [19th century] paintings capture changes in the optical environment associated with increasingly polluted atmospheres during the industrial revolution,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albright and Huybers distinguished art from aerosol by first using a mathematical model to analyze the contrast and color of 60 paintings that Turner made between 1796 and 1850 as well as 38 Monet works from 1864 to 1901. They then compared the findings to sulfur dioxide emissions over the century, estimated from the trend in the annual amount of coal sold and burned in London and Paris. When sulfur dioxide reacts with molecules in the atmosphere, aerosols form.</p>

<p>As sulfur dioxide emissions increased over time, the amount of contrast in both Turner’s and Monet’s paintings decreased. However, paintings of Paris that Monet made from 1864 to 1872 have much higher contrast than Turner&#8217;s last paintings of London made two decades earlier.</p>



<p>The difference, Albright and Huybers say, can be attributed to the much slower start of the industrial revolution in France. Paris’ air pollution level around 1870 was about what London’s was when Turner started painting in the early 1800s. It confirms that the similar progression in their painting styles can&#8217;t be chalked up to coincidence, but is guided by air pollution, the pair conclude.</p>





<p>The researchers also analyzed the paintings’ visibility, or the distance at which an object can be clearly seen. Before 1830, the visibility in Turner&#8217;s paintings averaged about 25 kilometers, the team found. Paintings made after 1830 had an average visibility of about 10 kilometers. Paintings made by Monet in London around 1900, such as “Charing Cross Bridge,” have a visibility of less than five kilometers. That’s similar to estimates for modern-day megacities such as Delhi and Beijing, Albright and Huybers say.</p>



<p>To strengthen their argument, the researchers also analyzed 18 paintings from four other London- and Paris-based impressionists. Again, as outdoor air pollution increased over time, the contrast and visibility in the paintings decreased, the team found. What’s more, the decrease seen in French paintings lagged behind the decrease seen in British ones.</p>



<p>Overall, air pollution can explain about 61 percent of contrast differences between the paintings, the researchers calculate. In that respect, &#8220;different painters will paint in a similar way when the environment is similar,&#8221; Albright says. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to overstep and say: Oh, we can explain all of impressionism.&#8221;</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">Trish Tran narrates her life in staccato notes.</p>



<p>“I remember carrying my little sister on my back because she’s too tired and walking through the huge sunflower fields … and me feeling so tired I didn’t think I could walk another step.”</p>



<p>“I remember being in a taxi with my mother, coming back to the man who had been violently abusive to all of us…. Her words to me were, ‘Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.’ ”</p>





<p>“I’m waiting at a train station … to meet my mother who I haven’t seen in many years…. Hours pass and eventually I try to call her … and she says to me, ‘I’m sorry, Trish. My neighbor was upset, and I needed to stay back with them.’ And her voice was slurring quite a lot, so I knew she had been drinking.”</p>



<p>Tran, who lives in Perth, Australia, is dispassionate as she describes a difficult childhood. Her account lacks what are generally considered classic signs of trauma: She makes no mention of flashbacks, appears to have a generally positive outlook and speaks with relative ease about distressing events. Yet she narrates her life growing up and living in the Australian Outback as a series of disconnected events; her life story lacks connective glue.</p>

TRAN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That disjointed style is not how people, at least people in the West, tend to talk about themselves, says psychologist Christin Camia. Autobiographical accounts, like any good narrative, typically contain a <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">curation of key past experiences</a>, transitions linking those experiences and larger arcs about where life is headed. People use these stories to make sense of their lives, says Camia, of Zayed University’s Abu Dhabi campus in the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<p>But a growing body of evidence from fields as wide-ranging as psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy and literary studies suggests that, as with Tran, trauma can shatter the narrative coherence of one’s life. People lose the plot.</p>



<p>Life’s crises can trigger an existential crisis, Camia says. People think: “I don’t know who I am, and I don’t know where I go from here.”</p>





<p>One therapy now in testing aims to re-tether traumatized individuals to their mental timelines, or their sense of themselves as connected across past, present and future. The therapy focuses on the future, which once rife with possibilities now appears as a void. It asks: What would it take for someone like Tran, or anyone traumatized by war, abuse, mass shootings, the ongoing pandemic and other calamities, to flip their life script, to say that they know who they are and where they go from here?</p>



<h4>People maintain a sense of self across time</h4>



<p>In a nod to an established research approach, I have asked Tran to tell me her story in two parts. First, she should narrate seven snapshots of key moments in her life. Second, Tran, who is a lecturer on mental health recovery at Curtin University in Perth, should stitch those snapshots together to tell me how she became who she is today.</p>



<p>The first task comes easy. The second task eludes her. She switches to generalities. “I’ve always been a highly reflective person,” she says. “I’ve had to rely on my brains to keep myself and my family alive.”</p>



<p>I try to nudge her toward specifics, but her timeline disintegrates. She repeatedly attempted suicide. Her mother brought home many violent men.</p>



<p>The developer of this two-question approach, psychologist Tilmann Habermas, wasn’t focused on people who had experienced trauma. Habermas, now at Goethe University Frankfurt, wanted to understand how adolescents develop a narrative identity and then sustain that sense of self over time.</p>



<p>In 2003, Habermas launched a study that would follow participants for up to 16 years. Participants came into the lab every four years and dictated their life story in roughly 20-minute increments, using the two-task format I tried with Tran. Habermas analyzed the resulting transcripts line by line, coding them for emotion, tense, transitions and other features.</p>



<p>With few psychologists at the time studying autobiography as a window into the mind, Habermas turned to theorists from other fields for guidance. “After I read psychology, I read narratology, literary theory, linguistics, social linguistics,” he says. “I had to steal … all these concepts from the other areas.”</p>



<p>One of Habermas’ questions was how people retain their sense of self in the face of life’s many disturbances, such as divorce, illness, job loss or moving to a new location.</p>



<p>Philosophers have been puzzling over this question for millennia. “Your body has changed. Your experiences have changed. Your knowledge has changed. And yet, people generally think of themselves as being the same person … in the past and future,” says psychologist Yosef Sokol of Touro University in New York City. “That’s a hard problem.”</p>



<p>This general belief in self-continuity appears universal, even though how it is constructed may differ across cultures.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>An autobiographical outlook</h3>



<p>Autobiographical reasoning is a type of thinking that links the self across space and time. Below are three categories of this reasoning and example arguments for each.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: &#8220;After that I told myself, when I fall in love the next time, I must take care that school doesn&#8217;t suffer.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Developmental status</strong>: &#8220;At the time I wasn&#8217;t aware of any that, after all, I was still too young for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Formative experience</strong>: &#8220;My burnout has led me to no longer attach so much importance to money today.&#8221;</p>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: T. HABERMAS AND C. KÖBER/<em>MEMORY</em> 2015</div>
</div>



<p>In the third wave of Habermas’ long-term study, when 150 participants were ages 16, 20, 28, 44 and 69, Habermas and Camia, who joined Habermas’ lab in 2009, also analyzed the transcripts for a type of thinking called autobiographical reasoning. This reasoning links the self across space and time.</p>



<p>“Autobiographical reasoning is this conscious reflection. How did my past impact me? How did I become the person I am today, and what does it mean for my future?” Camia says. Such reasoning tends to stem from change, she adds. “If there is perfect stability in life, you don’t do a lot of autobiographical reasoning … it’s the changes and the crises that compel meaning-making.”</p>



<p>The researchers divvied such reasoning into eight categories, such as turning points, lessons learned, generalized insights and using an event to explain a change in personality.</p>



<p>Participants also filled out two surveys. One survey summed up the number of big life changes experienced over the previous four years. The other gauged self-continuity, with participants rating the truth of statements such as, “When I look at pictures of myself four years back, it feels a little unfamiliar” and “I have the feeling that at the core I am the same person I was four years ago.”</p>



<p>Researchers then compared the three variables: autobiographical reasoning, levels of life change and sense of self-continuity. As expected, levels of autobiographical reasoning showed no discernible pattern among participants who experienced few changes in life, the team reported in 2015 in <em>Memory</em>.</p>



<p>But when the researchers zoomed in on the quarter of participants reporting the greatest level of change, more autobiographical reasoning <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24912017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came with higher levels of self-continuity</a>. “Constructing continuity in the life story buffers against the effect of change in your life,” Habermas says. Other teams have made similar findings.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Finding life’s plot</h3>



<p>As part of a long-term study, participants shared their life stories in roughly 20-minute increments. Researchers analyzed those stories for autobiographical arguments — statements about how the past influences a person today. Among those who experienced the most life changes (quartile 4 in the chart), more autobiographical reasoning correlated with a greater sense of self-continuity.</p>

</div>



<p>Most disruptions, however, do not rise to the level of trauma — such as that experienced by Tran. Several years later, Camia would study how traumatic events, notably being forced to flee one’s home and the resulting isolation and bereavement, affect people’s sense of self.</p>



<h4>Trauma messes with our sense of time</h4>



<p>“What does war change first? <a href="https://lithub.com/poetry-after-bucha-serhiy-zhadan-on-ukraine-russia-and-the-demands-war-makes-of-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One’s sense of time</a>, one’s sense of space,” said Ukrainian writer Serhiy Zhadan in an October speech translated to English in the online magazine LitHub.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks from experience. But the idea that trauma disrupts time perception is also borne out by research. Researchers have found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> frequently dictate whether we experience time as passing fast or slow. And traumatic events, which come with intense emotions, can cause people to experience time in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00196/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow motion</a>, researchers reported in 2012 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>During a car accident, for instance, a person’s whole body is ready to act, says Marc Wittmann, a psychologist with the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany. “Your inner workings, your processing, is speeded up. Relative to that, your outside slows down.”</p>



<p>What’s more, says health psychologist Alison Holman of the University of California, Irvine, in that moment or moments of crisis, you do not think about the past or future. All that matters is <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-living-distorts-time-sense">survival</a>.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks directly to this idea in his speech: “People in a war-torn space try not to plan for the future or think too much about what the world will be like tomorrow. What’s happening to you here and now is all that matters, just the people and things that will be with you tomorrow morning — tops. That’s if you survive and wake up.”</p>



<p>That narrow focus can wreak havoc on mental health. “[When] that present moment is so intense that it sears into your mind … it may set up the likelihood that you will have a hard time moving past it,” Holman says. “The past never passes.”</p>



<p>Such breakdowns in time can show up in language, particularly among those most severely affected by trauma. For instance, Habermas and his team compared the speech patterns of 14&nbsp;women diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a singular shocking event, such as physical or sexual abuse, and 14 women without such a diagnosis. The women with PTSD used more <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-45140-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immersive language</a>. They quoted people directly and spoke of the past as if it was ongoing, says Habermas, who reported the findings in 2014. “Instead of saying, ‘He hit me,’ they would say, ‘He hits me.’ ”</p>



<p>This immersive language dominates Tran’s narration. She is “carrying” her little sister. Her mother is “coming” back to the violent man. She is “walking many kilometers to school in the rain and then opening up my newspaper-wrapped wet and warm tomato sandwiches. They’re so wet, but I’m so hungry that I know I have to eat them otherwise I’ll never make the walk back.”</p>



<p>And always there, her mother’s voice: “Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think I will ever forget those words,” Tran says.</p>



<h4>Traumatized people can lose their life story</h4>



<p>Tran remembers her mother’s words exactly, but other details of the abuse she experienced as a child are fuzzier. That’s common among people who experience trauma. People with trauma “have both an excess and depletion of memory,” says cognitive neuroscientist Elisa Ciaramelli of the University of Bologna in Italy.</p>



<p>How <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624707/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory changes among trauma survivors</a> remains controversial, write the authors of a 2021 opinion piece in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. But mounting evidence suggests that people tend to remember stressful memories in detail. As the mind fixates on those traumatic memories, memories unrelated to the trauma seem to fade, while new memories fail to register.</p>



<p>For example, when asked to describe memories associated with a specific word, such as “beach,” people who do not have PTSD offer detailed reports, describing what they were wearing, what they said and who they were with, Ciaramelli says. People who have PTSD, on the other hand, typically provide general memories with little color.</p>



<p>Other memories can’t find a foothold. In one study, researchers asked 52 participants — 26 people with PTSD and 26 people who had experienced trauma but not developed PTSD — to keep a diary recording their memories over the course of a week. Participants also responded to questions about the memory, such as whether or not it related to their trauma, how central it was to their current life and how far away in time the memory felt.</p>



<p>Participants without PTSD recorded an average of 21.4 memories across the week while participants with PTSD recorded an average of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5528199/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 11 memories</a>, the team reported in 2017 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>. The PTSD participants had more trauma-related memories than the non-PTSD group.</p>



<p>Tran recognizes this paucity of detail in her own life story. “My memories are lightbulb memories,” she says. “They are always attached to significant events like trauma or happy times. I may have 57&nbsp;years of life, but you could truncate them into a chapter.”</p>



<p>Everyone’s memory has imprecision of course. That imprecision allows us to cut extraneous details and make sense of our story. The traumatized person’s relative lack of memories, though, both in clarity and quantity, means they struggle to construct a cohesive narrative of their past and to envision themselves moving forward.</p>



<p>“Ten years ago, people have found that the same brain regions that are activated and are necessary for remembering the past are also necessary to imagine the future,” Ciaramelli says. “We need memories to imagine the future.”</p>



<p>Camia’s work with refugees shows what can happen to the sense of self as people struggle and fail to reconcile a traumatic experience with the larger story of their life. Her central aim, which built on work with Habermas, was to see if the same autobiographical arguments people used to buffer against life’s everyday changes could help those facing traumatic disruptions. She and Rida Zafar, a psychology student at New York University Abu Dhabi, recruited 31 refugees living in Germany and asked them to narrate their life stories, plus fill out the life change and self-continuity surveys used in the 2015 study.</p>



<p>Among the 16 refugees who experienced relatively less change since arriving in Germany, such as fewer upheavals in relationships and fewer moves, more autobiographical reasoning did correlate with higher self-continuity, the team reported in 2021 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. Refugees who experienced high change also used autobiographical reasoning, but their sense of self-continuity remained low.</p>



<p>These individuals cannot settle their trauma, Camia explains, so their reckoning with the past leads not to resolution but <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.618343/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumination</a>. They are stuck.</p>



<h4>Therapy could restore the future self</h4>



<p>For most of her adult life, Tran grappled with that sense of stagnation. “My identity was rooted in the past, and I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “Time was this eternal loop. Every time a problem came up, it felt like a replication of a past problem. I couldn’t see that I could change anything.”</p>



<p>Over and over again, unable to envision a viable escape, Tran tried to kill herself.</p>



<p>Suicide attempts serve as the clearest signal that a person’s future has gone blank, says Sokol, the psychologist at Touro University. The thinking here is intuitive. “If you think you have a meaningful life into the future, you’re not going to kill yourself,” he says.</p>



<p>Conventional therapies for treating people struggling with suicidal thinking often fail to meet their needs because the therapies do not directly address <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397785/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people’s future self</a>, Sokol and his team wrote in 2021 in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy</em>. For instance, dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes focusing on the present to cope with stress and manage emotions. Narrative therapy likewise aims to help patients incorporate traumatic and other events into a continuous timeline, but focuses on linking past to present, not present to future.</p>



<p>So Sokol developed a therapy that incorporates elements of past- and present-oriented treatments but prioritizes future thinking. It’s known as continuous identity cognitive therapy. His goal is to help military veterans struggling with mental illness re-create the plot in the mental timeline of their lives, to answer those foundational questions: Who am I? Where do I go from here?</p>



<p>Sokol tested an initial version of the therapy in a four-week pilot study with 17 veterans. The program contains many work-arounds for participants struggling to access or make sense of their memories. The specific memory is less important than the larger story, or the broader values contained within that memory, Sokol says. “I have all sorts of techniques to help people tap into something that they find important, meaningful.”</p>



<p>In the first week, participants are asked to define their core values. The hope is that those values, rather than specific past events, will form the core of a person’s life story. To get to that core, participants review negative and positive experiences from their past and identify choices they made.</p>



<p>Many veterans struggle with what are called moral injuries — choices they made that don’t seem to align with who they wish to be, Sokol says. So veterans push those memories away. With the values approach, he hopes participants can start to see that they made the best choices they could under challenging circumstances. One way to access those values is to have participants identify people they admire, and the values those people embody. Participants can then use those people’s experiences to identify their own core values.</p>



<p>The focus of the second week shifts to the future. Participants assemble possible futures by reflecting on how life might play out if they work with, or against, their stated values. Participants also actively construct self-continuity. For instance, they write letters to themselves across different time points, such as from their present self to their future self or vice versa.</p>



<p>In week three, participants learn to differentiate between external life stories, the series of events outside their control, and internal life stories made up of choices in line with their stated values. By week four, participants should be able to visualize their future self overcoming an issue that their present self faces.</p>

<h3>Thinking of the future</h3>



<p>In a small pilot study with veterans, a new treatment for mental illness that focuses on future thinking, called continuous identity cognitive therapy, appeared to decrease levels of suicidal ideation and depression.</p>

<p>Tran came across Sokol’s research while embarking on her own journey to healing. That process began when Tran realized how her trauma was hurting the people she loved most. “I’m just causing my children and everybody near and dear trauma. I’m going to take [suicide] off the table,” she eventually realized. “This is not my pathway anymore. If it’s not my pathway, what am I going to do with the next 50 years of my life?”</p>



<p>Tran felt lost. So she dug into research on trauma survivors, eventually stumbling upon Sokol’s project. She was moved by the idea that participants did not have to reconstruct the past to build a new future. “This is true. My soul knows this to be true,” she remembers thinking.</p>



<p>Tran, who is also a trainer with DISCHARGED, a nonprofit organization that provides peer group support for people experiencing suicidal thoughts, and an occasional adviser to researchers writing about suicide, reached out to Sokol and offered to help him make the language used in his program more sensitive to people who have experienced trauma. For instance, she suggested changing references to “you” to “we” to give people a greater sense of belonging and agency. The two still work together.</p>



<p>Research on the therapy remains limited to Sokol’s lab, but initial results are promising. The pilot study showed that the program decreased previously reported levels of suicidal ideation and depression. Those levels stayed low one month after completion. Now Sokol has received a five-year, $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to scale up the program and eventually roll out a randomized controlled trial. In its newer iteration, the program will run for three months instead of one.</p>



<p>With input from Tran and veterans in the program, Sokol made another substantial modification to the pilot program. Participants will now identify how their own story intersects with the stories of other people in their lives. That addition makes sense to Tran, who has become engrossed in research showing the intergenerational nature of trauma. She now sees her life as part of a larger story with many characters, each on their own often troubled journey.</p>



<p>She says her story will always be truncated. But even without a clean narrative arc, she has managed to sever time’s eternal loop. “You can change your relationship with your past experiences in a way that makes living a future possible,” Tran says.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/new-biomaterial-heals-heart-attack-damage">A new biomaterial heals heart attack damage in animals. Humans could be next</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new biomaterial delivered to the heart soon after a heart attack can heal damaged tissue from the inside out.</p>



<p>Heart attacks kill cardiac muscle tissue, scarring the heart and leaving permanent damage after just six hours. The damage prevents the heart from functioning properly. If there was a way to begin healing damaged tissue soon after a heart attack, doctors could prevent scar tissue from developing.</p>



<p>“In an ideal world, you treat a patient immediately when they’re having a heart attack to try to salvage some of the tissue and promote regeneration,” says Karen Christman, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego.</p>





<p>The pursuit of this ideal inspired Christman, along with a team of researchers, to develop the biomaterial. In rodents and pigs, it<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00964-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> appears to repair tissue damage and reduce inflammation directly after a heart attack</a>, Christman and colleagues report December 29 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p><a></a>“I think it has a lot of potential,” Vimala Bharadwaj, a biomedical scientist at Stanford University who was not involved in the research. The paper&nbsp; “is definitely good proof of concept for what they’re trying to do.”</p>



<p>Previously, researchers found that<a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-fat-mend-bone-cartilage-muscle-and-even-heart"> stem cells derived from body fat can be used to heal bones, muscles and the heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/9/16</em>). Christman wanted to work with the extracellular matrix, the lattice of proteins that provide structural support to the cells in cardiac muscle tissue. Like stems cells, it has regenerative abilities but is much less expensive, she says.</p>



<p>In 2009, Christman’s team produced a hydrogel using particles from this matrix. Trials in rats and later in humans showed that the material bonded to damaged areas and promoted cell repair and growth. However, due to relatively large particles of the hydrogel, it could be delivered to the heart only via a needle.</p>



<p>“Poking the heart with a needle could set off an arrhythmia,” says Christman. To use this treatment, doctors would need to wait a few weeks until the heart is more stable and the chance of these irregular heartbeats decreases. And that would be too late to prevent scarring.</p>



<p>The team took the previously created hydrogel, sifted out the larger particles with a centrifuge so only nanoparticles remained, and added water to dilute the mixture. That created a material thin enough to deliver to heart blood vessels intravenously.</p>





<p>Based on the nanoparticles&#8217; size, the team expected the mixture would slip through any gaps in cardiac blood vessels caused by the heart attack and adhere to the surrounding tissue. Once there, it would create a protective barrier while the heart healed. </p>



<p>Instead, animal experiments showed that the extracellular matrix material bound to the leaky vessels, preventing some inflammatory cells from moving into the heart tissue in the first place and causing further damage. The material reduced inflammation in the heart and stimulated the healing process by encouraging cell growth, the team reports.</p>



<p>Further safety studies will be needed to get the biomaterial ready for clinical trials. The first trial in humans will most likely be for repairing cardiac tissue post–heart attack. “A lot of my motivation is moving things out of the lab, actually into the real world,” Christman says.</p>



<p>Another real-world application of the biomaterial could be treatment for leaky blood vessels in other hard-to-access organs, including in the brain after a traumatic injury, Christman notes.</p>



<p>While Bharadwaj finds that application potentially promising, she says tests are needed to see whether the biomaterial improves headaches and cognitive or memory deficits in the brain after a traumatic injury. That’s needed to gauge whether it really is an effective TBI treatment.</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission?

<p>Certain legitimate journal types are particularly susceptible to hijacking, including niche or trade journals published in English or local languages, print-only journals, and journals indexed in international databases like Web of Science or Scopus. Hijackers typically avoid journals from big,<s> </s>reputable publishers such as Springer, Wiley, and Elsevier. </p>



<p>As a result, multiple networks of hijacked journals created by different cybercriminals target the same legitimate journals, potentially causing the same legitimate journals to have multiple clone websites.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a> contains a few examples of journals that have been hijacked twice, such as&nbsp; the journal <em>Gorteria</em> (ISSN 0017-2294)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But hijackers have created at least five clone websites for <a href="http://thejossgroup.com/newsletters/">the <em>Seybold Report</em></a>, a trade publication focused on graphic arts technology. The <a href="https://seyboldjournal.com/">first clone</a> website was created in 2020 by an Indian network and continued to deceive scholars until 2021. The content of the hijacked journal ended up in Scopus, similar to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/12/meet-the-hijacked-journal-that-keeps-rising-from-the-ashes/">other</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/26/how-hijacked-journals-keep-fooling-one-of-the-worlds-leading-databases/">cases</a> of hijacked journals. That clone website has since been deactivated and Scopus has deleted the unauthorized content.</p>

<p>In 2022, at least four other websites cloning the <em>Seybold Report</em> were registered. It appears that at least two of these websites were created by the same fraudulent publishers, as their contact addresses are identical.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Three clone websites share identical editorial boards that include the names of prominent scholars without their permission. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/d/jonathan-dingel">Jonathan Dingel</a>, an associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is <a href="https://seyboldreport.net/Editorial%20Board.html">listed as</a> editor-in-chief of a hijacked <em>Seybold Report,</em> but confirmed that he has nothing to do with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, three of the newly created clones are accusing each other of being fake and claiming to be the original journal. It is unclear whether these three clones were created by two or three different networks of hijackers, or if this is just a marketing ploy of a single fraudulent publisher.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">one of us tweeted</a> about the fraudsters accusing each other of being frauds, we found <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">&nbsp;</a>even more cloned versions.&nbsp;For those who know the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/MAHC.2019.2926975">history of the journal</a>, how the original journal looks (such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recent-issue-seybold-report-molly-joss">this example</a> from 2015), and&nbsp;its purpose as a trade publication instead of a scientific journal, then the fraud is pretty obvious. But the hijackers accusing each other of fraud is next-level deception.</p>

<p><strong>The chances of contacting</strong> <strong>extraterrestrial civilizations seem poor</strong> – <em><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/archive/chances-contacting-extraterrestrial-civilizations-seem-poor">Science News</a></em>, February 24, 1973</p>



<p>The possibility of life … on other planets has stimulated many people’s i­maginations…. In the Feb. 9 <em>Nature</em>, James&nbsp;C.&nbsp;G. Walker of Yale University studies the possible parameters of such a search and comes to some pessimistic conclusions.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Walker estimated it could take 1,400 to 14 million years to contact E.T. with the available technology. That’s way longer than researchers have spent listening for alien radio signals and <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">scouring the sky with telescopes and satellites</a> (<em>SN: 11/21/20, p. 18</em>).</p>





<p>Despite the silence, scientists have sent their own messages into the void. In 1974, Earth sent a string of binary code from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Years later, arguably the most famous message — <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/archive/world-record">the Golden Record</a> — made its way to space aboard NASA spacecraft (<em>SN: 8/20/77, p. 124</em>).</p>



<p>If aliens ever reach out, they may <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">send quantum dispatches</a>, scientists say (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p.&nbsp;5</em>). Even so, the aliens are likely so far from Earth that their <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/drake-equation-alien-extraterrestrial-civilizations">civilization will have collapsed</a> by the time we get the message (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 9</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/gel-body-sugar-grow-electrodes-fish">A gel cocktail uses the body’s sugars to ‘grow’ electrodes in living fish</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, researchers have harnessed the body’s own chemistry to “grow” electrodes inside the tissues of living fish, blurring the boundary between biology and machines.</p>



<p>The technique uses the body’s sugars to turn an injected gel into a flexible electrode without damaging tissues, experiments show. Zebrafish with these <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electrodes grown in their brains, hearts and tail fins</a> showed no signs of ill effects, and ones tested in leeches successfully stimulated a nerve, researchers report in the Feb. 24 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Someday, these electrodes could be useful for applications ranging from studying how biological systems work to improving human-machine interfaces. They also could be used in “bioelectronic medicine,” such as <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">brain stimulation therapies for depression</a>, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>Soft electronics aim to bridge the gap between soft, curvy biology and electronic hardware. But these electronics typically still must carry certain parts that can be prone to cracks and other issues, and inserting these devices inevitably causes damage to tissues.</p>



<p>“All the devices we have made, even though we have made them flexible, to make them more soft, when we introduce them, there will still be a scar. It’s like sticking a knife into the organ,” says Magnus Berggren, a materials scientist at Linköping University in Sweden. That scarring and inflammation can degrade electrode performance over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous efforts to grow soft electronics inside tissues have drawbacks. One approach uses electrical or chemical signals to power the transformation from chemical soup to conducting electrodes, but these zaps also cause damage. A 2020 study got around this problem by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay4866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically modifying cells in worms to produce an engineered enzyme</a> that does the job, but the new method achieves its results without genetic alterations.</p>



<p>Berggren and colleagues’ electrodes instead exploit a natural energy source already present in the body: sugars. The gel cocktail contains molecules called oxidases that react with the sugars — glucose or lactate — to produce hydrogen peroxide. That then activates another ingredient in the cocktail, an enzyme called hydrogen peroxidase, which is the catalyst needed to transform the gel into a conducting electrode.</p>



<p>“The approach leverages elegant chemistry to overcome many of the technical challenges,” says biomedical engineer Christopher Bettinger of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To test the technique, the researchers injected the cocktail into the brains, hearts and tail fins of transparent zebrafish. The gel turns blue when it becomes conductive, giving a visual readout of its success.</p>





<p>“The beautiful thing is you can see it: The zebrafishes’ tail changes color, and we know that blue indicates a conducting polymer,” says materials scientist Xenofon Strakosas, also of Linköping University. “The first time I saw it, I thought ‘Wow, it’s really working!’”</p>



<p>The fish appeared to suffer no ill effects, and the researchers saw no evidence of tissue damage. In partially dissected leeches, the team showed that delivering a current to a nerve via a soft electrode could induce muscle contractions. Ultimately, devices like this could be paired with various wireless technologies in development.</p>



<p>Long-term implant performance remains to be determined, however. “The demonstrations are impressive,” Bettinger says. “What remains to be seen is the stability of the electrode.” Over time, substances in the body could react with the electrode materials, degrading it or even producing toxic substances.</p>



<p>The team still needs to refine how precisely the electrodes can stimulate nerves, says chemical engineer Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, who was not involved in the work. She and colleagues developed the way to “grow” electrical components using genetic modifications. Ensuring stimulation is concentrated where it’s needed for a treatment, while preventing the leakage of current to unwanted regions will be important, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, the relative abundance of different sugars in different tissues determines exactly where electrodes form. But in the future, a component of the main ingredient could be swapped out for elements that attach to specific bits of biology to make targeting much more precise, Berggren says. “We’re conducting experiments right now where we’re trying to bind these materials directly on individual cells.” Notes Strakosas: “There are some applications where precision is really important; that’s where we have to invest effort.”&nbsp;</p>
