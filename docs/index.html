<p>Two anthropology organizations co-hosting a conference this fall have removed from the program a panel presentation entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel had been slated for the joint <a href="https://annualmeeting.americananthro.org/general-info/">annual meeting</a> of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA), to be held in Toronto in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">letter</a> informing the panelists of the decision, Ramona Pérez and Monica Heller, presidents of the AAA and CASCA, respectively, wrote that the executive boards of the two groups had reviewed the submission “at the request of numerous members” and decided to remove it from the conference program. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127933"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision was based on extensive consultation and was reached in the spirit of respect for our values, the safety and dignity of our members, and the scientific integrity of the program(me). The reason the session deserved further scrutiny was that the ideas were advanced in such a way as to cause harm to members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While there were those who disagree with this decision, we would hope they know their voice was heard and was very much a part of the conversation. It is our hope that we continue to work together so that we become stronger and more unified within each of our associations. Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pérez and Heller did not respond directly to our request for comment, but forwarded our message to an association spokesperson, who sent us a statement titled &#8220;<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology.docx">No Place For Transphobia in Anthropology</a>.&#8221; The association writes, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The function of the “gender critical” scholarship advocated in this session, like the function of the “race science” of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, is to advance a “scientific” reason to question the humanity of already marginalized groups of people, in this case, those who exist outside a strict and narrow sex / gender binary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The AAA/CASCA decision was a “shock,” according to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">open letter</a> written by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/klowrey">Kathleen Lowrey</a>, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta who organized the panel, and her co-panelists. In the letter, they said none of the panelists had heard from AAA or CASCA with any concerns about the panel until the letter notifying them of the decision to cancel the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They defended the content of the panel against what they said was the “false accusation” the ideas were harmful. The letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Your suggestion that our panel would somehow compromise “&#8230;the scientific integrity of the programme” seems to us particularly egregious, as the decision to anathematize our panel looks very much like an anti-science response to a politicized lobbying campaign. Had our panel been allowed to go forward, we can assure you that lively contestation would have been welcomed by the panelists and may even have occurred between us, as our own political commitments are diverse. Instead, your letter expresses the alarming hope that the AAA and CASCA will become “more unified within each of our associations” to avoid future debates. Most disturbingly, following other organizations, such as the Society for American Archaeology, the AAA and CASCA have promised that “Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.” Anthropologists around the world will quite rightly find chilling this declaration of war on dissent and on scholarly controversy. It is a profound betrayal of the AAA’s principle of “advancing human understanding and applying this understanding to the world’s most pressing problems”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey’s directory page at the University of Alberta states the institution “has reacted <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/06/12/from-south-american-anthropology-to-gender-crit-cancel-culture-my-strange-feminist-journey/">punitively</a> to my outspoken criticisms of trans activism and gender ideology.” In 2020, Lowrey was removed from an administrative role as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology, <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions">which she attributed</a> to her views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us that several of the panelists had “spent quite a lot of money on travel arrangements, as the panel was accepted in July, and we were all stunned to receive the letter &#8220;removing&#8221; us on Monday.”</p>



<p>She said she was not aware of another instance when AAA or CASCA had removed a panel&nbsp; from the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us the implications of the cancellation were “quite unsettling”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The AAA is the largest professional association of anthropologists in the world, and the joint conference with CASCA (which happens every third year, I believe) is the Big Kahuna of anthropology conferences.&nbsp; I organized the panel in order to bring together two kinds of anthropologists concerned with the replacement of biological sex by &#8220;gender&#8221;:&nbsp; one the one hand, scholars like Elizabeth Weiss and Carole Hooven who have an interest in human evolution (for which sexual reproduction is a relevant process!) and on the other, scholars like Silvia Carrasco, Michele Sirois, and Kathleen Richardson who have an interest in feminist issues (for which sex based oppression is a relevant process!).&nbsp; I have interests in both domains, and thought it would be great to bring together scholars concerned for very different reasons with sex as a category of anthropological analysis in order to see where our concerns overlap and where they diverge.</p>



<p>I truly do not understand why anyone who disagrees with any of this wouldn&#8217;t simply turn up to the panel and engage us in discussion. That&#8217;s what conferences are for.&nbsp; I would be sincerely interested to hear AAA and CASCA representatives elaborate on why they think talking about biological sex is threatening and harmful to trans identified people or to what they term the &#8220;LGBTQI&#8221; community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">panel description</a> contained this summary:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While it has become increasingly common in anthropology and public life to substitute &#8216;sex&#8217; with &#8216;gender&#8217;, there are multiple domains of research in which biological sex remains irreplaceably relevant to anthropological analysis. Contesting the transition from sex to gender in anthropological scholarship deserves much more critical consideration than it has hitherto received in major diciplinary [sic] fora like AAA / CASCA. This diverse international panel brings together scholars from socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology who describe why in their work gender is not helpful and only sex will do. This is particularly the case when the work is concerned with equity and the deep analysis of power, and which has as an aim the achievement of genuine inclusivity. With research foci from hominin evolution to contemporary artificial intelligence, from the anthropology of education to the debates within contemporary feminism about surrogacy, panelists make the case that while not all anthropologists need to talk about sex, baby, some absolutely do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The rise in anthropology of multiple schools of thought that cannot withstand any scrutiny, any challenge, or even sustained contentious inquiry, is a growing disaster for the entire discipline.&nbsp; I feel like I&#8217;m trying to shout that the bridge is out ahead and no one is listening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very frustrating.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trilobite-fossil-hints-scavengers-ate">A one-of-a-kind trilobite fossil hints at what and how these creatures ate</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious, prehistoric marine creature has spilled its guts. For the first time, scientists have unearthed a fossilized trilobite whose final meals were preserved within its digestive system.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Valéria Vaškaninová and colleagues discovered the partially digested meals when they looked at a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06567-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-resolution 3-D scan of <em>Bohemolichas incola</em></a>, a previously known but relatively rare trilobite species that lived 465 million years ago. The contents include fragments of thin-walled shells, bits of echinoderms (a group that includes modern-day sea urchins and starfish), and other bottom-dwellers small enough to be swallowed whole, the researchers report online September 27 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Many of the more than 20,000 described species of trilobites, a group that existed between 520 million and 252 million years ago, were prominent members of marine ecosystems. Some species may have even had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-trilobites-sported-dual-digestive-tracts">dual digestive tracts</a>, though <em>B. incola</em> did not (<em>SN: 10/31/14</em>). The new find not only provides direct evidence of what some trilobites may have eaten, but it also hints about their physiology and how they foraged.</p>

<p>Tightly packed clumps of shelly bits throughout the tubelike gut suggest that the trilobite fed almost continuously before it died, perhaps by scavenging the seafloor for broken remains of shelled creatures and digesting the soft tissues still attached to them. Trilobites typically didn’t have sturdy mouthparts and thus wouldn’t have had a powerful bite, says Vaškaninová, of Charles University in Prague.</p>



<p>And since the calcium-rich shells in the gut show no signs of being dissolved, the trilobite probably had a gut environment with an alkaline or neutral pH, Vaškaninová and colleagues suggest. That sort of biochemistry would have reduced the amount of dissolved calcium entering its bloodstream, which would be metabolically difficult to get rid of, the team proposes.</p>



<p>In a small bit of turnabout-is-fair-play, the scan also revealed that <em>B. incola</em>’s carcass had been scavenged by other organisms before fossilizing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-falls-down-matter-einsteins-gravity">Antimatter falls like matter, upholding Einstein’s theory of gravity</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: Antimatter falls down, not up.</p>



<p>In a first-of-its-kind experiment, scientists dropped antihydrogen atoms and watched them fall, showing that gravity attracts antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</p>



<p>The study confirms a pillar of Einstein’s general theory of relativity known as the weak equivalence principle. According to that principle, gravity pulls on every object in the same way, no matter what it’s made of. “This concept is at the heart of our comprehension of gravitation,” says physicist Ruggero Caravita, who was not involved with the new work.</p>





<p>Antimatter is the mirror image of matter, carrying the opposite electric charge but the same mass. An electron’s antiparticle, for example, is a positively charged particle called a positron. A proton’s alter ego is a negatively charged antiproton, and so on.</p>



<p>Most physicists didn’t seriously entertain the idea that antimatter could fall up instead of down, says Jeffrey Hangst of Aarhus University in Denmark. But scientists had never been able to directly test it before. “Antimatter is kind of mysterious … so we want to actually confirm that behavior,” says Hangst, who is the spokesperson for the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus, or ALPHA, collaboration, which reported the new result.</p>



<p>Not only did <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06527-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the antimatter fall as expected</a>, but it also dropped with roughly the same acceleration as normal matter, the team found.</p>



<p>The results, described in the Sept. 28 <em>Nature</em>, showcase scientists’ growing control over antimatter, and antihydrogen in particular. Antimatter is a wily substance that can be difficult to work with. If it touches anything made of matter — the walls of a storage container or molecules of air — it quickly annihilates. It has taken decades of work to measure any effect of gravity on antimatter at all, Hangst says.</p>



<p>In the experiment, performed at the European laboratory CERN near Geneva, scientists trapped antihydrogen atoms with strong magnetic fields. Those antihydrogen atoms were made by mixing antiprotons, created at CERN, with positrons from a radioactive source.</p>



<p>The researchers then released the antihydrogen from its magnetic cage, counting how many atoms went up versus down. If gravity treats antimatter and matter equally, most atoms should fall down, with a few flying upward due to the initial jostling motions of the atoms. That’s just what the researchers found.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Researchers contained antihydrogen atoms within the ALPHA-g apparatus using magnetic fields. The team measured how the atoms fell when they were released. As the antimatter escaped, it hit the walls of the apparatus and annihilated. The researchers counted how many atoms went up and down by detecting those annihilations, as depicted in this animation. Most atoms went down, confirming that gravity pulls antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s a very nice, very neat and very simple concept,” says theoretical physicist Yunhua Ding of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>To further confirm that the antihydrogen behaved as expected, the researchers altered the magnetic fields to push atoms upward, canceling out gravity’s effect. In that test, roughly equal numbers of atoms went up and down. Further varying the magnetic fields likewise matched expectations.</p>



<p>Previous experiments already hinted that gravity treats matter and antimatter the same. In 2022, the BASE experiment, also at CERN, reported that oscillations of confined antiprotons indirectly confirmed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiprotons-protons-matter-antimatter-differences-physics">matter and antimatter feel the same tug of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/22</em>). But ALPHA’s experiment is the first to directly observe antimatter particles falling.</p>





<p>The idea that different types of objects fall with the same acceleration far predates Einstein. Legend states that in the 16th century, Galileo dropped different objects off the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate this effect. Scientists have since tested it in a variety of situations, even with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">objects in orbit around Earth</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But they’d never done the test with antimatter until now.</p>



<p>Although physicists didn’t expect the antimatter to fall up, some researchers have proposed that antimatter may fall with a slightly different acceleration than normal matter. “If we find even the tiniest difference, this would be an indication that something new is happening,” says Caravita, of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Trento, Italy, who is the spokesperson of the AEgIS collaboration at CERN. AEgIS is one of a cadre of experiments there also working toward measuring gravity’s effect on antimatter.</p>



<p>The current experiment isn’t precise enough to suss out those subtle differences. But new techniques, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-cooled-antimatter-foundations-physics-einstein-gravity">cooling antihydrogen atoms with lasers</a>, could make future tests more precise (<em>SN: 4/5/21</em>). That could help scientists see, when it comes to matter and antimatter, whether gravity is truly agnostic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-ring-galaxies-eye-wallaby-space">This ‘polar ring’ galaxy looks like an eye. Others might be hiding in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s big. It’s beautiful. It looks a bit like a sparkly, starry, slightly smooshed Eye of Sauron.</p>



<p>It’s the galaxy NGC 4632, and new radio telescope images suggest that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/525/3/4663/7264229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it sports a rare “polar ring”</a> — a halo of mostly hydrogen gas tilted about 90 degrees from the plane of the galaxy’s disk.</p>



<p>These spectacular structures, which can also contain dust and stars, are thought to encircle only about 1 in 1,000 galaxies. But now it seems that many more — possibly 30 times as many — could be hiding in plain sight, researchers report in the November <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>





<p>“The implication would be that there are tons of these things out there, masquerading as normal galaxies,” says astronomer Ronald Buta of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Astronomers are still puzzling out how any galaxies have polar rings at all. But they’re thought to form as galaxies grow, either by colliding with other galaxies or by gobbling up gas.</p>



<p>“The rings give us clues about how [galaxies] can grow and evolve,” says astronomer Nathan Deg of Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston, Canada.</p>



<p>Deg and colleagues spotted the ringlike structure around NGC 4632 — and one encircling another galaxy, NGC 6156 — in data from the WALLABY survey, a project that is scanning half of the southern sky with the ASKAP radio telescope in Western Australia.</p>



<p>“It immediately strikes you that, hey, look, there&#8217;s something funny going on right here that kind of looks like a ring,” Deg says.</p>



<p>It can be tough to tell rings from warped galactic disks, depending on how galaxies are oriented with respect to Earth. So the team used virtual reality visualizations to help distinguish the galaxies’ disks from the potential rings, and compared the real data with simulated observations of perfect polar rings viewed at different angles.</p>



<p>The scientists report that the stunning structures sported by the two galaxies are indeed probably polar rings, with NGC 4632’s ring spanning roughly 60,000 light-years.</p>



<p>And these two may have plenty of company. The fact that the team has already spotted two potential polar rings in the 592 galaxies included in these first bits of WALLABY data suggests that earlier estimates of the frequency of such structures were too low.</p>



<p>The team’s simulations, which tested how polar ring galaxies look to telescopes when viewed at different angles, indicate a similar conclusion. Altogether, the observations and simulations suggest that as many as 3 percent of nearby galaxies could have overlooked rings, too.</p>



<p>A fruit of these combined efforts is a striking composite image of NGC 4632’s starry disk, viewed in visible light, and the radio glow of its hydrogen halo. Hydrogen emits mostly radio light, so the structure is invisible in visible-light images of the galaxy previously taken by the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. Larger telescopes taking closer looks, Deg says, might be able to spot stars in the halo too.</p>





<p>Thanks to large surveys like WALLABY, Deg says, “we&#8217;re in an era where we can discover these and figure out the rings in a way that we never could before.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The significant growth of genomic data and bioinformatics tools to analyze them has led, inevitably, to discussions around reproducibility and robustness of software.</p>
<p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p>
<blockquote><p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean</a> is one platform that can be used to peer review code.  It provides “compute capsules” for researchers to upload their code and reviewers to access anonymously to test it. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00388-w">A small cluster of Nature journals</a> have now integrated Code Ocean into their submission system.</p>
<p>However, is this welcomed in the computational science community? How do researchers feel about the peer review of code in general? After all, as we don’t ask reviewers to try and reproduce experimental results in the laboratory during manuscript assessment, so perhaps we shouldn’t ask them to test code either.</p>
<p>I reached out to a number of researchers that serve on the editorial board for the journal <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Bioinformatics</em></a> to find out, inviting them to share their views in response to a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on mandating the sharing of previously unreported code described in a manuscript submitted to a computational journal such as <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em>?</strong></p>
<p>There was a, possibly unsurprisingly, consensus that this was a good idea and that all authors should be required to deposit their code in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or similar platform.</p>
<p>Dimitris Polychronopoulos from Ochre Bio stated that, in his view,<em> “publishing previously unreported code in code repositories such as Github, Bitbucket or others is a prerequisite for any work that involves computational analyses.”</em></p>
<p>He then went on to explain that this was for two reasons – to <em>“ensure code reproducibility and code robustness for people running on different computer architectures”</em> and <em>“disseminate the work and potentially integrate findings generated from a pipeline to another under development, promoting this way scientific progress.”</em></p>
<p>Miha Moškon from the University of Ljubljana went one step further, mentioning the importance of documentation, <em>“ … a code published without a proper documentation is sometimes as useless as no code at all. The requirement to share the code should thus be complemented with the requirement to also document it appropriately.”</em></p>
<p>Timothy Shaw from the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute points out that it <em>“ … should be a priority of requiring authors to submit ready-to-run code, which should include examples of inputs and outputs.”</em>  Hence platforms such as Code Ocean of course, although interestingly all but one of my respondents hadn’t heard of it.</p>
<p>But were my respondents as keen on the actual process of testing code as part of the peer review process?  Did they see any benefit to it? I asked them.</p>
<p><strong>What might </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>advantages of peer review of code be?</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13354" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13354" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="wp-image-13354 size-medium" title="© joyfotoliakid / Stock.adobe.com" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13354" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© joyfotoliakid / Stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>All respondents agreed that peer review would lead to improvements in the code prior to publication.</p>
<p>Bashar Ibrahim from the Gulf University for Science and Technology and University of Jena said that “<em>Peer review of code is a valuable practice in software development that enhances code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. It helps identify and address issues early, leading to more efficient development and better overall tools.”</em></p>
<p>Shaw stated that he <em>“personally benefitted from having users test our software.”</em></p>
<p>Johann Rohwer from Stellenbosch University was of a similar opinion but also cautioned that it may not be possible to inspect everything in detail if the code base is particularly large.</p>
<p>This statement lent itself nicely to my next question.</p>
<p><strong>Can you think of any disadvantages of including the assessment of code in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>As with the previous question, there was a general theme, that is, concerns focusing on finding peer reviewers that can test code and the additional time that may be required, which may lead to delays in publication.</p>
<p>Moškon, for example, stated that “<em>finding reviewers with appropriate expertise who are willing to provide timely reviews with high standard is already a challenging task, which editors are facing every day. And finding a reviewer who is competent in assessing, e.g., the biological significance of the results as well as the quality and reproducibility of the published code will sometimes be an impossible task.”</em></p>
<p>Anil Kesarwani from The Jackson Laboratory pointed out that <em>&#8220;reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available&#8221;</em> and that <em>&#8220;code review can be subjective as different reviewers may have varying opinions on code style and quality.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Boyang Ji from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, who was the one respondent that had any experience of using Code Ocean to peer review code, said <em>“usually I just have a look the core part of the algorithm part. For machine learning projects, I usually have a check to make sure the pipeline is as authors described in the manuscript. Usually, I cannot review the code line by line.”</em></p>
<p>So, perhaps using automated AI-tools such as ChatGPT can help solve the issues around additional resources needed to peer review code. I asked my respondents what they thought about this.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><strong>Anil Kesarwani, The Jackson Laboratory (USA)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What are you</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> views on using a ChatGPT tool to assess code automatically?</strong></p>
<p>Here, Ibrahim voiced the opinion shared by almost everyone:</p>
<p><em>“AI-based tools can be highly beneficial for improving code quality, and consistency. However, it is a valuable tool within the broader code review but not a complete replacement for human expertise. The best practice is to combine automated code assessments with regular human code reviews for code quality assurance.”</em></p>
<p>Jia Meng from Xi&#8217;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University was more cautious, stating that they were not convinced that ChatGPT is currently able to perform peer review of code well at present, but this might change in the future.</p>
<p>Polychronopoulos was particularly enthusiastic, stating “<em>I am a big fan. In my mind, assessing code can be largely broken down into two steps; first you check out the whole pipeline to familiarize yourself and get a general idea of what’s going on and then you delve into the specifics. I see ChatGPT being particularly useful at the first step.”</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you see the future of peer review of code?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, most respondents do feel that AI will have a role to play.</p>
<p>Ibrahim commented that <em>“Ultimately, the future of peer review of code review will be shaped by advances in AI, collaboration, and on improving code quality. Embracing these trends can help development teams deliver higher-quality software more efficiently.”</em></p>
<p>Moškon was a little more circumspect: “… <em>the future of peer review of code will rely on the automatic assessment tools. To what degree can we trust these tools is another question. Are we willing to transfer the peer review process to artificial intelligence?”</em></p>
<p>And Sri Krishna Subramanian from the Institute of Microbial Technology concludes the discussion with<em> &#8220;in the foreseeable future, I anticipate widespread adoption of code peer review as a standard practice across reputable journals in all major fields. The task is to find the sweet spot by balancing the integration of AI-driven tools for automated code evaluation, fostering community involvement for comprehensive code testing, and establishing standardized protocols. This approach should be complemented by the expertise of human reviewers to assess both the code and its accompanying manuscript, aligning with the principles of open science and adhering to ethical standards governing code and its associated data.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, in summary, what do the researchers I reached out to think about the future of peer view of code? In essence, it is laudable and something that should be considered essential when assessing papers describing computational research.  It should lead to higher quality and robust researcher-developed software and algorithms. There are some challenges, such as the difficulties in finding suitable reviewers and authors may have to wait longer for a decision, due to the time it takes to assess the code.  The advent of ChatGPT may, in part, be a solution to these, but it is important that human reviewers are still involved and gudelines incorporated to ensure that the peer review is suitably robust.</p>

<p>In an effort to reproduce the results using reverse-engineering, Kahng and his colleagues found <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/271439-more-details-but-not-enough/fulltext">human experts typically beat Google&#8217;s machine-learning system</a>, as they reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11014">a preprint</a> published earlier this year. However, they had no way &#8220;to replicate the pre-training described in the Nature paper,&#8221; they wrote.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, a Google researcher who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html">fired after he questioned the paper in <em>Nature</em></a> alleged in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/satrajit_vs_google.pdf">lawsuit</a> earlier this year that the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; claims to have revolutionized chip layout using AI were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/27/google_ai_chip_paper_nature/">tied to efforts to commercialize its software</a>, as reported by <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company referred us to a statement issued earlier to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-brain-ai-researcher-fired-tension/"><em>Wired</em></a> by Zoubin Ghahrahmani, vice president at Google DeepMind:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We thoroughly vetted the original Nature paper and stand by the peer-reviewed results &#8212; the authors’ many contributions to chip design have already helped us design more energy-efficient and useful AI hardware. We&#8217;ve open-sourced this work for the external research community, and multiple teams continue to advance this important area of research.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/">Anna Goldie</a>, one of the corresponding authors of the paper and formerly a researcher at Google Brain, pointed us to <a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/home/statement">a statement</a> she issued in March with first author <a href="http://azaliamirhoseini.com/">Azalia Mirhoseini</a>, also a former Google researcher.</p>



<p>They noted, among other things:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our [reinforcement learning] method has been used in production for multiple generations of Google’s flagship AI accelerator (TPU), including the latest, and chips with layouts generated by our method have been manufactured and are currently running in Google datacenters.</p>



<p>Being physically manufactured at sub-10 nm is a level of validation that goes far beyond what is present in almost any paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair also took issue with Kahng&#8217;s preprint, which they said &#8220;mischaracterizes&#8221; their work for a number of reasons laid out in their statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; they added, &#8220;we believe that this is just the beginning and that learning-based methods for chip design will have profound impact on both hardware and machine learning itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bigfoot-loch-ness-monster-data-pseudoscience">Seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster? Data suggest the odds are low</a></h4>

              
                <p>There were drones, there were boats. There were spotters on land and a hydrophone listening for suspicious sounds underwater. In what may have been the biggest search of its kind in 50 years, crowds of people gathered this summer in Scotland to hunt for any sign of a legendary creature: the Loch Ness Monster.</p>



<p>Nearly 6,000 kilometers away, data scientist Floe Foxon emailed the event’s organizers and wished them good luck. “I’m sure it’s going to be a fun weekend,” he said. Foxon wasn’t joining them, but from his home office in Pittsburgh, he has examined Nessie’s lore in his own way — with statistics.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In July, Foxon published a study on <a href="https://xbio.jmir.org/2023/1/e49063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the probability of finding a giant eel in the loch</a>, one of many hypotheses for sightings of the storied sea monster. The answer: Essentially zero. Even the chances of finding a 1-meter-long eel are low, about 1 in 50,000, Foxon reported in <em>JMIRx Bio</em>. But once you get much longer than that — into monster-sized eel territory — the probability plummets.</p>



<p>But don’t call Foxon a myth buster or a debunker. “Absolutely not,” he says. “I think you should approach these things with an open mind and let the data influence your decision-making.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though monsters have captured Foxon’s imagination, his background is in physics, and by day, he’s a data analyst for a health consulting firm. In his free time, he flits through far-flung fields of science, including astronomy, paleontology and cryptology, the study of ciphers. “When you learn data science,” Foxon says, “you find that it can be applied to more or less anything.” Even monsters.</p>



<p>For his Nessie study, Foxon analyzed the mass distribution of eels caught in Loch Ness and other freshwater bodies in Europe. He converted that data to eel length and then calculated the odds of finding eels of different sizes. And in a separate monster study posted online July 20 at biorXiv.org, Foxon looked at data on Big Foot sightings and black bear populations across the United States and Canada. As <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.14.524058v4.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of black bears in a region goes up, Bigfoot sightings tend to increase as well</a>, he found. That doesn’t tell you whether Bigfoot is real, though, Foxon says. “You can’t answer that sort of question without a specimen.” Instead, he thinks about it from a probability standpoint. If you think you’ve seen a sasquatch, he says, it’s probably just a bear.</p>



<p>But people claiming glimpses of Bigfoot or other extraordinary beasts probably aren’t hoaxers, Foxon says. “Most people are very earnest and honest about having an experience that they personally cannot explain.” He thinks scientists should listen to them and take them seriously.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="391" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline.jpg" alt="A photo from 1967 supposedly showing Bigfoot." class="wp-image-3131689" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline-666x383.jpg 666w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline-323x186.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131689">Black bears may account for many supposed sightings of Bigfoot. This image depicts the purported creature from footage shot in 1967.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131689">Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin, Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Off the top of his head, Foxon can rattle off the names of supernatural attractions he’s visited around the world, from a museum of curiosities in London to the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Sutton, W. Va. He’s even been boating on Loch Ness (though no sign of Nessie).</p>



<p>Foxon considers his study of sea monsters, sasquatches and other mythical beings folk zoology. He describes the field as the intersection between zoology and indigenous knowledge of animals in folklore. Though Foxon’s work has roots in cryptozoology, which once used the tools of science to investigate mysterious animals, that field has since been “overrun by a lot of pseudoscience,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s not so much the monsters that pushed the field to the fringe, though. Foxon, for instance, investigates all sorts of cryptic creatures, including giant snakes and a hypothetical aquatic animal dubbed Champy, reported to live in North America’s Lake Champlain. But his quest for answers takes a strictly scientific tack that relies on established mathematical methods.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not what you study, it’s how you study it,” says Charles Paxton, a statistician and fish biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who has published papers on the Loch Ness Monster. Still, when people find out what Paxton studies, some assume he’s a pseudoscientist. “That’s quite frustrating, actually,” he says. “The methods of science can be more widely used than people might think.”</p>





<p>Foxon’s latest study, posted online August 8 at biorxiv.org, uses a statistical method to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.07.552261v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examine eyewitness sightings of a long extinct bird, the New Zealand moa (Dinornithiformes)</a>. Though scientists think the ostrichlike bird went extinct hundreds of years ago, people have reported seeing moa as recently as the 1990s. In an analysis that factored in the reliability of 97 separate moa sightings, Foxon estimated that moa probably were extinct by 1770.</p>



<p>“I’m greatly disappointed by all of my findings,” Foxon says with a laugh. “I really wish that there was a giant eel in Loch Ness,” or a hairy apelike monster in North America’s woods or moa living in modern times, he says. But “there seems to be a very, very low probability.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-renaming-magellanic-clouds">Astronomers call for renaming the Magellanic Clouds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Names have significance, especially when they’re written in the stars.</p>



<p>A group of astronomers is coalescing around an idea to rename two neighbors of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.</p>



<p>Named after explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the satellite galaxies are visible with the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere. But Magellan&#8217;s name is not fitting, astronomer Mia de los Reyes and colleagues argue. The leader of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-circling-globe-has-evolved-500-years-since-magellan-voyage">first expedition to successfully circle the globe</a>, Magellan enslaved and killed Indigenous people encountered on the voyage, which set out from Spain in 1519 (<em>SN: 9/17/19</em>).</p>





<p>“Because we’re naming things in the night sky, which belongs to everyone, we think that it’s important to have names that reflect all of humanity,” says de los Reyes, of Amherst College in Massachusetts. She <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls for the name change</a> in an opinion piece published September 12 in <em>Physics</em>. Magellan’s voyage helped pave the way for Spanish colonialism in South America, Guam and the Philippines, says de los Reyes, who is Filipino American. “Many people see Magellan as a villain in the Philippines.”</p>



<p>The Magellanic clouds loom large in the field of astronomy. They’re independent galaxies, but close enough that astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magellanic-clouds-star-formation-birth-galaxy">can observe the individual stars</a> within (<em>SN: 4/1/22</em>). “The Magellanic Clouds are this amazing laboratory for seeing things up close and personal,” says astronomer Sally Oey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, a supporter of the name change.</p>



<p>Magellan wasn’t an astronomer. The clouds were noted by a member of his expedition, but they were already well-known to many cultures in the Southern Hemisphere, and even to previous European explorers. “It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have them named after any one person, let alone a person who never actually studied them,” says astronomer Gurtina Besla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>The galaxies have been known scientifically by Magellan’s name <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since only the end of the 19th century</a> — well after Magellan’s voyage. That’s just a blip in the history of astronomy, the researchers argue.</p>



<p><a></a>More than 100 astronomers have expressed interest in the campaign, anchored by a core group of about 50, de los Reyes says. The group aims to bring the proposal to the International Astronomical Union, in hopes of eventually holding a vote on the name change. Other fields of science are undergoing similar debates, with groups of researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">pushing to revise offensive names for certain plants and animals</a>, for example (<em>SN: 8/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>The astronomers are now trying out new names.&nbsp; One popular suggestion is to call them the “Milky Clouds.” That would maintain the commonly used acronyms, LMC and SMC. And it would reflect the galaxies’ connection to something much bigger than any one person — the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/future-of-collaboration/">This Peer Review Week, PLOS looks ahead to a future of cooperation and collaboration at all levels of scholarship and scholarly communications</a></h4>

              
                <p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Peer Review Week 2023 will focus on Peer Review and the Future of Publishing. At PLOS, we envision a future in which researchers, institutions, and organizations collaborate fluidly across disciplines and distances. A future of team science, collaborative peer review, multidisciplinary research, and collaboration between researchers in different regions, institutions, and even with the public. We believe Openness and collaboration work hand-in-hand. By removing the walls around research we can improve equity and discoverability, facilitate connections that lead to more innovative approaches, accelerate discovery, and support rigor and reproducibility. The end result is better for science, and society.</p>



<p>And we&rsquo;re not alone. In celebration of Peer Review Week, we asked our community what they think about collaboration, community, and the future of publishing and peer review. Here is just a little of what they had to say.</p>



<h2>International collaboration is key to addressing big global challenges</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Many of the most significant challenges facing our planet&mdash;such as climate change, biodiversity decline, and land degradation/desertification&mdash;require that scientists from different countries work together collaboratively.&nbsp; As an example, COVID19 saw almost unprecedented levels of international scientific cooperation (often on very short and urgent timeframes), where scientists shared knowledge, data, and findings relevant to understanding and treating an emerging issue where we had very little information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>International cooperation amongst scientists remains no less urgent today, as we move towards critical points in our ability to provide the evidence to (hopefully) support real change and decision-making in addressing these challenges at the global level. This is, of course, a central driver of the efforts to achieve Open Science.&nbsp; In making scientific findings more accessible (and hopefully understandable) to a wider audience, we also hope to better support international scientific collaboration.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Transparent, collaborative peer review builds trust</h2>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been puzzled by the closed and opaque nature of peer review. If it serves as a community and public scrutiny mechanism, then why should it transpire in isolation, behind closed curtains?</p>



<p>I therefore greatly support experimentation with and evaluation of transparent, open and collaborative review models, which hold the potential to strengthen scholarly communication, fostering greater collegiality and fairness.&rdquo; </p>



<p><em>Serge P.J.M. Horbach, Sociologist of science at Aarhus University</em></p>

<h2>When it comes to multidisciplinary research communication is key</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Working in multidisciplinary teams in biomedical research requires effective communication and bridging diverse perspectives, necessitating a deep understanding of each other&rsquo;s terminology. Harmonizing diverse voices and integrating varied viewpoints enables efficient project design, ensuring every piece contributes to the overarching aim.&rdquo;</p>



<p><em>Natascha Drude, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at Charit&eacute; &amp; BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="300" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-214x300.jpg" alt="Photo of Natascha Drude" class="wp-image-21661" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-214x300.jpg 214w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-732x1024.jpg 732w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-1463x2048.jpg 1463w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI.jpg 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"><figcaption>Natascha Drude</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Diverse perspectives generate stronger feedback and help us see our work in a new light</h2>



<p>&ldquo;There is no single good/best way to write. That&rsquo;s one principle we emphasize from the beginning, so we are effectively obligated to provide students with diverse writing coaches who come from different areas of science and who have different (sometimes strikingly different) habits and practices in writing. We all enjoy our collaboration very much, which is good because the retreat would be ineffective without that diversity.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Other researchers may have pieces of the puzzle you are trying to solve</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Mapping neural circuits requires a singular drive to complete a particular part of the brain you&rsquo;re focusing on. When done, you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised that your work is worth far more than expected. Turns out, neurons mapped by others elsewhere in the brain reach out and synapse with the ones you&rsquo;ve mapped. These synapses let you make sense of the structure of your neural circuits of interest&mdash;now you know its inputs and outputs&mdash;and enables others to likewise enrich their analysis. A huge win-win.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Collaboration isn&rsquo;t just useful for research&mdash;it helps in skills-building too</h2>



<p>&ldquo;[In our writing workshops] we intentionally create groups so that, as much as possible, people are working on similar things (manuscripts, grants, fellowships, job applications, etc.) and are from very different subdisciplines. There&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers what you do well when writing, and there&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers in different subdisciplines what might be confusing in your writing.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Researchers aren&rsquo;t the only ones</h2>



<p>Just like the researchers we serve, we&rsquo;re not doing it alone, but through collaboration with like-minded partners. Partners like <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">CSHL</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">EarthArXiv</a>, who enable us to integrate facilitated preprint posting directly into our submission system, so authors can share their work on their own timeline with ease. Or protocols.io, who co-developed and co-host <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">Lab Protocols</a>, an article type that leverages protocols.io&rsquo;s optimized platform and <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s publishing platform to publish step-by-step protocols in a peer reviewed scholarly journal, without sacrificing utility. Or the Einstein Foundation, with whom we work to recognize <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-partners-with-einstein-foundation-berlin-on-award-for-promoting-quality-in-research/">rigor, reliability, robustness and transparency</a> in research.</p>

<p>Set to launch in Autumn 2023, <em>BMC Methods</em> will be the first Springer Nature open access, peer reviewed journal that will focus on providing updates in methods and lab protocols across various scientific disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, computational and biomedical sciences. In line with BMC’s ethos the journal will champion open science, supported by <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review </a>and <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/open-data">open data policies</a>.</p>
<p>In a world where innovation and transparency are paramount, <em>BMC Methods</em> will serve as a valuable resource for researchers who seek to enhance their experimental techniques, improve study reproducibility, and stay informed about the latest advancements in methodology.</p>
<blockquote><p>At <em>BMC Methods</em> our mission is clear: to facilitate the dissemination of experimental procedures, novel techniques, and innovative methodologies in the natural sciences field to elevate the quality and rigour of scientific research.</p></blockquote>
<p>The journal welcomes submissions of both lab protocols and methodology articles. We particularly welcome lab protocols that have a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive explanations for each step. We’re very happy to receive submissions with links to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or from pre-print servers. Our goal is to empower fellow researchers to replicate and build upon your work. As with other <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals">BMC Series journals</a>, <em>BMC Methods</em> does not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. However, submissions to <em>BMC Methods</em> should directly address questions within their respective disciplines as we want to publish methods that contribute to meaningful scientific advancements. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate their method&#8217;s performance compared to existing approaches to allow the scientific community to gauge the true impact and advantages of the work. We are open to manuscripts that explore the theoretical foundations of methods and propose enhancements or optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Join us on this exciting journey!</strong></p>
<p><em>BMC Methods</em> aspires to be more than just a journal; our goal is to build a community of scientists dedicated to advancing the scientific method. Efforts are now underway to recruit an international Editorial Board with broad and diverse expertise. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey towards greater transparency, reproducibility, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-infected-covid-19-exhale">Here’s how much coronavirus people infected with COVID-19 may exhale</a></h4>

              
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through the air. But just how much virus people breathe out over the course of infection isn’t well-defined.</p>



<p>To pin the numbers down, olfactory researcher Gregory Lane and colleagues analyzed over 300 breath samples from 43 people with COVID-19, following them for nearly three weeks. Levels varied between and within individuals, but some people shed a lot, releasing over 800 copies of viral RNA per minute at times.</p>



<p>On average, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participants breathed out 80 copies per minute</a> for a full eight days after symptoms began, the team reports September 8 in a preprint posted at medRxiv.org. Only after that point did the viral particles drop to nearly undetectable levels.</p>





<p>Lane, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, and colleagues still need to confirm what percentage of that exhaled viral RNA comes from viruses that can still replicate in another person’s body. And scientists don’t yet know how much virus is required for infection.</p>



<p>But, based on the new data, the team estimates that a high shedder could potentially exhale enough virus to infect someone in a closed space in about 20 seconds, making even elevator rides risky. With an average shedder, infection could take a little under four minutes.</p>



<p>The new study, which will be published in <em>eLife</em>, provides valuable information that both nasal swab studies and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-detect-coronavirus-air">one-time aerosol experiments</a> cannot, says infectious diseases researcher Kristen Coleman (<em>SN: 7/16/23</em>).&nbsp; Swabs sample only one part of the respiratory tract. And many aerosol experiments measure the amount of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">virus people spewed while talking, singing or reading aloud</a>, as well as while while breathing, at just a single point during infection <em>(SN: 08/17/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Lane’s team devised a simple and cheap tool — essentially a plastic mouthpiece attached to a closed tube — that participants took home with them and breathed into for 10 minutes at a time. That allowed the team to easily collect samples over an extended period of time and track how emissions changed during infection.&nbsp;But the makeshift tool lacks the precision of advanced machines in laboratories and hospitals, says Coleman, of the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. Even the spike of 876 viral RNA copies per minute seen in the new study may be an underestimate by several orders of magnitude, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, those who reported more severe symptoms tended to emit more virus. Yet even asymptomatic people or those with mild cases breathed out substantial amounts of viral RNA. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people exhaled similar levels.</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people who are mildly ill or asymptomatic isolate for at least five days and then mask for another five. Lane would offer different advice: “If my friends or family asked me, I’d say you should isolate through day eight.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541702899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Fragile Moment</a><br><em>Michael Mann</em><br><em>PublicAffairs, $30</em></p>



<p>Over four millennia ago, in the final days of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, a drought swept over the region, afflicting lands as far away as Greece and what’s now Pakistan. Probably driven by the eruption of a distant volcano, the drying climate devastated local agriculture. A contemporary text, <em>The Curse of Akkad</em>, noted that “the large arable tracts yielded no grain … the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, thick clouds did not rain.”</p>





<p>As once-prosperous farmlands collapsed in the northern part of the empire, people fled to the south. The southern Akkadians’ response? Build a more than 150-kilometer-long wall between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, barring entry to any migrants. Soon after, history’s first empire crumbled, dying of thirst in the cradle of civilization.</p>



<p>Climate systems and civilizations are stable only up to a point. In <em>Our Fragile Moment</em>, climate scientist Michael Mann reminds us that today we are pushing the limits of both.</p>



<p>In the book, Mann looks back at episodes of global climate change over the last 4.5 billion years, from eras of deadly heat to wastelands of widespread ice. With each instance, he draws out lessons about what happens to Earth in periods of changing climate. Sometimes, the result is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-activity-convicted-permian-extinction">dramatic mass extinctions</a> or geologic upheavals (<em>SN: 8/28/15</em>). Other times, as with the Akkadians, it’s societal collapse.</p>



<p>Earth’s climate system includes regulating forces that tend to buffer against small shifts in climate; ice caps and low clouds reflect sunlight and help cool the planet, for instance. But pushed too far, regulating forces can be overwhelmed, causing the climate to spiral out of control.</p>



<p>This was the case 55 million years ago. As a steady set of volcanic eruptions spewed carbon dioxide into the air, Earth warmed. The heat may have contributed to thinner and less reflective clouds. This in turn would have made the planet even hotter. Eventually, the low-lying clouds disappeared, and average global temperatures soared to 32° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit) in what is referred to as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eocene-temperature-spike-caused-half-much-co2-once-thought">Hothouse Earth</a> (<em>SN: 11/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>Today, with unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, we may face a similar, though less sweltering, spiral with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">disappearance of our reflective ice caps</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>But what makes current climate change different is its source — humankind — and our ability to stop it. This is a benefit that is unique to our changing climate. It comes with blame, but it also comes with agency.</p>



<p>That agency is an important source of hope for Mann. Melting ice caps could raise sea levels and displace some 40 percent of the global population. Rising <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">heat could make swaths of the planet uninhabitable</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/20</em>). But if we act, we can preserve a world that looks much like ours. The limit is not geologic or even technological, Mann argues; it is political.</p>



<p>Despite the far-reaching themes Mann weaves throughout the book, it may not be for everyone. There is a strong academic bend to the writing, which leans heavily on jargon. The book also features a dizzying parade of researchers, and Mann often emphasizes his connection to climate researchers and events, at one point reminiscing about how he “was known as a bit of a statistics guru.” The technical terms, acronyms, initialisms and self-referential tangents can distract from the book’s broader arguments and message.</p>



<p>Even though Mann’s dedication to precise academic language comes at the expense of some clarity, climate buffs will appreciate the deep dives into the scientific process. Many of the dense sections reward the reader with a satisfying tidbit of fascinating information or an illuminating insight. On occasion, I laughed out loud at Mann’s puns, jokes and barbs. (A reference to <em>The Princess Bride</em>’s ROUSs — Rodents of Unusual Size — landed particularly well.)</p>





<p>After journeying through the past, Mann brings us to the present and looks toward the future. Though past climates may offer lessons, those lessons only go so far. We are unlikely to bring about another Hothouse Earth, but the climate is warming faster than it has in millennia, thanks to human actions. If current climate policy holds, the best scientific predictions show things will be painful, but civilization won’t end. But climate scientists are not oracles. They can’t be sure. </p>



<p>That uncertainty, rather than being a cause for complacency, should spur us to action, Mann argues. “The impacts of climate change, no doubt, constitute an existential threat if we fail to act,” Mann concludes. “But we <em>can</em> act. Our fragile moment can still be preserved.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/code-policy-interview/">How does mandated code-sharing change peer review?</a></h4>

              
                <p>On March 31 2021, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new journal requirement: mandated code sharing. If the research process included the creation of custom code, the authors were required to make it available during the peer review assessment, and to make it public upon the publication of their research article&mdash;similar to the longstanding data sharing requirement for all PLOS journals. The aim, of course, is to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">improve reproducibility and increase understanding of research</a>.</p>



<p>At the end of the year-long trial period, code sharing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">had risen from 53% in 2019 to 87%</a> for 2021 articles submitted after the policy went into effect. Evidence in hand, the journal Editors-in-Chief decided to make code sharing a permanent feature of the journal. Today, the sharing rate is 96%.</p>

<p>In addition to increasing reproducibility, <em>Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s mandated code policy has had other, unexpected impacts on the journal process and publication stream. In advance of Peer Review Week we caught up with the senior editorial team, Editors-in-Chief Felim Mac Gabhann and Jason Papin, and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Virginia Pitzer to get their thoughts on the experience, and changes observed at the journal.</p>



<h6><strong>Please tell us a bit about </strong><strong><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></strong><strong> and your roles there.&nbsp;</strong></h6>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700-300x280.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-21616" width="300" height="280" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700-300x280.jpg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Feilim Mac Gabhann, Johns Hopkins</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>is a leading journal in the field of Computational Biology, both for sharing new research results and for describing and disseminating novel methods and software tools. In addition, our journal continues to be a leader in open science (OS), driven by our mission and by our community to, for example, increase the sharing of code used in the studies we publish. As Editors-in-Chief, we provide support and guidance for the editors, reviewers, and authors that make our journal possible. One of our roles is to nurture and broaden the best practices in our field so that the studies we publish can have the highest likelihood of re-use and reproducibility.</p>



<h6><strong>Why is OS/code sharing important to your journal specifically?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Code is an integral part of the research process for all those who publish in our journal and I would say increasingly integral to all research in biology. For research to truly be &ldquo;open&rdquo; and reproducible, we need to know how scientists arrive at the conclusions that are drawn, and where code is a necessary part of that research process, it becomes imperative that the code be shared to evaluate the results and subsequent conclusions.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: That&rsquo;s right, code is every bit as much a key research reagent as an antibody or plasmid would be for experimental work&mdash;and as a research reagent, it should be available for sharing, validation, and reuse. Other researchers should be able to trust it and be able to build upon it in future studies.</p>



<h6><strong>What are the implications of code sharing to the future of peer review?</strong>&nbsp;</h6>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="253" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21614" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1024x864.jpeg 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-768x648.jpeg 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1536x1295.jpeg 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-2048x1727.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Jason Papin, University of Virginia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Peer review will need to account for code as it does for all reported methods in a paper. Where reported research does not have proper experimental controls or an experimental design does not properly account for the key characteristics of a method, peer review becomes a necessary part of a process of correction and refinement. Similarly, as the code is evaluated during peer review, it can be corrected and refined in a way that improves the scientific contribution.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: Sharing can also potentially shorten the cycles of review&mdash;for example, where previously a reviewer might have to ask particular questions to probe methods, algorithms, parameters and more, now they can go directly to the code to find what they need and potentially even run the code themselves.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As code sharing becomes a standard part of the peer review process, it will enhance the reproducibility of computational biology research. If a reviewer finds they cannot understand or run the code underlying an analysis, it will compel the authors to be clearer in their approach and sharing of necessary resources.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you noticed any changes to how editors or reviewers handle peer review since code policies have been introduced? For example, has there been an increase in desk rejects?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Reviewers certainly are much more deliberate in judging whether there is sufficient code with the submission to reproduce the reported results, and editors will desk-reject papers when code is not provided. But most of the time when an editor or reviewer notes the absence of code, the authors are notified and can readily provide the requested code. I believe the code sharing policy is very much in the ethos of the journal and consequently rarely is the request a surprise to the authors.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: There has not been an increase in desk rejects, but rather an increased ability of the editors to require that code be shared before a manuscript moves forward; and an increased likelihood that authors think about this code sharing before submission. Most of our authors, as members of our Computational Biology community, are in favor of increased sharing and intend to share their code; having the requirement up front helps the authors to get this done earlier instead of relying on post-publication sharing.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you seen changes in behavior to the definition of authorship as a result, such as lab technicians or programmers who assist in cleaning up code receiving credit? Would you like to?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: We certainly encourage authorship to include all those who contributed to the study that is being published. We see the sharing of code, and improving code to increase re-use and reproducibility, as central to a good computational process and study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Pitzer-YSPH-headshot.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21617" width="220"><figcaption>Virginia Pitzer, Yale School of Public Health</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think at this point, most code is written by one of the lead authors, since it is integral to the analysis. But that may change as it becomes more common for labs to hire people who specialize in programming, and as increasingly diverse or complex datasets come into common use &ndash; this is particularly true for my own work in epidemiology.</p>



<h6><strong>What were the top lessons or surprises each of you learned in implementation among stakeholders?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: I think that the response to implementation shows that the requirement for code sharing really reflected the goals and interests of the authors, and that instituting the requirement just encouraged or facilitated the authors to follow through on what they already wanted and intended to do. The outcome has been a continued increase in code sharing, even above the already-high baseline of code sharing in our field.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think reviewers and editors have been nearly universally supportive of the policy. Authors have occasionally questioned aspects of the policy, but there are usually simple clarifications that assuage any concerns. For example, the journal helps authors navigate concerns around code sharing and protected intellectual property or code that involves protected health information.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think there is still quite a bit of variation in how in-depth reviewers will go in reviewing the code. But now at least most reviewers will check that the code is provided, whereas others may do a more thorough review and actually try to run the code.</p>



<h6><strong>Do you think Computational Biology&rsquo;s policy has influenced data/code sharing outside of PLOS? What would wider adoption of the policy look like to you?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As an author, I have become more conscientious about sharing my code regardless of what journal I am submitting to and whether or not they have a code-sharing requirement. I think others are also seeing this as a standard part of the publication process.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: While code has always been a key component of our journal&rsquo;s papers, in recent years we can see that codes, whether for data analysis, complex visualization, or other uses, has become a much more common part of papers in all areas of biology and other sciences. There is no reason that the policy would not benefit all fields just as it has ours. The hard part &ndash; writing the code &ndash; has already been done by the authors; and sharing code is now so easy through free publicly available websites. So wider adoption of this policy would benefit the reproducibility and reuse of code throughout science, without imposing substantial additional effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>What changes in a manuscript submission system (MSS) would facilitate better code sharing, and how might this be a barrier with our current publishing tools?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: It would be helpful if the MSS could have a required field in which authors provide the link to the code depository, rather than having this only included within the manuscript itself.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>As an evolving policy, where would you like code sharing to go &mdash; what are the next steps, or dream next steps, both for your journal and more widely?</strong>.</h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: The policy empowers the editors and reviewers to do what they already wanted to do, which is review code and encourage sharing of code. Moving the requirement up front in the review process is essential for adoption; a post-review requirement is simply too difficult and time consuming, and doesn&rsquo;t reflect the realities of our busy scientific lives.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think we would like to see the policy evolve to involve measures of reproducibility; there&rsquo;s a difference between sharing code and sharing code usable code, however the burden on the author to make it usable would likely be a limiting factor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first book of a Yale professor of Chinese history contains a “multitude of problems,” according to a no-holds-barred review published last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674270954"><em>Uncertainty in the Empire of Routine: The Administrative Revolution of the Eighteenth-Century Qing State</em></a><em> </em>appeared last August from Harvard University Press. Its author, <a href="https://history.yale.edu/people/maura-dykstra">Maura Dykstra</a>, is now an assistant professor of history at Yale.</p>



<p>In an extensive <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/article/was-there-an-administrative-revolution/AD2E74A82073AAEAA5105E946BA17823">review</a> that appeared in the <em>Journal of Chinese History</em> on August 31, <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/gqiao">George Qiao</a>, an assistant professor of history and Asian languages and civilizations at Amherst College in Massachusetts, wrote that Dykstra’s book “fails to meet basic academic standards” and is “filled with misinformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book’s problems, according to Qiao, include typos, as well as: </p>



<span id="more-127909"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>flawed conception, numerous factual blunders, failure to engage existing scholarship, problematic choice of primary sources, and dubious citation practices.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, he wrote, “the book systematically misrepresents the majority of its primary sources to support an untenable thesis.” Another academic said it “might be the most brutal academic book review I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>Qiao declined to comment, citing the sensitivity of the matter within the field and his lack of tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dykstra told us she would publish a response in the same journal, likely in the January issue, and declined to comment further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/uncertainty-in-the-empire-of-routine-an-interview-with-maura-dykstra/">blog post</a> on the website of the Association for Asian Studies soon after the book’s publication, Dykstra told an interviewer that the project had come out of feedback she had received on a manuscript based on her dissertation. She began working on what became <em>Uncertainty in the Empire of Routine</em> “since people seemed very confused by my assumptions and claims about the evolving character of late imperial administration.”</p>



<p>We reached out to the Harvard University Asia Center – the book is in its monograph series – to ask about the review process the manuscript had undergone before publication, which would typically involve sending it to <a href="https://asiacenter.harvard.edu/publications/information-for-authors/preparing-manuscript-peer-review">two experts for feedback</a>. Kristen Wanner, director of the publications program, told us:&nbsp;</p>

It will expedite the review process, improve accuracy, identify biases, and help in handling large volumes of submissions. However, human expertise and judgment will remain crucial in assessing the overall quality and impact of research.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; ChatGPT-3.5</span></p>
<p>For many of us, conversations surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) seem inescapable. For some others, the thought of “let me ask ChatGPT about this” has become routine. Seemingly, AI has filtered into our everyday lives, a scientific innovation with an indiscriminate impact on the way we conduct scientific research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with language processing and generation. Under this hierarchy, LLMs are a specific subset of NLP, which draws upon huge training datasets (of typically a billion parameters or more) to generate text, summarize and answer questions. Examples of commonly known LLMs include OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5 or -4, Microsoft’s Bing Chat and Google’s Bard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As described in a recent </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> review, we are already seeing the multifaceted ways AI can be used to aid scientific discovery. From generating hypotheses to designing experiments, we have barely scratched the surface of harnessing this versatile tool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">While much of the discussion has covered the potential benefits AI may bring, we are increasingly seeing concerns about the risks AI may carry. Echoing the plot of a dystopian sci-fi, some news outlets have gone so far as to state that this technology may pose an </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524"><span style="font-weight: 400">existential threat to humankind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Parallel with the rising use of LLMs, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">scientific publishing and academia are not absent from this nervous discourse, with much of the discussion focused around the use of AI tools in generating paper publications and peer review reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Computer-assistance is not a novel concept in scientific publishing. Automated systems have long been integrated into the process to scan references, inspect manuscripts for plagiarism and check their compliance with journal policies. However, the capacity of AI to expand the volume and type of tasks that can be automated poses several risks that could disrupt the peer review system: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLM-generated ‘peer review’ reports are at risk of error: its ability to conflate different sources of information can lead to inaccurate and misleading information (LLM developers refer to this phenomenon as ‘hallucination’).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although a powerful tool for processing and summarizing facts about the world, as their output is limited to the training data they are given, LLMs are not yet able to generate original information: this means that the produced reports may not necessarily be as critical as a human reviewer would be and are very rarely as insightful. They will also be subject to any biases inherent in the data they are fed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Developers and creators of LLMs are often not very transparent about how their models use and retain the prompts they receive, raising concerns about intellectual property and confidentiality. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At a time when many academics already feel inundated with invitations to review a manuscript, LLMs are at risk of being misused by reviewers to rapidly generate poor quality, unhelpful reviews, thereby diminishing the value of the peer review process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such concerns have led some publishers and funding agencies such as the NIH </span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-149.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">to ban the use of AI in the peer review process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While these measures are expected and perhaps advisable as we come to better understand how to work with LLMs, we should not ignore their potential to help peer reviewers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLMs have the potential to support reviewers as writing assistants in assembling constructive and easily readable reports </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">With more than 90% of indexed scientific articles being published in English, English-speaking researchers are at an advantage in science communication, and the use of LLMs could help democratize peer review by allowing researchers who are not fluent English speakers to communicate science in English more effectively. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the risks of bias in LLM persist, the potential biases, judgments and subjectivity inherent in manual reviewing can be minimized by using these tools. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A significant amount of research requires multidisciplinary scrutiny. LLMs could accelerate the assessment of aspects of papers that require significant time, energy and expertise (such as statistical validity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a complementary tool to one&#8217;s own work, LLMs could expand on the existing human reviewers’ report by providing additional insights and context. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scientific peer review has long been considered the gold standard for ensuring the quality and credibility of research. A way of replicating the research-focused discussions between academics that formed the foundation for the critical yet open-minded approach that defines modern scientific discovery. The use of LLMs in the scientific review process may, to some, feel like the removal of the &#8216;peer&#8217; in peer review and, as such, a threat to science in its entirety. However, if used as a tool to assist the peer review process, rather than as a standalone “robot” reviewer, LLMs could enhance both the quality and efficiency of manuscript assessment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching this goal will require a concerted effort from all parties involved in the peer review process. Reviewers who use LLMs to assist with manuscript assessment must take responsibility for the accuracy and value of the reports they submit. Authors can use LLMs to help improve their work but should avoid the trap of assuming these imperfect tools can instantly create a complete manuscript. In turn, publishers must ensure that accountability across the peer review process remains in the hands of experienced human editors. Transparency and honesty about LLMs will be vital in shaping the policies that will help usher in their use.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“AI can bring efficiency to peer review by identifying plagiarism, sorting submissions, and assessing the quality of research. However, it might also lead to job loss for human reviewers, lack of nuanced understanding, and the risk of overlooking innovative but unconventional studies. Additionally, reliance on AI may increase the risk of hacking and manipulation of review outcomes.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; ChatGPT-4.0</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The text at the top of the article was generated by ChatGPT3.5 in response to a prompt asking about the future of peer review. The text above, which provides a considerably more cautious perspective on AI, was created by the next iteration of ChatGPT. LLMs are a technology developing at an incredible pace,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and opinions on its use are likely to shift just as rapidly. Science should strive to work with, rather than against or without, AI whilst recognizing the complexity of the challenges it proposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever these developments may bring, it is important that science maintains an attitude of critical open-mindedness and adaptability in the face of new tools and developments, like science always has. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brainless-jellyfish-eyes-nerves-learn">These brainless jellyfish use their eyes and bundles of nerves to learn</a></h4>

              
                <p>For Caribbean box jellyfish, learning is literally a no-brainer.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, these animals <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01136-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned to spot and avoid obstacles</a> despite having no central brain, researchers report September 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>. This is the first evidence that jellyfish can make mental connections between events — such as seeing something and running into it — and change their behavior accordingly.</p>



<p>“Maybe learning does not need a very complex nervous system, but rather, learning is an integral part of nerve cells, or very limited circuitry,” says Jan Bielecki, a neuroethologist at Kiel University in Germany. If so, the new finding could help trace how learning evolved in animals.</p>





<p>The nervous system of a Caribbean box jellyfish (<em>Tripedalia cystophora</em>) includes four knoblike rhopalia that dangle off the bell of its body. Each rhopalium houses six eyes and about 1,000 neurons. The jellyfish use their vision to help steer between mangrove roots in the tropical lagoons where they hunt tiny crustacean prey.</p>



<p>Weaving between roots is no simple feat. Caribbean box jellyfish judge a root’s distance based on how dark it appears relative to surrounding water — that is, its contrast. In clear waters, only distant roots fade into the background, or have low contrast. But in murky waters, even nearby roots can blend into their surroundings.</p>



<p>Waters can become murky quickly due to tides, algae and other factors. Bielecki and his colleagues wondered if Caribbean box jellyfish could learn that low-contrast objects, which might at first seem distant, were actually close by.</p>



<p>The team put 12 jellyfish into a round tank surrounded by low-contrast, alternating gray and white stripes. A camera filmed the animals’ behavior for about seven minutes. At first, the jellyfish seemed to interpret the gray stripes as distant roots and swam into the tank wall.</p>



<p>But those collisions seemed to lead the jellyfish to treat the gray stripes more like close roots in murky water, and the animals started avoiding them. The jellies’ average distance from the tank wall increased from about 2.5 centimeters in the first couple of minutes to about 3.6 centimeters in the final couple of minutes. Their average bumps into the wall dropped from 1.8 per minute to 0.78 per minute.</p>



<p>“I found that really amazing,” says Nagayasu Nakanishi, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, who has studied jellyfish nervous systems but was not involved in the new work. “I never thought that jellyfish could really learn.”</p>

<p>Neurobiologist Björn Brembs views the results more cautiously, noting the small number of jellyfish tested and the variability in their performance. “I want this to be true, as it would be so very cool,” says Brembs, of the University of Regensburg in Germany. Experiments with more jellyfish could convince him that the animals really do learn.</p>



<p>In other experiments, Bielecki and his colleagues snipped rhopalia off jellyfish and placed those eye-bearing nerve bundles in front of a screen. Sort of like that scene in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, Bielecki says, except jellyfish eyes don’t have eyelids to hold open. The screen displayed low-contrast, light gray bars, while an electrode gave the rhopalia a weak electrical pulse, which mimicked the sensation of bumping into something.</p>



<p>This training caused the rhopalia to start responding to low-contrast bars that they had initially ignored. They started sending out the types of neural signals they are known to emit when a jellyfish darts away from an obstacle. This suggests that rhopalia alone can learn that seemingly distant, low-contrast obstacles are actually close enough to avoid — which, in turn, hints that the rhopalia are the Caribbean box jellyfish’s learning centers.</p>





<p>“That’s the coolest part of the paper,” says Ken Cheng, a behavioral biologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “That gets us one step down into the, you know, wiring of how it works.”</p>



<p>For neurobiologist Gaëlle Botton-Amiot, tracing learning to the rhopalia raises new questions. “They have four of these things in their bodies, so how does that work?” she asks. “How is this coordinated?” And if a jellyfish loses one of its rhopalia, does it forget everything those eyes saw and neurons learned? Or do the other rhopalia remember it?</p>



<p>Botton-Amiot’s research at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220685120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints at similar learning abilities in sea anemones</a>. Like jellyfish, they belong to a group of animals called cnidarians. “Showing that cnidarians that are so different [can both learn] means that it’s probably super widespread within them,” she says, and that perhaps their common ancestor could learn too.</p>



<p>“Maybe [learning] actually evolved multiple times in the evolution of nervous systems,” Nakanishi says. Uncovering the cellular and chemical machinery behind learning in jellyfish or other animals could shed light on this. “If there’s a lot of similarities in the mechanism of how they learn, then that would be suggestive of common ancestry,” he says. “But if they evolved independently, then you would perhaps expect very different mechanisms of learning.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx has returned bits of the asteroid Bennu to Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Seven years is a long time to wait for your carrier service to deliver a package. That’s how long it’s been since <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/osiris-rex/in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</a> set off to gather rocks and dust from the asteroid Bennu. But the package has now been safely delivered.</p>



<p>On September 24, the spacecraft flew near Earth and dropped off a capsule containing material <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">collected from Bennu</a> in October 2020 (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>This is the third mission to retrieve bits of an asteroid, and the first for NASA and the United States. The amount of asteroid material onboard this time far exceeds the micrograms that Japan’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/hayabusa-asteroid-sample-return-mission-lands-australia">Hayabusa spacecraft returned in 2005</a>, from the asteroid Itokawa, and the five grams that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">Hayabusa2 collected in 2018</a> from Ryugu (<em>SN: 6/14/10; SN: 12/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>The Bennu sample arrived with a timing and precision that would make most terrestrial delivery services jealous. After a three-year journey back from the asteroid and an initially scorching descent, the capsule released a parachute and descended to its destination at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah, touching down a few minutes earlier than scheduled at 10:52 a.m. EDT.</p>



<p>“This is a huge deal,” said NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Chief Scientist James Garvin, who was at the air force base to witness the capsule’s landing. “This is the rarest stuff we&#8217;ve ever had on Earth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The capsule will travel on to the Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston on September 25 before the sample canister is opened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the asteroid bits survived the descent, they could help reveal what sort of materials came together to build our solar system. Getting a good look at the stuff that Bennu is made of could also provide insights into the risks that nearby asteroids pose to us, in the event that they are on a collision course with Earth. The asteroid cargo may even hold clues to help answer one of the biggest questions in science — how did life begin?</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m really focused on … trying to understand if these kinds of carbon-rich asteroids may have delivered the seeds of life,” says planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission. “So we&#8217;re looking for things like amino acids, which are in our proteins, and nucleic acids,” the building blocks of the genetic instructions that make life possible on Earth.</p>



<p>Lauretta says there’s essentially no chance of finding anything alive on asteroids like Bennu. But in the collected rocks and dust, “we could really see how organic molecular chemistry can evolve before life shows up.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="414" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline.jpg" alt="An illustration of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft lightly touching down on the asteroid Bennu." class="wp-image-3131722" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline-629x383.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline-306x186.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131722">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft (illustrated lightly touching down on the asteroid Bennu)&nbsp; dropped off its sample of the asteroid in Utah after a three-year trip back home.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131722">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At an estimated 250 grams, the asteroid sample in the OSIRIS-REx return capsule is just a bit heavier than a cup of coffee. But it is a huge cache of asteroid material, as far as mission scientists are concerned. The sample size far exceeds the quantity initially hoped for, Lauretta says.</p>



<p>“We came up with 15 grams” as a reasonable sample size to analyze, he says, “which is an enormous amount of material in analytical chemistry these days.” But NASA allows Lauretta and his team to keep only a quarter of the sample for their own use. Some of the remaining portion will be distributed to scientists around the globe, with the rest reserved for future studies.</p>



<p>That meant collecting 60 grams from Bennu would have been enough to ensure that Lauretta and his colleagues had their hoped-for sample. “The fact that we got over four times that is just phenomenally successful,” Lauretta says.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recipe for an asteroid</h4>



<p>Researchers are already envisioning all they can learn from Bennu.</p>



<p>Physicist Mikael Granvik of the University of Helsinki and Luleå University of Technology in Sweden hopes analyses of the Bennu material will help reveal the potential for mining asteroids for water and raw materials that could supply future space missions.</p>



<p>The asteroid bits could also aid his investigations of how fragile some space rocks might be. “What happens to asteroids of the same type as Bennu when they get closer to the sun?” says Granvik, who is not a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. &nbsp;He and his colleagues propose that the interaction with the sun causes such “rubble pile asteroids,” made of loosely bound material, to break apart. The hypothesis could explain why there are fewer rubble pile asteroids in orbits near the sun than expected.</p>



<p>To test the idea, Granvik exposes samples to harsh conditions that approximate what it would be like near the sun, basically destroying the material. For that reason, he doesn’t expect to use any of the precious Bennu rock. Instead, Granvik hopes to learn the Bennu asteroid recipe and then order up asteroid analogs from suppliers who will blend together materials mimicking the Bennu mix. It’s an example of how the returned sample could expand research opportunities even for scientists who don’t get a share of the real thing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After a three-year trip aboard the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, a capsule containing dust and rocks from the asteroid Bennu will make a fiery plunge into the Earth’s atmosphere on September 24, as seen in this simulation. Once it releases the capsule, OSIRIS-REx will fire its jets to deflect itself onward to asteroid Apophis under the new name OSIRIS-APEX. Meanwhile, the capsule will fly toward Earth like a fireball. Although jostled during the rough descent, the sample will be protected from the intense temperatures of reentry by the capsule&#8217;s heat shield. As the capsule nears the ground, it will pop a parachute and gently drift the rest of the way down in Utah where, if all goes well, scientists can collect their long-awaited delivery.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stories Bennu can tell</h4>



<p>For planetary scientist Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland in College Park, much of the value in sample return missions is in stories asteroids can tell us about the formation of the Earth and solar system.&nbsp;“We think of them as sort of dead rocks, and they&#8217;re not. I mean, they have undergone significant evolution, both chemical and physical in the 4.5 billion years since they formed,” Sunshine says.</p>



<p>Like Lauretta, Sunshine hopes to learn how those processes ultimately led to the origins of life, but studying near-Earth asteroids is crucial for understanding the threats asteroids pose as well. “In principle, they could have given us life and they could take it away,” Sunshine says, “I mean, from the dinosaur&#8217;s perspective, they did take it away.”</p>



<p>Sunshine is member of the team that sent the DART spacecraft to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">nudge asteroid Dimorphos</a> into a new orbit to see if it was possible to push asteroids off courses that threaten Earth (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). &nbsp;“If you&#8217;re worried about the asteroid hazard problem, we pretty much better understand what is the physical and compositional variability of all these things that might hit us,” Sunshine says. “Because depending on what they&#8217;re made of and how they&#8217;re made, it&#8217;s going to change their effect when they hit us. If they ever hit us.”</p>



<p>There may be more than bits of just Bennu in the return capsule, says astronomer Humberto Campins of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who is a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. Some highly reflective boulders on Bennu don’t match the rest of the asteroid, which is very dark. The most likely reason, Campins says, is that the bright chunks come from collisions with other asteroids.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s no guarantee, but I&#8217;m hoping that in our sample there will be some fraction, some pieces, grains that come from those other asteroids,” Campins say. Remote analyses suggest that some of the bright pieces on Bennu are a good match for the asteroid Vesta. “So we would have a sample return not just from Bennu, but from possibly from Vesta,” Campins says, “or who knows what other asteroid.”</p>



<p>Though this will be NASA’s first sample return of an asteroid, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-nabbed-spacecraft-may-be-outside-solar-system">the Stardust mission</a> in 2006 successfully returned samples of comet Wild-2, also to Utah (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Next stop: Asteroid Apophis</h4>



<p>OSIRIS-REx’s mission doesn’t end with the package delivery in Utah. “The spacecraft is still healthy,” Lauretta says. After firing a deflection maneuver, “it’s on a route to another asteroid — Asteroid Apophis,” which is about as far away from Earth as Bennu is.</p>



<p>For the extended mission, the satellite gets a new name, OSIRIS-APEX, and is set to orbit Apophis once it arrives in April of 2029, if everything goes to plan. But it won’t be bringing any more samples back to Earth. Unlike your local delivery trucks, OSIRIS-REx was designed to carry only one package and make a single delivery. After Sunday, the spacecraft’s delivery days are done.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouth-taping-trend-sleep-science-slim">Mouth taping may be a trending sleep hack, but the science behind it is slim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe TikTok showed you people putting a little tape on their lips. Or maybe Instagram served you ads for sticky mouth strips. On social media and beyond, a trend called mouth taping is keeping people’s mouths shut at night — helping them breathe through their nose.</p>



<p>Zack Ford, age 38, first tried the trend last month, after recovering from surgery for a deviated septum. Surgery improved his nasal breathing, but at night, he was still sucking air through his lips. In the mornings, Ford says, he’d wake up with a dry mouth and a scratchy throat.</p>





<p>Ford brought up mouth taping during an appointment with his doctor, who didn’t think there was harm in trying. That evening, Ford placed a small square of surgical tape over the middle of his lips and settled into bed. It was the best night’s sleep he’s had in recent memory, he says. “When I woke up, I was like, ‘Holy shit this works!’”</p>



<p>Mouth taping’s benefits have been touted for everything from the dental to the somnial. People may seal their mouths shut to prevent teeth grinding, bad breath, snoring and sleep apnea — or even to boost fitness&nbsp;or get a stronger jaw.</p>



<p>But there’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6039-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little data yet to support such claims</a>, dentist Jonathan Quigley wrote in a June 23 letter in the <em>British Dental Journal.</em> Before advising patients, Quigley, who works at a dental clinic in England, would like to see more studies and have a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Could taping the mouth improve people’s sleep?</h4>



<p>Some evidence suggests that mouth taping may have merit for helping treat at least one ailment: sleep apnea. Even here, though, the science is skimpy, and the methods are varied. From a thin strip on the lips to a black patch across the mouth, tape types and techniques can differ between people, brands and studies, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions.</p>



<p>Though popularized recently via social media and the 2020 book <em>Breath</em>, the idea of using a device to keep one’s mouth shut while sleeping isn’t all that new. For years, doctors have used chin straps to help some sleep apnea patients keep their mouths closed during continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP treatment, says Krishna Sundar, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine doctor who directs the Sleep-Wake Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People with the condition can have trouble breathing while asleep: muscles relax, the tongue flops back and soft tissues in the throat collapse, blocking the airway. CPAP is the gold standard treatment. The machine delivers air pressure via a mask worn on the face. It’s kind of like pumping up a tire, Sundar says. Turn it on, and the floppy airway inflates. If masks cover only the nose, though, air can leak out the mouth. Chin straps can keep the mouth closed and prevent air leakage. But they don’t work all that well and some people find them uncomfortable, Sundar says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="677" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg" alt="A photo of a white man lying in bed with a CPAP machine strapped to his head and covering his nose." class="wp-image-3131598" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131598">One treatment for sleep apnea is a CPAP machine, which pumps air into the nose via a face mask. Doctors sometimes pair it with a chin strap to prevent air from venting out the mouth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131598">Alina555/E+/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In sleep studies in his lab, if a person treated with CPAP is venting air through the mouth, Sundar&#8217;s team will stick a tiny strip of tape down their lips to keep them closed. “This teensy tape seems to do the job better than a big chin strap,” he says. It makes the CPAP more effective, which can help people get a better night’s sleep. Sundar calls mouth tape one of the tools in doctors’ tool kits, though he would like to see more data on how well it works.</p>



<p>One effect sleep medicine specialist Andrew Wellman has noticed is that, with people’s lips stuck together, air pumped into their noses sometimes flows into their mouths and puffs out their cheeks. “They look like they’re blowing into a saxophone,” says Wellman, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Other scientists have also observed this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9992075/#CR16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“mouth puffing” phenomenon</a>, though Wellman’s team doesn’t yet know how it affects sleep apnea. It’s not dangerous, he says, but it might wake you up.</p>





<p>He and his colleagues have combined mouth taping not only with CPAP, but also with a mandibular advancement device for treating the disorder. The device slips into the mouth like a mouthguard and pushes the lower jaw forward, pulling the tongue off the back of the throat. But the device can cause people to breathe through their mouths, potentially rendering the treatment less effective, Wellman says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202109-1050OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study of 21 people with sleep apnea,</a> Wellman’s team covered participants’ lips with clear adhesive strips made by SomniFix, a Maryland manufacturing company that supported the work. Combining the strips with the mouthguard-like device offered an improvement over the device alone, reducing the number of times people stopped breathing per hour, Wellman’s team reported in 2022. It was “a small improvement,” he points out. “We need a bigger study.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bigger trials are needed to test mouth taping’s efficacy</h4>



<p>That seems to be a common denominator of mouth taping research to date. It’s all small preliminary studies, Wellman says. “We don’t have the large clinical trials … that’s what’s missing.”</p>



<p>A 2015 study found that just a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porous patch on the mouth alone helped treat mild sleep apnea and snoring</a>. And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9498537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study last year on a different kind of tape</a> reported something similar. But these studies were tiny, with just 30 participants or less. The lack of data from larger trials means that experts’ opinions on mouth taping may be all over the map, Wellman says. “When you ask a doctor about it, you’re going to get all different answers,” he says.</p>



<p>Ear, nose and throat specialist Erich Voigt, for one, isn’t convinced mouth taping is beneficial — or even safe. The trend “definitely raises a few red flags,” says Voigt, of NYU Langone Health. He’s concerned people may impede their breathing or accidentally inhale the tape and choke, though no large studies have tracked this yet.</p>



<p>Mouth taping might be worthwhile in the right scenario, Voigt says, but he advises a cautious approach for anyone trying a new health fad from TikTok. “It&#8217;s probably a good idea [for people] to talk about it with their health care provider before just doing it themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the first part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content warning: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>On a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon in Manhattan, time froze for Jon Nelson. He stood on the sidewalk and said good-bye to his three kids, whose grandfather had come into the city from Long Island to pick them up.</p>



<p>Like any parent, Jon is deeply attuned to his children’s quirks. His oldest? Sometimes quiet but bitingly funny. His middle kid? Rates dad a 10 out of 10 on the embarrassment scale and doesn’t need a hug. His 10-year-old son, the baby of the family, is the emotional one. “My youngest son would climb back up into my wife’s womb if he could,” Jon says. “He’s that kid.”</p>





<p>An unexpected parade had snarled traffic, so Jon parked illegally along a yellow curb on 36th Street, near where his father-in-law was waiting. It was time to go. His youngest gave the last hug. “He looked up, scared and sad,” Jon says, and asked, “Dad, am I going to see you again?”</p>



<p>That question stopped the clock. “I was like, ‘Oh man,’” Jon says. “It was one of those moments where I was living it through his eyes. And I got scared for the first time.”</p>



<p>Until that good-bye, Jon hadn’t wanted to live. For years, he had a constant yearning to die — he talks about it like it was an addiction — as he fought deep, debilitating depression. But his son’s question pierced through that heaviness and reached something inside him. “That was the first time I really thought about it. I was like, ‘I kind of hope I don’t die.’ I hadn’t had that feeling in so long.”</p>



<p>That hug happened around 5 p.m. on August 21, 2022. Twelve hours later, Jon was wheeled into a surgical suite.</p>



<p>There, at Mount Sinai’s hospital just southwest of Central Park, surgery team members screwed Jon’s head into a frame to hold it still. Then they numbed him and drilled two small holes through the top of his skull, one on each side. Through each hole, a surgeon plunged a long, thin wire dotted at the end with electrodes deep into his brain. The wiring, threaded under his skin, snaked around the outside of Jon’s skull and sank down behind his ear. From there, a wire wrapped around to the front, meeting a battery-powered control box that surgeons implanted in his chest, just below his collarbone.</p>



<p>During the surgery and in the days after, doctors sent small pulses of electricity into Jon’s brain. In ways that are still unclear, this electrical tinkering changes the messages that move between different brain regions. The doctors and researchers had what seems like a bold goal: They wanted these pulses to pull Jon out of the darkness of depression.</p>



<p>Jon is one of dozens of people in the United States currently in clinical trials that aim to heal mental disorders with brain implants. The technique is called deep brain stimulation, and it’s built on the scientific premise that electrical stimulation can reset brains that are in the grip of powerful and devastating psychiatric disorders <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">such as depression</a>, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Jon describing his depression, his experience with DBS and how his mental health affects his family.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing deep brain stimulation</h4>



<p>I first heard about deep brain stimulation, or DBS, more than a decade ago, in 2010. As a science reporter, I was sitting in a cavernous conference room packed with neuroscientists in San Diego. We were listening to a presentation by <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/helen-s-mayberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Mayberg, a neurologist and neuroscientist</a> who was then at Emory University in Atlanta. As she spoke, Mayberg walked the audience through the scientific rationale for the idea that electrodes pushed down into the brain could alleviate severe depression.</p>





<p>Toward the end of her presentation, Mayberg showed a video of a woman who had severe depression. The day before the video was taken, doctors had implanted electrodes into the woman’s brain. The researchers in the video turned on the stimulation, and within a minute, just like that, the woman wanted to smile and laugh. That transformation floored me, and judging by the audience reaction, a lot of other people too.</p>



<p>In November of 2022, I caught up with Mayberg, again at a neuroscience meeting, again in San Diego. We talked about what had happened in the years since that presentation and where this research is going. It hasn’t been an easy road, says Mayberg, who now directs the Nash Family Center for Advanced Circuit Therapeutics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The science of DBS has taken lots of twists and turns.</p>



<p>So have the journeys of people who have participated in this research. To hear one of those stories, Mayberg put me in touch with Jon.</p>



<p>For this series, I talked with him and his wife, as well as three other people who had lived with severe depression and are now being treated with deep brain stimulation. These people’s paths have been incredibly tough. And while they still face challenges, they have been crystal clear about what DBS has done for them: This experimental brain surgery has given them back their lives.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The darkness of depression</h4>



<p>Jon’s a sharp, funny middle-aged guy, a self-described “character,” who lives in a picturesque small town northeast of Philadelphia. He’s a dad with three busy kids and a garage packed with hockey sticks, softball catcher pads, golf clubs, balls of all sorts, bikes, in-line skates, a mesh goal and a supercute white motor scooter. He’s a coach (hockey and softball) known for dispensing “isms” and the phrase, “I’m going to give you some life advice.” He’s a husband who worries about his wife doing too much and not taking care of herself. He’s in advertising, a people person who used to love having his friends over to hang around his fire pit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a decade, Jon let his outgoing personality carry him as he struggled to overcome his depression. His disease, and the suicidal thoughts it forced on him, grew worse in the last five years. On the outside, Jon was the hypersocial, high-functioning guy everyone expected him to be. But inside, his profound depression was a private hell, he says. “I’d be the one standing in front of everybody leading a champagne toast, and then I’d be driving home and wanting to slam my car into a tree.”</p>



<p>Jon fantasized about other deaths: A mugging, a plane crash. Until Jon’s son asked if he would see Jon again, on the evening before the procedure, Jon even nurtured a little bit of hope that he might die during the brain surgery he volunteered for.</p>



<p>Jon’s depression also stole his motivation, leaving him wrung out and isolated from his family. He overate, overslept and drank too much. His worst stretches, he suspects, left his family traumatized.</p>



<p>Talk therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ketamine, cannabis, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snap-crackle-and-feel-good">transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> (in which magnetic fields target nerve cells through the skull), several residential treatment stints, even electroconvulsive therapy, which left him with intense memory loss — none of these treatments reliably worked for him.</p>



<p>An estimated 280 million people worldwide have major depression. A subset of that giant number will ultimately fall into a hopeless-sounding diagnosis: “treatment-resistant depression” or “intractable depression.” In the United States, an estimated 2.8 million people have that diagnosis.</p>



<p>Jon is one of them. For him and his family, deep brain stimulation was a last-ditch, desperate maneuver. It was his Hail Mary.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the second part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content note: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>Jon Nelson’s depression was poison. “I had poison in every single bit of my body. It literally ran throughout every cell in my body. My blood carried the poison, and it crushed everything in me.”</p>



<p>Melancholia, one of depression’s early names, comes from the ancient Greek word for “black bile,” a diseased liquid believed to flood a body. It was once thought that bloodletting and other ways to let the corrupting fluids out could ease people’s minds.</p>





<p>Today, doctors have much better options to treat depression. Antidepressant drugs and talk therapy can be effective for many people. But these options don’t help everyone.</p>



<p>Jon has treatment-resistant depression. So does Amanda, an app and web designer and artist in her 30s who lives in New York City. Amanda can also rattle off a long list of therapies she has tried for the deep depression she’s felt since she was 13. She has been on 21 different antidepressant drugs. Her brain has been zapped with powerful magnets in a therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation. She has had IV infusions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ketamine-new-nerve-cell-connections-mice-depression">ketamine</a>.</p>

Her art, including depictions of “Cartoon Amanda,” became an escape.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131335">Courtesy of Amanda</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Amanda, who to protect her privacy requested her last name not be used, has also had 40 rounds of electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. The “gold standard” treatment for people who aren’t helped by other therapies, ECT is often done several times a week for three or four weeks. For unknown reasons, the resulting mini-seizures in the brain can sometimes provide relief.</p>



<p>“The electroconvulsive therapy helped a little bit,” Amanda says. “But for it to help, I had to do it so frequently that I got memory damage. I was like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don’t remember where my sock drawer is. I don’t remember what subway stations are near my apartment. I don’t remember how to use the software I’ve been using for 10 years,’” she told me. “I have to stop.”</p>



<p>Jon’s depression was poison; Amanda’s was a vortex. And when ECT was no longer an option, that vortex nearly consumed her. After a suicide attempt, she spent six weeks in the hospital and then another six weeks receiving outpatient care. “It was at that point that [doctors] were like, ‘There’s nothing else we can do for you. You’ve tried literally everything that’s out there. If ECT doesn’t work, that’s it,’” Amanda says.</p>



<p>As with Jon and others I talked with, her doctors had given up, Amanda says. “When you get to that place where they say there’s nothing else we can do for you, and yet you have to keep living your life, that’s a hard place to get to.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The last hope</h4>



<p>Desperate for help, Amanda called the <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/care/psychiatry/services/depression-anxiety-disorders/trd-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment-resistant depression program at Mount Sinai</a>. After describing all of her unsuccessful treatments, Amanda was once again passed along to different doctors. “They had decided that you really have tried everything,” she says.</p>



<p>That last handoff is what delivered Amanda to the DBS research program. As Martijn Figee, a psychiatrist and DBS researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, explained the procedure, the research and the risks, Amanda listened carefully. She arrived at appointments prepared with an eight-page-long list of questions that covered the practical (“What should I avoid forever once I have it? Running? Hanging my head upside down? Trampolines?”) and the profound (“What makes a person want to be alive?”). Questions answered and fully informed, Amanda agreed to have DBS surgery.</p>





<p>The DBS program that Amanda and Jon are a part of looks vastly different from earlier iterations. In 2008, neurologist Helen Mayberg and many colleagues around the country had just begun a large, double-blind DBS clinical trial to test the technique. Called the Broaden trial, the six-month study followed people with depression, some of whom had electrical stimulation on and others who were implanted with electrodes but had the stimulation off.</p>



<p>All told, 90 people with severe depression were implanted with brain stimulation devices in the trial. But in 2013, testing stopped early because of poorer-than-expected results. The sponsor and maker of the DBS device, St. Jude Medical Inc., determined that the trial wasn’t likely to hit its goals. Along with another unsuccessful trial, which included 30 people who received stimulation in a different part of the brain, those lackluster results represented a real setback for DBS as a treatment for depression.</p>



<p>Those disappointing findings fueled criticisms of the method, underscored by stories of people who had negative experiences with DBS. And potential conflicts of interest exist, as they do for many medical treatments that depend on medical device companies. Mayberg, for instance, receives fees for consulting and licensing intellectual property from Abbott Laboratories, the company that bought St. Jude Medical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite setbacks and criticism though, the research didn’t stop; it matured. Brain-imaging methods got better, allowing researchers to see exactly which highways of white matter fibers, message-sending bundles that emanate from nerve cells, are influenced by the electrodes. Other aspects of care, including follow-up sessions with mental health experts and therapists, have evolved. In a small trial of 11 people with severe depression, for instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28397839/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine had their symptoms improve</a>, researchers reported in 2018. And DBS as a depression treatment has been able to borrow heavily from progress in treating other disorders.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Amanda describing how she uses art to process her experience with intense depression and DBS.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How widespread is DBS?</h4>



<p>Globally, DBS electrodes have been implanted in an estimated 230,000 people’s brains. DBS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997 to treat tremor, and in 2002 to treat Parkinson’s disease. DBS is also used by doctors for severe cases of epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder and dystonia, or involuntary muscle contractions.</p>



<p>DBS’s reach is expanding fast. In smaller experimental trials, people have been implanted with electrodes for pain, eating disorders, addiction, traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers are working on stimulation systems to restore movement to paralyzed people and speech to people unable to talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jon heard about the procedure in 2021. He called the Mount Sinai program from a residential treatment facility, only to learn that he didn’t qualify because, at the time, he hadn’t yet tried ECT. So he did 12 rounds of the therapy in early 2022. ECT helps many people. But it didn’t help Jon, and the experience shook him. “It was horrific. Zero relief. My memory loss is still pervasive to this day,” he says. It was utter misery, but he qualified for the DBS trial.</p>



<p>And with that, Jon’s surgery date was set: August 22, 2022.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the surgery, Jon’s wife, Barbara, worried about both the surgery and the outcome. “What if they slip or they sneeze and they ruin his brain?” she recalls wondering. “What if it doesn’t work? What do we do next? This was so much like the last resort that if it didn’t work, then we were going to be looking at potentially years more of trying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She adds, “And there’s no option of giving up.”</p>



<p>Even so, Barbara didn’t fully believe the surgery was going to happen until it was right around the corner. “I think my brain just did not catch up to the reality of it until we were very close to the actual surgery,” she told me. “A couple of days before, I was like, ‘Oh I’m a mess.’ I do weird things when I’m really that stressed out, rearranging furniture, doing things that seem to take too much energy.”</p>



<p>Jon, however, was not worried. “I didn’t care that I was having my head cut open,” he says. “I had the same level of anxiety that you would have if you were getting your teeth cleaned.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the third part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Early in the morning on August 22, 2022, Jon’s medical team told him that neurologist Helen Mayberg would check in with him just before his deep brain stimulation surgery. “Everybody is like, ‘Dr. Mayberg is going to come in and give you a pumped-up speech.’” She’d explain how everything ought to go and what the team needed from Jon. She didn’t disappoint, Jon says. “She came in and gave me the pep talk: ‘All I need you to do is to be present,’” she told him. “She was really adamant about that.”</p>





<p>In the middle of the surgery, the medical team woke Jon up from anesthesia. It was a hazy time, but Jon remembers it. “I’m so awake, and I was so myself,” he recalls. “Dr. Mayberg is right in your face right away, and she’s like, ‘Jon, it’s Dr. Mayberg and Dr. Figee.’ And I said, ‘Doc, I need to tell you something.’ And she was so concerned, like, ‘Yes, yes, yes?’ And I was like, ‘I’m present!’</p>



<p>“I’m just busting her chops, and she’s sitting there laughing. But that’s how completely normal you are.”</p>



<p>The day after surgery, Jon sat with Mayberg and another clinician as they began to turn on and off electrodes, searching for the pattern of stimulation that would influence nerve cells in the right way and in the right spot. Each time, Mayberg would ask him two key questions: Did he feel like walking his dog? And did he want to have friends over to sit around his fire pit? Jon’s wife, Barbara, his dad and a crowd of doctors and researchers watched a video feed of this process from an overflow room.</p>



<p>After trying a series of stimulation patterns and getting “yes” to their questions, the researchers settled on an electrical pattern, and Jon went home to Pennsylvania. “The next day, bandaged up on my head, I not only took the dog on a walk, I asked my son and my wife to come with me. I enjoyed the walk. I enjoyed the conversation. I enjoyed coming back home. I sat outside and had coffee. It’s just surreal.”</p>



<p>As we talk, about six months after his surgery, Jon has no doubt about the outcome: “Instantaneously overnight I was healed,” he says. “I have been in remission from depression since the moment they turned that on.”</p>



<p>Barbara, Jon’s wife, has seen the shift from the outside. His motivation is back, she says. He’s not as fidgety as he was. He’s easier to talk to. He cooks elaborate dinners for the family. He even looks different. When he is sick, Jon has a clammy, pale, almost puffy look to him, Barbara says. “I haven’t seen that look in six months, which is amazing,” she says. “He just looks healthier.</p>



<p>“He has the old Jon voice back. He annoys me more,” she says. “He’s a super high-energy, outgoing person, and I’m the quiet, withdrawn person who needs more time alone. I’m like, ‘Oh my God, would you just stop talking?’ That’s a good thing, though, that’s a good thing, because for a long time, he didn’t want to talk at all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Barbara and Jon got together in their early 20s, she thought Jon was the happiest and nicest person she had ever met. Now, “the person I met 20-something years ago is back,” she says. “I feel like he was lost for a long time.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Changes after DBS</h4>



<p>Jon has no shortage of words to describe his recovery.</p>





<p>Amanda, the artist in New York City, who had DBS surgery on October 20, 2022, has trouble describing the immediate change. “Maybe it was like a little spark of energy. I was more chatty. It was easier to talk to people, just because it felt like there was a little something inside pushing.”</p>



<p>Like Jon, her recovery has been incredibly fast. “I left the hospital on a Friday,” Amanda recalls. “By Sunday, I could tell it was working. By Wednesday … that’s when I got completely better.</p>



<p>“I can’t even describe the relief. I’ve never felt relief so profound in my life,” she says. “You get used to living in pain. And when the pain is all of a sudden gone, you’re like, ‘What is this?’”</p>



<p>Part of her life now includes what she calls “weird experiences” — taking pleasure in things. Candles, for instance. “I never enjoyed smells before. And now I have these candles, and they smell so good. Candles never smelled good before.”</p>



<p>A similar sentiment comes from Emily Hollenbeck, who also lives in New York City and had DBS surgery in 2021, about a year and a half before I spoke with her. When a certain pattern of brain stimulation was turned on during the surgery, she started to think about bacon. “I was tasting the bacon in my mind. I could taste that salt and the fat and the crispiness. I started to feel that sense of hunger.”</p>



<p>Her depression had taken away any anticipation of upcoming pleasure. “My mouth won’t water,” she says. “I won’t really think about it.” With the stimulation, the contrast between disinterest and intense craving was “so immediate and so strong,” she says. “That’s why it struck me.” In the days after the surgery, she also noticed she began to feel restless, like she wanted to go to the library. “I had these impulses to move, to do things, to enjoy things,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What brain areas does DBS hit?</h4>



<p>Jon, Amanda and Emily have been receiving constant brain stimulation targeted to a brain area called the subcallosal cingulate, or SCC. That’s the same area that was targeted in the Broaden clinical trial, which was stopped prematurely because of poor early results.</p>



<p>So, what’s different now?</p>



<p>Since Broaden, and armed with better brain-imaging techniques, scientists have learned a lot more about the SCC and how it connects to other parts of the brain. The area is not a uniform glob of brain tissue; it holds a confluence of diverse white matter tracts, nerve bundles that speed information to and fro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent presentation from Mayberg’s research group described the outcomes of about 50 patients from the Broaden trial, people who continued to be stimulated and monitored after the trial officially ended. It turns out that the people who got better had their electrodes implanted in a fortuitous spot in the SCC, one that hit four key white matter tracts. “It was really about targeting,” Mayberg says.</p>



<p>The SCC — and the signals it sends to other brain areas — seems to have a role in generating negative emotions, immobility, cognitive sluggishness and heavy physical feelings. Stimulating there, researchers suspect, can overwhelm those nerve cells, tiring them out and making them effectively fall silent. That silence then has ripple effects at many different levels, from single cells to entire cohorts of brain areas. Those changes, the thinking goes, somehow turn down the negative malaise.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like taking off the parking brake, allowing energy and motivation to flow once more. This aspect of the SCC’s job may explain why Jon went for a walk in the hospital halls and at home with his family, why Amanda felt a spark of energy and why Emily had an itch to get up and go to the library.</p>

The subcallosal cingulum (left) and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (right) are two current targets.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131441">S.A. Sheth and H.S. Mayberg/<em>Annual Review of Neuroscience</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But Mayberg and her colleagues at Mount Sinai aren’t the only people conducting trials on DBS for depression, nor is their target the only one under consideration. Another promising target, called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, is more involved in feelings of reward. Stimulating there may be turning up the positive as opposed to dialing down the negative. Its connections to other brain regions are extensive, perhaps even more numerous than the SCC’s.</p>



<p>Some of the big questions, says Sameer Sheth, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, are about personalizing the technique: Which patients would benefit from which target in the brain and what type of stimulation? The SCC and the VC/VS both seem promising. In a way, the debate mirrors a similar one in DBS for Parkinson’s disease, where several brain structures are possible targets. To determine where electrodes should be implanted, doctors now consider factors like how advanced the disease is, whether a patient needs to reduce their medication and if tremor is the main problem.</p>



<p>To better understand the neural circuits related to mood, Sheth and his colleagues are conducting a clinical trial for depression that is using implanted electrodes to listen in on many parts of the brain. The study is designed, in part, to uncover how various types of stimulation, pointed toward various neural spots, affect the brain. Eventually, the team hopes, this knowledge could lead to personalized stimulation — bespoke electrical patterns tailored to each person. (Sheth has received consulting fees from various medical companies, including Boston Scientific and NeuroPace, and cofounded a neurotechnology company.)</p>



<p>I talked with one of the people in this trial, a man who wanted to remain anonymous. He was the first person to undergo this massive brain eavesdropping effort by Sheth and colleagues. As such, he became Patient 001, a designation he grew fond of, he says. He traveled to Houston from New York City, where he was living at the time, and was scheduled for surgery on March 9, 2020. His surgery squeaked through, just days before all nonemergency surgeries were canceled in the area because of the growing COVID pandemic.</p>



<p>During surgery at Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston, Patient 001 was implanted with four electrode wires, two in the SCC and two in the VC/VS. He got 10 extra electrodes, too, implanted in areas connected to the SCC and VC/VS. These extras were temporary, there only to listen to his brain activity over a 10-day stay in the hospital. “I’m not going to say the 10-day stay in the hospital was a walk in the park, because it wasn’t,” he says. “But when you have nothing to lose and you’re in hell, you’ll do anything.”</p>



<p>Like Jon, Patient 001 went through a similar testing phase with his electrodes. At one point, he felt something big. “I said, ‘I don’t know what you did, but it feels like I’m online again. I’m online.’ If you think of your brain as a computer, it felt like I had a virus, and then my hard drive crashed. And all of a sudden — boom. They control all the leads, and they reboot you, and you’re OK again. I remember the doctor and the people in the OR literally laughing, like, ‘That’s a new one.’</p>



<p>“We laugh about it, but it came out of my heart,” he says. “It’s how I felt.”</p>



<p>These stories all sound remarkable, and in all sorts of ways, they truly are. The four people with depression I’ve told you about were pulled out of deep suffering and restored to themselves — for now, and for what Jon and the researchers expect will be a very long time.</p>



<p>But like any story, this one has its moments of despair.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the fourth part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content note: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>“The only thing I’ll slightly complain about — and it’s very vain — I only wish the batteries in your chest didn’t show up so much,” says Patient 001.</p>



<p>There is an intense physicality to deep brain stimulation for depression. Participants have two slight bumps on their head, wires under the skin of their neck and a battery-powered control unit implanted under the skin in their chest.</p>





<p>Because he was implanted with two sets of electrodes, Patient 001 has two battery packs, one on each side of his upper chest. He lives in a hot place near the ocean. “It just sucks I can’t take my shirt off at the beach and not be self-conscious about that.” Sometimes the devices in his chest feel alien to him when he’s going to sleep. “I put my hand on it to be comfortable,” he says.</p>



<p>Amanda has a strained relationship with the device, too. “I don’t like the idea of it. I don’t like how it feels. Every time I accidentally touch the wire in my neck, I’m like, ‘Ugh, ugh, I don’t like it,’” she says. “It’s getting better, but sometimes I can still feel that thing in my chest just sitting there.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">

<p>She also points out the annoyingly low-tech charging process, which is done with a wireless charger draped around her neck. Her charger shows only 10 percent increments, and the screen is on for only a minute before it locks up, without indicating that the charging is done. “They can get better at that part,” she says.</p>



<p>In addition to the charging, there are lots of tasks these volunteers complete as part of the research — surveys, mood ratings, video journals. Twice daily, Amanda clicks what looks like a TV remote at home to collect brain data. “I’m Bluetooth-enabled,” she says with a laugh. “I upload from the computer to the server at the hospital.” She and others also make regular trips to the lab at Mount Sinai.</p>



<p>These days, Jon takes the train from his house just outside Philadelphia to Mount Sinai so often that he knows exactly which crack in the sidewalk to stand by as he waits for his train at the New Jersey Transit station. On one of his visits to the lab, a mess of scalp electrodes were eavesdropping on his brain. The scientist doing the measurements, neuroscientist Allison Waters, mentioned that his electrode leads were zipping 130 pulses of electricity into his brain per second.</p>



<p>“She just said it off the cuff,” Jon says. Later, with his daughter, Jon did the math for a full day, doubling it for each side: “22 million, 500 thousand electrical pulses to my brain,” Jon says. “That’s what has kept me alive.”</p>



<p>During Jon’s surgery on August 22, 2022, doctors told him that his only job was to be present. After his incisions healed, he was given a new task: rehabbing his brain. Jon was initially dismissive of the new job. He already felt fantastic, cocky almost, and didn’t buy that he needed to work hard on rehab. “In the back of my head, I’m like, ‘OK, weirdos. I’m not sick. This is great. I’m good. I got this.’”</p>



<p>But about six weeks after his surgery, everything fell apart.</p>



<p>A malaise crept in, and Jon freaked out. “Oh my God, I feel it,” he said. “I feel it in my body.” He snapped right back into the habits that depression solidified: overeating, sleeping too much and hiding away from his family. “My wife, I’ll never forget it, was like, ‘Hey, we got an appointment at the school.’” But Jon told her he couldn’t make it; he was busy. It was a lie. “I didn’t have anything going on,” he says.</p>





<p>Jon knew that as part of the study protocol, around the sixth month, researchers would turn off his stimulation, a looming event that made him intensely anxious. His shift alarmed him so much that on the night of October 6, he sent an email to the Mount Sinai psychiatrist Martijn Figee to ask if his stimulation had been turned off earlier than planned. “Is there an earlier part of the program where it gets shut off too, such as now, and that is also part of the experiment?” Jon wrote. “Even if it was shut off, could you even tell me that?”<br><br>An hour and a half later, the email back was clear: “Your device is absolutely on<em>.”</em> His psychologist would address it with him at their next appointment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Relearning to live with emotions</h4>



<p>As brain implants are used more and more, the risks of DBS have become somewhat clear. Regardless of why a person is getting it or where in the brain it targets,the technique can, like any medical procedure, go sideways. Electrode leads in the brain can break; the chest controller can fail; batteries can die. Infections, in both the head and chest, are a risk, as is wire tethering, a painful condition, also called bowstringing, in which scar tissue grows around the wire in the neck.</p>



<p>DBS can also carry risks that are distinct from other surgeries. Electrical stimulation in certain parts of the brain has been linked to unwanted behavioral changes. For people receiving stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, there have been cases of gambling problems and hypersexual behavior.</p>



<p>In one unusual case, a Dutch man treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder developed a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new and intense affinity for Johnny Cash hits</a>, especially “Ring of Fire,” “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Sunday Morning Coming Down.” When his stimulations diminish or his batteries die, the man subconsciously switches back to listening to his old favorites — Dutch-language songs and classics by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.</p>



<p>People being treated with DBS for depression have experienced relapses when the device accidentally stops working, for instance due to a battery failure or a wire breaking. But that’s not what happened to Jon.</p>



<p>Worries over spiraling dark moods surface among people with DBS for depression, says psychologist Shannon O’Neill, who works with Jon and other people treated with DBS at Mount Sinai. “We often talk significantly about the difference for them of how they can distinguish between depression and normal everyday sadness,” O’Neill says. This is the rehab part, she says. People who have lived with severe depression for years need to relearn how to recognize and tolerate garden-variety emotions, including sorrow.</p>



<p>As O’Neill describes ordinary sadness, it reminds me of the analogy that emotions are like the weather. We can spend the morning under heavy cloud cover, and then maybe we luck out with a full-blast sunny afternoon. But it’s fleeting. Likewise, our feelings are impermanent, O’Neill says. “Negative emotions come and go, just like positive emotions come and go. It can be passing and not ever-present.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emily Hollenbeck, whose DBS surgery was in 2021, says her recovery took time. “You’re letting your brain relearn how to live in the world without the constant threat of severe negativity, suicidality, all of that.” She had to learn how to cope with emotions, and trust that she’ll get through bad situations. “Basically, I’m relearning how to ride the bike, you know?”</p>



<p>Understanding that these feelings are transitory — that ups and downs happen — is something people with severe depression haven’t practiced, because they hadn’t had to. They’ve been perpetually stuck under heavy cloud cover. Emerging into an emotional landscape with those ups and downs can be intensely unsettling.</p>



<p>“At first it was scary,” says Amanda, who had DBS surgery last fall. “At first I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff.” An artist, Amanda draws her experiences to help her think them through. One of her pictures shows a cartoon Amanda wearing a rainbow shirt, standing high on a ledge of bright green grass with blue sky overhead. But she’s looking over the edge to the darkness below. “I had been pulled out of this giant pit, and I was worried that I would fall back in it again.”</p>

<p>But she hasn’t. When people recover from depression with DBS, they generally stay well, several studies suggest. Between three and six years after surgery, about 60 percent of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21285143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients had sustained improvements</a>, Mayberg and colleagues reported in 2011 in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry.</em> In a longer-term study, most of a group of 28 people who had deep brain stimulation for major depression or a type of bipolar disorder <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18121427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw benefits for more than eight years</a>, the researchers reported in 2019 in the same journal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Does DBS make people happy?</h4>



<p>The idea of a machine forcing happiness on us or taking away sorrow — that kind of mind control is unsettling for most of us. We are fiercely protective of the idea that our feelings originate inside of ourselves, that we are in charge here. So the idea that artificial happiness can be created by a computer that controls electrodes in our brain hooked to wires that snake down our neck? No thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That sentiment is understandable, but it’s not what people with these implants experience. As I’ve talked with people who had lived first with devastating depression and then with these devices, I have come to think that these implants do not make a person feel artificial joy. “DBS is not going to give you happiness,” O’Neill says. Instead, “it just kind of clears the way.”</p>



<p>Overcoming misconceptions about what this technology can and can’t do is yet another burden for Jon and others. The patients I spoke with were incredibly candid about their depression and their treatment. They graciously tolerated my questions. But being open about their medical condition and treatment can exact a steep price.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the fifth part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Like many people who have struggled with a mental illness, Emily Hollenbeck had plenty of stories of people not quite getting it. One memorable instance happened as she was about to be anesthetized for an electroconvulsive therapy treatment. The anesthesiologist found out that she had a Ph.D. in psychology. “His eyes settle on me, and he goes, ‘Oh, that’s ironic.’” Her academic background should have somehow prevented her illness, he seemed to imply.</p>





<p>A palpable silence filled the room. “I remember literally biting my tongue,” she says, “being like, ‘We’re not going to sass the guy who’s injecting the propofol.’”</p>



<p>Being open about depression can bring judgment, and danger: “If you are honest about what you need for your mental health, you can suffer consequences,” says Emily, who had DBS surgery in 2021. That can include lost jobs, lost relationships and perhaps most crucially, lost health care.</p>



<p>Those consequences are why I’m not identifying Patient 001 by his name. He works in an intensely intellectual and competitive field, and with a new baby at home, he can’t risk losing business over people’s mistaken assumptions.</p>



<p>There’s stigma surrounding depression, and there’s stigma surrounding its treatments. When Patient 001 told his family he was getting experimental brain surgery, they didn’t understand. “At first, they were like, ‘You’re crazy. It’s unsafe.’”</p>



<p>In a way, their reaction tracks with people&#8217;s suspicions toward other treatments for depression, and psychiatric disorders more generally, despite the fact that they work for many people. Since their rise to prominence in the 1990s, antidepressants have caught heat from people claiming the drugs change personalities and steal emotions. Electroconvulsive therapy is still crawling back after the damage done by portrayals like in the movie <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. Even talk therapy can bring shame and secrecy.</p>



<p>So perhaps it’s not surprising that electrodes implanted into your brain raise a whole new set of assumptions, misgivings and judgments. People will live with these stigmas until society changes, until people start understanding what severe depression is like, and what treatments are like too.</p>



<p>“You’re screaming for help, and they just don’t understand,” Patient 001 tells me. “That’s probably one of the reasons I’m talking to you, even though I’m doing it anonymously. I hope one day one kid reads what you’re writing, and he finds DBS and he’s cured.”</p>



<p>Barbara, Jon’s wife, is no stranger to people’s uncomfortable reactions. “When we have told people that he has a pacemaker in his brain, basically, you get this sort of strange, ‘Oh my God,’…. They’re like, ‘What? You’re going to let them do this to you?’” There’s this assumption, she says, that the brain is somehow different from other parts of the body. The heart can also need a device that delivers electrical stimulation. So why not the brain? “It’s really interesting to see people, myself included, process that.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Barbara Nelson talking about her experience as a partner to someone with depression, and how DBS changed her family.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been wondering the same thing: What sets the brain apart, and why are people so uncomfortable with attempts to change it?&nbsp;</p>





<p>Here’s what I think. Remember the Dutch guy who <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all of a sudden loved Johnny Cash</a> after his implant was turned on? That story sounds a bit trivial. His new musical taste didn’t bother him; it’s a minor thing in the grand scheme of things. But that change, that switch, arguably bores straight to the core of our unease. So many of us, myself included, consider our brains — and the minds they create — the bedrock of our identity. So when a disease attacks the brain, or a treatment changes the brain, we get nervous.</p>



<p>None of us like the thought of having a brain implant tell us what music we like, especially if we might not be aware of it. The stakes are much, much higher when it comes to how we feel.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Does DBS change who you are?</h4>



<p>Reporting this story, I heard a lot of jokes about being a cyborg, Bluetooth-enabled, bionic. People would laugh as they said it. But I wondered if there was anything more to these offhand comments. Does this brain implant change who you are?</p>



<p>Jon kindly tells me that he understands why I’d ask. “I can only tell you that it is the exact opposite of that question,” he says. For him, DBS took away his poison. “It purely eliminates the disease…. That’s it.”<br><br>Amanda echoes the sentiment: “Nothing I’ve ever done has changed who I am or my personality,” she says, DBS included. “I’m still the same person. I’m just suffering more or less.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emily flips my question on me in a beautifully philosophical twist: “What does that even mean? Where is the ‘me’?” Equating ourselves with our brains makes sense, she says, because much of what we experience comes through our brains. “But is that really where our selves are?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="478" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline.jpg" alt="portrait of Emily Hollenbeck" class="wp-image-3131432" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-545x383.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-640x450.jpg 640w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-265x186.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131432">Emily Hollenbeck, like other people with DBS implants, had to relearn how to cope with her new emotional range.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131432">Courtesy of Emily Hollenbeck</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Who she is, Emily says, is an activity, a choice. Her depression took away those choices and altered who she was. But now, “I don’t have that feeling, so which of those is correct? I don’t know. But I know which one I like better. I know that’s not a satisfactory answer for your question, but what really gets to the heart of it is that I feel like I’m untethered, and I have the ability now to focus on the things that I do really care about. And that’s where my <em>self</em> lies.”</p>



<p>These days, Jon says, his sense of self is lighter. Without the poison coursing through his body, Jon feels better, more energized, more present in his life with wife, Barbara, their three kids, a dog, a cat and a bearded dragon named Lizzy. But, as his daily surveys make absolutely clear, he’s still crabby. “There are certain things that you realize are the disease, and certain things that are innate in who you are,” he says. His irritability scores didn’t budge after DBS. “I guess I’m just a cranky middle-aged dude now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barbara may be one of the best judges of who Jon is now. Is he different somehow with DBS and without severe depression? “I don’t feel like he’s changed,” Barbara says. “I don’t feel like I have a different person living in my house. It’s not that creepy, sci-fi way, like there’s this new person,” she says. It’s just him, the Jon she met all those years ago.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the final part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Neurologist Helen Mayberg cringes at the slow pace of DBS research. Her <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(05)00156-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662730500156X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first paper describing DBS for depression</a> in the subcallosal cingulate (then called Brodmann Area 25) appeared in the journal <em>Neuron</em> in 2005. Almost 20 years later, she almost can’t believe that researchers are not further along in bringing this technique to people who would benefit from it.</p>





<p>“On the other hand, we’ve learned so much that maybe it’s not so bad,” Mayberg says. Still, she feels impatient. “We don’t have a lot of time,” she says. “People are dying now, so let’s fix them. And then we can make something better.”</p>



<p>Mayberg hopes to see the treatment become streamlined. The first heart pacemaker was an incredible piece of technology, but it was giant and clunky. Today, the powerful device, usually about the size of a matchbook, sits near millions of people’s hearts, keeping them beating. As with the heart, for the brain, “how do you go from complicated to simple? Everything is about the prototyping and the simplification,” she says.</p>



<p>What’s next? “What’s the future of this, the future three steps ahead?” Mayberg says. “I have no idea.”</p>



<p>Despite stories from Jon Nelson and others, deep brain stimulation still has its stigma to overcome, even in the research world. Questions of autonomy — of control over feelings and actions — crop up in ethics discussions of brain technology. But to Martijn Figee, the psychiatrist and DBS researcher who has worked with many people implanted with electrodes, those questions are a “luxury problem.” That framing ignores the idea that mental illness itself takes away a person’s control. “People who work in DBS are always a little frustrated by these discussions,” Figee says. “We’re always like, ‘Talk to the patients.’”</p>



<p>Figee, who receives consulting fees from Medtronic, a device company that makes brain implants, and his colleagues asked people before and after surgery for DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder and Parkinson’s about their feelings of being in control of themselves. People did not report a loss of feeling in control of themselves after the procedure. In fact, the people treated for OCD reported a bigger jump in autonomy and control than the Parkinson’s patients. “That’s not something that bothered them at all,” Figee says, “because the OCD was more of a prison to them than the fact that they have this implant.”</p>



<p>Psychologist Shannon O’Neill, who treats people with DBS at Mount Sinai, says she hopes that the procedure will be more readily understood in the future: “What I’d love is a shift toward not making it a last resort,” she says. “I wonder if we wait too long to give an individual DBS.” She doesn’t mean that brain implants would be an early treatment, but instead, she wants other health care professionals to have more awareness of the procedure so that they can refer people who have run out of hope.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the open questions?</h4>



<p>What’s next will almost certainly include nuanced and complex science. Big questions remain about where in the brain to stimulate, for which people and what kind of stimulation. Jon and Amanda are participating in follow-up studies searching for signs of recovery in their brains, bodies and microexpressions on their faces, and even in their voices. “The commitments are out of control,” Jon jokes. He spends eight minutes twice a day recording his brain waves, along with video journals and daily, weekly and monthly surveys. His brain is imaged regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a hallmark, a signature, that can tell them the method is working. “I need to know when the depression is away, and I need to have a way to discriminate,” Mayberg says. “When are you having a bad day and when are you relapsing? Those are not the same thing.”</p>



<p>Mayberg and her colleagues just described one such hallmark in six people who underwent DBS for depression. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06541-3#Sec7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collection of changes</a>&nbsp;in brain behavior can indicate when a person has recovered, the researchers reported September 20 in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>A handful of trials are putting a spin on the typical DBS approach and studying what’s called adaptive DBS, which kicks in only when a certain pathological brain activity pattern is detected. That approach has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-severe-depression-activity-stimulation">worked well for a woman named Sarah with severe depression</a>. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the details of her improvements</a> in 2021.</p>



<p>Similar on-demand efforts are happening for other disorders, including binge eating and post-traumatic stress disorder. Jay Gill, a brain researcher and medical student at UCLA told me that one man, a veteran with PTSD, described having an aura, a sort of premonition, just before his symptoms would get bad. With his adaptive DBS system in place, he still gets triggered and feels the aura, but instead of feeling worse, a feeling of calm sets in.</p>



<p>The optimal DBS approach for depression may be similar to the approach for PTSD, OCD, addiction and other psychiatric disorders. Or maybe not. There’s still so much to learn.</p>



<p>Not everyone thinks about depression, or any illness for that matter, as a battle. Jon does. And there were days — lots of days — when he thought he’d lose it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="419" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of Jon Nelson standing on an ice rink next to a red hockey goal." class="wp-image-3131450" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline-622x383.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline-302x186.jpg 302w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131450">Jon Nelson’s deep brain stimulation treatment hasn’t made him happy all the time, but he now enjoys experiences more, including moments like coaching hockey and softball.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131450">AIDAN KAHN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These days, the Nelson house is bright. It’s full of laughter, riddles, good-natured teasing, homemade pizza — and an energetic kid on in-line skates who twirls and glides through the kitchen loop. It’s also full of hope for a future that’s better than the past. That makes me reluctant to ask Barbara a question that I know will be hard for her to answer: Is she worried that Jon’s DBS treatment will stop working?</p>



<p>“That’s always in the back of my mind a little bit,” she tells me. Over the years, Barbara has learned to temper her expectations for the future. “You just never really know what’s going to happen,” she says. In a way, she’s still guarded. “I don’t know if this is going to work forever,” she says.</p>



<p>“But my perspective is that even if something changes, we have had this time with him.… And if it keeps going forever, that’s amazing. It’s amazing. I hope it does.”</p>



<p>On the drives home from softball, field hockey, golf, basketball and ice hockey, Jon and whichever kids are around have chats. “I always call it ‘car talk with the kids.’” In one of these car talks, Jon’s youngest piped up. “He’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so happy you just kept fighting for us.’ These little comments that come out of nowhere.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-ai-drones-find-meteorites">How drones are helping scientists find meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meteorites offer tantalizing clues about what the early solar system was like. But finding them is far from rocket science. Often, researchers simply fan out across a landscape and walk for hours while staring at the ground. Now, some scientists are turning to drones and machine learning to help spot freshly fallen meteorites much more efficiently.</p>



<p>A team of six people on a meteorite-hunting expedition can search about 200,000 square meters per day, says Seamus Anderson, a planetary scientist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. But since the area over which a cluster of meteorites falls typically can’t be pinpointed to better than a few million square meters, searching can take a while, he says. “It’s quite slow.”</p>

<p>Around 2016, Anderson began toying with the concept of using drones to take pictures of the ground to look for meteorites. That idea blossomed into a Ph.D. project. In 2022, he and his colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac66d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported their first successful recovery of a meteorite</a> spotted with a drone. They’ve since found <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2023/pdf/6187.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four more meteorites at a different site</a>, the team reported August 17 in Los Angeles at a meeting of the Meteoritical Society.</p>



<p>Drone-based searches are much faster than the standard way of doing things, Anderson says. &#8220;You’re going from about 300 days of human effort down to about a dozen or so.&#8221; It’s also fun and exciting work, he says, but there are challenges too.</p>





<p>Anderson and his collaborators have used drones to search for meteorites in remote parts of Western Australia and South Australia. The team is tipped off about a fall site by networks of ground-based cameras that track meteoroids flashing through Earth’s atmosphere. Then, the hunt is on.</p>



<p>The researchers pack a four-wheel drive vehicle with drone and computer equipment, battery charging stations, generators, fuel, food, camping equipment, tables, chairs and more. The drive to the fall site can take more than a day, often on rough or nonexistent roads, Anderson says. “You hope you don’t pop a tire.”</p>



<p>After arriving, the team flies its primary drone at an altitude of about 20 meters. Its camera takes an image of the ground once every second, and the researchers download the data every 40 minutes or so when the drone lands to receive fresh batteries.</p>



<p>A typical day of flying can net over 10,000 images, which are then divided digitally into 100 million or so smaller sections. Those “tiles,” each 2 meters on a side, are fed into a machine learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize meteorites based on images of the real thing or terrestrial rocks spray-painted black. The latter are convincing stand-ins for real meteorites, Anderson says.</p>



<p>The algorithm is good but not perfect. It automatically discards most tiles — typically upwards of 99 percent — that don’t contain any meteorite-looking objects. But that still leaves roughly 50,000 or so tiles after a day’s worth of flights that must be manually checked by a human, Anderson says.</p>

<p>Most of the time, those tiles contain things that decidedly aren’t meteorites: animal poop, tin cans, snakes or sleeping kangaroos, for instance. Those objects get flagged as potential meteorites simply because the algorithm isn’t familiar with them, Anderson says, and it’s up to the team to winnow out those false positives.</p>



<p>For objects that still look convincing to the human eye, the researchers send out a smaller drone that flies much lower — about a meter off the ground — to investigate. Finally, the team goes out in person to examine promising candidates.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to train their algorithm to better avoid flagging things like poop and kangaroos as meteorites. And the team is working on making its computer code open-source so that other researchers can freely use it.</p>



<p>Anderson also hopes to see drones make an appearance in Antarctica, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machine-learning-meteorite-antarctica">a hotbed of meteorite sleuthing</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/22</em>). But the icy environment will present a whole new slew of challenges, Anderson says, such as making sure sensitive electronic equipment fares well in the frigid conditions and overcoming the logistics of working in such a remote place. “Antarctica is a whole different beast.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/logs-evidence-oldest-wood-structure">Interlocking logs may be evidence of the oldest known wooden structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modified logs dating to about 476,000 years ago might be the oldest evidence of wooden structures, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Wooden artifacts decompose easily and are relatively scant in the archaeological record compared with stone or bone. The new finding, reported September 20 in <em>Nature,</em> suggests that the structural use of wood <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may stretch </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> back</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> into the</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> history of human ancestors</a>, hinting at advanced cognitive skills and a less nomadic lifestyle for some hominids than previously thought.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s a challenge to preconceptions about what are considered sophisticated, complex behaviors,” says Larry Barham, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool in England. “For me, settling into one place and changing the landscape, that is very sophisticated.”</p>



<p>Humans and their ancestors have been using wood in some fashion for quite some time. The earliest known example of modified wood is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/004724849190015N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a polished plank from Israel</a> dating to around 780,000 years ago. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/385807a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wooden tools</a> don&#8217;t appear in the historical record until about 400,000 years ago. Before this new study, the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/50/impact/star-carr-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest known example of a wooden structure</a> was much more recent: around 9000 B.C.</p>



<p>During a dig in 2019, Barham and colleagues found five modified wooden objects in the exposed bank of a river flowing into the top of Kalambo Falls in Zambia. The area is rich with forest and has a consistently high water table. This makes it ideal for human habitation — and the water also blocks oxygen from buried wood. Since the 1950s, archaeologists have excavated ancient technologies here, though wooden objects couldn’t be accurately placed in time and clear modifications had been worn away.</p>



<p>This time the team used a technique <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-first-settled-australia-early-65000-years-ago">known as luminescence dating</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/17</em>). Minerals buried underground gradually absorb background radiation like a battery taking up charge, which can be released later as light. This reveals how many years ago a sample last saw the sun. The team analyzed 16 sand samples‚ including from directly around the wooden objects, and grouped the artifacts into three chunks of time from 476,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>In the sands that are nearly half a million years old, the team found two large interlocking logs, with shaped ends and wide, carved notches at the point they overlap. Like an early version of Lincoln Logs, this would have held the wood together. Both logs showed evidence of chopping and scraping, and were buried near tools used for scraping or carving, hand axes and other crafting equipment.</p>

<p>These logs may have been part of a structure — a raised walkway, a place to store wood or somewhere to sit — that helped early hominids in their environment, the researchers suggest. Based on timing and location, the structure could be the handiwork of <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>, a human ancestor that lived about 700,000 to 200,000 years ago. Other wooden objects recovered from the site include a wedge, a digging stick and a chopped log, dating from 390,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>“This paper provides a wonderful peek into our past,” says Rebecca Biermann Gürbüz, a biological anthropologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in the study. Other primates use wood and plants in a variety of ways, she says. “So the fact that [hominids] did so nearly half a million years ago is not surprising.”</p>



<p>In fact, Barham wonders if Stone Age is even the right term for that era. “Let&#8217;s say wood survived as much as bone does in the archaeological record,” he says. “Maybe we should relabel our Stone Age to the Woodworking Age, an Organic Age or something that reflects the reality of common behavior, which we can only really glimpse.”</p>

<p>Surveys show spreadsheets are the <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-692">most widely used</a> analytical tool in academic research. But they are <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0801/0801.3114.pdf">prone to errors</a>. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health England lost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988">16,000 test results</a> after using an old Excel file format to handle data. Whether this mix-up hampered local infection control is anybody’s guess, but it certainly could have. </p>



<p>The software is causing trouble for other lines of research, too, as our team and others have shown: Genomics studies that rely on Excel spreadsheets to manage data turn out to be riddled with erroneous gene names, or gene-name errors, and the issue is affecting more and more journals.</p>



<span id="more-127892"></span>



<p><strong>A persistent problem</strong></p>



<p>Gene-name errors were <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80">discovered</a> by Barry R. Zeeberg and his team at the National Institutes of Health in 2004. Their study first showed that when genomic data is handled in Excel, the program automatically corrects gene names to dates. What’s more, Riken clone identifiers – unique name tags given to pieces of DNA – can be misinterpreted as numbers with decimal points.</p>



<p>In 2016, we conducted a more extensive search, showing that in more than 3,500 articles published between 2005 and 2015, <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">20% of Excel gene lists contained errors</a> in their supplementary files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are no documented cases in which gene-name errors have affected the conclusions of a study. But if a researcher unknowingly saved a spreadsheet containing such errors, someone importing those data for further analysis would face a reproducibility problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to these issues, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0669-3">made changes</a> to some gene names prone to errors. This includes converting the SEPT-1 gene to SEPTIN1 and the MARCH1 gene to MARCHF1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The widespread adoption of these new names is a lengthy process: Our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008984">latest study, of</a> more than 11,000 articles published between 2014 and 2020, found that 31% of supplementary files that included gene lists in Excel contained errors. This percentage is higher than in <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">our previous 2016 study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also found some novel errors. Some were connected to the local language setting. For example, the AGO2 gene was converted to Aug-02, perhaps due to “Ago” being short for “August” in Spanish. Similarly, MEI1 was switched to May-01 (“Mei” is “May” in Dutch), and TAMM41 to Jan-41 (“Tammikuu” is “January” in Finnish).<br><br>One of the significant findings in our study was the five-digit conversion. When saving a gene name converted to a date and importing it into a new Excel spreadsheet, the dates will change into a five-digit number. Software packages like HGNChelper and Gene Updater can help in fixing gene-name errors, but not once they have been converted to numbers.</p>

<p><strong>More and more journals affected</strong></p>



<p>Despite increased recognition of gene-name errors, scientific journals have taken no significant initiatives to mitigate the problem. Our continuous tracking of these errors, the data for which is publicly accessible at <a href="https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/">https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/</a>, reveals a steady rate of gene-name errors and a rising number of affected journals until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This spread may be due to the expansion of omics into different branches of biology and medicine, coupled with the growth of second-tier journals.</p>



<p>But the problem isn’t limited to lesser-known journals. We found the journals with the highest numbers of affected articles were <em>Nature Communications, PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports, BMC Genomics, PLOS Genetics </em>and<em> Oncotarget</em>, with at least 100 affected publications each. Clearly, journals need to produce guidelines about how to filter for and address gene-name errors that can affect data reproducibility.</p>



<p>A substantial number of genes may be misnamed when the computer is set to a non-English language. Our studies only scratch the surface of this problem, but they plainly show Excel and other non-specialised spreadsheet programs are not designed to handle big data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although gene-name errors may seem like small fry in the grand scheme of scientific data analysis, they are a symptom of broader issues like over-reliance on spreadsheets and lack of consensus on how large genomic datasets should be reviewed and disseminated. These issues need to be addressed to improve the reliability of genomics research.</p>
