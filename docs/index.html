              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-new-view-milky-way-space">Neutrinos offer a new view of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have made the first image of the Milky Way using neutrinos.</p>



<p>The extremely low-mass subatomic particles have no electric charge, and pass easily through gas, dust and even stars on their way from the places where they originate to detectors here on Earth. High-energy neutrinos zip throughout the cosmos, but where they come from is usually a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, by combining artificial intelligence and data collected over the course of a decade with the IceCube detector in Antarctica, researchers have found the first evidence of high-energy neutrinos that originated from inside the Milky Way and mapped the particles onto an image of the galaxy’s plane. It’s the first time our galaxy has been imaged with anything other than light.</p>





<p>The map includes suggestions of <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific high-energy neutrino sources within the Milky Way</a> that might be the remnants of past supernova star explosions, the cores of collapsed supergiant stars or other as-yet-unidentified objects, the team reports in the June 30 <em>Science</em>. But more research is needed to clearly pick those sorts of features out of the data.</p>



<p>Previously, only a few high-energy neutrinos have been traced back to their potential birthplaces, all outside the Milky Way. Those include two that appeared to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">black holes shredding their companion star</a>s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">others from a highly active galaxy known as a blazar</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/22, SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re quite unambiguously seeing neutrinos from both galactic and extragalactic space these days,” says physicist Kate Scholberg of Duke University who was not involved with the research. “There’s so much more to learn, and it can be tremendous fun to figure out how to see the universe with neutrino eyes.”</p>



<p>Neutrino astronomy could potentially allow us to see distant objects in a way that no other telescopes can match. That’s because neutrinos can cross huge expanses of space without being absorbed or deflected. X-rays, gamma rays, optical light and the charged particles that make up cosmic rays, on the other hand, can be deflected or absorbed along the way, which may obscure their origins.</p>



<p>To physicist Naoko Kurahashi Neilson of Drexel University in Philadelphia, the map she and her team produced is the latest contribution to a shift in neutrino science. In the past, neutrino observatories like IceCube haven’t provided the sorts of views of the sky that telescopes relying on optical light, X-rays or gamma rays offer.</p>



<p>“When I first joined IceCube,”  Kurahashi Neilson says, “I used to do air quotes” when using the phrase <em>neutrino astronomy</em>. “I don&#8217;t do that anymore.… I don&#8217;t have to because we&#8217;re starting to resolve things” in neutrino images that resemble the astronomical images from other telescopes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Three ways to map the Milky Way</h3>



<p>In these three views, the Milky Way is seen in visible light (top), in gamma rays (middle) and in high-energy neutrinos (bottom). This first-ever particle-based map is based on data collected with the enormous IceCube detector embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. Dust obscures portions of the visible light map, and gamma rays can come from a variety of sources. Neutrinos have the potential to pinpoint locations where high-energy cosmic rays coming from supernova remnants, the cores of collapsed stellar giants and other as-yet-unidentified sources interact with dust in the galaxy, creating the neutrinos.</p>

<p>The downside of neutrinos is that they’re extremely hard to detect. The IceCube experiment is enormous in part to overcome that challenge. It consists of 5,160 sensors in a cubic array one kilometer on a side embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. The large size of the experiment increases the odds of seeing a tiny fraction of the neutrinos flying through space from the Milky Way and other places in the cosmos.</p>





<p>Of the 100,000 or so neutrinos that IceCube scientists observe each year, some leave long tracks in the detector that potentially point back to where the neutrinos came from. Many of the neutrino signals in IceCube, though, are known as cascade events. They make bursts of light in the detector, but don’t reveal neutrino origins as well as tracks can.</p>



<p>“This is data we used to throw away in terms of astronomy,”  Kurahashi Neilson says. There’s still information indicating where the neutrinos come from in the data. But it’s difficult to identify the promising cascades in the hundreds of thousands of meaningless, background events that IceCube has collected.</p>



<p>Kurahashi Neilson decided to take up the challenge by plowing through a decade of IceCube cascade data with the help of an artificial intelligence system known as a neural network. “You can train the neural nets to identify which events are worth keeping … [and] which events are more background-like,”  Kurahashi Neilson says.</p>



<p>It’s an approach Kurahashi Neilson pioneered in 2017 and steadily improved until she and her colleagues were able to identify the neutrinos used in the new map.</p>



<p>“It’s an impressive analysis and the techniques may well not yet be pushed to their limits,” Scholberg says. “Clearly a lot more work needs to be done, but it’s very exciting to see the basic expectation [of Milky Way neutrinos] verified. This is an important step forward in understanding of the high-energy particle sky.”</p>

<p>A paper published in <em>Science</em> two years ago has been flagged with an expression of concern while the editors give the authors a chance to correct a data issue identified by two different readers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>,” was published in September 2021 and has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice, published today, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127400"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors have been made aware that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression. We are alerting readers to these concerns while the authors provide additional data to correct the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the journal told Retraction Watch two separate individuals had emailed the editorial team about an issue in the paper, with the most recent email arriving earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Science</em> editors contacted the authors of the paper, who acknowledged the problem and said the error in the figure was unintentional, the spokesperson said. The authors also told <em>Science</em> correcting the error wouldn’t change the conclusions of the paper and offered to provide more data to address the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked about the decision to allow the authors to submit replacement data. The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> editorial, after consulting advisers, agreed to allow the authors of the study to provide additional data to correct Figure 5. Under these circumstances, while <em>Science</em> waits for the data, and in order to alert our readers as to the need for amendments to the paper, we are posting an Editorial Expression of Concern. After the sought after data is provided, <em>Science</em> editorial will review it to confirm it represents and matches what the authors had published in 2021.&nbsp; At that point, the authors may need to further provide corrections to the text and figures of their 2021 study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither of the study’s corresponding authors, Shiyong Sun and <a href="https://rsc.henu.edu.cn/info/1162/2071.htm">Xuelu Wang</a> of the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement at Henan University in Kaifeng, China, has responded to our request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-exploit-third-wild-vertebrate-species-animals">Humans exploit about one-third of wild vertebrate species</a></h4>

              
                <p>The aptly named resplendent quetzal is prized for its plumage. Golden poison frogs are popular creatures in the pet trade. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine.</p>



<p>Those three animals are among the third of all wild vertebrate species that people eat, trade or otherwise use, a new study reveals.&nbsp; Out of nearly 47,000 vertebrate species around the world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04940-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans exploit about 14,600</a>, researchers report June 29 in <em>Communications Biology </em>in a comprehensive look at humans’ impact on a vast swathe of wildlife.</p>





<p>Some species, like fish trawled from the sea in large quantities for food, are abundant. But human activities are helping push many others of these exploited species toward extinction, marine ecologist Boris Worm and colleagues say.</p>



<p>More than half of the vertebrate species that humans exploit — mostly fish and mammals — are killed for food, the team finds. Birds, reptiles and amphibians are primarily targeted for the pet trade. And about 8 percent of exploited species are recreationally hunted for sport or trophies. Other uses include medicine or clothing, and more than a quarter of the species are used for more than one purpose.</p>



<p>Worm, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and colleagues collated data compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which tracks the trade, use and vulnerability of species worldwide. The team considered species from the six classes of vertebrates that contain more than 100 species each: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, ray-finned fishes (such as tuna and salmon) and cartilaginous fishes (a group that includes sharks, rays and skates).</p>



<p>About 13 percent of all vertebrate species facing extinction — those classified by the IUCN as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered — are threatened at least in part due to human exploitation, the team found. That includes 5,775, or 39 percent, of the species the study identified as used by humans.</p>



<p>The rise of advanced hunting and fishing technology, as well as global trade and a burgeoning human population, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-indeed">increasingly skewed the balance of many ecosystems in favor of people and against other species</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/07</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Worm and his colleagues, and some other scientists, think of humans as predators, that’s not quite correct, says Daniel Pauly, a fisheries biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. “Predators are regulated by natural processes, but humans are not.”</p>



<p>The team’s findings, Pauly says, “describe the impact of our mad consumption of the world.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boreal-forest-north-america-shrink">The snow forest of North America may be about to shrink</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of nature’s woody behemoths — the North American snow forest — may soon begin shrinking.</p>



<p>The continent’s boreal forest reposes in subarctic latitudes, spanning much of Alaska and Canada. Scientists had previously suggested that its range might shift northward as the climate warms, helping maintain its expansive breadth.</p>



<p>But for two decades, the ecosystem’s northern tree line has held fast, while its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39092-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southerly tree cover has thinned</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Human activities and climate change could push the prodigious forest to contract.</p>





<p>“We are about to transform an entire biome on a continental scale,” says environmental scientist Ronny Rotbarth of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Millions of people — many from Indigenous groups — depend on the boreal forest to live. It’s thought to contain <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00090/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 percent</a> of Earth’s remaining intact forest, and its living flora are estimated to store about <a href="https://carbon2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 billion metric tons of carbon</a>. That exceeds what global fossil fuel burning emitted last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the forest is being disturbed, and not just by climate change. Logging and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-boreal-forests-record-co2-2021">wildfires</a> — such as those now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">raging in Quebec</a> — can also diminish it (<em>SN: 3/2/23</em>;<em> SN: 6/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rotbarth and his colleagues assessed how those pressures were impacting the forest’s range. Using satellite observations, the researchers tracked tree-cover changes from 2000 to 2019. They then analyzed how those changes corresponded with temperature, precipitation and disturbances like wildfires and logging.</p>



<p>Overall, the forest’s tree cover increased, mostly within its northern interior. But its northern boundary showed little to no expansion, while its southern boundary thinned, largely due to wildfires and logging. The researchers also found that the southerly reaches didn’t fully recover from these disturbances during the study period, potentially hindered by climate warming.</p>



<p>The changes may foreshadow a long-term forest contraction, though it’s unclear when exactly that could start.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">A newfound gravitational wave ‘hum’ may be from the universe’s biggest black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beneath the explosions, collisions and other intermittent bangs in the cosmos, scientists suspect a nonstop soundtrack plays, created by ripples in spacetime continually washing through the universe. After more than a decade of searching, scientists may have finally heard that background hum.</p>



<p>Several teams of researchers from around the world reported on June 28 the first clear evidence of these gravitational waves. Unlike previously detected gravitational waves, these new ones have ripples that are staggeringly long — on the scale of light-years. Their likely source: innumerable pairs of gargantuan black holes, which churn the spacetime cauldron as they orbit one another.</p>





<p>If that hunch is correct, the result would provide the first evidence that pairs of monster black holes, with masses billions of times that of the sun, can coalesce into one.</p>



<p>If the gravitational waves are real, and if they truly are a signal of supermassive black hole pairs, “it’s miraculous,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University. “It’s extremely interesting, because we have essentially no handle on what the most massive black holes are doing.”</p>

<p>Gravitational waves are produced by accelerating, massive objects. As these waves careen through the universe, they rumple the fabric of spacetime upon which reality is embroidered. In 2015, scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction?mode=magazine&amp;context=1679">detected gravitational waves for the first time</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). Those waves were spawned by mergers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">relatively puny black holes</a>, entirely different beasts than the supermassive ones that lurk at the centers of galaxies (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>).</p>



<p>While LIGO picks up gravitational wave blips that can last mere fractions of a second, orbiting supermassive black holes are expected to pump out waves continually for millions of years, creating ripples that blanket the cosmos with their constant hum. “This is a very different sort of thing, very new sort of thing,” says LIGO researcher Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. “That is awesome.”</p>



<p>Across the universe, galaxies regularly mingle and merge. As they do, scientists suspected, their supermassive black holes would orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Many pairs of black holes would be doing this orbital dance at once, in the many merging galaxies scattered throughout the cosmos, all sending their spacetime ripples out into space.</p>



<p>“The Earth is just randomly bumping around on this sea of gravitational waves,” says astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin of West Virginia University in Morgantown and a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav.</p>



<p>Detecting this mishmash of gravitational waves is not easy. The task required scientists to MacGyver the Milky Way, turning the galaxy into a gravitational wave detector by timing the clocklike ticking of dead, spinning remnants of exploded stars called pulsars, which emit beams of radio waves as they twirl. These beams sweep past Earth at regular intervals, like the precise ticks of a clock. Gravitational waves stretching and squeezing the space between the pulsars and Earth cause the pulsars’ ticks, observed with a variety of radio telescopes around the world, to come early or late.</p>



<p>To ensure that they were seeing the gravitational waves, rather than uninteresting jitters, the researchers looked for a special type of correlation between different pulsars. Pulsars near one another on the sky should show similar timing shifts, but those that are at right angles to one another should observe opposite shifts: One pulsar’s blips come early while the other’s come late.</p>



<p>That compelling hallmark has finally been observed, NANOGrav researchers reported June 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. “There’s nothing in nature that can mimic this,” says Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University and NANOGrav researcher. “Only gravitational waves can make that.” Their result was based on 15 years spent monitoring dozens of pulsars.</p>





<p>“It’s really invigorating stuff,” says astrophysicist Michael Keith of the University of Manchester in England, a member of the European Pulsar Timing Array, or EPTA.</p>



<p>The EPTA team spent an even longer time staring at pulsars — a quarter of a century. “We were getting to the point where we were starting to think maybe the signal is just so weak, we’ll never ever find it,” Keith says. But the telltale correlation between pulsars was also evident in the EPTA results, which were reported in a series of papers accepted in <em>Astronomy and Astrophysics </em>with researchers from the Indian Pulsar Timing Array.</p>



<p>Some scientists have thought that supermassive black holes in merging galaxies would never draw close enough to coalesce with one another, or to emit gravitational waves like the ones observed. “It’s actually been a sore spot for our field for many years,” Mingarelli says.</p>



<p>In contrast, the gravitational wave signal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-weird-secrets-early-universe">seems to be stronger than expected</a> (<em>SN</em>: 6/3/23). That suggests, “there are many black holes, they merge happily, and black holes also grow [to large masses] very happily,” says astrophysicist Marta Volonteri of Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique de Paris, who was not involved with the new research.</p>

<p>Future work could reveal more about supermassive black holes and their environs, says astronomer Ryan Shannon of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.</p>



<p>“Understanding better the demographics of these supermassive black holes is going to help us understand how galaxies form and evolve,” says Shannon, a researcher on the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array in Australia, which also reported independent results in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and<strong> </strong>in a paper accepted <strong>in</strong> <em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia</em>. A shorter-term effort, from the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array, reported its results in <em>Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>.</p>



<p>The teams stopped just short of declaring an ironclad detection of the background of gravitational waves, rather presenting their results as strong evidence for the ripples. Taken individually, their results don’t quite meet the most stringent standards for statistical significance set by physicists. In future work, the teams plan to combine their data, in hopes of further solidifying the detection.</p>



<p>And although supermassive black holes are the simplest explanation for the waves’ origins, researchers still can’t rule out a more exotic provenance. For example, the ripples might have arisen from inflation, the period just after the Big Bang when the universe is thought to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inflation-trial">expanded incredibly rapidly</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/12</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever the source, the future study of these gravitational waves is bound to have ripple effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-squash-bugs-adult-poop-microbe">Young squash bugs seek out adults’ poop for an essential microbe</a></h4>

              
                <p>For young squash bugs, a sip full of feces can help the microbes go down.</p>



<p>Squash bugs (<em>Anasa tristis</em>) are a major agricultural pest, and a bacterial partner called <em>Caballeronia</em> is essential for their survival. To pick up the bacteria, fledgling squash bugs <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00724-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home in on adult poop in the environment</a>, researchers report in the July 10 <em>Current Biology</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If the nymphs don’t find the microbe, they die, says evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist Scott Villa of Davidson College in North Carolina. And&nbsp;<em>Caballeronia</em>&nbsp;is not plentiful in the environment. So having to fend for themselves is a risky strategy, Villa says. “If it’s so important, why in the heck did they not just put them on a platter for their kids?”</p>





<p>Many other insects do just that. Females defecate on their eggs, leaving behind essential bacteria that their young can slurp up. But it was unclear how squash bug nymphs acquired <em>Caballeronia</em>. Figuring it out could lead to ways to interrupt the bacterial supply chain to control the pest’s population, Villa says.</p>



<p>The serendipitous discovery came when Villa and colleagues caught an adult squash bug pooping on camera while working on a different study. Nymphs flocked to the feces and started feeding. When the team then gave nymphs a choice of a mouthful of saline or poop spiked with the bacteria, the bugs were intensely attracted to the feces. Of 229 recorded events, all but three involved bacteria-containing poop.</p>



<p>Nymphs also preferred bacteria-free poop or the bacteria alone to saline.</p>



<p>What’s more, the attraction may be species-specific. The insects were less successful at picking up <em>Caballeronia</em> from feces belonging to their close relative <em>A. andresii</em>, another squash bug.</p>



<p>Why <em>Caballeronia </em>is key for squash bugs is unclear, says coauthor Jason Chen, a microbial ecologist and entomologist at Emory University in Atlanta. But the bacteria probably help ensure the insects get the nutrients they need from their diet.</p>

<p>When it comes to delays in correcting the scientific record &#8212; and less-than-helpful retraction notices &#8212; it&#8217;s not uncommon to see journals blaming universities for being slow and less than forthcoming, and universities blaming journals for being impatient and not respecting the confidentiality of their processes. So in 2021 and 2022, a group of university research integrity officers, journal editors and others gathered to discuss those issues.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.20796">new paper in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a>, the group recommends specific changes to the status quo to enable effective communication between institutions and journals:&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>(1) reconsideration and broadening of the interpretation by institutions of the need-to-know criteria in federal regulations (ie, confidential or sensitive information and data are not disclosed unless there is a need for an individual to know the facts to perform specific jobs or functions), (2) uncoupling the evaluation of the accuracy and validity of research data from the determination of culpability and intent of the individuals involved, and (3) initiating a widespread change for the policies of journals and publishers regarding the timing and appropriateness for contacting institutions, either before or concurrently under certain conditions, when contacting the authors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Susan Garfinkel, the associate vice president for research compliance at The Ohio State and the corresponding author of the article, some questions.</p>



<span id="more-127384"></span>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch (RW): The group recommends “broadening institutions’ interpretation of the federal concept of need-to-know.” Did it consider <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/06/its-time-to-end-the-code-of-silence-at-universities/">broadening beyond journals</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Garfinkel (SG): </strong>The working group was composed of RIOs and journal editors and publishers, so the discussions focused on issues relevant only to institutions and journals. The recommendation to broaden the interpretation of the federal concept of “need to know” is a significant change for institutions to adopt and implement. The working group was very cautious to weigh the effect of such a change on the confidentiality requirements of research misconduct proceedings and therefore did not consider broadening it to include other bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Did the group consider changing the practice at many institutions of waiting until the ORI or NSF OIG has made a finding in a report to release the findings of its own investigation?</p>



<p><strong>SG: </strong>The working group focused solely on false, fabricated, or plagiarized data and not on institutional findings of research misconduct. We were cognizant that appropriately releasing information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data will adhere to the confidentiality requirements in federal regulations and institutional policy, i.e., the requirement to protect the identity of respondents and complainants to the extent possible. The working group focused on the timing for institutions to provide information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data to journals, but did not consider the timing or release of institutional or federal findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>Who should decide what constitutes “additional information” in this recommendation? “Limit additional sharing of any information provided by a journal to the extent possible.”</p>



<p><strong>SG: </strong>This recommendation refers to limiting sharing of information with other parties. For example, the working group recommended that an institution share complete and sufficient information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data or text with a journal so that a comprehensive correction or retraction can be published. But to maintain confidentiality, this recommendation advises that journals should restrict sharing the information provided with any other party who may use it for other purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> The group recommends that journals “should not expect institutions to share information about the involved researchers, such as whether a researcher is currently, or has recently been, investigated for serious concerns including misconduct or specific fact-finding that occurred in a research misconduct proceeding.” Why not?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The working group made this recommendation based on a few facts.&nbsp; First, the confidentiality provision of the federal regulation (42 CFR §93.108) that states, “Disclosure of the identity of respondents and complainants in research misconduct proceedings is limited, to the extent possible, to those who need to know, consistent with a thorough, competent, objective and fair research misconduct proceeding, and as allowed by law.”&nbsp; Second, the primary concern of journals is the integrity of the data or text submitted or published, and not who committed potential research misconduct. Third, it is the institution that must focus on who was responsible for research misconduct, which is a difficult and time-consuming process. Thus, to enable earlier communications between institutions and journals, this recommendation proposes that journals appreciate the limitations under which institutions operate and their inability to share certain information in an ongoing matter.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> The article describes two problems – delays and transparency – which are closely linked but distinct, and journals and institutions have different pressures here. How do you think this initiative will help reduce delays, particularly in retractions, expressions of concern, and correcting the scientific record?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> Retractions, expressions of concerns, and corrections are currently delayed because journals usually are not provided with any information until research misconduct findings are made by institutions. However, institutions may identify and confirm early in a research misconduct proceeding that data are false, fabricated, or plagiarized. The recommendations from the working group propose that when false, fabricated, or plagiarized data or text are identified and confirmed, that determination can be shared with the journals to allow earlier actions to be taken by the journals.&nbsp; In addition, the working group also proposes that institutions provide complete and specific information limited to the data falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism, which conforms to the confidentiality requirements in federal regulations and institutional policy. These recommendations should allow for shorter delays in correcting the literature and more transparent journal notices.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Decoupling data validity from culpability and intent has been <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3742__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL7rqOkxYQ$">suggested before</a>, as the group notes. But it means retraction notices to the scientific community will be even more likely to be incomplete, since journals are <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/retractionwatch.com/2022/08/18/its-time-to-devise-a-more-efficient-solution-science-editor-in-chief-wants-to-change-the-retraction-process/__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL5I1YkxjQ$">extremely unlikely to update prior notices</a> if an investigation report is even made available. How do you propose to fix this problem?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The decoupling of data validity from culpability and intent should allow retraction notices to be <em>more</em> complete regarding the data. The recommendation is that the institution provide the journal with complete information to understand the specific falsification, fabrication or plagiarism of data or text.&nbsp; For example, rather than limiting a notice to include only that a specific figure is false, the working recommends that the journal be provided with information to explain why the data or text are at issue, which can then be included in their notices. This will allow readers a better understanding of the concern leading to a correction or retraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> We and others have noted <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL58NijSrQ$">flaws in many institutional investigation reports</a>. How will these recommendations address that problem?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> This working group did not discuss, and its recommendations are not relevant to, the quality of institutional investigation reports.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do the imperatives of public universities here differ from those for private institutions? Use of NIH/NSF funds? Can taxpayer/public interests outweigh expectations of privacy in some instances?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The recommendations of the working group would apply equally to public and private institutions.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-black-hole-active">200 years ago, the Milky Way’s central black hole briefly awoke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sometime between the American Revolution and the California gold rush, the black hole at the Milky Way’s heart woke up.</p>



<p>The black hole, called Sagittarius A*, has been quiet and dim since it was discovered in the 1990s. It’s thought to have been mostly quiescent for eons. But roughly 200 years ago, the black hole, as seen from Earth, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06064-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suddenly brightened as it let out a brief flare of X-rays</a>, researchers report June 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>At about 26,000 light-years away, “Sagittarius A* is the closest supermassive black hole to us,” says astronomer Frédéric Marin of the University of Strasbourg in France. “But it’s dormant.” If the black hole is accreting material from its surrounding disk of gas and dust at all now, it’s at a low rate, making the behemoth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">difficult to observe</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>About 30 years ago, astronomers detected bright X-rays from large gas clouds in the galactic center. One explanation was that at some point, Sagittarius A* shot an X-ray pulse into space after eating some cosmic material, and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-once-glowed-brightly">clouds recorded the afterglow</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/08</em>). But other X-ray sources were possible.</p>



<p>Marin and colleagues used NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite to measure the polarization, or direction, of the X-rays. “This direction can act as a compass, pointing to the source of emission,” Marin says. And it pointed straight at the black hole.</p>



<p>That polarization also suggests that the light came from at least one X-ray pulse roughly 200 years ago, the team says. The X-ray fluorescence indicates that the black hole suddenly grew a million times as bright as it is now. It’s unknown how often such pulses happen.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear what exactly caused Sagittarius A* to flare. “It could be a giant molecular cloud that was slowly accreted, or a very big star that passed by and was accreted all at once,” Marin says. “We don’t know yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-break-internet-save">Quantum computers could break the internet. Here’s how to save it</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Keeping secrets is hard. Kids know it. Celebrities know it. National security experts know it, too.</p>



<p>And it’s about to get even harder.</p>



<p>There’s always someone who wants to get at the juicy details we’d rather keep hidden. Yet at every moment, untold volumes of private information are zipping along internet cables and optical fibers. That information’s privacy relies on encryption, a way to mathematically scramble data to prevent any snoops from deciphering it — even with the help of powerful computers.</p>





<p>But the mathematical basis of these techniques is under threat from a foe that has, until recently, seemed hypothetical: quantum computers.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, scientists realized that these computers could exploit the weird physics of the minuscule realm of atoms and electrons to perform certain types of calculations out of reach for standard computers. That means that once the quantum machines are powerful enough, they could crack the mathematical padlocks on encrypted data, laying bare the world’s secrets.</p>



<p>Today’s quantum computers are far too puny to defeat current security measures. But with more powerful quantum machines being regularly rolled out by the likes of IBM and Google, scientists, governments and others are beginning to take action. Experts are spreading the word that it’s time to prepare for a milestone some are calling Y2Q. That’s the year that quantum computers will gain the ability to crack the encoding schemes that keep electronic communications secure.</p>



<p>“If that encryption is ever broken,” says mathematician Michele Mosca, “it would be a systemic catastrophe.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y2Q is coming. What does it mean?</h4>



<p>Encryption pervades digital life — safeguarding emails, financial and medical data, online shopping transactions and more. Encryption is also woven into a plethora of physical devices that transmit information, from cars to robot vacuums to baby monitors. Encryption even secures infrastructure such as power grids. The tools Y2Q threatens are everywhere. “The stakes are just astronomically high,” says Mosca, of the University of Waterloo in Canada, who is also CEO of the cybersecurity company evolutionQ.</p>



<p>The name Y2Q alludes to the infamous Y2K bug, which threatened to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/year-2000-chip-danger-looms-large">create computer havoc</a> in the year 2000 because software typically used only two digits to mark the year (<em>SN:&nbsp;1/2/99, p. 4</em>). Y2Q is a similarly systemic issue, but in many ways, it’s not a fair comparison. The fix for Y2Q is much more complex than changing how dates are represented, and computers are now even more inextricably entwined into society than two decades ago. Plus, no one knows when Y2Q will arrive.</p>



<p>Confronted with the Y2Q threat, cryptography — the study and the practice of techniques used to encode information — is facing an overhaul. Scientists and mathematicians are now working urgently to prepare for that unknown date by devising new ways of encrypting data that won’t be susceptible to quantum decoding. An effort headed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, aims to release new standards for such post-quantum cryptography algorithms next year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a longer-term effort takes a can’t-beat-’em-join-’em approach: using quantum technology to build a more secure, quantum internet. Scientists around the world are building networks that shuttle quantum information back and forth between cities, chasing the dream of communication that theoretically could be immune to hacking.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How public-key cryptography works</h4>





<p>If you want to share a secret message with someone, you can encrypt it, garbling the information in such a way that it’s possible to decode it later.</p>



<p>Schoolkids might do this with a simple cipher: For example, replace the letter A with the number 1, B with 2 and so on. Anyone who knows this secret key used to encrypt the message can later decode the message and read it — whether it’s the intended recipient or another sneaky classmate.</p>



<p>It’s a simplified example of what’s called symmetric-key cryptography: The same key is used to encode and decode a message. In a more serious communication, the key would be much more complex — essentially impossible for anyone to guess. But in both cases, the same secret key is used to encode and decode.</p>



<p>This strategy was used in cryptography for millennia, says computer scientist Peter Schwabe of the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany. “It was either used in a military context or it was used between lovers that were not supposed to love each other.”</p>



<p>But in the globally connected modern world, symmetric-key cryptography has a problem. How do you get the secret key to someone on the other side of the planet, someone you’ve never met, without anyone else getting their hands on it?</p>



<p>To solve this quandary, in the 1970s cryptographers devised public-key cryptography, which uses special mathematical tricks to solve the symmetric-key conundrum. It uses two different, mathematically related keys. A public key is used to encrypt messages, and a mathematically related private key decodes them. Say Alice wants to send a message to Bob. She looks up his public key and uses it to scramble her communication. Only Bob, with his private key, can decode it. To any snoops that intercept the message, it’s meaningless.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to swap secrets with strangers</h3>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows people in far-flung places who have never met to share secret information. A publicly available key is used to encode the message being sent, and a different but mathematically related private key — known only to the intended recipient — is used to decode the message.</p>

<p>Public-key techniques are also used to create digital signatures. These signatures verify that someone online really is who they say they are, so you know you’re really downloading that new app from Apple, not some nefarious impersonator. Only the owner of a private key can sign the message, but anyone can use the public key to verify its authenticity.</p>



<p>The public-key cryptography that permeates the internet is directly vulnerable to full-scale quantum computers. What’s more, symmetric-key cryptography often relies on public-key cryptography to share the secret key needed to communicate. That puts the majority of internet security under threat.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why quantum computers will threaten public-key cryptography</h4>



<p>If public-key encryption keeps your data hidden away under the floorboards, then to read that information, you need to build a way in. You have to be able to access the data with your private key. “There’s got to be a secret door somewhere in there, where if I knock the right way, it opens up,” Mosca says.</p>



<p>Constructing such a trapdoor demands special mathematical tactics, based on operations that are easy to perform in one direction but hard in the opposite direction. Multiplying two prime numbers together is quick work for a computer, even if the numbers are very large. But it’s much more time-consuming for a computer to calculate the primes from their product. For large enough numbers, it’s impossible to do in a practical amount of time with a standard computer.</p>



<p>The challenge of finding the prime factors of a large number is behind one of the main types of public-key encryption used today, known as RSA. A hacker using a classical computer wouldn’t be able to deduce the private key from the public key. Another math problem, known as the discrete logarithm problem, is a similar one-way street.</p>



<p>These two mathematical problems underlie nearly all of the public-key cryptography in use today. But a sufficiently powerful quantum computer would blow their trapdoors wide open. “All of those public-key algorithms are vulnerable to an attack that can only be carried out by a quantum computer,” says mathematician Angela Robinson of NIST, in Gaithersburg, Md. “Our whole digital world is relying on quantum-vulnerable algorithms.”</p>



<p>This vulnerability came to light in 1994, when mathematician Peter Shor, now at MIT, came up with an algorithm that would allow quantum computers to solve both of these math problems. In quantum machines, the bits, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quarter-century-ago-qubit-was-born">called qubits</a>, can take on values of 0 and 1 simultaneously, a state known as a superposition. And qubits can be linked with one another through the quantum connection called entanglement, enabling new tactics like Shor’s (<em>SN: 7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 34</em>).</p>



<p>“Back then, that was an interesting theoretical paper. Quantum computers were a distant dream,” says mathematician Dustin Moody of NIST, “but it wasn’t a practical threat.” Since then, there’s been a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computing boom</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 28</em>).</p>



<p>The machines are being built using qubits made from various materials — from individual atoms to flecks of silicon to superconductors (which conduct electricity without resistance) — but all calculate according to quantum rules. IBM’s superconducting quantum computer Osprey, for example, has 433 qubits. That’s up from the five qubits of the computer IBM unveiled in 2016. The company plans to roll out one with more than a thousand qubits this year.</p>



<p>That’s still far from the Y2Q threshold: To break RSA encryption, a quantum computer <a href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would need 20&nbsp;million qubits</a>, researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Quantum</em>.</p>



<p>Mosca estimates that in the next 15 years, there’s about a 50&nbsp;percent chance of a quantum computer powerful enough to break standard public-key encryption. That may seem like a long time, but experts estimate that previous major cryptography overhauls have taken around 15 years. “This is not a Tuesday patch,” Mosca says.</p>



<p>The threat is even more pressing because the data we send today could be vulnerable to quantum computers that don’t exist yet. Hackers could harvest encrypted information now, and later decode it once a powerful quantum computer becomes available, Mosca says. “It’s just bad news if we don’t get ahead of this.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">New algorithms could safeguard our security</h4>



<p>Getting ahead of the problem is the aim of Moody, Robinson and others who are part of NIST’s effort to select and standardize post-quantum encryption and digital signatures. Such techniques would have to thwart hackers using quantum machines, while still protecting from classical hacks.</p>



<p>After NIST put out a call for post-quantum algorithms in 2016, the team received dozens of proposed schemes. The researchers sorted through the candidates, weighing considerations including the level of security provided and the computational resources needed for each. Finally, in July 2022, NIST announced four schemes that had risen to the top. Once the final standards for those algorithms are ready in 2024, organizations can begin making the post-quantum leap. Meanwhile, NIST continues to consider additional candidates.</p>



<p>In parallel with NIST’s efforts, others are endorsing the post-quantum endeavor. In May 2022, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put out a memo setting 2035</a> as the goal for U.S. government agencies to go post-quantum. In November, Google announced it is already <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/why-google-now-uses-post-quantum-cryptography-for-internal-comms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using post-quantum cryptography</a> in internal communications.</p>



<p>Several of the algorithms selected by NIST share a mathematical basis — a technique called lattice-based cryptography. It relies on a problem involving describing a lattice, or a grid of points, using a set of arrows, or vectors.</p>



<p>In math, a lattice is described by a set of vectors used to produce it. Consider Manhattan. Even if you’d never seen a map of the city, you could roughly reproduce its grid using two arrows, one the length and direction of an avenue block and the other matching a street block. Discounting the city’s quirks, such as variations in block lengths, you’d just place arrows end-to-end until you’ve mapped out the whole grid.</p>



<p>But there are more complicated sets of vectors that can reproduce the city’s grid. Picture two arrows starting, for example, at Washington Square Park in lower Manhattan, with one pointing to Times Square in Midtown and the other to a neighboring landmark, the Empire State Building. Properly chosen, two such vectors could also be used — with more difficulty — to map out the city’s grid.</p>



<p>A math problem called the shortest vector problem asks: Given a set of long vectors that generate a lattice, what is the shortest vector that can be used as part of a set to produce the grid? If all you knew about the city was the location of those three landmarks, it’d be quite a task to back out the shortest vector corresponding to the city’s blocks.</p>



<p>Now, picture doing that not for a 2-D map, but in hundreds of dimensions. That’s a problem thought to be so difficult that no computer, quantum or classical, could do it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>



<p>The difficulty of that problem is what underlies the strength of several post-quantum cryptography algorithms. In lattice-based cryptography, a short vector is used to create the private key, and the long vectors produce the public key.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help from the shortest vector problem</h3>



<p>Some post-quantum encryption schemes rely on what’s known as the shortest vector problem. Take a set of two long vectors (green on the left). By placing those vectors end-to-end, it’s possible to trace out a grid of points (blue). The shortest vector problem is to find the shortest of the vectors (the horizontal arrow in the grid on the right) that can be used to trace out that same grid. That’s not so hard in two dimensions. But when used for cryptography, the problem must be solved in hundreds of dimensions, a nearly impossible task.</p>

</div>



<p>Other post-quantum schemes NIST considered are based on different math problems. To choose among the options, NIST mathematicians’ chief consideration was the strength of each algorithm’s security. But none of these algorithms are definitively proved to be secure against quantum computers, or even classical ones. One algorithm originally considered by NIST, called SIKE, was later broken. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30589-4_15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It took just 10 minutes to crack on a standard computer</a>, researchers reported in April in <em>Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2023</em>.</p>



<p>Although it might seem like a failure, the SIKE breakdown can be considered progress. The faith in the security of cryptographic algorithms comes from a trial by fire. “The more [that] smart people try to break something and fail, the more confidence we can get that it’s actually hard to break it,” Schwabe says. Some algorithms must perish in the process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A quantum internet could bolster security</h4>



<p>Quantum physics taketh away, but also, it gives. A different quantum technique can allow communication with mathematically proved security. That means a future quantum internet could, theoretically at least, be fully safe from both quantum and classical hacks.</p>



<p>By transmitting photons — particles of light — and measuring their properties upon arrival, it’s possible to generate a shared private key that is verifiably safe from eavesdroppers.</p>



<p>This quantum key distribution, or QKD, relies on a principle of quantum physics called the no-cloning theorem. Essentially, it’s impossible to copy quantum information. Any attempt to do so will alter the original information, revealing that someone was snooping. “Someone who was trying to learn that information would basically leave a fingerprint behind,” says quantum engineer Nolan Bitner of Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill.</p>



<p>This quirk of quantum physics allows two people to share a secret key and, by comparing notes, determine whether the key has been intercepted along the way. If those comparisons don’t match as expected, someone was eavesdropping. The communicators discard their key and start over. If there is no sign of foul play, they can safely use their shared secret key to encrypt their communication and send it over the standard internet, certain of its security. It’s a quantum solution to the quandary of how two parties can share secret keys without ever meeting. There’s no need for a mathematical trapdoor that might be vulnerable to an undiscovered tactic.</p>



<p>But QKD can’t be done over normal channels. It requires quantum networks, in which photons are created, sent zipping along optical fibers and are manipulated at the other end.</p>



<p>Such networks already snake through select cities in the world. One threads through Chicago suburbs from the University of Chicago to Argonne lab and Fermilab in Batavia, for a total of 200&nbsp;kilometers. In China, an extensive network connects cities along a more than 2,000-kilometer backbone that wends from Beijing to Shanghai, along with two quantum satellites that beam photons through the air. A quantum network crisscrosses South Korea, and another links several U.K. cities. There are networks in Tokyo and the Netherlands — the list goes on, with more to come.</p>

<p>Many of these networks are test-beds used by researchers to study the technology outside of a lab. But some are getting real-world use. Banks use China’s network, and South Korea’s links government agencies. Companies such as ID Quantique, based in Switzerland, offer commercial QKD devices.</p>



<p>QKD’s security is mathematically proven, but quantum networks can fall short of that guarantee in practice. The difficulty of creating, transmitting, detecting and storing quantum particles can open loopholes. Devices and networks must be painstakingly designed and tested to ensure a hacker can’t game the system.</p>



<p>And one missing component in particular is holding quantum networks back. “The number one device is quantum memory,” says quantum physicist Xiongfeng Ma of Tsinghua University in Beijing. When sending quantum information over long distances through fibers, particles can easily get lost along the way. For distances greater than about 100 kilometers, that makes quantum communication impractical without the use of way stations that amplify the signal. Such way stations temporarily convert data into classical, rather than quantum, information. That classical step means hackers could target these “trusted nodes” undetected, marring QKD’s pristine security. And it limits what quantum maneuvers the networks can do.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to create pairs of particles that are entangled over long distances in a network like this. But special stations sprinkled throughout the network, called quantum repeaters, could solve the problem by storing information in a quantum memory. To create far-flung entangled particles, scientists could first entangle sets of particles over short distances, storing them in quantum memories at each quantum repeater. Performing certain operations on the entangled particles could leapfrog that entanglement to other particles farther apart. By repeating this process, particles could be entangled across extended distances.</p>



<p>But, thanks in part to quantum particles’ tendency to be easily perturbed by outside influences, scientists have yet to develop a practical quantum repeater. “When that does appear, it’s likely to catalyze global quantum networks,” says David Awschalom, a physicist at the University of Chicago. Not only will such technologies allow longer distances and better security for QKD, but they will also enable more complicated tasks, like entangling distant quantum computers to allow them to work together.</p>



<p>A European effort called the Quantum Internet Alliance aims to build a network with quantum repeaters by the end of 2029, creating a backbone stretching over 500 kilometers, in addition to two metropolitan-scale networks. The effort is “super challenging,” says physicist and computer scientist Stephanie Wehner of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. “We are on a moon shot mission.” Eventually, scientists envision a global quantum internet.</p>



<p>Awschalom imagines the networks becoming accessible to all. “Wouldn’t it be great to be able to go to a public library and be able to get onto a quantum network?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="621" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4.jpg" alt="photo of a ground station in Xinglong, China" class="wp-image-3129043" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4-635x383.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4-746x450.jpg 746w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4-309x186.jpg 309w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4-768x463.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061723_quantum_inline4-962x580.jpg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129043">A link between a ground station (red and green lasers shown in this time-lapse image) and the quantum satellite Micius shows the potential for long-distance secure communications.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does the future of cryptography look like?</h4>



<p>QKD and post-quantum cryptography are complementary. “In order to overcome the threat of the quantum computers we need both,” says physicist Nicolas Gisin of the University of Geneva and cofounder of ID Quantique. When people are exchanging information that doesn’t require the utmost security — say, using a mobile phone to post cat memes on Reddit — post-quantum cryptography will be more practical, as it doesn’t demand a to-and-fro of individual quantum particles. But “there are really situations where we want to make sure that the security is going to last … for several decades, and post-quantum cryptography cannot guarantee that,” Gisin says.</p>



<p>Eventually, quantum techniques could allow for even more advanced types of security, such as blind quantum computing. In that scheme, a user could compute something on a remote quantum computer without anyone being able to determine what they’re computing. A technique called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/communicating-covertly-goes-quantum">covert quantum communication</a> would allow users to communicate securely while hiding that they were exchanging messages at all. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">device-independent QKD</a> would ensure security even if the devices used to communicate are potentially flawed (<em>SN:&nbsp;8/27/22, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>The appeal of such extreme secrecy, of course, depends upon whether you’re the secret-keeper or the snoop. In the United States, government agencies like the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency have argued that encryption makes it difficult to eavesdrop on criminals or terrorists. The agencies have a history of advocating for back doors that would let them in on encrypted communications — or building in secret back doors.</p>



<p>But quantum techniques, done properly, can prevent anyone from intercepting secrets, even powerful government agencies.</p>



<p>“It’s interesting to think about a world where, in principle, one might imagine perfect security,” Awschalom says. “Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing?”</p>

<p>Clarivate, the company that assigns journals Impact Factors, this year will not give four journals updated versions of the controversial metric used by many institutions and publications as a shorthand for quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journals will remain indexed in Web of Science, but won’t have an Impact Factor for this year in Clarivate’s 2023 Journal Citation Reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Clarivate, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mtq"><em>Marketing Theory</em></a>, a SAGE title, has been suppressed for self-citation. Three other journals have been suppressed for citation stacking, sometimes referred to as “citation cartels” or “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">citation rings</a>.” The other journals are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127390"></span>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dgsgenetika.org.rs/publications/"><em>Genetika</em></a> (the Serbian Genetics Society)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.isisn.org/Bioscience_Research.htm"><em>Bioscience Research</em></a><em> </em>(Innovative Scientific Information &amp; Services Network)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/toc/jbibn/current"><em>Bioinspired, Biomimetic, and Nanobiomaterials</em></a> (ICE Publishing)</li>
</ul>



<p>Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, told Retraction Watch that Clarivate’s decision not to give <em>Genetika</em> an Impact Factor this year was “truly devastating.” Milasin also disputed that the journal had participated in a citation stacking scheme:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We tried to explain to the Clarivate staff that we were absolutely unaware of the situation with the citations and that Genetika did not have any kind of relationship with the journal Bioscience Research nor with authors of cited and citing papers (we never heard of that journal). We neither had any influence on the editorial policy of the Bioscience Research journal nor the authors’ decision which papers to cite. Also, none of the papers published in Genetika in 2021 and 2022 cited any article from Bioscience Research.</p>



<p>So, basically, it seems to me quite unfair to be punished for something that was beyond our control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Milasin said that the suppression decision came in spite of the editors of <em>Genetika</em> offering to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, to blacklist authors who “misused the papers published in Genetika by citing them unjustifiably,” as well as the authors of the cited papers, and to no longer ask scientists identified as engaging in peer review misconduct to review for the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The listing for <em>Genetika</em> in Clarivate’s Master Journal List indicates that the publication is “On Hold,” meaning that “concerns have been raised about the quality of the content,” and Clarivate is reevaluating whether the title meets its <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">selection criteria</a> for inclusion in Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors and publishers of the other suppressed journals have not yet responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">suppressed three journals</a> for self-citation. In 2021, it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">suppressed 10</a>, and 33 the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">year before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Clarivate refreshed its Master Journal List in March, the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisted 50 journals</a> for failing to meet quality criteria, including 19 from the open-access publisher Hindawi. Delisted journals are no longer included on the Master Journal List or indexed in Web of Science, and Clarivate does not count their citations or assign them Impact Factors. All these changes can have negative effects for authors, because universities often use the metrics to judge researchers’ work for decisions about tenure and promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, later announced that it would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">close four of the journals</a> that had been delisted, as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">retract approximately 1,200 articles</a> for compromised peer review. The company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publication</a> of Hindawi special issues for three months ending in mid-January, and lost $9 million in revenue as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">published a list</a> of 82 journals Clarivate delisted in March, which also included those removed for production-related rather than editorial reasons, the company <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/building-trust-through-transparency-our-pledge-to-provide-more-clarity-around-web-of-science-journal-coverage/">announced</a> that it would publish the changes it makes to the Master Journal List each month, which it had not done before. <s>No journals have been delisted this month.</s></p>



<p>This year’s Journal Citation Report includes 9,136 titles that have an Impact Factor for the first time, following Clarivate’s <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/clarivate-announces-changes-to-the-2023-journal-citation-reports-release/">decision</a> to expand the metric to journals in its Arts and Humanities Citation Index and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The company also is now publishing Impact Factors to one decimal place, rather than three. The move “introduces more ties, which will encourage users to consider additional indicators and descriptive data when comparing journals,” the company said in a press release.</p>



<p>Update, 7/28/23, 1430 UTC: Andreas Chatzidakis, one of the editors in chief of <em>Marketing Theory</em>, said that the journal was in the process of appealing the decision.</p>



<p>Update, 7/29/23, 1740 UTC: After publication, Clarivate informed us that their earlier statement that no journals had been delisted this month was not accurate, though none had been delisted with the release of the Journal Citation Reports. Clarivate delisted the <em>Russian Law Journal,</em> which we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/26/three-journals-web-domains-expired-then-major-indexes-pointed-to-hijacked-versions/" target="_blank">had reported</a> had been hijacked,for editorial reasons when it refreshed the Master Journal List earlier this month.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flowers-pollinate-honeybees-low-seeds">Flowers pollinated by honeybees make lower-quality seeds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flowers pollinated by honeybees make fewer and lower-quality seeds than flowers visited by other pollinators.</p>



<p>That could be because honeybees spend more time buzzing between flowers of the same plant than other pollinators do. As a result, more of the plant’s own pollen is deposited back on itself, leading to more inbred seeds, researchers report June 28 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Honeybees command a lot of attention in insect conservation circles, in part because they are important for pollinating our food supply. But the findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing pollinators like wild, native bees, moths and butterflies in conservation efforts too, the researchers say.</p>





<p>For the study, ecologists Joshua Kohn and Dillon Travis, both of the University of California, San Diego, painstakingly tracked the pollination of flowers from three native plant species — white sage (<em>Salvia apiana</em>), black sage (<em>Salvia mellifera</em>) and <em>Phacelia distans — </em>in San Diego County<em>.</em></p>



<p>Often Travis sat for hours waiting for a single pollinator, honeybee or wild bee or otherwise, to come and go from a flower. Then he put a mesh bag on the flower and came back later to collect its seeds. He also collected the seeds of flowers he had cross- or self-pollinated by hand — also covered with a bag to prevent any new visitors.</p>



<p>Despite boasting over 650 native bee species, San Diego County’s most frequent flower visitor is the western honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>), which isn’t native, the researchers say. “Whatever native plants [are] blooming abundantly, they’re just dripping with honeybees,” Kohn says.</p>



<p>Back in the greenhouse, the team grew the seeds, analyzing characteristics that reflected their&nbsp; quality, such as how many seeds germinated and survived and how many leaves or flowers seedlings grew.</p>



<p>The white sage and <em>P. distans</em> plants produced roughly half the amount of seeds from flowers pollinated by honeybees compared with other pollinators, mostly native insects. And <em>P. distans</em> seeds from honeybee-pollinated plants grew into seedlings with fewer flowers. The black sage plants didn’t get enough non-honeybee visitors for comparison but did produce fewer seeds when pollinated by honeybees compared with cross-pollination by hand.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that honeybees visited about twice as many flowers on one plant before moving to the next than the average of other pollinators. That suggests the fewer, lower-quality seeds may arise because honeybees transfer more pollen between flowers of the same plant, resulting in more inbred seeds. Other pollinators more often flitted between different plants, probably transferring more diverse pollen.</p>



<p>The new finding is concerning, Travis says. Because of honeybees&#8217; methodical pollination habit, it’s likely the results are relevant to other plants. But it’s difficult to know how things will play out in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One potential consequence could be that native plant populations decline as subsequent generations become more inbred, reducing biodiversity. It would be illuminating to see how inbred plants fare after several generations, says Maria van Dyke, a pollinator ecologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>For now, this study is an example of why more conservation focus should be on native bees and other pollinators, which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-bees-pollinators-billion-yields-six-u-s-crops">vital to ecosystems and agriculture</a>, in addition to honeybees, van Dyke says. (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Honeybees, wild bees and many other insects are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/much-worlds-honey-now-contains-pesticides-harm-bees">threatened by pesticide use</a> and climate change (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It is time to actually shift our dependence for pollination from largely honeybees to … native species as well,” says Jaya Sravanthi Mokkapati, an entomologist at Penn State University. Growing native flowers is one way to support native pollinators, she says, as is adding nesting habitat — like twigs and decaying wood — to yards.</p>

<p>A neurology researcher in Australia is no longer employed at his former university in the midst of a research misconduct investigation, Retraction Watch has learned. And the work of a co-author at another institution also is being assessed for possible research misconduct after sleuths alerted the university to comments on PubPeer about potential data issues in his papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-014-9557-9">Changes in Cathepsin D and Beclin-1 mRNA and protein expression by the excitotoxin quinolinic acid in human astrocytes and neurons</a>,” was published in <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> in 2014 and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Gregory Konat, retracted the paper because several of the western blots appeared to be duplicated and he no longer had confidence in the results, according to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-023-01241-3">retraction notice</a>. The six authors are researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Macquarie University and St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127373"></span>



<p>All but one of them agreed with the retraction; first author <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/our-people/dr-nady-braidy">Nady Braidy</a>, a senior research fellow at UNSW’s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, did not respond to correspondence from the editor, according to the notice. The corresponding author, Gilles Guillemin, is no longer employed as a neuroscience professor at Macquarie University as the institution investigates some of his work, Retraction Watch has learned. Guillemin is a <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2009388">Member of the Order of Australia</a>.</p>



<p>Anonymous commenters on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/33ECDD6D3F1978854948927C58B5FA#1">first pointed out</a> potential data anomalies in the paper in September 2021. Two Australian researchers, <a href="https://neura.edu.au/researchers/prof-simon-gandevia">Simon Gandevia</a>, deputy director of NeuRA, and <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a>, an honorary research fellow and retired deputy director of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, contacted the editor of <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> to ask for an investigation into the paper in October 2021, citing the PubPeer comments. (Vaux is also on the board of directors of Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, the Center for Scientific Integrity.)</p>



<p>In March 2023, the journal’s publisher wrote back to Gandevia confirming that an investigation was underway by their in-house research integrity group. Three months later, the paper was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux says he became interested in the paper after reading a post about Guillemin on Leonid Schneider’s <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2021/09/07/none-of-the-work-has-not-been-done-in-my-lab/">blog</a>. By <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGuillemin%252c%2bGilles%2bJ">our count</a>, one of Guillemin’s papers has previously been retracted, and another marked with an expression of concern. Vaux noticed several papers that were flagged for potential data duplication <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Gilles+Guillemin">on PubPeer</a> were also co-authored with Braidy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don&#8217;t know which of the authors are responsible, whether it&#8217;s Braidy or whether it&#8217;s one of the other authors,” Vaux says. “We&#8217;re just ringing the alarm bell.”</p>



<p>This retraction is Braidy’s first. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9673782/">Two of his</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00134/full">publications</a> have been corrected, one has received an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263555">expression of concern</a>, and another is <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/10905/text/">under investigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I saw all of these postings about all of these papers,” Vaux says. “I thought well, given past history, it&#8217;s quite likely that the universities won&#8217;t take any action unless somebody makes an official complaint.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Gandevia &#8212; who has taken an <a href="http://retractions.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active interest in scientific integrity</a> &#8212; and Vaux alerted UNSW to the PubPeer comments about Braidy’s papers in September 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter to several university officials they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The evidence presented on PubPeer is very difficult to dismiss as the result of chance of innocent mistake, leaving the remaining explanation deliberate falsification or fabrication of data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2023, Vaux was told that the case was still in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/researchmisconductproc.pdf">preliminary assessment stage</a> – an assessment of whether the complaint constitutes a breach of the university’s code and requires further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He wrote to Attilla Brungs, UNSW’s vice chancellor, in March, alleging that the university’s handling of the case was not timely and constituted a breach of the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018">Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brungs wrote back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I do appreciate that this investigation is taking a significant amount of time, as warranted by its complexity. I would also like to highlight again for you that UNSW has a far more extensive and rigorous preliminary assessment process that perhaps some other institutions do not have. This allows UNSW to generally ensure more efficient outcomes in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we emailed Brungs to follow up on the case, a spokesperson for UNSW responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>UNSW Sydney is aware of the concerns, and we are managing these concerns in accordance with our Research Misconduct Procedure. It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I think the problem is that the university&#8217;s office for handling research misconduct allegations is not competent,” Vaux said.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In September 2021, Vaux also forwarded the PubPeer comments on Guillemin’s papers to the research integrity office at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, Macquarie University’s director of research ethics and integrity wrote to Vaux that their preliminary assessment had found ten of Guillemin’s papers had a potential breach of the university’s research code, and that four of them required further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for the university wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Macquarie University is aware of the concerns, and they are being managed in accordance with the University&#8217;s Research Code Procedure. We note that Professor Gilles Guillemin has ceased employment at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have not received confirmation of when or why Guillemin left Macquarie. According to the spokesperson, “it is not the University&#8217;s place to disclose that information.” But since we started reporting this story on June 14, the webpage for Guillemin’s lab is now <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research/our-people2/genetics">no longer accessible</a> and has been removed from the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research">website</a> of Macquarie University’s Centre for Motor Neuron Disease Research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Universities in Australia self-regulate cases of research misconduct. Vaux says the <a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-an-office-for-research-integrity-to-catch-up-with-the-rest-of-the-world-176019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of a national office for research integrity</a> makes this process inefficient. “Australia should be embarrassed because we&#8217;re behind, falling further behind the rest of the world,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">Megalodon sharks may have become megapredators by running hot</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massive, megatoothed <em>Otodus megalodon</em> ran hot — the ancient shark was at least somewhat warm-blooded, new evidence shows.</p>



<p>Chemical measurements from fossil <em>O. megalodon</em> teeth suggest <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2218153120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sharks had higher body temperatures than their surrounding waters</a>, researchers report June 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Analyses of carbon and oxygen in the teeth of these and other sharks, both living and extinct, revealed that the giant shark’s body temperature was about 7 degrees Celsius warmer than estimated seawater temperatures at the time.</p>





<p>That warm-bloodedness may have been a double-edged sword. The trait may have helped <em>O. megalodon</em> become a swift, fearsome apex predator and grow up to 20 meters long, making it among the largest carnivores to ever live on Earth. But the shark’s voracious appetite may have also spelled the species’ ultimate doom. Gigantism has a high metabolic cost, says UCLA marine biogeochemist Robert Eagle: Bigger bodies require more food, and the massive sharks may have been particularly vulnerable to extinction when the climate changed and food became scarcer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mammals are well known for being able to metabolically elevate and maintain their body heat, even in colder environments, a trait called endothermy. But some fish lineages, both living and extinct, are capable of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-marine-reptiles-losing-their-cool">regional endothermy</a>, maintaining some body parts at higher temperatures than the surrounding water (<em>SN: 6/10/10</em>). For example, many modern lamniform sharks — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">the group that includes species like mako and great white sharks</a> — have this ability (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>).</p>



<p>“Indeed, regional endothermy is one of just two known evolutionary pathways toward giant sizes in sharks,” says Jack Cooper, a paleobiologist at Swansea University in Wales who was not involved in the new study. (The other, Cooper says, is filter feeding, employed by gentler giants such as whale sharks.)</p>



<p>Scientists have long thought that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">megalodon was regionally endothermic</a>, Eagle says, based on a variety of evidence such as estimates of the megashark’s body shape, as well as its likely swimming speeds and energy requirements. The shark was also known to have a very large geographic range around the globe, actively hunting in colder as well as warmer waters, which argues for some warm-bloodedness. A recent study by Cooper and colleagues that modeled the shark’s body in 3-D estimated that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adult <em>O. megalodon</em> was a transoceanic superpredator</a>, able to swim faster than any living shark species and fully consume prey the size of today’s largest predators.</p>



<p>The question, Eagle adds, isn’t really whether <em>O. megalodon</em> was endothermic — it’s <em>how</em> endothermic it was. In particular, the team wondered how its body temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-megatooth-sharks-food-chain-apex-predator-ocean">compared to one of its primary ocean competitors</a>, which appeared on the scene late in the shark’s reign: <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, better known as the great white shark (<em>SN: 6/29/22</em>).</p>



<p><em>O. megalodon</em> appeared around 23 million years ago and went extinct sometime between 3.5 million and 2.6 million years ago. Great white sharks emerged around 3.5 million years ago, and they competed for food with their massive cousins. One hypothesis has been that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">this competition helped drive <em>O. megalodon</em> to extinction</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/22</em>). Climate change during the Pliocene Epoch, which spanned 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, led to a collapse in the population of marine mammals, the primary food source for both sharks.</p>



<p>“The <em>Carcharodon</em> were much smaller … and persisted, whereas the <em>Otodus</em> went extinct,” Eagle says. “<em>Carcharodon</em> probably had a lower requirement for food to maintain its metabolic rate.”</p>



<p>To get more direct evidence of the body temperatures of these shark species, and therefore better understand their respective metabolisms, the team turned to the only fossils the sharks have left behind: their teeth.</p>



<p>Fossilized teeth offer a wealth of encapsulated environmental data. The tooth enamel contains both heavier and lighter forms, or isotopes, of carbon, oxygen and other elements, and the relative abundances of these isotopes is linked to body temperature. Eagle and his colleagues used a technique that examines the abundance of “clumped isotopes” — bonded-together heavy forms of carbon (carbon-13) and oxygen (oxygen-18) — as a kind of ancient geochemical thermometer. The abundance of these bonds is “only affected by temperature,” offering a more unambiguous thermometer than using a single element’s isotopic abundance, Eagle says.</p>



<p>The team used this technique on teeth from the different sharks, as well as fossil samples from other ancient ocean contemporaries including whales and mollusks. (Mollusks, being entirely cold-blooded, represent the ocean water temperature, Eagle says). The data show that both sharks were a bit endothermic, but not only was&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>’s average body temperature (about 27⁰ C) higher than its surrounding waters, it was also higher than the average body temperature of great whites (about 22⁰ C) living in similar waters. Neither shark was as warm-blooded as marine mammals, such as the whale groups <em>Odontoceti</em> and <em>Mysticeti</em>, the team determined.</p>





<p>It’s “a very interesting finding, and it is fantastic that we have more evidence for regional endothermy in megalodon,” Cooper says. <em>O. megalodon’s</em> higher body temperature would have allowed it “to swim further and faster, increasing its chances of encountering prey,” he says. “But it also means that if food availability declines, megalodon would not have been able to meet its huge energetic requirements.” And when changing sea levels in the Pliocene led to a decline in the sharks’ prey about 3 million years ago, “it may well have starved into extinction.”</p>



<p>Eagle and colleagues are now delving into the chicken-or-egg question of which came first for <em>O. megalodon</em>: warm-bloodedness or apex predator status. “You need a high trophic level to become gigantic,” Eagle says. But is warm-bloodedness necessary to get to that high trophic level (apex predator status)? “We’re hoping to fit it all together into an evolutionary story as to what drives what.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper entitled &quot;Few-shot Object Counting with Similarity-Aware Feature Enhancement&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This work studies the problem of few-shot object counting, which counts the number of
exemplar objects (i.e., described by one or several support images) occurring in the query
image. The major challenge lies in that the target objects can be densely packed in the
query image, making it hard to recognize every single one. To tackle the obstacle, we
propose a novel learning block, equipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature
enhancement module. Concretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a
score map by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score maps
regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across both the
exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable similarity map. We
then enhance the query feature with the support features by employing the developed point-
wise similarities as the weighting coefficients. Such a design encourages the model to
inspect the query image by focusing more on the regions akin to the support images,
leading to much clearer boundaries between different objects. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks and training setups suggest that we surpass the state-of-the-art
methods by a sufficiently large margin. For instance, on a recent large-scale FSC-147
dataset, we surpass the state-of-the-art method by improving the mean absolute error from
22.08 to 14.32 (35%↑). Code has been released in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount">https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, are seeking to establish a multi-stakeholder working group to identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing. The aims of this working group and the eligibility criteria that interested parties must meet in order to apply are outlined below.</p>



<p>We anticipate that the group will consist of a maximum of twelve individuals and will represent the three key stakeholders &ndash; funders, institutions/library consortia and publishers &ndash; in roughly equal proportions.</p>



<p>Once established, the working group is expected to convene up to six times. The key outcome from this collaborative effort will be the development of a model (or multiple models) that, if implemented, would enable equitable participation in knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>Interested parties should apply using the form available at <a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup">https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup</a>. <strong>Applications must be submitted by 25th August 2023.</strong></p>



<p>The organising committee will review the applications and strive to ensure a well-balanced representation of different stakeholders within the working group. Efforts will also be made to achieve a broad and diverse membership. The first meeting of the working group will be held by videoconferenceon Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> September, from 14.00 BST to 15.30 BST.</p>



<h2><strong>Multi-stakeholder working group overarching aims</strong></h2>



<ol type="1"><li>To identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing</li><li>To consider how the &lsquo;per unit&rsquo; payment model (i.e. APCs) can be replaced by more equitable payment models</li><li>To explore how funds made available by research funders to support Open Access can be used to best support a non-APC publishing ecosystem</li><li>To address the possible unintended consequences of publishing funding streams being locked up in individual grants</li><li>To encourage Open Science practices</li></ol>



<h2><a></a><strong>Background: from Open Access to Equitable Participation</strong></h2>



<p>The OA movement aimed to provide equitable access to research outputs. The push to include the cost of publication in research budgets was intended to reduce the overall cost of access to published research.<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Twenty years on, what we see is that:</p>



<ul><li>APCs are established as the predominant OA business model in those countries /regions/ disciplines where this economic argument worked but also where they create barriers to participation for those with limited funds.</li><li>The rate of article growth is leading to ever-increasing costs for funders and research-intensive institutions.</li><li>The article embedded as the research output of value, blocking progress towards an Open Science ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>Viewed through an economic lens, separating responsibility for choice (the researcher) from responsibility for payment (the librarian or funder) creates a dysfunctional system, as has been raised by funders, including Research England. Giving researchers responsibility for the budget to cover the cost of their publications on a &lsquo;publication-by-publication&rsquo; basis, at first sight, appears to address this problem. However, this approach overlooks the deeper incentive system at work while simultaneously negating the ability of libraries or funders to engage in collective negotiation on researchers&rsquo; behalf.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>The incentives problem</strong></h2>



<p>We continue to operate in a world where:</p>



<ul><li>The majority of research outputs are not accessible, either because they are behind a paywall (in the case of articles) or because they are not shared (non-article outputs).</li><li>The research assessment and incentive systems rely on numbers: number of articles published and Journal Impact Factors (or journal names/&rsquo;prestige&rsquo;) in a hypercompetitive environment that rewards quantity and prestige (or falsely equates it with quality).</li></ul>



<p>These factors reinforce each other, leading to a self-perpetuating state in which the research community feels shackled and is resistant to change. The current model, firmly centred on the event of publication of an article&rsquo;s Version of Record (VoR) as the desired outcome of research and marker of scientific achievement, exacerbates this problem.</p>



<p>In this current system, the majority of scholarly publishers operate, in the words of Uli Dirnagl,<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> as &lsquo;an industry mining the currency of the academic reputation economy&rsquo; and, as such, &lsquo;a lifeline for those who want to keep the status quo.&rsquo; Publishers defend themselves from this criticism by positioning themselves to be in the service of the research community, unable to move until researchers change.</p>



<p>Of course, none of us is free of constraints and incentives: funders need to show that they have invested in worthwhile research; institutions need to generate funding income and need the prestige of researchers and research outputs to attract students; researchers need money, infrastructure and support networks to carry out research; all publishers need a revenue stream, submissions and stakeholder partnerships for sustainability and stewardship of the community&rsquo;s trust. And everyone in the system expects a salary and recognition in some form for work done.</p>



<h3><a></a><strong>What are we aiming for?</strong></h3>



<p>APCs have got us this far. They have usefully shown that OA is possible. But they create perverse incentives, administrative expenses, and burden for researchers, and they embed the article as the primary research artefact. Waivers are not a sustainable solution: researchers do not want to be viewed as &ldquo;charitable cases&rdquo; in need of funds.</p>



<p>At the same time, libraries unintentionally perpetuate this situation, with existing (decreasing) budgets predominantly going towards the largest publishers via &ldquo;transformative agreements&rdquo;, a model which locks in the APC/published unit payments and locks out those publishers trying to progress different (more equitable) OA business models.</p>



<p>So, if we weren&rsquo;t &lsquo;starting from here&rsquo;, how would we design a model, or models, to support born-digital Open Science?</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>What can research funders, publishers and libraries/consortia do to drive change?</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we outline what the three key stakeholders in scholarly communication &ndash; funders, publishers and institutions &ndash; can do to drive change and develop new publishing models and arrangements that are not based on per unit payment systems such as APCs.</p>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Research funders and research performing organisations</u></strong></h4>



<p>Although many research funders are providing financial support to cover publication costs for articles which arise from their funding, in many cases, this funding is held in the research budget.</p>



<p>However, if we are to move away from a per-unit business model &ndash; and empower institutions to negotiate arrangements which are non-APC based and have equity at their core &ndash; funders will need to explore how their funds can be made accessible to institutions (and not tied up in individual grants).</p>



<p>Research funders interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ensure that funds made available to cover publication fees are NOT allocated to individual research grants but instead are aggregated and directed to those who procure publishing services, typically the university library.</li><li>Incentivise Open Science behaviours in research dissemination in line with Open Science best practices and <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/">research assessment reform</a> by emphasising in the grant application process that all research outputs &ndash; preprints, articles, data, peer review reports, methods etc. &ndash; are valuable and will be recognised via the research assessment process.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Publishers</u></strong></h4>



<p>Publishers are another key stakeholder, as ultimately, it is in their gift to develop and implement new business models which are not based on APCs.</p>



<p>Publishers interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to supporting <strong>all </strong>the actions below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Developing financially transparent business models which are not based on &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; payments (such as APCs) and which place equity at their core.</li><li>Supporting Open Science practices, for example, by enabling the publication of a wide variety of research outputs, including data, negative findings etc.</li><li>Reimagining quality assessment and peer review processes, for example, by supporting journal independent peer review.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Libraries/consortia</u></strong></h4>



<p>The third key stakeholder for this working group is libraries and library consortia. They are key players in negotiating fully OA publishing agreements and thus can play a critical role in supporting the move to non-APC based business models.</p>



<p>Libraries/consortia interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate ways in which they are already working toward their implementation:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Allocate a growing portion of (aggregated) budgetary spend for OA business models, which are not based on a per published unit&rsquo; payments and which place global equity at their core.</li><li>Support and facilitate Open Science practices, for example, by encouraging the sharing/deposition of a wide range of research outputs.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong>Potential questions for the group to consider</strong></h4>



<ul><li>What other stakeholder groups might need to be involved in the discussion?</li><li>What does an equitable business model look like?</li><li>How can each stakeholder group facilitate business models that move &ldquo;beyond the article&rdquo; and &ldquo;beyond APCs?&rdquo;</li><li>What are the costs to each stakeholder group of swimming against the current tide of an APC/article-based economy? What incentives are barriers to change?</li><li>What are the current financial flows? What would need to change in terms of processes to enable new agreements to work?</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><a href="#_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> As the PLOS founders stated: &lsquo;Because publishing is an integral part of the research process, a natural alternative to the subscription model is to consider the significant but relatively small costs of open-access publication as one of the fundamental costs of doing research&hellip; If these research sponsors also paid the essential costs of publication&mdash;amounting, by most estimates, to less than 1% of the total spent on sponsored research (statistics found at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036.sd001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036.sd001</a>)&mdash;we would retain a robust and competitive publishing industry and gain the benefit of universal open access.&rsquo; Brown PO, Eisen MB, Varmus HE (2003) Why PLoS Became a Publisher.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trick-snow-flies-survive-self-amputation">A grisly trick helps snow flies survive freezing: self-amputation</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few years ago, John Tuthill was trail running in the Cascade mountains in Washington state when he spotted something dark skittering across the snow.</p>



<p>It was about the size of a wild blueberry, with an elongated body and six legs that moved in a blur.</p>



<p>Tuthill was surprised to see an insect out and about on that cold October day. “I was kind of blown away that there was this animal out running around,” says Tuthill, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was a <em>Chionea</em> fly, he later learned. Also known as a snow fly, it could somehow walk around at temperatures well below what most other insects can tolerate.</p>





<p>Now, Tuthill and colleagues have shown that a grisly trick helps snow flies survive sub-zero conditions. When a leg begins to freeze, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.29.541388v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the insects can rapidly self-amputate it</a>, preventing ice crystals from creeping up into their bodies, the team reports in a paper posted online May 30 at bioRxiv.org.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snow flies may drop one or more legs to prevent themselves from freezing. Even missing multiple limbs, one fly (shown here) can navigate over snow in the wild.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many animal species, including spiders, lizards and crabs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can drop a limb or tail</a> to escape a predator (<em>SN: 2/17/22</em>), but the new work is the first to show an animal using this life-saving measure in response to the cold, says Christine Miller, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The study describes “a new phenomenon that hadn’t been documented before and a very interesting species that we know very little about.”</p>



<p>Snow flies are a type of flightless crane fly, relatives of the “big, spindly, goofy-looking flies that you see bumbling around in your house,” Tuthill says. The insects, which can live up to two months, aren’t easy to study: They can’t be bred in the lab, and they’re tough to collect from the wild. Snow flies can live in alpine areas that are difficult for people to reach, where the threat of avalanche looms.</p>



<p>The best way to find them, Tuthill says, is to spend a lot of time wandering around, looking at snow. Backcountry skiing fit the bill. In an eight-hour trip, he says, “probably seven hours of that is walking slowly uphill.” From 2020 to 2022, he, his wife, and some friends and volunteers collected hundreds of snow flies, scooping them into plastic tubes they brought back or mailed to Tuthill’s lab. Most of the snow flies that arrived alive came from excursions in Washington.</p>



<p>Tuthill’s team used a thermal camera to record 77 snow flies as they walked on cold plates. The insects kept trekking even when their body temperature fell to an average of –7° Celsius, the researchers found. But more than half of the snow flies tested dropped at least one leg during the experiments.</p>



<p>A sharp-eyed research tech, Dominic Golding, noticed a temperature spike in the flies’ legs just before they fell off. That spike is a sign of ice formation, Tuthill says. Liquid water releases heat as it crystallizes into ice. Neurons in the leg may sense this temperature shift and trigger amputation, preventing the icy crystals from spreading, the team suggests. The flies “have about half a second to get rid of their leg before that wave of ice crashes into their body and then freezes all of their internal organs,” he says.</p>



<p>Snow flies didn’t lose their limbs when the researchers tugged on them — only in response to freezing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thermal camera can pick up the moment ice begins to form in a snow fly’s leg and track when the insect self-amputates it. Colors represent temperatures, shown from warmer (yellow) to colder (purple).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other animals have devised different strategies to fend off frost, says Katie Marshall, an entomologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Some insects pump out antifreeze proteins; certain snails and frogs simply withstand ice forming in their bodies.</p>





<p>“The cool thing about snow flies is that they don’t actually follow either strategy,” says Marshall, who provided feedback on the team’s manuscript, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. They let ice form in their legs, she says, and “self-amputate to get rid of it, which is just completely strange to me.”</p>



<p>Snow flies that amputated their gelid limbs survived more than a minute longer than flies that didn’t, the team found. That extra time may not seem like much. But in the wild, when night is falling and the temperature is dropping and the insects are “looking furiously for a place to hunker down,” Tuthill says, it could be the difference between life and death.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-cosmic-dawn-julian-munoz-scientists-to-watch">Julian Muñoz has a ‘ruler’ that could size up the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Julian Muñoz has come up with a ruler to measure the early universe.</p>



<p>A theoretical physicist, Muñoz studies the distant, dim period in the universe’s history known as cosmic dawn. That’s when stars first began flickering on, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, infusing the universe with initial glimmers of starlight and forming the first galaxies.</p>



<p>Before the first stars, the universe was cold and dark — as Muñoz describes it, “boring.” Then, starlight began to reshape the universe. “It is a very dramatic epoch,” says Muñoz, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>That epoch is also poorly understood. Cosmic dawn is so unexplored that Muñoz compares it to an uncharted area on early maps of Earth. There, Muñoz says, “there could be dragons.” By studying this era, he hopes to reveal the behavior of one dragon of the cosmos, dark matter, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">inscrutable substance</a> whose mass binds galaxies.</p>



<p>But to understand the cosmos, scientists have to be able to measure it. Looking far into space means looking deep into the past. The trouble is our 2-D view of the sky doesn’t readily reveal how far away things are. “When we look at the night sky, we’ve got no depth perception,” says cosmologist Adrian Liu of McGill University in Montreal.</p>





<p>Scientists have devised a variety of methods to get a handle on distances, including standard candles and standard rulers — objects of known brightness or length. If you know how bright an object is (compared with how bright it appears) or you know how long a particular feature is on the sky (compared with its apparent length), you can tell how far away it is. A ruler looks smaller from 20 meters away than from 10 meters away, and a 20-watt lightbulb looks dimmer the farther away it is. The same applies over cosmic distances.</p>



<p>Scientists use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-one-way-explode-star">certain types of exploding stars</a>, for example, to estimate distances, because the blasts put out a predictable light show (<em>SN: 5/8/12</em>). Standard rulers or standard candles can be used to trace out how far away other objects of interest are and reveal how rapidly the universe has expanded over its history.</p>



<p>But none of the known standard objects reach back to the cosmic dawn era. That’s where Muñoz’s ruler comes in. “This ability to reach that far back,” Liu says, “that’s the really valuable thing.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sizing up cosmic dawn</h4>



<p>No one has ever seen a conclusive signature of cosmic dawn — the very first galaxies are too distant to observe directly. But there’s another way to spot cosmic dawn’s effects, one that’s been a long-sought target for astronomers. As the first stars formed, their light heated the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing it to absorb light with a wavelength of 21 centimeters, a number that results from the separation between energy levels in hydrogen atoms. Observing that 21-centimeter absorption signal is the aim of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, or HERA, collaboration, an effort that Muñoz and Liu both work on, using a radio telescope in South Africa.</p>



<p>If it can be detected, this absorption signal should have <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.131301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtle, ring-shaped patterns imprinted in it</a>, Muñoz reported in 2019 in <em>Physical Review Letters.</em></p>

Regions with more absorption (red) correspond to denser pockets of stars, compared with sparsely populated regions with less absorption (blue). Sparse areas tend to be separated by distances of about half a billion light-years (arrow indicates one example); the same goes for dense areas.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125372">J.B. Muñoz</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Those patterns, the basis of his ruler, result from the differing behavior of dark matter and normal matter during an even earlier period, less than 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Sound waves careening through the plasma at that time would have pushed normal matter to high speeds while leaving dark matter at a standstill.</p>



<p>This mismatch in velocities affected where galaxies formed during the later cosmic dawn era. To create a galaxy, dark matter must gravitationally reel in normal matter. But where the velocities differed, the normal matter zipped right on by. The early universe was left with sparsely populated regions of the sky, arranged in ring-shaped patterns with a predictable distance scale. The rings, which are too subtle to pick out by eye from the data but show up in statistical analyses, have radii of half a billion light-years – that’s one long measuring stick.</p>



<p>The new standard ruler could reveal how fast the universe was expanding back then. That information can tell scientists what that youthful universe was made of, revealing the amount of dark matter, normal matter and dark energy, another hidden piece of the cosmic puzzle.</p>





<p>A new expansion measurement could also add fuel to one of the fiercest debates in cosmology. Currently, different measurements of the universe’s expansion rate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">clash with one another</a>, leaving scientists pondering whether there are flaws in our understanding of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Seeking to understand the unknown, including these shadowy cosmic realms, is “an integral component of human nature — like art and poetry,” Muñoz says. “You could live without it, but I really hope you don’t have to.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking into dark corners</h4>



<p>Muñoz’s interest in dark matter drew him to the cosmic dawn. The first galaxies grew off a scaffold of dark matter. So information about how and when those galaxies formed can reveal dark matter’s properties. In a report published in 2018 in <em>Nature</em>, for example, Muñoz and colleagues suggested that, if some of the universe’s dark matter had a tiny electric charge, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0151-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a millionth of an electron’s</a>, that could alter the expected cosmic dawn signal.</p>



<p>He has also developed important computational tools, like a new technique that allows for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/523/2/2587/7174391?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lightning-fast simulations</a> of the cosmic dawn, reported in May in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The time it takes to perform these simulations has previously limited what scientists can study.</p>



<p>“He’s got an eye for interesting ideas,” says theoretical physicist Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, Muñoz’s Ph.D. adviser. But the cosmic ruler, “that’s probably the most singular idea that he’s had.”</p>



<p>Becoming a physicist, in itself, was uncharted territory for Muñoz. As a child, he liked science. He recalls being amazed by fossilized shark teeth that were millions of years old — perhaps his first experience grappling with such grand timescales.</p>



<p>But Muñoz didn’t have a scientific role model; his parents didn’t finish high school. He focused his attention on video games and coding until a high school physics teacher encouraged his scientific streak. He turned to physics, he says, where “it was possible to channel all this nerdy energy for knowledge.” That’s what drives Muñoz to explore the questions that swirl around dark corners of the cosmos. “I do it because I think the answers enrich the human experience.”</p>

<p>A cancer researcher who was terminated from one postdoc position and resigned another faked data in multiple papers and grant applications, according to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-laliotis-yiorgos-georgios-i">found</a> that Yiorgos (Georgios) I. Laliotis “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally and knowingly falsifying and/or fabricating data, methods, results, and conclusions” in three published papers and two applications for grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The findings were based on Laliotis’ own admissions as well as reports from The Ohio State University and Johns Hopkins University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/22/fired-postdoc-faked-recommendation-letters-from-supervisor-osu-alleges/">previously reported</a>, Ohio State terminated Laliotis from his postdoc position in November of 2021, and he apparently resigned from another postdoc position at Johns Hopkins University that same month. Whether both universities employed him at the same time is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis has also been charged in Franklin County, Ohio – home to Ohio State –&nbsp; with forgery, identity theft, and telecommunications fraud in connection with allegations he created a fake email address in the name of Philip Tsichlis, his PI at Ohio State, and used it to send letters of recommendation purportedly from Tsichlis to prospective employers. Laliotis has pleaded not guilty to all charges.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127380"></span>



<p>Issues with Laliotis’ work came to light after researchers who attempted to replicate the findings of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24795-1"><em>Nature Communications</em> paper</a> on which he was the first author contacted Tsichlis and shared that they could not confirm the results, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">emails we obtained</a> through a public records request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Tsichlis looked into the matter, he discovered “evidence of data manipulation,” as he put it in an email to the editor of <em>Communications Biology</em> requesting the retraction of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02668-z">related paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Communications Biology </em>paper was retracted in December 2021, less than one month after Tsichlis contacted the editor. He also contacted <em>Nature Communications </em>around the same time, but that paper was not <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31445-7">retracted</a> until June of 2022, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/29/seven-months-after-an-author-request-journal-retracts/">two weeks after we published our initial story</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the two retracted papers, ORI identified data fabrication in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.12.454141v3">bioRxiv preprint</a>, which has since been withdrawn, two unpublished manuscripts, and two NIH grant applications, one of which garnered Tsichlis and co-PI Vincenzo Coppola $626,476. Laliotis’ misconduct affected research funded by five grants from the National Cancer Institute, ORI said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s finding states that Laliotis “knowingly and intentionally” faked sequencing data in the <em>Nature Communications</em> paper “by splicing two sequencing chromatograms together to falsely represent a novel identification of a previously undescribed” RNA transcript, and subsequently falsified conclusions about the fabricated variant. He also falsified experimental conditions and methods, as well as additional data and conclusions in the other identified manuscripts and grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis has not immediately responded to our request for comment. He agreed to a three year period of supervision for his research, which began on June 12, according to ORI.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bottlenose-dolphin-mom-calf-baby-talk-whistle">Bottlenose dolphin moms use baby talk with their calves</a></h4>

              
                <p>When speaking to young kids, humans often use squeaky, high-pitched baby talk. It turns out that some dolphins do, too.</p>



<p>Bottlenose dolphin moms <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300262120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modify their individually distinctive whistles when their babies are nearby</a>, researchers report June 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. This “parentese” might enhance attention, bonding and vocal learning in calves, as it seems to do in humans.</p>



<p>During the first few months of life, each common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>) develops a unique tune, or signature whistle, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphins-name-themselves-whistle">akin to a name</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/13</em>). The dolphins shout out their own “names” in the water “likely as a way to keep track of each other,” says marine biologist Laela Sayigh of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.</p>





<p>But dolphin moms seem to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/90/3/638/874710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweak that tune in the presence of their calves</a>, which tend to stick by mom’s side for three to six years. It’s a change that Sayigh first noticed in a 2009 study published by her student. But “it was just one little piece of this much larger study,” she says.</p>



<p>To follow up on that observation, Sayigh and colleagues analyzed signature whistles from 19 female dolphins both with and without their babies close by. Audio recordings were captured from a wild population that lives near Sarasota Bay, Fla., during catch-and-release health assessments that occurred from 1984 to 2018.</p>



<p>The researchers examined 40 instances of each dolphin’s signature whistle, verified by the unique way each vocalization’s frequencies change over time. Half of each dolphin’s whistles were voiced in the presence of her baby. When youngsters were around, the moms’ whistles contained, on average, a higher maximum and slightly lower minimum pitch compared with those uttered in the absence of calves, contributing to an overall widened pitch range.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dolphin ‘parentese’</h3>



<p>When their babies are around, bottlenose dolphin moms modify their signature whistles to include higher pitches and a wider pitch range than normal. The first audio clip presents a mother’s typical whistle. The second clip is of her whistle with her calf nearby. Both clips were slowed to one-eighth normal speed to make the high frequency vocalizations audible to human ears.</p>

<p>These whistle adjustments echo baby talk because human caregivers use real words and language, just with certain inflections, Sayigh says. Formally called child-directed communication, these inflections typically involve higher pitches and a wider pitch range, like what was observed in the dolphins.</p>



<p>“Bottlenose dolphins are a prime candidate for child-directed or calf-directed communication,” says Quincy Gibson, a marine mammal behavioral ecologist who was not involved with the study. Similar to humans, these dolphins form strong mother-baby bonds and learn vocalizations.</p>



<p>But to confirm this study’s results, scientists should analyze signature whistles of freely swimming, unrestrained dolphin moms, notes Gibson, director of the University of North Florida Dolphin Research Program in Jacksonville. “We do need to look at this question in more natural and undisturbed conditions.”</p>



<p>And although researchers speculate dolphin parentese could have the same functions as in human speech, no one can be certain “until the day we can ask the dolphins what they’re actually doing,” says behavioral ecologist Mauricio Cantor of the Oregon State University Marine Mammal Institute in Newport, who was also not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Still, Sayigh says, “the idea that there might be similar forces driving [parentese] in such different species is just really cool.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-indicators-update-q1-2023/">A first look at Open Science Indicators for articles published in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>This week, PLOS shares the latest update to our Open Science Indicators (OSIs) dataset. We&rsquo;ve added an additional three months of data, bringing the data current through the end of the first quarter of this year. The complete dataset now covers the period from January 1 2019-March 31 2023.</p>



<h2>About Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS Open Science indicators are a large public dataset&mdash;the latest version has data on 82,298 articles&mdash;that uses Natural Language Processing to identify and measure key Open Science practices in the published literature, including the entire PLOS corpus, plus a smaller comparator dataset drawn from PubMed Central. The current indicators include data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.</p>



<h5 class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Download the dataset</a></h5>



<h2>Who are Open Science Indicators for?</h2>



<p>PLOS initially created Open Science Indicators to help meet our own needs&mdash;to better understand researchers and their sharing practices, and how these differ across groups. An improved understanding of the communities we serve helps us to better support researchers, develop new solutions, and advance our mission of Openness.</p>



<p>By sharing the data openly, we hope to help meet the needs of individuals and organizations <em>outside</em> PLOS as well. So far, users of the dataset have included funders, institutions, academic librarians, and meta researchers. As of this writing, the dataset on Figshare has attracted over 5,600 views and more than 700 downloads and been cited in multiple scholarly preprints.</p>



<p>Let us know how you use the dataset, and what would be helpful to support you! If the data isn&rsquo;t useful for you, we want to hear about that, too. Comment below, or email us at community (at) plos.org.</p>



<h2>Open Science Indicators trends</h2>



<p>In the first quarter of 2023 Open Science Indicator trends for PLOS articles have remained largely stable compared to the previous quarter and 2022 as a whole. Comparator rates are more varied, likely due to the smaller sample size, and show increases following a drop off at the end of last year across all indicators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After reading an <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720583">economics paper</a> that claimed to document an increase in the rate of rape in European countries following the passage of prostitution bans, a data scientist had questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientist, who wishes to remain anonymous, sent a detailed email to an editor of the <em>Journal of Law and Economics</em>, which had published the paper last November, outlining concerns about the data and methods the authors used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them: the historical rates of rape recorded in the paper did not match the values in the official sources the authors said they used. In other cases, data that were available from the official sources were missing in the <a href="http://www.huashenggao.net/uploads/1/1/1/9/111968909/gaojle2022_publishedversion.pdf">paper</a>, the researchers didn’t incorporate all the data they had collected into their model, and a variable was coded inconsistently, the data scientist wrote. (We’ve made the full critique available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/JLE-reader-questions.pdf">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Given the consequences the conclusions of the article could have for people in the sex industry, the data scientist wrote, “I hope that someone takes this very seriously and looks into it the [sic] validity of the analysis and the data they used.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127362"></span>



<p>In response, <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/emeriti/sam-peltzman">Sam Peltzman</a>, an editor of the journal and a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, instructed the data scientist to contact the authors of the article:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The email raises serious questions but without any specific request. Your questions can better be answered by the authors than editors who, as you must know, cannot give each submission the kind of careful attention reflected in your email. Accordingly, we ask that you contact the authors directly if you have not already done so.</p>



<p>If you mean the email as a prologue to a critique, I am happy to discuss our relevant policies or any other question about our editorial process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data scientist wrote back with a specific request:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have just informed you, the editor, that it appears that the authors made an error in at least one of their models that resulted in a substantive difference in the conclusions of the article you edited … <strong>I am requesting you investigate if these models are correct and if so, at very least issue a correction.</strong><strong> </strong>[emphasis original]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response, Peltzman reiterated his refusal to investigate:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can only repeat what was in my last letter. You should take this up with the authors first. The editors cannot become involved unless your conversation with the authors fails to resolve the issues and a comment is received through the usual submission process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The University of Chicago Press, which publishes the <em>Journal of Law and Economics</em>, states on its <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/publication-ethics-statement">publication ethics page</a> that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When notified of possible errors or corrections, the editor(s) of the journal will review and resolve them in consultation with the Press and according to the Press’s best practices.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Peltzman why he refused to investigate the concerns the data scientist had raised. He told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The JLE does not have the resources to investigate concerns about data procedure used by authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We select referees knowledgeable about the topic of any submission.&nbsp; Occasionally a referee might comment on some detail of data used by authors.&nbsp; more often the referee and editors have to take data details at face value and focus their efforts on evaluating empirical results and analysis.&nbsp; While I can only speak for the JLE it is my impression that these procedures are common among economics journals that publish empirical articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Peltzman also explained that the journal’s standard procedure for considering critiques of published articles, “designed to avoid misunderstanding and excessive burden on editors’ and referees’ time,” starts with the critic contacting the authors directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the authors don’t respond, or if their response is unsatisfactory, the critic could then submit a comment to the journal along with their correspondence with the authors, which the editors would handle as any other submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Editors obviously cannot be expected to look at raw data for every paper they review,” the data scientist acknowledged, “but when concerns are brought directly to them it is their responsibility to take them seriously. If readers can’t trust that editors will address serious concerns appropriately, it will undermine their faith in the scientific process.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We contacted the authors of the paper, <a href="https://fisf.fudan.edu.cn/en_show-112-67.html">Huasheng Gao</a> and <a href="https://fisf.fudan.edu.cn/en_show-112-133.html?k=fmF3%EF%BC%89">Vanya Stefanova Petrova</a> of Fudan University’s Fanhai International School of Finance in Shanghai, and shared the data scientist’s critique. They responded with an 11-page PDF, available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reply-Letter-20230618.pdf">here</a>, standing by their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the differences between the data and their paper and the official sources, they said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the data we have used in the paper were the most up-to-date data available at the time we started the empirical work in 2018 … Eurostat is constantly revising its data. It is possible that the data contained in its current version are different from the historical version</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data scientist was unimpressed, and noted that the authors had not responded to a key aspect of the critique:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even if the authors believe it was a reasonable strategy to only assess two years post policy change, the relative year variable for year 2— the year in which they identified a large causal increase in rape in the criminalized prostitution countries and a reduction in the prostitution decriminalized countries &#8212; was coded incorrectly (or differently for some reason). When the coding is consistent with their original coding scheme, a reduction in rape is seen in the criminalized prostitution group. I&#8217;m not sure why they didn&#8217;t address this in their response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors also did not directly respond to the data scientist’s concern that if they had incorporated every year of data they had on rape rates into their model, instead of only the two years following a change in prostitution laws, they would not have gotten the same results, the scientist said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To check whether data values had indeed changed since the authors started their work, the scientist went to the website of the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, where the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/26462">survey data the authors</a> used is available for download, and found that no substantive changes had been made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientist told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If they did something wrong or made a mistake they should just take accountability and retract the article.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-hominids-stone-age-cannibalism">Fossil marks suggest hominids butchered one another around 1.45 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 1.45-million-year-old hominid leg fossil sports previously unrecognized <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35702-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of our ancient evolutionary relatives butchering and possibly eating one another</a>, a new study claims.</p>



<p>An ancient individual used a stone tool to make nine incisions on the fossil, which preserves the shin and knee. Analyses of 3-D models of these marks peg them as resembling damage produced by stone tools rather than by large predators’ bites or by animal trampling, researchers report June 26 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>





<p>Those incisions are the oldest convincing example of such butchery and possibly cannibalism among ancient hominids, says paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. But there’s debate about that interpretation.</p>



<p>Pobiner first examined the incised leg bone while studying fossils held at the Nairobi National Museum in Kenya. She wanted to identify which nonhuman predators hunted and ate ancient hominids. But marks on the leg bone looked to her like butchery damage.</p>



<p>Pobiner sent molds of 11 incisions on the fossil to paleoanthropologists Michael Pante of Colorado State University in Fort Collins and Trevor Keevil of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. The pair created 3-D scans of the bone marks and compared them with 898 bone marks known to have been made by stone cutting tools, stone pounding implements, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crocs-take-bite-out-claims-ancient-stone-tool-use">the teeth of crocodiles</a>, lions and other nonhuman predators, or cows trampling the ground (<em>SN: 11/6/17</em>).</p>

<p>Nine marks closely matched stone-tool damage, Pobiner says. The other two marks resulted from the bite of a big cat, perhaps a saber-toothed cat.</p>



<p>No consensus exists on the species identity of the ancient leg fossil. It might represent <em>Homo erectus</em>, <em>H. habilis</em> or a relatively small-brained species called <em>Paranthropus boisei</em>, Pobiner and colleagues say. There is also no way to tell whether a hominid from the same species or a different species left stone-tool marks on the leg fossil.</p>



<p>The incisions on the fossil cluster around a spot where a calf muscle attached to bone, consistent with the removal of a chunk of flesh, Pobiner says. Reasons for that act remain hazy, especially with only a single, fragmentary bone in hand. “We assume the intention of whichever [hominid] inflicted the cut marks was simply to cut off meat from the bone to eat it, based on hunger,” Pobiner says.</p>



<p>Zooarchaeologist Raphaël Hanon of Wits University in Johannesburg agrees. Cutting into the fleshy part of a lower leg probably reflected a need for food rather than a ritual act of some kind, says Hanon, who was not part of Pobiner’s team. There is no way to know whether flesh from meatier body parts, such as the shoulder and upper leg, was also removed, he says.</p>



<p>But stone-tool incisions on a partial leg bone do not provide enough evidence to determine whether hunger motivated flesh removal, counters zooarchaeologist Palmira Saladié of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain. Pobiner’s findings may reflect scenarios such as cannibalism to supplement other food sources, some sort of ritual practice that did not include cannibalism or the consumption of a defeated enemy following a fight between groups, suggests Saladié.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Yonatan Sahle of the University of Cape Town in South Africa agrees that the interpretation remains up in the air.&nbsp; Although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-cutups-deathly-rituals-emerge-neandertal-site">Stone Age cannibalism may have occurred</a>, “the present evidence is not strong enough to enable such an inference,” he says.</p>





<p>Further complicating matters, the original context of the leg fossil is unknown. It was found on the surface of a site in northern Kenya after coming loose from eroding sediment. The fossil’s age estimate derives from its position just above a volcanic ash layer dated to between around 1.5 million and 1.6 million years ago. Researchers have thus presumed that the leg bone originally rested in sediment slightly younger than that ash deposit.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200004)111:4%3C579::AID-AJPA12%3E3.0.CO;2-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A possible earlier case of a butchered hominid</a>, reported in 2000, also triggered debate. Researchers described incisions on a partial upper jaw found at a South African site — with age estimates ranging from 1.5 million to 2.6 million years old — as having resulted from slicing through a muscle to remove the lower jaw. But Hanon and colleagues have argued that animal trampling or accidental rubbing of the fossil against jagged rocks before it was excavated could have produced the incisions.</p>



<p>Pobiner’s group did a good job of excluding such factors as causes of nine of the 11 incisions on the hominid leg fossil, Hanon says. There is a “very high probability” that a hominid used a stone tool to create those ancient marks, he concludes.</p>



<p>But even if further research strengthens that probability, such evidence falls far short of demonstrating butchery or cannibalism, says Tim White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cannibals-signature">who has long studied skeletal clues to cannibalism</a> (<em>SN: 1/2/93</em>). White calls the Kenyan fossil “an interesting scientific curiosity that changes nothing of significance.”</p>

<p><strong>Comets, novas and the Mayans </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/archaeoastronomy"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 30, 1973</p>



<p>Did the Mayans record novas and comets? … Comparing dates of known historic novas and comets with [20] Mayan dates, [a researcher] found no acceptable correlation. Nevertheless, [the researcher] believes that the Mayans probably did record such events and that a record will eventually be found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Solid evidence that ancient Maya people marked dying stars or passing comets continues to elude archaeologists. Several early codices and stones may have recorded hieroglyphs that together mean “comet.” But Spanish conquistadores destroyed many of the originals, and only copies made well after the Maya empire’s collapse clearly depict comets. </p>



<p>In 2017, an analysis of Maya records and astronomical data hinted that the Maya indirectly marked at least one comet by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063316302951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting when meteor showers would dazzle the sky</a>. Between the years 250 and 909, six royal coronations happened within days of the annual Eta&nbsp;Aquariid meteor shower, researchers found, which occurs when Earth passes through the tail of Halley’s comet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-fossil-lost-world-microbe-life">1.6-billion-year-old steroid fossils hint at a lost world of microbial life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular fossils found in ancient sedimentary rocks have unveiled a lost world of primitive eukaryotes that dominated aquatic ecosystems from at least 1.6 billion to 800 million years ago.</p>



<p>The findings, published June 7 in <em>Nature</em>, come from laboratory analyses of rock samples from around the world that revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06170-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of primitive compounds called protosteroids</a>. The majority of these molecules, which form in the process of creating steroids, were likely produced by primordial eukaryotes, relatively complex life-forms that today include animals, plants, algae and fungi, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Almost all eukaryotes produce molecules called steroids, like cholesterol, that are crucial components of cell membranes. Steroids don’t degrade easily and their remnants can be detected in sedimentary rocks as molecular fossils.</p>



<p>The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes lived around 1.2 billion to more than 1.8 billion years ago. But scientists know almost nothing about the abundance, ecology and habitats of those early microorganisms. Molecular and physical fossils of eukaryotes dated to 800 million years ago have been found. But farther back in time, their physical fossils become scarce and molecular fossils of the steroids become undetectable. The existence of protosteroids had been predicted but it was unclear what they would look like — or if they could even be detected — until the researchers figured out a way to re-create those molecular footprints in the lab.</p>



<p>“This study explains why we don’t see footprints of these guys in the rocks, as researchers were looking for the wrong thing,” says biologist Laura Katz, a biologist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who was not involved with the new work. “It fills a void in the fossil records.”</p>



<p>A dearth of obvious eukaryote fossils before 800 million years ago led scientists to speculate that the ecosystem at that time was dominated by bacteria. Alternatively, primordial eukaryotes may have simply lacked strength in numbers to leave behind detectable steroid remnants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists had a different explanation: What if some intermediate molecule in the chemical pathway that produces modern steroids was actually the end product of the process in primordial eukaryotes? This theory had been proposed by the biochemist Konrad Bloch, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1964 for discovering the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol.</p>



<p>To test this, geochemist Jochen Brocks of the Australian National University in Canberra and colleagues artificially matured molecules made in the first few steps of steroid biosynthesis, including lanosterol and cycloartenol. That revealed what the compounds’ molecular fossils would look like. Then the researchers looked for these fossils in tarlike bitumens and oils extracted from ancient rocks from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers discovered a deluge of the protosteroids in samples ranging from deep to relatively shallow water environments. The oldest sample, dating back to 1.6 billion years ago, came from the Barney Creek Formation in Australia.</p>



<p>“One of the greatest puzzles of early evolution is, why didn’t our highly capable eukaryotic ancestors come to dominate the world’s ancient waterways? Where were they hiding?” says Benjamin Nettersheim, a geobiologist at University of Bremen in Germany. “We show that the protosteroid-producing microorganisms were hiding in plain sight and were in fact abundant in the world’s ancient oceans and lakes all along.”</p>



<p>While most bacteria produce a different molecule, called hopanoids, some bacteria also have the chemical tools to kick-start protosteroid production. But these bacteria exist in niche environments, such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. And their molecular footprints have not been found in sediments older than 800 million years, leading the researchers to conclude that eukaryotes dominated the ancient ecosystems.</p>



<p>“Konrad Bloch would have been delighted, had he lived, to see this,” says MIT geobiologist Roger Summons, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This paper has elegantly confirmed his prediction that biosynthetic precursors to cholesterol reflect ancient life’s quest for improvement.” (Bloch died in 2000.)</p>





<p>Making these steroid precursors requires less oxygen and energy, so that may have given the primordial eukaryotes an advantage in thriving in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fascination-earths-boring-billion">early Earth’s harsh low oxygen conditions</a>, the researchers propose (<em>SN: 10/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>“If true, [this study] suggests that we may be able to examine the stepwise evolution of eukaryotes at [an] unprecedented level of detail,” says evolutionary biologist Yosuke Hoshino of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, who was not involved in the study. “This is such a great opportunity to understand the evolution of complex life, which biologists have always dreamed of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-cluster-milky-way-old-universe">A star cluster in the Milky Way appears to be as old as the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the oldest known objects in the universe is wandering around the Milky Way.</p>



<p>Star cluster M92, a densely packed ball of stars roughly 27,000 light-years from Earth, <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2306.02180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about 13.8 billion years old</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted June 3 to arXiv.org. The newly refined age estimate makes this clump of stars nearly the same age as the universe.</p>



<p>Refining the ages of clusters like M92 can help put limits on the age of the universe itself. It can also help solve cosmic conundrums about how the universe evolved.</p>





<p>The age is “on the edge of the age of the universe, as estimated by other groups,” says astronomer Martin Ying of Dartmouth College. “It helps us set the lower bound of the age of the universe. We don’t expect M92 to be born before the universe, right?”</p>



<p>Globular clusters like M92 are tight knots of stars that are thought to have all formed at the same time. That makes it easier for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">astronomers to measure the stars’ ages</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). Stars that are born at different masses have different fates: The big ones use up their fuel quickly and die young, and the small ones linger. Figuring out how many of the cluster’s stars have aged out of the main parts of their fuel-burning years gives a sense of when the whole cluster was born.</p>



<p>But those estimates rely on assumptions about how stellar evolution works. Ying and colleagues wanted to find an age measurement that would sidestep those assumptions.</p>



<p>Using a computer, the team created 20,000 synthetic stellar populations for M92, each for a different possible cluster age. They then compared the colors and brightnesses for each of these populations with Hubble Space Telescope observations of M92 and calculated the age that fit the collection best.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time astronomers have measured M92’s age, but previous estimates relied on just one synthetic collection of stars. Comparing thousands of them reduced the uncertainty introduced by the assumptions baked into each one. The new technique reduced the uncertainty of the cluster age by about 50 percent, Ying says. The team found the cluster is 13.8 billion years old, give or take 750 million years. That’s strikingly close to the best estimate of the age of the universe: a smidge over 13.8 billion years, plus or minus 24 million years, according to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-planck-refines-cosmic-history">the Planck satellite’s measurement of the first light</a> emitted after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 12/20/13</em>).</p>



<p>The age of clusters like M92 is important partly because of a rising tension over how fast the universe is growing. Astronomers have known since the 1990s that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, thanks to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">a mysterious substance dubbed dark energy</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/22</em>). But recent measurements of the rate of that expansion, a figure called the Hubble constant, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">disagree with each other</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>One way around that tension is to accept a different age for the universe, says cosmologist and study coauthor Mike Boylan-Kolchin of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>“We often think about it as, Moses came down from Mount Sinai with ‘13.8 billion years’ written on some tablets or something, but it’s not quite like that,” he says. “If one takes the Hubble tension seriously, then one also has to say we don’t know the age of the universe that well.”</p>



<p>That’s where M92 comes in. Before spacecraft measured the cosmos’ earliest light, globular cluster ages were the best way to place limits on the age of the universe. That practice had fallen out of fashion for a while, says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>But improvements in computing, theory, and measurements of the distances to clusters like M92 make it worth trying again.</p>





<p>“The Hubble tension itself is a really challenging nut to crack,” Freedman says. This measurement alone isn’t precise enough to settle the debate. But “the more kinds of constraints we have, the better,” she says. “It’s showing a way for the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/irrigation-shift-earth-rotational-axis">Irrigation may be shifting Earth’s rotational axis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Runoff from irrigation has moved so much water from land to sea that Earth’s rotation might have measurably shifted.</p>



<p>Computer simulations suggest that from 1993 through 2010, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irrigation alone nudged the North Pole by about 78 centimeters</a>, researchers reported in the June 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters. </em>That would make irrigation the second largest contributor to polar drift after the ongoing rebound of Earth’s surface following the retreat of glaciers since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Researchers have long known that the North Pole wanders across the Arctic seascape in a circle a few meters in diameter. Seasonal weather patterns cause part of this cyclical drift, and long-term variations in the temperature and salinity of ocean water help drive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solving-one-mystery-polar-wander">a 14-month-long oscillation dubbed the Chandler wobble</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/03</em>).</p>





<p>But those repeated vacillations aren’t the only things that move the pole around, says Clark Wilson, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. There is also a subtler, noncyclic polar drift caused by the movement of land-based water to the sea from melting glaciers worldwide and from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, he says.</p>



<p>Runoff from irrigation also plays a role — and a surprisingly large one at that.</p>



<p>In the first study to try and tease out the contributions of these water movements, Wilson and colleagues used computer simulations to assess how the impoundment of water behind dams, glacial melt, irrigation and several other factors might affect polar drift. Previous studies have suggested that irrigation shifted about 2 trillion metric tons of water from land-based aquifers to the oceans from 1993 through 2010 — enough to raise global sea level more than 6 millimeters.</p>



<p>Although seemingly minuscule, that redistribution of water was enough to shift the North Pole just over four centimeters each year on average during that period, the team found.</p>



<p>When all sources of water movement are considered — including the runoff of meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets — the North Pole drifted about 1.6 meters toward the east coast of Greenland in that time. The impact of irrigation was mostly to nudge the pole generally east of where it would have gone otherwise, the team found. Without irrigation, the pole would have drifted nearly the same amount, but toward the center of Greenland instead.</p>



<p>Unlike other drivers that vary over the course of a year, Wilson says, the polar drift due to irrigation is permanent and probably growing each year.</p>



<p>“The team’s findings all make sense,” says Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “It’s important to realize that water is heavy, and when it moves around it’s going to affect Earth’s rotation.”</p>



<p>Besides shifting the North Pole, large-scale irrigation can also affect local and regional climates. Studies have shown that irrigation cools temperatures and boosts humidity in California’s Central Valley, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watering-fields-california-boosts-rainfall-southwest">increasing rainfall in the Four Corners area</a> of the American Southwest and enhancing flow volumes in the Colorado River (<em>SN: 1/22/13</em>).</p>

<p>Two years after it was quietly retracted &#8220;due to plagiarism,&#8221; a <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">paper</a> by a prominent researcher in Latvia has set the country&#8217;s media ablaze, drawing comments from, among others, <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/04/06/caksa-un-kalvins-par-plagiatu-lu-pilnas-atbildes/">the minister of education and science</a> and <a href="https://www.la.lv/plagiats-ir-viens-no-smagakajiem-noziegumiem-akademiskaja-vide-tam-nav-noilguma-ta-lu-rektors">the rector of a leading university</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plagiarized paper came to public attention in March when the Latvian magazine <em>Ir</em> <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/03/22/profesors-petnieks-un-plagiats/">published serious allegations</a> against <a href="http://ww3.lza.lv/scientists/klavinsm.htm">Maris Klavins</a>, a professor and former dean at the University of Latvia. The allegations concern “possible fraud&#8221; in an EU-funded project headed by Klavins and include not only plagiarism but data falsification, budget irregularities and suspicious cash payments.</p>



<p>According to <em>Ir</em>, the Latvian police have opened a criminal investigation into the case. Klavins told the magazine he has not been charged in the matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Klavins called the allegations &#8220;lies&#8221; and said the &#8220;person responsible&#8221; for &#8220;my defamation and persecution&#8221; was his former PhD student <a href="https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/dmitrijs-porsnovs">Dmitrijs Porsnovs</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127339"></span>



<p>&#8220;Presently this case is under investigation within a legal process,&#8221; Klavins added. &#8220;Considering this, I cannot give comments on the case.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the article in <em>Ir</em>, Porsnovs discovered in 2021 that parts of an internal report he had written about the processing of algae for energy production had been <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">published</a> earlier that year by Klavins and others in the journal <em>Agronomy Research</em> – without listing him as an author or citing his work. Porsnovs, who is now a graduate student at the University of Stavanger in Norway, did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>The magazine article includes examples of similar text and identical data in Porsnovs&#8217; report and Klavins’ paper, titled &#8220;Algae processing for energy production: development of waste pyrolysis technology.&#8221; <em>Ir</em> also notes that an ethics committee at the University of Latvia found &#8220;elements containing plagiarism&#8221; in the work of Klavins and his coauthors, according to a Google translation.</p>



<p>The university did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly complained to the journal, which pulled the paper &#8220;due to plagiarism&#8221; on June 20, 2021, according to a note on the retracted article.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Ir</em> also published anonymous allegations from another former student of Klavins accusing the professor of stealing student work on a previous occasion.</p>



<p>Klavins, who is currently a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies/special_issues/R274PNLK26">guest editor of a special issue</a> of the journal <em>Energies</em>, has made perplexing statements to the media. He reportedly told <em>Ir</em> that the paper in <em>Agronomy Research</em> had &#8220;never been published,&#8221; but also claimed that he retracted it himself because it turned out to contain &#8220;erroneous data.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Klavins asserted that the right to use the text in Porsnovs&#8217; report &#8220;belongs to Linnaeus University in Sweden, on whose behalf the study was conducted,&#8221; according to a Google translation of <a href="https://www.tvnet.lv/7747703/lu-profesors-klavins-parmetumus-plagiatisma-sauc-par-apmelojosiem">an article</a> published April 5 by <em>TVNET GRUPA</em>.</p>



<p>A press officer at the university said she was not familiar with the case and referred us to acting university director Thorbjörn Nilsson, who could not be reached.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly harbored suspicions toward the EU-funded research project from the beginning. He has alleged that two of Klavins&#8217; coauthors on the now-retracted paper were &#8220;fictitiously employed&#8221; and that one of them gave part of his salary to Klavins.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have seen with my own eyes several cases of transfer of cash,&#8221; Porsnovs wrote last year in a letter to an ethics committee for the University of Latvia, according to <em>Ir</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Porsnovs is currently involved in extensive litigation with the University of Latvia, the magazine said.</p>
