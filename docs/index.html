                <h4>Feeling a bit wired</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*02_Fo1ReZoUPx2CMzi4J8A.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Dee from Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p>Eight years I’ve been writing these annual reviews. Eight. I now regret starting the tradition of opening each with a pithy, allegedly humorous take on the year’s political news. When I started these in 2016 the idea was that, surely, things couldn’t get much worse — many people of the UK had voted to leave the EU, many people of the US had voted to take leave of their senses — and so future news round-ups would show the arc of history bending back in a better, happier direction, as we returned to meaningful international cooperation and tackled crises like climate change and mass migration together. Bloody hell was I wrong. The arc of history bends slowly.</p><p>So stuff the politics, let’s do some brains. The arc of science tends forward, progressing, improving. Science is always, in the round, a source of hope. As individuals we scientists may moan about our lot as researchers, or about crap studies, or terrible statistics, or how our institutions treat us. Yet our individual grumpiness adds up to constant, yearning improvement. Here are four small yet significant ways we improved our understanding of the brain this year. And odds are good something here will be true now and forever. Isn’t that cool?</p><h4>1. Vision quest</h4><p>Here’s a thought: Might we consider studying vision in an animal that uses it? Don’t get me wrong, we’ve learnt a lot from studying the visual system of rodents, from the details of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03044-3">how cortex is wired</a> to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2130-2">limits of sensory coding</a>. And all of our most powerful tools, from imaging the neural activity of specific neurons to perturbing that activity with light, are most easily and powerfully used in mice, with the consequence that they are the animal of choice for large-scale work in visual neuroscience, notably by the Allen Brain Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.</p><p>But mice and rats are nocturnal. (I confidently state ‘nocturnal’, like all writers on this topic, yet my mind can’t help but turn to the large rat that has recently taken to visiting our lawn, joyfully bounding across it pretending to be a squirrel, occasionally pausing to take the air, in broad daylight, while our cat sits on the dining room table staring at it through the window with a demeanour of “it’s not my problem, mate” when it very much is.) Mice and rats can navigate the world just fine without light, or eyes, through a mixture of their sense of smell, their ability to keep track of their self-motion better than us (not hard) and, especially, their whiskers, which probe and prod the ground in front and objects around. Crudely put, their eyes are for detecting potential threats (things above them) and food (things below them). Not for watching Bridgerton or football or clips of pandas falling off logs. Rodents are a poor model for how humans use their eyes.</p><p>A lovely paper this year showed us something of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48374-2">what we might be missing</a>. It simply asked, how does primate and rodent navigation differ? Our intrepid authors turned to the (common) marmoset, that like us is a primate, lives its waking life in daylight, and uses it front-facing big eyes to guide its behaviour. It’s also a cute, small 20-cm high monkey.</p><p>By letting their marmosets forage freely in a 3D, split-level box rather like a massive hamster play arena (the arena is massive, not the hamsters), they found two basic differences from rodent vision. The first is that rats explore by moving, not looking; marmosets, by contrast, explore by looking, not moving. Not in itself a startling revelation, for that’s what we do: we scan our environments, noting salient features like the clock tower yonder or the small bronze statute of a urinating boy over there. But that’s the point. Rodents don’t do this.</p><p>The second difference is in the marmoset hippocampus. If you want to look at how animals are literally representing their place in the world, look there, for that is where are found the Nobel-prize winning place cells, the neurons that fire when a rodent is in a specific location of the world. So the team looked there in the marmosets. And found that no neuron was just a place cell. Sure, a majority of them had firing that related to where the marmoset was in the 3D, split-level box. But all of those neurons coded for something else too, and the majority of that was the view: what specific view the marmoset was looking at. And those place-related neurons did not cover much of the big box, whereas the view-related neurons did. Use an animal that has eyes to see and it turns out it uses different representations of the world than a rodent. What were the odds?</p><h4>2. Fly in the ointment</h4><p>As regular readers may recall, <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/mindlessly-mapping-the-brain-1dec092a404d">I’ve been sceptical </a>about the worth of connectomes, of building the complete wiring diagram of the connections between each and every neuron in a brain. The source of the scepticism was simple: a wiring diagram is a terrific reference tool, just like the genome, making it easier to identify the parts of a brain and, when recording neurons, providing a way to better guess which neurons and what they connect to. But it is just a description, with little hypothesis-driven science possible without major further work. This scepticism has taken a beating recently. In 2021 <a href="https://drmdhumphries.medium.com/maps-of-a-growing-brain-show-that-genes-do-less-than-we-thought-1d08684b7cb8">Witvliet and co showed</a> it was possible to derive scientific insight from the connectome alone — all you needed was more than one. They mapped the neural development of the tiny worm <em>C Elegans</em> by reconstructing connectomes at key stages of its life, providing, among other things, more strong evidence for the crucial role of randomness in the wiring of brains, even in a brain with just 302 neurons. And then, this year, <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00053-4/index.html">FlyWire dropped</a>.</p><p>At its heart, FlyWire is the full connectome of the brain of the adult female fruit fly (or <em>Drosophila melongaster </em>if you insist). It’s a monster, in connectome terms: 140,000 neurons divided into a strangely-precise 8453 types of neuron and connected by about 50 million synapses, making up to 15 million connections between neurons (if we count every single synaptic connection). A lot of wire in a tiny brain of a tiny fly.</p><p>But what made FlyWire special was the not the admittedly impressive technical feat of tracing all that wire but the effort put in to then doing science with it, to show how it could be used to drive knowledge forward. Officially, FlyWire <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/hgcfafejia">dropped 11 papers as a collection</a> across the <em>Nature</em> journals, ranging from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07763-9">a simulation</a> that literally placed a model neuron everywhere there was an actual neuron, to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07854-7">a detailed probe of how the fly stops walking</a>, using the connectome to show at least 3 separate neural pathways that call a halt, two seemingly specialised in stopping the fly to consume food rather than wandering past it looking mournfully at what it could have eaten, the third holding the fly still while grooming, so it doesn’t try to rub its face and walk at the same time, fall flat on its proboscis and look a bit of a prat to its mates.</p><p>Officially 11 papers; unofficially, I’d say at least 14. Pretty much every experimental, theory, and modelling paper relied on<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.016"> a crucial <em>Cell </em>paper</a> from earlier this year that had inferred the sign of each connection already, whether it excited or inhibited it target — without that, much of the theory and modelling work would have been impossible. And two of the best papers appeared earlier this year, studying deep neural network models of the fly brain that were strongly constrained by the connectome: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07939-3">Lappalainen et al showed us</a> that training wiring-constrained deep networks to track the visual flow of the world as the fly moves recovered many known types of neuron responses and predicted new ones; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07451-8">Cowley &amp; co showed us </a>a beautifully tight model-experiment interplay by training a deep network model to match the behavioural effects of knocking-out each of 23 types of early visual system neuron in the fly.</p><p>We cannot of course abandon all scepticism, for science proceeds through reasonable doubt. Types of neurons remain a nebulous concept: it was telling that about a third of the neuron types found in the previously-published, partial half-brain connectome of the adult female fruit fly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07686-5">could not be found in the newly-constructed full brain</a>. The favoured explanation is that the disagreement represents variation between individual flies. The figure of 8453 types was arrived at by taking a consensus across three half-brains: the previous half-brain one, and treating the new, complete one as two halves. But how can it be a neuron “type” if it is simply missing from a different individual of the same species (and one, I suspect, that is genetically-identical)?</p><p>And deeply impressive as FlyWire is, the problem of scale remains: if we could scale the technology to the whole mouse brain, would such a synaptic-level connectome hold any value? After all, the constraints of genetically-specified connections between neurons must get weaker as the brains get bigger, so random chance plays more and more of a role in initial development, and life experience plays more and more of a role in sculpting connections from that baseline. What we want instead are the rules for wiring, but for that we need many, many connectomes, in order to infer the general principles they share. This creates a connectome paradox: as the brains get bigger so, conversely, the value of individual connectomes gets smaller. This suggests only making the leap to doing many brains at once is worth it, with little pay-off in the short-term. In the past I would have questioned whether it was worth it; FlyWire has given me pause for thought.</p><h4>3. Shining a light in the dark</h4><p>Two papers especially piqued my interest this year as they were on topics close to my heart. The first paper gave a new take on dark neurons. I’ve written much about them before, including a dedicated chapter in <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691241487/the-spike?_gl=1*147tsvi*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTA5MDEyMDc5LjE3MjM2NTY5Nzg.*_ga_N1W9JWKLY3*MTcyMzY1Njk3Ny4xLjEuMTcyMzY1NzAwOC4yOS4wLjE1ODIwMDA4NDI.">my book <em>The Spike</em></a>. The short version is that cortical activity obeys a rough 80:20 rule — 80% of spikes come from just 20% of the neurons. That means the other 80% are mostly silent, firing much less than 1 spike every second. For any given moment in time, for any given behaviour, they are not active: they are dark. This raises the question of what they are for. Perhaps they are reserve neurons, awaiting recruitment to represent something new; perhaps they’re just very picky and we’ve just never shown them anything they’re interested in.</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.04.015">Work from Oliver Gauld and colleagues</a> in Michael Hausser’s lab this year offered a new view, that dark neurons are not reluctant to respond, they are actively suppressed. They looked at neurons in the barrel cortex, the neurons whose job is supposed to be responding to deflections of a single, unique whisker on a rodent’s face. They looked there because many of them don’t. It’s their only job, yet many neurons in a single “barrel”, representing a single whisker, don’t respond to deflections of that whisker. Indeed some of our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.026">best early evidence of dark neurons</a> came from the total lack of response from neurons in barrel cortex.</p><p>Gauld and co flicked a whisker on each side of a mouse’s face at the same time and simply asked it to report which side had moved the most. Many neurons in layers 2 and 3 of that whisker’s “barrel” were dark to the stimulus, not responding differently whether the left or right whisker had be stimulated. Yet activating enough neurons using light could bias the mouse’s choice to the other side, as though, when forced to be active, these dark neurons were perfectly capable of transmitting information about the whisker. So why didn’t they normally? Because they were locally and actively suppressed: the more some neurons were stimulated, the more the unstimulated neurons around them reduced their activity. This gives us a new “sparse coding” hypothesis for why neurons are dark: not because they are hardwired to respond to just a few, select features of the world, but because they are actively suppressed from responding. Some light in the darkness.</p><h4>4. How low can you go?</h4><p>The other paper that especially piqued my interest was a thought-provoking take on the dimensionality question: how many dimensions does neural activity have? It’s now routine to take a recording of hundreds or thousands of neurons and ask if the dynamics so captured have fewer dimensions than there are neurons. One reason to do this is that it makes understanding the brain easier: we don’t have to worry about coding in thousands of neurons, but just a comparative handful of dimensions of activity. Recently, <a href="https:/​/​doi.org/​10.51628/​001c.24619.">I’d pointed out that</a> as we increase the number of recorded neurons we hope the number of additional dimensions doesn’t scale with them; rather, we hope the number of dimensions of neural activity has a hard upper limit that is a tiny percentage of the number of neurons. Consider what happens if it doesn’t. There are about half a million neurons in the primary visual cortex of a mouse and about 50 million neurons in the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey. Even if the number of dimensions of activity is just 1 percent of the number of neurons then if the dimensions of activity scales all the way to the full extent of the region’s neurons that’s still 5,000 dimensions in mouse visual cortex and 500,000 dimensions in the macaque’s motor cortex. That’s still high-dimensional in anyone’s book. This year, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.02.011">the 1-million-neuron paper</a> appeared in Neuron, and had a first crack at answering to this question.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/now-we-can-record-one-million-neurons-at-the-same-time-25b0c9607e7d?source=user_profile_page---------14-------------6bce9fc81f1f---------------">I’d previously covered</a> this technical marvel when it was a pre-print: the scaling of calcium imaging to cover vast chunks of a mouse’s cortex, with typical recordings in the low hundreds of thousands, and one exemplar obtaining the activity of 1 million neurons at (roughly) the same time. So this team were the best-placed on the planet to ask how dimensions of activity scale with the number of neurons.</p><p>They estimated the number of “reliable” dimensions in the activity, essentially by finding how many dimensions were needed to capture the variation in activity of two sets of neurons at the same time — the idea being that these dimensions must be common to both sets, and thus not noise. And while 16 of these dimensions captured about half the variation in activity, the number of reliable dimensions grew unbounded with the number of neurons.</p><p>On the one hand, this means that we can indeed describe a good chunk of activity with just a handful of dimensions. But on the other, it implies that recordings have to scale with the size of the targeted population in order to capture all that population’s shared dynamics. Which raises the obvious question: how do we know how big the targeted population is? But that’s a story for a different time.</p><h4>Is this thing on?</h4><p>There was so much more of course. Rafal Bogacz and crew kicked the year off by taking a different slant on the problem of how the brain could approximate backprop and hence learn like an artifical neural network. Their slant being: <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1">it doesn’t, that would be silly</a>. Instead, they proposed that a network of neurons predicts what the neural activity at the end of learning should look like, and then change synaptic weights according to whether that prediction looks correct or not. We also had much more on how psychedelics alter brain function, including suggestions they <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5">desynchronise activity in the human brain</a>.

You could continue to mournfully scroll through your social media feed. Either way, all I can suggest is that, if you’re after good news in 2025, it’s probably best to stick to science.</p><p>Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markdhumphries.bsky.social"><em>@markdhumphries.bsky.social</em></a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-humphries-65a460212/"><em>Mark Humphries</em></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=84d343155146" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/2024-a-review-of-the-year-in-neuroscience-84d343155146">2024: A Review of the Year in Neuroscience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>All but one member of the editorial board of the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> (JHE), an Elsevier title, have resigned, saying the “sustained actions of Elsevier are fundamentally incompatible with the ethos of the journal and preclude maintaining the quality and integrity fundamental to JHE’s success.” </p>



<p>“Elsevier has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining the core principles and practices that have successfully guided the journal for the past 38 years,” the journal’s “joint Editors-in-Chief, all Emeritus Editors retired or active in the field, and all but one Associate Editor” said in their resignation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">statement</a> posted to <a href="https://x.com/clementzanolli/status/1872352787662852156">X/Twitter</a> yesterday.</p>



<p>Among other moves, according to the statement, Elsevier “eliminated support for a copy editor and special issues editor,” which they interpreted as saying “editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting.” The editors say the publisher “frequently introduces errors during production that were not present in the accepted manuscript:”</p>



<span id="more-130593"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In fall of 2023, for example, without consulting or informing the editors, Elsevier initiated the use of AI during production, creating article proofs devoid of capitalization of all proper nouns (e.g., formally recognized epochs, site names, countries, cities, genera, etc.) as well italics for genera and species. These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors. This was highly embarrassing for the journal and resolution took six months and was achieved only through the persistent efforts of the editors. AI processing continues to be used and regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stage.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The resigning editors also said Elsevier “unilaterally took full control over” the editorial board’s “scientific structure and composition” by requiring all editors sign a new contract every year,” leading to a decline in the number of associate editors. The publisher also “indicated it would no longer support the dual-editor [in chief] model that has been a hallmark of JHE since 1986,” according to the statement. “When the editors vehemently opposed this action, Elsevier said it would support a dual-editor model by cutting the compensation rate by half.”</p>



<p>Editors also raised concerns about article processing charges at the journal of $3,990 that “remain out of reach for much of our authorship” and are as much as twice those “of discipline-comparable Elsevier-published journals.”</p>



<p>Attempts to seek comment from Elsevier and to learn the name of the associate editor who did not resign from the recently resigned editors in chief were met with holiday out-of-office replies. We will update this post with anything we learn.</p>



<p>The mass resignation is the 20th such episode since early 2023, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">our records</a>. Earlier this year, <em>Nature</em> asked, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00887-y">what do these group exits achieve</a>?”</p>

<p>If 2024 felt like a whirlwind, you’re not alone. It was another busy one here at Retraction Watch, too.</p>



<p>Some numbers to tell that story:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>2024 was a record traffic year for us, with 7.5 million pageviews – a 15 percent jump from the previous record, set in 2015, thanks to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">scoop</a> some longtime readers may remember. </li>



<li>Here’s our <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/retractionwatch.com/post/3le7nswez3s23">top 10 list</a> by traffic (in a thread over at Bluesky, which we joined in November).</li>



<li>The <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">Retraction Watch Database</a> – now part of Crossref – has just shy of 55,000 retraction entries, and counting.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sampling of a few other key accomplishments this year:</p>



<span id="more-130589"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We published four major investigations in <em>Science</em>. One piece exposed what one researcher called a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">“nasty” publishing scheme</a> at a dental school to boost its global rankings. Another revealed that paper mills – a major scourge of today’s publishers – have been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">bribing editors at prestigious journals</a> to ensure their clients’ work is published.  We also found companies are <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">preying on doctors</a> desperate to publish papers to obtain U.S. residencies. And just last week, we revealed that shoddy commentaries were <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise">overwhelming journals in a bid to boost metrics</a>.</li>



<li>Our reporting at Retraction Watch has had significant impact, including the resignation of deans in <a href="https://nevadasagebrush.com/2024/04/15/unr-dean-of-engineering-replaced-associate-dean-taking-place/">Nevada</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/19/dean-in-indonesia-resigns-following-retraction-watch-report/">Indonesia</a>, the retraction of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">flawed paper in economics</a>, and the retraction of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/30/journal-retracts-80-papers-idd-as-paper-mill-products-following-sleuths-report-undark-retraction-watch-investigation/">80 papers at once</a> for compromised peer review.</li>



<li>We published op-eds in <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-06-24/scientific-fraud-the-case-of-the-spanish-university-rector-should-prompt-change-to-ranking-system.html"><em>El Pais</em></a>, <a href="https://thanhnien.vn/vi-sao-khong-nen-phi-thoi-gian-cho-cac-bang-xep-hang-nha-khoa-hoc-185240822195312368.htm"><em>Thanh Nien</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/11/scientific-journals-retractions-paper-mills/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</li>



<li>Anna Abalkina, our partner on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03894-1">named one of the Nature 10</a>, a “list of people who shaped science in 2024.”</li>



<li>We gave <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/44-1/SRSR/meeting-112/evidence">testimony</a> to the Canadian Parliament’s Standing Committee on Science and Research.</li>



<li>We gave invited talks around the world, from <a href="https://unmevents.unm.edu/event/keynote-ivan-oransky-md---retractions-on-the-rise-but-not-enough/">Albuquerque</a> to <a href="https://www.uksg.org/events/conference24/">Glasgow</a> to <a href="https://eur-gene.u-paris.fr/en/%C3%A9v%C3%A8nement/__trashed/">Paris</a>.</li>

<p>Both publishers criticized the move, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/finland-downgrades-mdpi-and-frontiers-will-others-follow-suit">first reported</a> in <em>Times Higher Education</em>, as lacking transparency and seeming to target fully open-access publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finland’s Publication Forum (JUFO) “is a rating and classification system to support the quality assessment of research output,” which factors into government funding for universities, according to its website. “The objective is to encourage Finnish scholars and researchers to publish their research outcomes in high-level domestic and foreign forums.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130575"></span>



<p>JUFO rates journals on a scale from 1 to 3, with higher ratings corresponding to more points for funding. Publications in titles rated “<a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/faq-0#Q5">level 0</a>” count the same as popular articles or scientific articles that haven’t been peer-reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, as we reported, JUFO <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/28/finland-group-downgrades-60-journals/">downgraded 60 journals</a>, most of them from MDPI, from level 1 to level 0&nbsp; after soliciting feedback from researchers about their experiences with the quality of publications in scientific journals.</p>



<p>JUFO later <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/grey-area-journals-level-0">decided it would downgrade</a> MDPI and Frontiers journals to level 0 in 2025, calling the publications “grey area journals” which “make use of the APC (Article Processing Charge) operating model and aim to increase the number of publications with the minimum time spend for editorial work and quality assessment.” The announcement continued: </p>



<p>One of the most important changes in scientific publishing in Finland is the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/publication-volume-decreased-mdpi-journals">sharp increase in the number of articles</a> published especially in MDPI and Frontiers open access journals operating with APC fees. The scientific community’s key concern is, whether the costs of open access publishing increases unreasonably, and whether the increase happens at the expense of a thorough quality assessment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 16, JUFO released a <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/sites/default/files/2024-12/List%20of%20journals%20to%20be%20downgraded%20to%20level%200.pdf">list</a> of 271 journals that will be downgraded to level 0 next year, 193 from MDPI and 78 from Frontiers. Based on suggestions from discipline-specific panels of experts, JUFO kept 16 MDPI and 22 Frontiers journals at level 1, the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/changes-classification">announcement</a> stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are deeply concerned by JUFO&#8217;s recent decision and find it challenging to understand the objectivity of the applied criteria,” Giulia Stefenelli, scientific communications lead for MDPI, said in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MDPI-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch. “The simultaneous downgrade of 271 journals suggests a generalized evaluation process rather than a fair assessment of each journal’s merit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, the sudden death of a young MDPI employee <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/22/young-employees-death-puts-workplace-culture-in-spotlight-at-publisher-mdpi/">raised questions about the workplace culture at the company</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Frontiers-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, Shirley Dent, head of public relations for Frontiers, said all of the publisher’s downgraded journals meet JUFO’s criteria for level 1 ranking. “Targeting” publishers with author-funded open-access models “is both unfair and arbitrary – the assessment ranking of journals should simply be based on the quality and value of services provided,” Dent said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dent also said JUFO’s statement on their decision “does not provide any evidence” but points to “hearsay, anecdote and discredited lists.” Frontiers did not receive any “substantial feedback” about issues to address, “which is the core criterion of any evaluation process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“​​The decision can only be interpreted as an attack on a publishing model, rather than as an assessment of journal quality,”&nbsp; she said, in comments <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2024/12/19/institutional-journal-lists-place-an-unfair-burden-on-publishers/">echoing those by Frontiers&#8217; Fred Fenter in the LSE Impact Blog</a>.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="365" height="480" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130571" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png 365w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-228x300.png 228w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martin Gleave</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A high-profile Canadian urologist received an editorial expression of concern for one of his papers this month, after anonymous comments on PubPeer flagged suspected data duplication in dozens of his articles. </p>



<p>By our count, sleuths have flagged <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=gleave">30 papers</a> co-authored by Martin Gleave, a professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and co-founder of the Vancouver Prostate Centre. According to the posts on PubPeer, images in these studies appear “much more similar than expected” based on analyses using the similarity detection software ImageTwin. The issues include similarities within individual papers and across multiple publications, with some comments suggesting the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0D5681C40B524E650ACBC095B0A627#">alleged reuse of tumor specimens</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gleave, an appointee to the Order of Canada for his work developing treatments for prostate cancer, has received more than $120 million (approximately $84 million USD) in funding throughout his career, according to his profile on the Vancouver Prostate Centre website. He is also a co-founder of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, with several of the findings from the flagged papers connected to the company and related patents.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130569"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Gleave stated, “We are taking the comments seriously, and assessing them internally now,” adding it would take “a couple of months to understand and respond to the issues.” He declined to speculate on how the mistakes might have occurred, writing that he couldn’t provide insights “at this time,” but maintained the errors did not affect the findings or conclusions of the papers.</p>



<p>A media representative at the University of British Columbia acknowledged the PubPeer comments, but declined to comment on whether the works were under investigation, stating the university does not “discuss employee matters.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This month, the<em> British Journal of Cancer</em>, a Springer Nature publication, published an expression of concern for the 2012 paper “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2012209">Clusterin inhibition using OGX-011 synergistically enhances antitumour activity of sorafenib in a human renal cell carcinoma model</a>.” The paper, a collaboration between Gleave and researchers from Kobe University in Japan, is one of the 30 flagged on PubPeer. It has been cited 36 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-024-02918-x">journal’s notice</a> cites “concerns” about similarities between Western blots meant to represent different experimental conditions. The expression of concern follows a June post on PubPeer in which an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08A295E42FAFF9BBA26D466706DDEB#">anonymous commenter</a> had reported the similarities, which appeared to involve horizontal and vertical resizing of the images. According to the journal, the original data are no longer available, and “Readers are therefore advised to interpret these results with caution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four more of the 30 papers are published in other Springer Nature journals:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CD385980501604D8BF94A365C1E221#">Novel inhibition of AKR1C3 and androgen receptor axis by PTUPB synergizes enzalutamide treatment in advanced prostate cancer</a>, <em>Oncogene,</em> 2023</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E9001D25ED3D6759538174F6AE70DB#">Clusterin facilitates stress-induced lipidation of LC3 and autophagosome biogenesis to enhance cancer cell survival</a>, <em>Nature Communications,</em> 2014</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0B338779F44A3334DE459C033D770D#">Hsp27 silencing coordinately inhibits proliferation and promotes Fas-induced apoptosis by regulating the PEA-15 molecular switch</a>, <em>Cell Death and Differentiation,</em> 2012</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4C9F14E87FC3A5B64D7042262A5E9B#">Heat shock protein 27 confers resistance to androgen ablation and chemotherapy in prostate cancer cells through eIF4E</a>, <em>Oncogene,</em> 2010</li>
</ul>



<p>A spokesperson from Springer Nature, Alice Kay, confirmed the publisher is “aware of the concerns and [is] looking into them” and said editors would decide on appropriate action once they had established the facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another of Gleave’s papers, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283813013808">Suppression of Heat Shock Protein 27 Using OGX-427 Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Potentiates Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors to Delay Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer</a>”, published in <em>European Urology </em>in 2014<em>,</em> was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283816002712?via%3Dihub">corrected</a> in 2016 for mislabeling and duplication of data. But the journal doesn’t appear to have addressed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2D45B0398BD26B918696E6F368EC7#">the more recent concerns</a> about additional data duplications.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Gleave%22+%2B+%22dong%22">Several of the papers</a> flagged originated from the lab of Xuesen Dong, a frequent co-author with Gleave and a senior research scientist at the Vancouver Prostate Centre and professor at the University of British Columbia. They include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/92D29150742BE3C36895DB0543D53C#">Consensus PP1 binding motifs regulate transcriptional corepression and alternative RNA splicing activities of the steroid receptor coregulators, p54nrb and PSF</a>, <em>Molecular Endocrinology</em>, 2011</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/502BA68BFA9EAC0588A0DB91704488#">Prostate stromal cells express the progesterone receptor to control cancer cell mobility</a>, <em>PLoS ONE</em>, 2014</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D8AC95DB6BFB09699C8FE5714247AD#">UGT2B17 Expedites Progression of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancers by Promoting Ligand-Independent AR Signaling</a>, <em>Cancer Research</em>, 2016</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FE78FF07944B56112DBD6260CE02F6#">Catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II suppress the androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer progression</a>, <em>Oncotarget</em>, 2015</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7F3F271CAEDF3B7DF8E0DF4913118E#">Downregulation of c-SRC kinase CSK promotes castration resistant prostate cancer and pinpoints a novel disease subclass</a>, <em>Oncotarget</em>, 2015</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1D20E72C797DE6EFCB2CCA9862BA02#">Expression and function of the progesterone receptor in human prostate stroma provide novel insights to cell proliferation control</a>, <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</em>, 2013</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first five papers listed above, Dong attributed the errors to students who “inadvertently inserted incorrect images into the figures,” he wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. He explained most of the issues involve Western blots, “which can appear very similar” or originate from “experiments with comparable designs. The images “were often labeled with file names that differed by only one letter or a small detail,” he stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Compounding the issue, many of these incorrect images were part of larger composite figures containing up to 30 subfigures, which made the errors more challenging to identify,” he added. Dong also said the method his lab used to develop Western blots may have contributed to “flipped images being saved and later incorporated into figures.”</p>



<p>Addressing concerns about the final paper in question, published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism </em>in 2013, Dong claimed “there is no mistake” in the figure referenced in the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1D20E72C797DE6EFCB2CCA9862BA02#">PubPeer comment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, <em>Oncotarget</em> contacted Dong in late June regarding “image irregularities” in two of his papers published in the journal. That followed <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/A14D808A9A8155FA23A7522AC05140#2">anonymous</a> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/FE78FF07944B56112DBD6260CE02F6#2">comments</a> on PubPeer detailing similarities between images earlier the same month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the 2015 paper “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/4279/text/">Downregulation of c-SRC kinase CSK promotes castration resistant prostate cancer and pinpoints a novel disease subclass</a>” published in <em>Oncotarget</em>, Dong echoed the explanation he provided to Retraction Watch. He told the journal manager the project “involved a large amount of immunoblotting assays, and all loading controls looked similar. Therefore the two actin images were mistakenly inserted.” He added, “Regardless, these minor mistakes did not affect the conclusion we have drawn.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/4105/text/">Catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II suppress the androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer progression</a>,” another 2015 paper in <em>Oncotarget</em>, the journal pointed out similarities to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2014303">an earlier publication</a> in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>. Dong explained that the first author, Haolong Li, had been working on the two publications simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Each project involved a large amount of western blotting assays,” he told the journal. “And all images for the loading controls look very similar and easily misplaced.” No corrections have yet been posted for the <em>Oncotarget </em>papers, and the journal has not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late November, Dong’s co-authors reached out to the other three journals which published papers containing erroneous data to request corrections, according to emails shared with Retraction Watch. None so far has been corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another 14 of Gleave’s papers flagged on PubPeer were published in American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) journals, with six of them in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. In an email, Christine Battle, publisher and vice president of scientific publications at AACR, wrote they would be examining the articles and will correct or retract if required.</p>

<p>The authors of an influential but controversial 2020 paper on the activity of bat coronaviruses in China which proposed the animals as a “likely origin” for the virus that causes COVID-19 have retracted their work and republished a revised version of the analysis. They say their results and conclusions did not change.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17687-3">Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China</a>,” appeared Aug. 25, 2020, in <em>Nature Communications</em>. It has been cited 154 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and by at least two <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/88830779/policy-documents">international policy documents</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are affiliated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the New York City-based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which has come under intense scrutiny by members of the U.S. Congress and others. The U.S. government in May <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/federal-officials-suspend-funding-ecohealth-alliance-nonprofit-entangled-covid-19">suspended</a> funding for EcoHealth amid concerns the COVID-19 pandemic virus may have developed from research on which the nonprofit and Wuhan lab collaborated – a so-called “lab leak.” EcoHealth has denied the pandemic virus could have emerged from its work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130566"></span>



<p>Peter Daszak, a corresponding author of the paper and president of EcoHealth, told Retraction Watch the researchers had discovered dozens of the more than 1,000 viral sequences in the paper didn’t come from China, but from “a few miles over the border” in Laos. He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Given that bats on both sides of the border likely co-mingle, and that our initial analyses were conducted by zoogeographic regions which encompass cross-border populations, we did not expect that the inclusion of these samples changed any conclusions substantially. However, given that the title and focus of the paper was for CoVs from bats in China, the authors decided to remove the 41 Laotian sequences, and repeat all of the paper’s analyses. During this process, we were also able to remove 29 sequences that were duplicated in the Genbank database. As expected, the results did not change substantially, and the conclusions remain the same.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nature Communications</em> published the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55384-7">revised analysis</a> on December 19, along with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55454-w">retraction notice</a> for the original article. The abstracts of the original and revised papers are identical, except for the number of viral sequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors learned of the erroneously included sequences “months after publication,” Daszak said. He did not immediately respond to our questions about when his group informed the journal, or whether they considered publishing an expression of concern while they conducted the new analysis.</p>

<p><em>The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation </em>(<em>JHLT</em>) has decided against retracting a November 2024 paper that&nbsp; violated the ethics policy of the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publishing the paper, which describes a new mechanical circulatory support device used to treat heart failure that was developed in China, staff at the journal realised two of the patients in the study had received organ transplants in that country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dozens of research articles have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/">been retracted or flagged</a> for appearing to have used organs procured from executed prisoners in China, and many journals around the world have introduced policies to avoid such research. <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement, published in 2022, bans data on human organ transplants from journals or scientific sessions when they originate from countries, particularly China, where organ procurement from prisoners has been observed.</p>



<span id="more-130542"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01664-4/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">study</a>, “Long-term outcomes of a novel fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device for the treatment of advanced heart failure in China,” has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s abstract was initially presented at the annual meeting of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, which runs the journal, said cardiologist <a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/joseph-g-rogers/">Joseph Rogers</a>, president and chief executive officer of the Texas Heart Institute and the editor-in-chief of <em>JHLT</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a “lengthy debate,” Rogers said, the editors decided retracting the paper would be an “inappropriate response” despite the journal’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>“We didn’t want to convey to the readership that there was something scientifically invalid about the paper,” Rogers said. “That’s not true. The paper was scientifically valid.”</p>



<p>The journal also printed <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01804-7/abstract">two editorials</a>, one by the journal’s then interim editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/michelle-kittleson-309129.html">Michelle Kittleson</a> of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who initially accepted the study, and the other about <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01803-5/abstract?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">the journal’s ethics statement</a>, signed by the <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Retraction Watch</em> has reached out to <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/savitri-fedson-21192">Savitri Fedson</a>, of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a co-author of the editorial about <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal published the editorials to recognise <em>JHLT </em>missed the issue and had violated its own ethics commitments. If the issue was spotted beforehand, he noted, <em>JHLT </em>would have rejected the study. Going forward, the journal has put in “additional safeguards” to prevent violation of the ethics statement, Rogers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1141521/overview">Shengshou Hu</a>, the study’s corresponding author, who is based at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>As part of the safeguards, all papers are now sent to Rogers, who desk-rejects any papers involving human organ transplants in China, he said. That step is particularly&nbsp; important, he noted, because peer reviewers working for the journal are not required to read the publication’s ethics statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal contacted the study’s authors. “What we really wanted to do was reassure them that the reason that we were editorializing their paper in this manner was not because of the scientific content of the paper,” he added. “It was really a failure of our internal checks and balances that allowed that paper to move forward.”</p>

The authors of the report describe ecological medicine as “the structured and deliberate use of connectedness and interaction with plants, animals, and other species to generate a therapeutic effect for individuals.” While few would doubt the value of spending time in the natural world, the suggestion that we need medicine to mediate our connection to nature is a striking one. Surely nothing could be more direct and immediate than the sense of awe we feel when we gaze upon the vast night sky, or the sense of renewal we feel when wandering in a spring meadow? And surely, too, it is more than just our health that is affected by this engagement; <em>we </em>are affected.</p><p>That the concept of ecological medicine seems to be pointing at something so familiar, and yet seems to be expressing it in such a striking and novel manner, gives us pause to reflect. How have we arrived at a point in our civilisation where it seems sensible to describe as a medical discovery the idea that “other species are worthy of respect”, and that the recognition of inter-species reciprocity that is enabled by participating in ecological medicine “serves to counteract some of the societal elements contributing to society’s epidemic of mental health problems”?</p><p>This manner of approaching our sense of connection with nature is, arguably, emblematic of a sweeping cultural trend: </p><div><blockquote> We appear to be losing our grasp on ways of conceiving of human flourishing other than in medical terms. </blockquote></div><p>Today, we speak of ‘mental health’, often treating this as synonymous with the notion of flourishing itself. To accept the notions of ‘mental health’ and ‘flourishing’ as synonymous with each other involves a commitment to the conjunction of the following two claims:</p><div>C1: To be mentally healthy is to flourish; and</div><div>C2: To flourish is to be mentally healthy.</div><p>C1 takes mental health to be sufficient for flourishing, whilst C2 takes it to be a necessary condition. C1 is the stronger of the two claims insofar as it asserts that nothing else—apart from being mentally healthy—is required for human flourishing. C2, unlike C1, allows for the possibility that there may be <em>other </em>conditions besides that of mental health that are also necessary for human flourishing—conditions pertaining to other domains of value such as ethics or aesthetics (domains that are of course salient in our connection with nature). But even the weaker claim, C2, imports a medical connotation into our conception of human flourishing that would have once seemed novel, perhaps even puzzling. Aristotle in the <em>Eudaimian Ethics</em>, for instance, takes health (like wealth or honour) to be a means by which we might come to flourish, rather than as tantamount to flourishing itself. How did this connotation appear, signalling the shift towards the medicalisation of our understanding of what it means to flourish?</p><p>Here is one story of the origin of this connotation (told by Martin Seligman, a founding father of the positive psychology movement): if (severely) distressing emotional experiences are cast as states of pathology, as contemporary psychiatry does, then it isn’t a huge leap (although it is a <em>substantive </em>one) from this claim to the idea that being in a state opposite to this—that is, enjoying a preponderance of pleasant emotional experiences—amounts to a state of wellness, a state of wellbeing, indeed a state of flourishing. This chain of inference is one of the major paths we have taken that has led us towards the medicalisation of our conception of flourishing. If this is right, then recovering alternate, non-medicalised conceptions of human flourishing, conceptions that might well return to us the expressive power to capture (amongst other things) our immediate connection with nature that we intuit, will involve a dissection of the concept of emotional disorder.</p><p>What, then, is the basis of the claim that (severely) distressing emotional states constitute states of pathology? From what general concept of disorder is this identification derived, and in light of what conception of our emotional lives might this identification be motivated?&nbsp;Surprising lines of inquiry emerge in the course of this exploration, all of which point to the pivotal role that our emotions play in the myriad ways we appraise our lives and make sense of ourselves. One particular line is worth mentioning here: it is often assumed that the medicalisation of our understanding of human flourishing signifies progress, at least in the sense that it yields an understanding that is informed by scientific knowledge. But this line of inquiry invites us to consider whether human flourishing is something we should seek to understand exclusively in scientific terms (as the invocation of the idea of progress implies). Indeed, is it something we should seek to understand in scientific terms at all? A systematic investigation of the value of emotions in human life suggests that there are visions of human flourishing that invite, indeed compel, not the detachment of the scientific gaze, but our immersion in life through the exercise of our rational agency. It is in appreciating the trade-offs between these alternative conceptions of human flourishing, and the appraisals they lead us to make of our emotional experiences, that we arrive at a clearer reflective understanding of our current predicament. It is in so doing that we may recover our power to express the immediate connection we feel with nature when we plant an acorn and tend its growth.</p><p>My aim is not to argue in favour of any particular conception of flourishing—and so I do not, for instance, claim that it is a mistake to medicalise our sense of connection with nature. It is rather to display as perspicuously as possible some of the conceptual structures that guide our ongoing quest to live happier and more enlightened lives. This quest has, for the most part, taken a very distinctive shape over the past half century: we pour billions of dollars each year into the enterprise of improving our ‘mental health’. It is ultimately for us to decide, individually and collectively, whether thinking of our flourishing in terms of the notion of ‘mental health’ is a good thing to do—rather than being, merely, something we’ve simply ended up doing.</p><p><em><sub>Featured Image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@cmdor?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Sébastien Bourguet</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-brown-and-red-beans-sxrpceiAKts?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909669284/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/909669284/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f12%2fphoto-1510950109928-f3aac6afbb03-1-273x194.avif"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/jolly-yule/">Jolly Yule</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/a-look-behind-the-curtain-at-the-best-books-of-2024/">A look behind the curtain at the best books of 2024</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/does-the-get-italics/">Does &#8220;the&#8221; get italics?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>
