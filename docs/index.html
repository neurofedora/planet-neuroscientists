                For decades, Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been viewed as a disorder of the brain. This perspective was shaped by the presence of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates throughout the brain, combined with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Collectively, these dysfunctions drive the devastating motor symptoms, speech difficulties, and cognitive decline that characterise PD. However, recent research challenges this brain-centric view. Alpha-synuclein has been identified to appear in the...

<p>In a new memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kangaroo-Dreams-Prof-Tuan-Nguyen/dp/1965142613"><em>Kangaroo Dreams</em></a>, Tuan V. Nguyen, D.Sc., Ph.D., provides a unique perspective on medical research. Nguyen escaped Vietnam in 1981 as part of the mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people">“boat people”</a> exodus of refugees, taking to dangerous waters just a few months after his older brother attempted the same and disappeared. Making his way to Australia through grit and luck in 1982, Nguyen started his new life as a dishwasher before steadily building a career in science, ultimately specializing in bone research.</p>



<p>Nguyen is now distinguished professor of predictive medicine and director of the Center for Health Technologies at the University of Technology Sydney and adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales. He’s also a Leadership Fellow of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and a member of the Order of Australia. Dedicated to the memory of his lost brother, <em>Kangaroo Dreams</em> weaves Nguyen’s personal journey with a thoughtful examination of contemporary medical research. We interviewed him in writing to learn more. (Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: You were co-author on </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/367284a0"><strong>a 1994 <em>Nature</em> paper</strong></a><strong> subsequently </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/387106a0"><strong>corrected in 1997</strong></a><strong> which reported individuals with a particular vitamin D receptor gene benefitted from relatively high bone mineral density. When the research team made this finding, you write, “A nagging unease, however, bothered me. The results, while undeniably impressive, seemed almost too good to be true.” The team published the findings only to discover – after a <em>Nature</em> reader challenged the results – that a lab member who was ill likely contaminated samples, skewing the results. Did you regret not having pushed harder on your initial doubts? What held you back?</strong></p>



<span id="more-133901"></span>



<p>Nguyen: I come from a cultural background, particularly in Vietnam, where respect for teachers and senior colleagues is considered an ethical obligation rather than a matter of courtesy. This principle strongly shapes how junior scientists engage in professional discourse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In retrospect, I sometimes wish I had expressed my reservations more directly. At the time, however, as a junior member of the team, my response was shaped by a strong cultural and professional norm of deference to senior colleagues, limited experience, and a good-faith expectation that the results would be independently validated through subsequent work anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This experience became an important lesson for me in the need to actively insist on rigorous validation, particularly when findings appear unusually strong.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Why did it take three years to publish a correction</strong>?</p>



<p>Nguyen: The reader’s question prompted a careful re-examination of thousands of original samples. Investigating the matter, including confirming the likely source of sample contamination and re-running the analyses, required time and thoroughness. This process was followed by internal discussions and coordination among the co-authors to ensure a shared understanding of the findings. The journal’s correction procedures also contributed to the overall timeline. Importantly, after the analysis was completed, the main conclusions of the study remained unchanged, which was a considerable relief for all of us. Once the evidence was clear and fully documented, we proceeded with the correction.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Tell us briefly about the “experiment” you conducted which validated your suspicion about bias against papers authored by people with Vietnamese names.</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: At the time, I was running two research labs, one in Australia and one in Vietnam. In Vietnam, I had established a large, population-based prospective study with the support of many dedicated physicians and scientists. As this work progressed, I observed a recurring pattern: manuscripts from my Vietnamese lab received reviews that I regarded as unfair and unprofessional. Some were distinctly patronizing and, in certain cases, intimidating in tone. In some instances, reviewers raised statistically incorrect criticisms, even though I have extensive expertise in this area, having served as a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and as a statistical editor for three medical journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, some submissions were desk rejected with little or no explanation. Sometimes, the stated reason was that the work “added little to the literature,” despite the fact that these studies were genuinely novel. I also observed instances in which conceptually similar studies conducted in Western populations were subsequently published, while our previous work in Vietnam addressing the same questions with more rigor was deemed insufficiently original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prompted me to explore whether factors such as author affiliation or name recognition might be influencing editorial decisions. To do this, we submitted essentially similar manuscripts to the same journal, varying only the authorship. In the initial submission, all authors were based in Vietnam, and the manuscript was desk rejected. Several months later, a closely comparable version, now including my name and that of an Australian colleague, was submitted and was sent out for external review. At that point, we withdrew the manuscript and informed the editors of what we had done.</p>



<p>Although this was not a formal study, the outcome was consistent with my own experience and with broader discussions in the literature regarding unconscious bias in peer review, particularly as it relates to authors and institutions from lower-resource countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW: We frequently report on paper mills, citation cartels and the like, and these often are located in developing nations. Do you think our reporting is adding to the bias, and what would you advise?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I have followed Retraction Watch with great interest for many years, as its reporting consistently reflects issues I have encountered firsthand in practice. Drawing in part on insights from your reporting, I have for 20 years raised concerns about research and publication ethics in Vietnam through the popular press and books written in Vietnamese.</p>

<p>I consider that your reporting is essential in uncovering genuine misconduct and in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research, irrespective of geography. That said, there is a possibility that sustained emphasis on particular regions may unintentionally reinforce certain perceptions or stereotypes, especially if comparable issues elsewhere receive less attention. For example, researchers in economically advanced countries also publish in predatory or questionable journals and engage in a range of questionable research practices, such as salami publication or <em>p</em>-hacking. Highlighting these issues across diverse settings can help ensure a more balanced and contextualized understanding of research integrity challenges.</p>



<p>So, my suggestion would be to continue this important work. At the same time, it may be helpful to place greater emphasis on the broader, systemic drivers of misconduct, such as publication pressure and incentive structures that operate across all research systems. Where possible, including more cases from high-income settings would add valuable context. Taken together, this broader coverage can help ensure that the focus remains on practices and structures, rather than on geography alone.</p>



<p><strong>RW: In your book, you explore the dangers of narcissism to science. What do you think academics should do when they spot narcissism in a potential collaborator? In a detractor? In a mentee?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Over the course of my career, I have encountered many individuals with strong narcissistic traits in science. They can be intellectually stimulating colleagues, and some are undoubtedly highly talented. At the same time, these traits can present challenges in collaborative and mentoring contexts.</p>



<p>For potential collaborators, it is sensible to proceed with some caution. Reviewing their track record for equitable credit-sharing, collegiality, and ethical conduct can be helpful. If concerns arise, such as excessive self-promotion or a history of difficult collaborations, it may be wise to limit the scope of engagement or, if necessary, decline involvement.</p>



<p>For detractors, maintaining professionalism is the key. I find it helpful to focus discussions strictly on data, methods, and evidence, while documenting interactions and avoiding personal escalation. This approach helps keep disagreements constructive and protects one’s own position.</p>



<p>For mentees, early and thoughtful mentoring is particularly important. Setting clear expectations, modeling humility, and encouraging self-reflection can help channel ambition toward productive, collaborative outcomes. When left unaddressed, these traits can be detrimental not only to individuals but also to research groups and institutions.</p>



<p><strong>RW: It has been very challenging to stop bad behavior in the sciences, partly because of the problem of self-interested institutions, as you note in your book. Do you suppose there should be some system for weeding out or at least being vigilant about problem personalities in the sciences? And if so, what would that look like?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I would be cautious about any formal mechanism designed to “weed out” individuals, as such approaches risk misuse and unnecessary punishment. A more constructive approach is to focus on systems and institutional culture, rather than on labeling people.</p>



<p>For example, institutions could strengthen anonymous and well-protected channels for reporting bullying or misconduct. They could provide regular training in research ethics and professional conduct. Broader forms of feedback, such as 360-degree evaluations, could also be incorporated into promotion and leadership decisions. In addition, greater transparency around conflicts of interest, particularly for reviewers and editors, would help build trust in the system.</p>



<p>In addition, I think professional societies and funding agencies can play an important role. They can recognize and reward behaviors that promote collegiality, integrity, and mentorship, rather than focusing exclusively on narrow performance metrics. In my view, lasting improvement is more likely to arise from sustained cultural change and shared accountability than from purely punitive approaches.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Is there a role for overtly teaching humility in scientific training?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Yes, but it should be framed as a professional skill essential to scientific rigor, rather than as a moral trait.</p>



<p>In my cultural background, modesty and humility are considered professional and social norms. In other settings, however, humility may be interpreted as weakness, while overconfidence is sometimes rewarded as a sign of competence. In science, this inversion is problematic: overconfidence increases the risk of bias, discourages serious engagement with uncertainty, and can lead to premature or overstated conclusions.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is a strong case for giving humility more explicit attention in scientific training, alongside technical and methodological skills. Science advances through collective effort, and progress depends on recognizing uncertainty, fallibility, and the contributions of others. Humility, in this sense, underpins good judgment, reproducibility, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Early in my career, my institute director, a widely respected figure in DNA research, regularly reminded us to be modest and to share credit. This advice shaped my own approach to mentorship and is something I consciously pass on to my students.</p>



<p>Humility can also be addressed through structured training. In Vietnam, I have led workshops and seminars on research ethics and facilitated discussions of historical cases in which overconfidence or unrecognized bias led to serious scientific error. These settings allow trainees to see humility not as self-effacement, but as a safeguard against flawed reasoning.</p>



<p>That said, mentorship plays a central role in shaping scientific values. I was fortunate to train under a physician–scientist of exceptional integrity, who consistently modeled openness to critique, respect for replication, and a willingness to revise conclusions in light of new evidence. When demonstrated in practice, these principles are often absorbed more deeply than through formal instruction alone.</p>



<p>Thus, by treating humility as a core professional competency, essential to methodological rigor, we can strengthen both scientific outcomes and research culture.</p>

<p>A “scholarly business and management publication” is holding a researcher’s paper for ransom, requesting the author pay to withdraw the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher submitted a manuscript in August to the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal</em> in August, thinking he had sent it to the <a href="https://www.aom.org/publications/journals/journal/"><em>Academy of Management Journal</em></a><em>.</em> He asked to remain anonymous for fear of seeming careless “rather than recognizing the real predatory nature” of the journal.</p>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://archive.is/poCsx">homepage</a> notes it is indexed in Scopus, but it was <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/19700175176#tabs=2">delisted in 2021</a>, nor is it indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science. Its <a href="https://archive.is/AfFMm">most recent volume</a> contains five single-author articles from nonexistent universities. None of the articles has a DOI or provides an email for the author.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133910"></span>



<p>Once the researcher realized his mistake the following day, he asked to withdraw his manuscript. In emails seen by Retraction Watch, the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em>asked the researcher to pay €1,519 —&nbsp; roughly $1,770 — to “remove your article from our database.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months later, the journal emailed the researcher saying it was “working on” his article and asked if he had any revisions. The email, signed by “Blessy Mertins,” did not address the researcher’s withdrawal request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher then sent what he termed a “cease and desist” letter to the journal soon after. As of now, the article has not been published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal&nbsp; </em>did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iriem.org/pro/memberdetail.aspx?ID=295">Sang-Bing Tsai</a>, one of the <a href="https://archive.is/QHtWx">three listed editors-in-chief</a> on the journal’s website, told us he has no affiliation with the “fake journal” which is using his name “without permission.” Tsai said he reached out to the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em>“five or six years ago” to request his name be removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other two listed editors-in-chief are Shawn Carraher and Roberto Cerchione. Carraher’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-carraher-0b60b118/">LinkedIn profile</a> lists his affiliation with the journal and states he is doing a “post doctoral “Graduate Certificate in Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship” at Harvard University. A representative from Harvard told us no one by that name is currently enrolled in the program, which does not offer a post-doctoral degree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carraher did not respond to our request for comment when we reached out via LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cerchione, a professor at the University of Naples, Parthenope, similarly lists his affiliation with the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberto-cerchione-21888267/?originalSubdomain=it">on his LinkedIn profile</a>. Cerchione did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is published by Allied Business Academies, a company that has been flagged for <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/dementia-conference-fraud-1.3941354">fake conferences</a> and <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201709/20/01-5134920-fraudes-fausses-revues-scientifiques-faux-congres.php">journals</a>, as reported by <em>CBC News</em> and <em>La Presse</em>.

<p>The reviewer, a neuroscientist in Germany, was confused. The manuscript on her screen, describing efforts to model a thin layer of gray matter in the brain called the indusium griseum, seemed oddly devoid of gist. The figures in the single-authored article made little sense, the MATLAB functions provided were irrelevant, the discussion failed to engage with the results and felt more like a review of the literature.</p>



<p>And, the reviewer wondered, was the resolution of the publicly available MRI data the manuscript purported to analyze sufficient to visualize the delicate anatomical structure in the first place? She turned to a colleague who sat in the same office. An expert in analyzing brain images, he confirmed her suspicion: The resolution was too low. (Both researchers spoke to us on condition of anonymity.)</p>



<p>The reviewer suggested rejecting the manuscript, which had been submitted to Springer Nature’s <em>Brain Topography</em>. But in November, just a few weeks later, the colleague she had consulted received an invitation to review the same paper, this time for <em>Scientific Reports</em>. He accepted out of curiosity. A figure supposed to depict the indusium griseum but showing a simple sine wave baffled him. “You look at that and think, well, this is not looking like an anatomical structure,” he told us. </p>



<span id="more-133879"></span>



<p>Like his colleague who had looked at the manuscript before him, he also felt the text read like technobabble produced by a large language model – full of scientific-sounding sentences without much real meaning.</p>



<p>The two reviewers compared notes. Based on the first review, the author had swapped the irrelevant MATLAB functions in the text for others. But the results and images remained the same. “Nice try, my friend,” the second reviewer recalled thinking. “But forget it.”</p>



<p>At the end of November, however, he again was asked to review a manuscript by the same author, associate professor<a href="https://ubys.medeniyet.edu.tr/ABPDS/AcademicInformation/BilgiGoruntulemev2/Index?pid=ZkmbkJz6B!xDDx!e81D!xBBx!i8TjSfQ!xGGx!!xGGx!"> Eren Öğüt</a> of Istanbul Medeniyet University, a public institution. The new paper, submitted to <em>Neuroinformatics</em>, dealt with a different brain structure, but the abstract geometric shapes it presented were beginning to look familiar.</p>



<p>With growing suspicion, the reviewer looked Öğüt up online. In 2025 alone, the Turkish academic had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Eren-Ogut_-_Google-Scholar_-01-05-2026_02_21_PM_Page_1-scaled.png">published 25 papers</a> – nearly all of them in Springer Nature journals – and 12 of those were single-authored. Perhaps even more remarkably, Öğüt also<a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/1574034"> managed to review</a> nearly 650 papers that year, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Among the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Eren-ogut-reviews_Screenshot-2026-01-05-142500.png">more than 1,400 total reviews</a> he has done, 379 were for Elsevier, 225 for Wolters Kluwer Health and 139 for Springer Nature.</p>



<p>Öğüt has also served as an editor <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/1574034">for several journals from major publishers</a> and is<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260112142608/https:/link.springer.com/journal/40001/editoria"> currently listed</a> as an associate editor of Springer Nature’s <em>European Journal of Medical Research</em>. He teaches classes on anatomy and neuroanatomy and claims to be a member of Sigma Xi, a scientific honor society based in the United States.</p>



<p>To the two reviewers in Germany, Öğüt’s level of productivity did not seem humanly possible. Rather, they told us, it appears to be accomplished through reckless use of generative AI. One indication they could be right: Öğüt’s reviews <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ogut-review-length_Screenshot-2026-01-12-124232.png">average 364 words each</a>, which is just a single word more than the average review length calculated from 11 million reviews.</p>



<p>Extensive review activity can help burnish a resume, the reviewers told us, and journal editors might also be more friendly toward manuscripts coming from a diligent reviewer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Rigorous’ peer review</strong></h3>



<p>Öğüt defended his publications, telling us some had been under way for several years, and said his review activity reflected a team effort.</p>



<p>“The appearance of both newly completed and previously developed studies being published within the same year was coincidental rather than indicative. Importantly, all manuscripts were submitted through standard journal procedures and underwent rigorous editorial handling and peer-review processes,” he told us by email.</p>



<p>“We use AI tools for editing or improving sentence clarity, just as many other researchers do,” he added. “In fact, in some manuscripts, in line with editorial and reviewer recommendations, we explicitly state that AI was used for editing purposes.”</p>



<p>Öğüt said he serves “as a reviewer and editor for many journals” and makes “every effort to meet deadlines as promptly as possible. Moreover, I work with a dedicated team who support and assist me throughout these processes.”</p>



<p>He also worried about the discussion of his unpublished work “outside the formal peer-review process,” which he said could “constitute an ethical violation.”</p>



<p>But after we reached out to him, his profiles at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Eren-Ogut_-_Google-Scholar_-01-05-2026_02_21_PM_Page_1-scaled.png">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ogut-Orcid_-_2023-01-19_13.03.49-scaled.jpg">ORCID</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Loop_Eren_Ogut_-_2025-12-24_15.41.10-scaled.jpg">Frontiers’ Loop</a> all vanished.</p>



<p>In an email from December that Retraction Watch has seen, the reviewers laid out their concerns to <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/john-van-horn">John Van Horn</a>, editor of <em>Neuroinformatics</em>, a Springer Nature title. Three of Öğüt’s single-authored research papers from 2025 were published in that journal, they noted, and they all seemed to follow the same template.</p>



<p>“The pattern of his single-authored articles and the manuscript that I reviewed was quite similar, with a similar style of title formation, redundant and/or noninformative figures, description of MATLAB functions that are not relevant for the research question at hand, and the discussion that resembles a literature review without engaging with the results of the manuscript,” the email stated. “Last but not least, the author never [shows the structures he modeled overlaid on] real MRI images, does not share the data or code, and even states that ‘<em>No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study</em>.’”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Under investigation</strong></h3>



<p>In a statement, Van Horn told us the journal had also developed “concurrent” concerns about Öğüt’s work “late last year,” and that “the manuscript submissions from this author to <em>Neuroinformatics</em>, past and current, have been referred to the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group for their detailed examination.”</p>



<p>Tim Kersjes, head of Research Integrity, Resolutions at Springer Nature, told us he could not share any details while the investigation is ongoing, “but we want to assure you that we take this matter extremely seriously.”</p>



<p>“We are grateful to the research community for bringing these concerns to our attention,” he said in a statement.</p>



<p>One of the papers in <em>Neuroinformatics</em> the reviewers’ email mentioned is titled “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-025-09743-4">Integrated 3D Modeling and Functional Simulation of the Human Amygdala: A Novel Anatomical and Computational Analyses</a>.” It purports to use a method called <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01819-0">elastic shape analysis</a> developed in 2017 by the mathematician <a href="https://anujsrivastava.com/">Anuj Srivastava</a> and his colleagues, who <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.954055/full">used the technique</a> to model the amygdala and other brain structures in a 2022 article. Öğüt’s paper cites this work and, strangely, arrives at a specific quantitative result – 38% – that it describes as also a finding of Srivastava’s 2022 paper. Yet the number, purportedly representing the “lateral bulging” of the amygdala in people with post-traumatic stress disorder, does not appear in Srivastava’s article.</p>



<p>“The value of 38% was not intended to indicate an exact numerical identity with Wu et al. (2022), but rather to reflect a representative magnitude of variance typically explained by PC1 in SRNF-based elastic shape analyses,” Öğüt told us. “We acknowledge that explicitly noting this as an approximation would have avoided potential confusion.”</p>



<p>Srivastava, who is <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/anuj-srivastava/">an incoming professor</a> at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, told us that at least on first reading, Öğüt’s paper seemed “sub standard.”</p>



<p>“The methodological details are missing, the information is superficial, the equations are mis-typed, the procedure is not reproducible, and so on. The paper repeatedly mentions our method (’Elastic Shape Analysis’) but it does not give evidence on how they used our method,” Srivastava said.</p>



<p>Jennifer S. Stevens, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University in Atlanta and a coauthor of Srivastava’s 2022 paper, also found Öğüt’s work problematic. ”Since the methods and results are very dense and confusing,” she said, “I can’t develop a formal response at this moment, but it does seem to be concerningly vague.”</p>



<p>To Srivastava, Öğüt’s publication raises a larger question: “I am wondering how this paper got accepted in the first place,” he said.</p>

<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted a paper after an investigation at a U.K. institution found the first author — then a doctoral student — manipulated data.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05771-9">The paper</a>, which looked at the sensitivity of lung cancers to immunotherapy, appeared in April 2023 and has been cited 192 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10104-7">retraction notice</a> published today states first author <a href="https://www.kevinwng.com/home/science">Kevin Ng</a> was responsible for the manipulation in the paper, including manipulated data in several figures. At the time of the experiments, Ng was a Ph.D. student at the Francis Crick Institute in London under the supervision of co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/find-a-researcher/george-kassiotis">George Kassiotis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133854"></span>



<p>According to Ng’s <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1635-6768">ORCID profile</a>, he is now a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in New York. We were unable to find a current email address for him, and he did not respond to a message sent via Instagram. </p>



<p>The Francis Crick Institute’s integrity team “was made aware of concerns” regarding the study after it was published, according to a statement sent to us by Kathryn Ingham, research communications and public affairs lead for the organization. Ingham declined to comment on the origins of the concerns. The corresponding authors on the article — Kassiotis, Charles Swanton, and Julian Downward, all affiliated with the Crick Institute — agreed with the retraction, according to the statement, which is <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/about-us/our-approach-to-science/research-integrity/2025-research-integrity-news">now published online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation found “no evidence of malpractice by other authors,” according to the Crick statement. The corresponding authors did not respond to our question on how the manipulation went unnoticed by the other 48 authors on the paper, and forwarded our request to Ingham.</p>

<p>According to the Crick report, Ng manipulated cell binding data in one of the figures, and experiments relating to three other figures couldn’t be verified. The manipulated data supported the paper’s main conclusion, according to the report, and the institute recommended the paper be retracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Crick Institute notified the journal about its findings and on November 21, <em>Nature</em> added an <a href="https://archive.ph/2W08q">editor’s note</a> to the article alerting readers to data reliability concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/find-a-researcher/julian-downward">Julian Downward</a>, associate research director at the Crick Institute, has 27 papers with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Julian+Downward%22">comments on PubPeer</a>, many of which were flagged for image concerns. In 2015, Downward lost <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/30/jbc-cancer-paper-felled-by-duplication-is-one-authors-second-retraction-this-month/">two papers in one month</a> for data issues, including one from <em>Nature</em>,<em> </em>as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>
