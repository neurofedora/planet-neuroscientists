              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-asteroid-stardust-old-space">Ryugu asteroid samples are sprinkled with stardust older than the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu contain bits of stardust that predate the birth of our solar system.</p>



<p>Slivers of Ryugu material, snagged by the Japanese Hayabusa2 spacecraft, appear to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh1003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come from the solar system’s frozen fringes</a>, rather than from the asteroid itself, scientists report July 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>. These foreign fragments could illuminate details of the solar system’s history.</p>



<p>Finding these fragments “is really unique,” says cosmochemist Ann Nguyen of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It’s showing us a new type of material, but also telling us about the dynamics of material from the outer solar system.”</p>





<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft visited the asteroid in 2018 and 2019, then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">returned to Earth with 5.4 grams of the space rock in 2020</a> (<em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Scientists examined those samples in the lab in ways that can&#8217;t be done with telescopes or even spacecraft, like getting detailed measurements of chemical composition.</p>



<p>So far, those examinations have shown that Ryugu is rich in carbon, that it’s made of the same material as some of the rarest meteorites found on Earth, and that it was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">altered by water</a> at some point in its past (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). Scientists think that Ryugu formed from the debris of a larger asteroid, which broke up in a collision and re-formed into a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">loose pile of rubble</a> (<em>SN: 3/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>Nguyen, however, was searching for something different. “My focus of research is presolar grains,” tiny specks of material that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteorite-stardust-oldest-ever-examined-lab">formed from the ashes of dying stars</a>, she says (<em>SN: 1/13/20</em>). “I was on the hunt for them.” These delicate grains contain different isotopes — atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons — than those formed by the sun, giving away their alien origins.</p>



<p>Nguyen and her colleagues examined two samples of Ryugu, each less than a millimeter in size. They then picked out tiny slivers of rock, 50 to 200 micrometers wide, called clasts, that stood out from the rest of the Ryugu sample.</p>



<p>Using scanning electron microscopes and other imaging techniques, Nguyen and colleagues found that two of the clasts are chemically different from the rest of Ryugu, with lower oxygen, magnesium and silicon contents, and greater amounts of iron and sulfur.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="766" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile.jpg" alt="Electron microscope images of a sliver of solar system material (outlined in white) in a sample of the asteroid Ryugu show that the material is different from the rest of the asteroid.

The slivers also contain grains of silicates (white arrows) that come from outside the solar system." class="wp-image-3129690" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile-340x383.jpg 340w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile-399x450.jpg 399w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile-165x186.jpg 165w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile-515x580.jpg 515w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129690">Electron microscope images of a sliver of solar system material (outlined in white) in a sample of the asteroid Ryugu show that the material is different from the rest of the asteroid.

Nguyen <em>et al</em>/<em>Science Advances</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The clasts also have much higher concentrations of presolar grains than the rest of the Ryugu material. The grains contain silicon carbide, which is easily destroyed by water, plus an extra abundance of organic matter.</p>



<p>That means the grains could not have been part of Ryugu’s parent body, which was extensively altered by water. The researchers think the grains were bits of a comet that formed in the outer solar system’s Kuiper belt, where the conditions were cool and dry. Then the grains sprinkled onto the rubble that formed Ryugu sometime between the original asteroid’s destruction and the rubble pile’s formation.</p>



<p>“Between these events, it kind of collected some other friends that came from other bodies, from different parts of the solar system,” Nguyen says. It’s not yet clear how material from the outer solar system found its way to Ryugu. Perhaps the asteroid formed farther from the sun — and hence, closer to the Kuiper belt — than it is today. “It’s interesting to visualize how this asteroid came about and what it gathered along the way.”</p>



<p>The discovery is “very exciting,” says cosmochemist Philipp Heck of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who was not involved in the new work. “These clasts that got incorporated into Ryugu after it formed, they’re really valuable. I think they’re even more valuable than the Ryugu sample itself.”</p>





<p>The clasts can reveal what the unaltered ingredients that formed the solar system were made of. Think of the disk that formed the planets as bread dough, Heck says. Once the dough is well-mixed, it’s hard to tell what went into it. Clasts like the ones in the Ryugu sample are like bits of unmixed flour that survived intact in the final loaf, he says — not delicious, but very informative.</p>



<p>“If we want to understand the ingredients from which the solar system formed, the original ingredients, we need to find these very rare, unaltered clasts,” Heck says. “This is one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-missing-chunk-neuroplasticity">Elyse G.’s brain is fabulous. It’s also missing a big chunk</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE</strong>: Most of the Interesting Brains Project participants featured in this story are using shortened forms of their names and/or pseudonyms to protect their privacy.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>You’d never guess that Elyse G. has a black hole in her brain.</p>



<p>Meet her on the street, and it’d be impossible to tell she’s lacking a chunk of neural tissue about the size of a small fist.</p>



<p>Looking at her brain scans is a different story. It’s as if someone has knocked over a bottle of ink. The darkness pools inside her skull near her left ear, a puddle of fuliginous black. Inside the splotch, there’s no white matter or gray matter, no blood vessels or tissue at all.</p>



<p>Elyse says you don’t have to be a neurosurgeon to spot what’s different about her brain: “There’s a big honking piece missing!”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="438" height="636" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_REV-2.gif" alt="A gif showing the MRI scan of Elyse G. and the large chunk of her brain missing on the left hand side." class="wp-image-3129547" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129547">In this view of Elyse G.’s brain, scientists stacked MRI slices that go from the bottom of the brain to the top. On the left side, the missing temporal lobe shows up as a large black hole that appears and then disappears as the scans move up through the brain.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129547">COURTESY OF THE FEDORENKO LAB</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scientists can’t say exactly how it happened. It’s possible that sometime long ago, perhaps due to a stroke before or shortly after birth, a portion of Elyse’s brain died and then ultimately disappeared, leaving behind only liquid — brain tissue swapped for a fluid-filled void. Her sister has one too.</p>



<p>Elyse and her sister, Martha M., who are not using their full names to maintain their anonymity, look and act perfectly ordinary. But each lacks most of a temporal lobe, and each in a different hemisphere. Elyse is also missing part of her brain stem. The women are two of who knows how many people living their lives without brain structures generally thought to be crucial.</p>





<p>Martha, now age 59, didn’t know her brain was different until she was a teenager. Elyse, who will turn 61 this year, found out in graduate school. Two sisters. Two brains. Two black holes. When MIT cognitive neuroscientist Evelina Fedorenko’s team first learned about the duo, “we were all kind of blown away,” she says.</p>



<p>Elyse emailed Fedorenko her brain images in 2016, decades after the void was discovered. She had read an article about neuroscience research at MIT and was curious if scientists would be interested. “She said, ‘I’m missing my left temporal lobe. Do you want to study me?’ ” Fedorenko remembers.</p>



<p>The left temporal lobe is generally thought to be essential for speech and language, and Fedorenko, who trained as a language researcher, was intrigued. Her lab hadn’t studied people like Elyse before, but “I’m a very adventurous scientist,” she says. So her team brought Elyse to the lab for tests.</p>



<p>Fedorenko didn’t know it at the time, but those first studies would set in motion a whirlwind that would alter the course of her research. Her team’s findings would ignite media attention, prompting even more people to send along their brain scans. What started as a single case study has now snowballed into <a href="https://web.mit.edu/~interestingbrains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Interesting Brains Project</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of this fall, the project will likely have scanned more than 40 people with atypical brains. In many cases, participants are missing entire brain regions, and like Elyse, they didn’t find out until they were adults.</p>



<p>That may be a tribute to the brain’s flexibility — its ability to change and adapt — including its redundancies, Fedorenko says. Like backup generators, some brain areas can kick into gear if others get injured. A close look at cases like Elyse’s could help scientists better understand how our brains cope with damage and why some kinds are worse than others.</p>



<p>For now, Fedorenko’s team is focusing on language and aspects of high-level cognition, such as a person’s capacity for general reasoning. But the effort could also offer insights into the workings of the brain more broadly and might one day give doctors a better sense of what outcomes a person with a brain injury might expect.</p>



<p>That’s what Elyse and Fedorenko hope, anyway. Before she started working with the MIT team, Elyse says, “I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.” Not anymore. These days, there’s a different word that comes to Elyse’s mind when she thinks about her brain. “It’s fabulous,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MRI turns up atypical brains</h4>



<p>Elyse first learned about her atypical brain after an MRI scan in the fall of 1987. She was 25 years old and in her first year of grad school in Washington, D.C., an avid reader and a whiz with a needle and thread.</p>





<p>At an appointment with a neurologist at the George Washington University Hospital, Elyse — who had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy despite never having a seizure — sensed mostly boredom from the doctor and an accompanying resident. They didn’t pay her much notice, she says.</p>



<p>That feeling evaporated when Elyse came back for her results. Now she had the doctors’ full attention. They leaned forward in their chairs, elbows on knees, chins in hands, eyes laser-focused on Elyse. “How do you feel?” she remembers them asking. She felt like a lab specimen — like a frog they were zapping with electrodes, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What the doctors had seen in her brain scan, of course, was that blatant black hole. When detected in babies, it’s the kind of lesion that makes parents fear the worst. In adults, strokes in the left hemisphere can steal people’s ability to read and write and jumble their speech. The meaning of words can slip suddenly from the mind, as if an eraser has scrubbed away a person’s mental dictionary. Elyse’s doctors, she remembers, were surprised she had more than a fifth-grade vocabulary.</p>



<p>At the time, Elyse felt sickened and scared. She didn’t know if the lesion was growing, if it foreshadowed early Alzheimer’s disease or if it was going to “explode in my head,” she says. A follow-up scan six months later eased her fears. The scan looked the same as the first. Her brain’s black hole wasn’t expanding.</p>



<p>Elyse never returned to those doctors, but she did get a second opinion that summer from her sister’s neurosurgeon. He had operated on Martha when she was 17, after she had noticed vision problems. The bulk of her right temporal lobe was gone, possibly due to a stroke in the womb. Fluid buildup in the brain was pressing against the nerves of her eyes, hindering her sight. “They drained it, and I went on my merry way,” Martha says. She hasn’t had the area drained since.</p>



<p>Martha’s doctor looked at Elyse’s scan and told her that as MRIs were becoming more common, doctors were finding other people with brains that diverged from the norm. “He said, ‘We’re seeing more and more deviations, and you’ve got one,’ ” she remembers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM.jpg" alt="An MRI scan of Martha M.'s brain with a large dark section on the right side." class="wp-image-3129526" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129526">Martha M., Elyse G.’s younger sister, is also missing most of a temporal lobe, but on the right side of the brain — a near–mirror image of Elyse’s lesion.

Like all of the Interesting Brains Project participants tested so far, Martha scores at or above average on language and cognitive tasks.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129526">COURTESY OF THE FEDORENKO LAB</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Interesting Brains Project is born</h4>



<p>When Elyse and Fedorenko first met, Fedorenko was interested in how language areas wire up when a chunk of crucial tissue is missing. Her plan was to peek inside Elyse’s head using functional MRI, a technique that tracks blood flow in the brain. Functional MRI lets scientists see which parts of the brain are active while a person performs a specific task.</p>



<p>For Elyse, that means lying statue-still inside the giant tube of an MRI machine while equipment whirs around her. Depending on the task, Elyse may look at or listen to words, sentences and stories or see math problems or spatial puzzles. Occasionally, she’ll press a button so the team knows she’s staying alert.</p>



<p>Outside the tube, the researchers have also tested Elyse’s vocabulary, reading and writing skills, and intelligence. She scored near the top of every language test she took. “I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain,” Elyse jokes.</p>



<p>Elyse’s first scan with Fedorenko’s team revealed language activity in the right side of the brain, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported in 2022 in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>. Shifting functions to the right is one trick our brains use to deal with damage on the left, something other scientists have reported previously, Fedorenko says.</p>



<p>The team wondered if Elyse’s left frontal lobe might chip in too. Yes, Elyse lacks her left temporal lobe, Fedorenko says, but her left frontal lobe — where language also typically resides — is perfectly intact. “Is there any language going on there?” Fedorenko asked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>But that lobe showed no language-responsive areas at all. The findings hint at a neural order of operations for language development: Without Elyse’s left temporal lobe, language areas in her left frontal lobe couldn’t wire up.</p>



<p>Fedorenko’s team also revealed that Elyse completely lacks a typical region for reading words. The team thought such a region might show up in Elyse’s right temporal lobe. Instead, she appears to tap into a network of neurons across the visual cortex, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643294.2023.2164923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported this year in <em>Cognitive Neuropsychology</em></a>.</p>



<p>“It turns out you can have perfectly functional reading visual machinery in your brain that’s implemented in a different way,” Fedorenko says. Elyse may be the first reported example of this.</p>



<p>The findings from Elyse’s brain caught the attention of a reporter at <em>Wired</em> who wrote an article last year with an eyeball-grabbing headline: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/she-was-missing-a-chunk-of-her-brain-it-didnt-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She Was Missing a Chunk of Her Brain. It Didn’t Matter</a>.” Then the emails started pouring in.</p>



<p>The morning after the <em>Wired</em> story published, Fedorenko’s inbox was “filled with cool brain pictures — brains missing all sorts of big parts,” she says. In many cases, people found out about their atypical brains accidentally. Fedorenko heard stories about people with neck tension going in for an MRI and finding out they’re missing most of their right frontal lobe. Others, like Helen Santoro, have known about their brain lesions since they were little.</p>



<p>Santoro, a science journalist who reached out to Fedorenko after reading the <em>Wired</em> story, had a stroke before birth and was missing her left temporal lobe, like Elyse. Doctors said Santoro would never speak and would need to be institutionalized. “But month after month, I surprised the experts, meeting all of the typical milestones of children my age,” she wrote last September <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/science/brain-language-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an article about her experience</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear why some brain injuries slide by unnoticed while others demand attention, says neuroimaging scientist Helen Carlson. Her team at the University of Calgary in Canada has worked with kids who’ve had early strokes in the motor cortex, the brain region responsible for movement.</p>



<p>Some kids with large brain injuries have only minor weakness on one side of their body. Others with just “a little whisper of a smudge on their MRI … have quite profound disabilities for their entire life,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>That mismatch can be true of other difficulties too, including problems with language and general reasoning — and it’s one of several mysteries the Interesting Brains Project is pursuing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the brain adapts</h4>



<p>As of May 30, the Interesting Brains Project had scanned the brains of 30 people. Some have holes in their frontal or temporal lobes; others are missing parts of their cerebellum, a brain structure involved in balance and movement. Still other participants have brain matter that’s squished up against the sides of their skull; scans show voids that appear to have ballooned from the brain’s center.</p>



<p>These atypical arrangements can stem from cysts, surgery, strokes or excess fluid buildup in the brain. Some can result in a brain with much less neural tissue than usual — and sometimes the change can be abrupt. What happens when the brain needs to perform its same jobs but in a much smaller space, Fedorenko asks. “What are the solutions that our brains come up with when suddenly there’s a lot less turf to work with?”</p>



<p>A community of scientists has already dug up some answers by studying kids who have had perinatal strokes. In some of these cases, during a baby’s birth, or the weeks before and after, blood flow in the brain can cut off altogether, starving tissues of oxygen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“My brain is special, unique and interesting.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The brain can adapt to this injury, but it’s not a lump of clay with infinite potential. “Everybody thinks, ‘Oh, the brain is endlessly plastic,’ ” says Elissa Newport, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. But it tends to deal with damage in set ways.</p>



<p>Newport worked recently with a group of 15 kids and young adults who all had perinatal strokes that resulted in left hemisphere damage in an area that processes words and sentences. In nearly every case, the participants’ brains shifted language over to the same spots in the right hemisphere, Newport and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207293119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2022 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>



<p>It’s as if the language region has flip-flopped from left to right, “exactly the mirror image of what ordinary, typical brains look like,” she says. This pattern suggests that certain brain areas can serve as pinch hitters for language function.</p>

<p>But there’s still a universe of more questions, Fedorenko says. She’s curious if brain functions can overlap, sharing the same cortical machinery in an atypical brain when they might otherwise have set up shop in different locations. And a damaged left hemisphere doesn’t always mean language moves to the right. Sometimes language function stays behind, surviving on the fringes of the damaged region, Fedorenko says. “Nobody knows why that happens.”</p>



<p>Carlson and colleagues reported this kind of adaptation in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887899420302770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 in <em>Pediatric Neurology</em></a>. The team was studying young stroke patients who had perinatal strokes that hit the motor cortex. Carlson says the Interesting Brains Project is valuable because it could tell scientists more about plasticity in the brain at the individual level — how a specific person’s brain has adapted to injury.</p>



<p>Not every person’s brain is able to bounce back. What scientists learn from the project, along with individualized neuroimaging, could help with prognosis, and potentially rehabilitation. “Perhaps if we can tailor intervention options to an individual brain, they might be more effective,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>Getting results will take time. Fedorenko’s team is currently juggling experimental logistics, including scanning a new participant every one to two weeks, performing behavioral tests and analyzing data. Still, they’re seeing some interesting results, Fedorenko says, and hope to submit a paper this summer.</p>



<p>She hopes the project can showcase the range of solutions our brains can, in some cases, employ to deal with a slow or sudden loss of neural real estate. Maybe, she says, the project’s findings will help more people understand “how different you can be and still grow up and do amazing things.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a normal brain anyway?</h4>



<p>In an opening note in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedorenko’s 2022 paper in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>, Elyse wrote about how her brain’s structure doesn’t define her. “Please do not call my brain abnormal, that creeps me out,” she wrote. “My brain is atypical. If not for accidently finding these differences, no one would pick me out of a crowd as likely to have these, or any other differences that make me unique.”</p>



<p>Elyse hopes the message comes through for doctors and research scientists. “I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar,” she says.</p>



<p>One thing Elyse likes about working with Fedorenko’s team is that the research feels collaborative. Scientists rely on close partnerships like this to understand how the brain works under typical situations and how it may recover from injury, says Lesley Fellows, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies how brain damage affects decision making. People with atypical brains “can give us all kinds of great ideas we might not have thought about,” she says. “They have a unique vantage point.”</p>



<p>Elyse, for example, experiences smell hallucinations. She picks up whiffs of electrical fires whenever she’s under a lot of stress. “When I was in grad school, I would smell electrical fires three times a week,” she says. Elyse hasn’t yet explored this brain quirk with Fedorenko and her colleagues, but she’s open to their ideas for future investigations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For the team’s most recent study, reported in a preprint this year, Elyse, Martha and another sister (one with an “ordinary” brain) participated in hearing tasks inside the MRI tube. Fedorenko’s team wanted to find out <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.18.523979v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the left or right auditory cortex works when the other side is missing</a>.</p>



<p>You might think that the remaining auditory cortex would have to be enhanced somehow to pull double duty, perhaps taking up extra space, says Tamar Regev, a cognitive neuroscientist in Fedorenko’s lab. But that’s not what the team found.</p>



<p>In both Elyse’s and Martha’s brains, “activity looks completely neurotypical,” Regev says. That suggests there’s some redundancy to the brain’s auditory system, and that the development of one auditory cortex does not depend on the existence of the other.</p>



<p>Elyse is curious what other insights Fedorenko’s team will glean from her brain, and the brains of fellow Interesting Brains Project participants. “My brain is special, unique and interesting,” she wrote in the 2022 paper, “and I am excited that it can help neuroscientists understand the plasticity of the human brain.”</p>

<p>A former lecturer in the modern languages department of the University of St Andrews in Scotland committed plagiarism in seven papers published between 2014 and 2022, according to the results of an institutional investigation. </p>



<p>The university <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/research/documents/integrity-and-ethics/research-integrity-investigation-outcome-july-2023.pdf">posted a statement</a> on its website about the outcome of the investigation that did not name the researcher, who Retraction Watch has learned is Ros Holmes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holmes has two retractions in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHolmes%252c%2bRos">database</a>, both for plagiarism. </p>



<span id="more-127518"></span>



<p>The first retraction, from May of last year, was for “Bad Citizens and Symbolic Subjects: Wang Jin, Zhou Tiehai, and the Art of (In)civility,” originally <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/issue/view/13">published in 2019</a> in the <em>British Journal of Chinese Studies</em>. The journal removed the article from its website, but updated the <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/article/view/32">introduction</a> to the issue with a retraction notice that stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been alerted to the fact that this article uses phrases and ideas taken verbatim from a number of other scholars’ works without being properly cited. In many cases, the scholarship was also not included in the bibliography.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice also included nine references as the “most significant” sources Holmes had plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holmes’ other retraction to date came last October. “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/7/1/31/18049/RETRACTED-Meanwhile-in-China-Miao-Ying-and-the">Meanwhile in China … Miao Ying and the Rise of Chinternet Ugly,</a>” was published in 2018 in the journal <em>ARTMargins</em>. The <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/11/3/144/112388/Retraction-of-Holmes-Ros-2018-Meanwhile-in-China">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A reader conveyed concerns regarding the originality of parts of the author&#8217;s article in May 2022. The journal independently investigated the charges and verified them. Following Dr. Holmes&#8217;s admission of plagiarism in all the instances identified by the ARTMargins investigation, the journal informed the journals and authors whose work was left un-cited, as well as the Ethics Committee at the author&#8217;s university.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice said Holmes agreed to the retraction, and listed 24 sources she “failed to cite,” including Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of St Andrews’ online statement said it had begun the investigation after academic publishers “and other parties” raised concerns about the lecturer’s work in May and June of last year. The university said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation found incontrovertible evidence that the individual had used the texts and conclusions of other scholars and journalists in their published works without appropriate attribution, and that this amounted to plagiarism and research misconduct.</p>



<p>Over 70 instances of plagiarism, from a wide range of sources, were established across seven pieces of work published between 2014 and 2022.</p>



<p>The individual is no longer employed by the University of St Andrews.</p>



<p>The University is informing all relevant publishers and previous employers of the findings of the research integrity investigation and is grateful for the cooperation and support on which it has been able to rely throughout the investigatory process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/University-of-St-Andrews-Staff-Plagiarism-Investigation-Outcome.pdf">forwarded an email</a> from a university official that named Holmes as the lecturer referred to in the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KnwXZYPjq7UJ:https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/schoolpeoplepublic/html/build/4208b996-d70a-4ef6-9ef7-4ba3e2a957f1/rmh21/&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">cached version</a> of Holmes’ profile page&nbsp; at St Andrews indicates she joined the university in 2020 and was a lecturer in Chinese studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email to Holmes’ school email address was not returned as undeliverable, but we have not yet received a reply.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mass-moon-orbit-gravity-space">Mass has different definitions. The moon’s orbit confirms two are equivalent</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mass is mass is mass.</p>



<p>Physicists have three different definitions of mass, all thought to be equivalent. Measurements of the distance between Earth and the moon confirm that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.021401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of those masses are one and the same</a> to higher precision than ever before, physicists report July 13 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That result confirms one of the most basic foundations of physics: Newton’s third law of motion.</p>



<p>Inertial mass determines how easily an object accelerates in response to a force. Then there’s active gravitational mass, which determines the strength of an object’s gravitational field. Rounding out the trio is passive gravitational mass, which dictates the force on an object in a given gravitational field.</p>





<p>“It is a big question in physics why these masses are all the same,” says theoretical physicist Claus Lämmerzahl of the University of Bremen in Germany. So scientists want to be sure they aren’t slightly different.</p>



<p>Previously, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">MICROSCOPE experiment</a> confirmed the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational mass in tests aboard a satellite (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists compared active and passive gravitational masses for two elements found in different parts of the moon: iron in the core and aluminum in the crust.</p>



<p>Newton’s third law, often stated as “for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction,” suggests the iron’s gravitational pull on the aluminum should be the same as the aluminum’s pull on the iron.</p>



<p>If the active and passive masses were different, that would violate the rule and the uneven tug-of-war would alter the moon’s orbit. Based upon decades of laser measurements of the moon’s distance from Earth and its location in its orbit, the ratio of active and passive gravitational masses for the two materials were the same to about four trillionths of a percent, Lämmerzahl&nbsp; and colleagues report.</p>



<p>Finding a difference would also clash with Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. So the moon serves up a win not only for Newton, but for Einstein, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">Last week was the hottest ever recorded — here’s why we keep smashing records</a></h4>

              
                <p>Global temperatures are shattering records as El Niño and climate change compound.</p>



<p>On July 3, the planet sweltered as the average global temperature reached 17.01° Celsius (62.62° Fahrenheit), the highest ever recorded, according to data from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction. That surpassed the previous record of 16.92° C (62.46° F) from August 2016.</p>



<p>By the end of the week, that new record was tied or broken three more times, peaking on July 6 at 17.23° C (63.01° F). And Earth just experienced its hottest June ever recorded.</p>





<p>This time of year is usually when the average global temperature peaks. But the extraordinary nature of this year’s June and July probably stems from what’s going on in the big blue. Oceans around the world have grown alarmingly warm, thanks in no small part to human-caused climate change, researchers say. And El Niño, the recurring climate pattern known to temporarily heat the planet, has finally returned.</p>



<p>“We’ve really never had this set of circumstances before,” says atmospheric scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. “We’re entering uncharted territory.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hot oceans are a problem</h4>



<p>Much of the extreme heat we’re seeing goes back to the state of our oceans, says climate scientist Thomas Di Liberto of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, D.C. “The global ocean has just been so, so warm.”</p>



<p>Our planet&#8217;s seas have been warming for decades. The most recent decade has been the sea surface&#8217;s hottest since at least the 1800s. In April, the average surface temperature of the world’s oceans reached 21.1° C, the highest ever recorded. </p>



<p>It’s been particularly warm in the North Atlantic, where records are being broken by large margins. In April, sea surface temperatures there surpassed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">4 degrees C above what’s normal</a> for that time of year (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>). And in the Gulf of Mexico, the average surface temperature is more than 30° C, as of July 12, the highest recorded for this time of year since satellites began monitoring there in 1981. Both are examples of marine heat waves, persistent periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures.</p>



<p>Such heat waves currently plague about 40 percent of the world’s oceans. NOAA forecasts suggest that by September, <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marine heat waves could prevail across half the global ocean</a>, Di Liberto says.&nbsp; These extreme events have become about 50 percent more common over the last decade. Much of that warming has to do with climate change, he says. “We’ve juiced the system.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Marine heat waves June 13–July 12, 2023</h4>



<p>About 40 percent of the world’s oceans are currently afflicted by marine heat waves — persistent periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Their distribution can be seen on this map, which shows average sea surface temperature anomalies throughout the oceans from June 13 to July 12, 2023. More intense temperature anomalies are darker shades of red. </p>

<p>Hotter seas are a huge problem, says atmospheric scientist Marybeth Arcodia of Colorado State University in Fort Collins.</p>



<p>“The ocean is currently taking [in] about 93 percent of the heat associated with global warming,” Arcodia says. As the oceans warm, they become less capable of absorbing heat from the atmosphere, so that’s where it remains, raising the global temperature.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">El Niño has arrived</h4>



<p>Operating on top of this background of ocean warming is a natural climate cycle called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The phenomenon entails yearslong fluctuations in sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. These water temperature changes are controlled by equatorial air currents known as the trade winds.</p>



<p>During neutral ENSO conditions, the trade winds blow westward against the surface of the Pacific Ocean, pushing warm water toward Indonesia and triggering the upwelling of cold water from the ocean’s depths along the South American coast. When the trade winds blow especially strong, more warm water is pushed east. This part of the cycle is called La Niña. In March, the Earth exited three years of La Niña conditions, a relatively long-lived phase.</p>



<p>Then in June, La Niña’s counterpart, El Niño, got underway. Many scientists think that El Niño can be triggered by westerly wind bursts — anomalous winds that sometimes appear in the western Pacific, says physical oceanographer Regina Rodrigues of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. These bursts blow opposite to the trade winds and weaken them, she says, setting the stage for El Niño.</p>



<p>Unbidden by the westbound winds, warm water in the western Pacific sloshes back toward the Americas. Ocean upwelling along the tropical South American coast is stifled, and much of the tropical Pacific — which at the equator wraps halfway around the planet — becomes swaddled in a warm duvet of water, which can be hundreds of meters deep. That balmy layer exudes heat into the atmosphere, where much of it is trapped by the greenhouse gases that humans have emitted, raising the global temperature.</p>



<p>El Niño is typically associated with warmer global temperatures, while La Niña is often correlated with cooler temperatures, Arcodia says. “2016 is currently the hottest year on record,” she says. “That lines up with the strongest El Niño event on record.”</p>



<p>But El Niño and La Niña don’t always have predictable outcomes. For instance, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2020-was-earth-s-2nd-hottest-year-just-behind-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 was the second hottest year</a> on record, and it was during La Niña conditions, Arcodia says. That underscores the influence of climate warming on these record-breaking temperatures, she says.</p>



<p>While it’s probably safe to say that El Niño is exacerbating climate warming, it’s hard to say exactly how much the phenomenon’s return contributed to the recent unprecedented heat, Di Liberto, Rodrigues and Arcodia agree.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We’re just getting started</h4>



<p>This El Niño is still in its infancy. The climate pattern typically peaks during the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, so Earth has probably not yet felt the full brunt of the impact. That means the planet may be in store for even higher global temperatures later in July, Di Liberto says. Even later in the year, Earth will probably see more anomalously warm months as El Niño continues to strengthen.</p>



<p>Since the climate pattern hasn’t reached full force, it’s hard to draw comparisons with its past manifestations. But forecast models do suggest that there is a <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better than 50 percent chance</a> of this El Niño developing into a relatively strong one, Arcodia says. In such a scenario, the average temperature of the east-central tropical Pacific would temporarily reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C above normal. In early June, temperatures in that part of the Pacific were already 0.7 degrees C above normal.</p>



<p>It’s possible that the relatively long La Niña period we just exited might have set the stage for a strong El Niño, Rodrigues speculates. That La Niña spent three years packing the western Pacific with warm water, loading it like a spring, she says. Now, that spring has been released.</p>

<p>With El Niño exacerbating things, this year could become the hottest year on record. There’s about <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202305/supplemental/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 13 percent chance</a> that 2023 takes the title, and a nearly 90 percent chance that it’s among the top five on record, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information.</p>



<p>What’s more, some scientists are concerned that the El Niño could temporarily push global warming more than 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels for the first time, Rodrigues says.</p>



<p>Many experts have warned that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-limit-degrees-ipcc-climate-change">crossing that benchmark</a> could trigger irreversible changes in some parts of the planet (<em>SN: 10/7/18</em>). That could include the transformation of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">Amazon rainforest</a> and more widespread melting of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">Greenland</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">Antarctic ice sheets</a> (<em>SN: 6/16/23</em>;<em> SN: 11/9/22</em>; <em>SN: 2/15/23</em>). But because El Niño is a temporary phenomenon, it’s hard to say if, or how, the climate pattern might impact these elements, Rodrigues says.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a momentous experiment, she says. One with us, and the rest of life on Earth, stuck in the middle.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324005087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eight Bears</a><br><em>Gloria Dickie<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Bears have long been considered family. “Stories of a familial bear exist in almost every human culture that shares territory with the animal,” writes journalist Gloria Dickie in her new book, <em>Eight Bears</em>. </p>



<p>The Yakut people of eastern Siberia call brown bears “grandfather” and “uncle.” Shepherds in the French Pyrenees call the brown bear <em>la va-nu-pieds</em>, the “barefooted one,” a reference to its humanlike footprints. In Peru, the Ukuku is an Andes-traipsing man-bear hybrid in Quechua lore that steals away young women.</p>





<p>The ancient and recurrent history of humans recognizing bears as either spiritual or biological brethren sets the tone for the book, which provides rich lessons for understanding our ursine neighbors and how their lives have intertwined with our own.</p>



<p>That bears have had such a cultural grip on our species is impressive given their dearth of global diversity. As you might have guessed, there are only eight bear species: brown, black, sun, moon, polar, spectacled, sloth and giant panda. Dickie explores each in vivid detail, traveling across three continents to some of the places where they amble.</p>



<p>The settings Dickie presents — some remote, some urban — are marvelously rendered. She transports readers to the perilously steep ridgelines of the Andes, perpetually misty and buzzing with hummingbirds, and to Churchill, Canada, a subarctic town on an icy seashore sitting square in the path of migrating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-paws-traction-snow-microstructures-friction">polar bears</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/22</em>). Through these travels, Dickie weaves in each species’s unique stories — of decline, recovery and an uncertain future — and how humans have roped their own desires and ambitions to the bears, for better or worse.</p>



<p>Dickie expertly peppers her “ursine odyssey” with dry humor, augmenting the experience of encountering the bears, which oscillates from dopey to truly dangerous. One moment that stands out is when Dickie is preparing to visit the forest homes of Indian sloth bears and describes digesting jarringly matter-of-fact stories and photos of the aftereffects of maulings. But not to worry, a local biologist assures her “in a way that was meant to be comforting,” she will see more injuries like this where she is set to travel.</p>



<p>Such engaging insights into Dickie’s experiences elevate <em>Eight Bears</em> well above a patchwork of bear facts.</p>



<p>Though, there are facts aplenty. Dickie provides ample context on each species’s biology, ecology and historical (and sometimes prehistorical) relationship with humans. The robust accounting of so much about these animals is fascinating, though some forays into the evolutionary history of each branch of the bear family tree and the taxonomic identity of Paddington Bear and Baloo from <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disneys-jungle-book-resurrects-giant-extinct-ape">The Jungle Book</a> </em>can feel meandering (<em>SN: 4/3/16</em>). Still, Dickie excels in crafting a captivating and carefully considered mosaic of stories that will engross any reader interested in wildlife and wilderness.</p>



<p>One primary theme in <em>Eight Bears </em>is that many species inhabit woefully shrinking natural spaces. In the Andes, spectacled bears’ cloud forests risk ascending upslope into oblivion due to a warming climate. Polar bears are caught between <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-bering-sea-ice-winter-melt-lowest-level">rapidly dwindling sea ice</a> and a genetic tidal wave from hybridizing with brown bears that have started wandering poleward (<em>SN: 9/3/20</em>). Sloth bears are squeezed into smaller and smaller pockets of forest as human populations expand, leading to violent, tragic conflicts with people.</p>



<p>These eight bear species, Dickie shows, manage to capture the full range of people’s attitudes toward wilderness, from awe to exploitation, neglect to reverence. She illuminates radically varied consequences of humans placing political, social or economic value on bears. For instance, circumstances aligned for giant pandas to be useful in “panda diplomacy” as a political bargaining chip for China, thus feeding a cultural status and conservation investment the seven other bear species lack. Dickie’s honest and bleak accounts of moon and sun bears languishing on farms in Vietnam that collect bear bile to treat inflammation and high cholesterol present a far darker reality for some species.</p>



<p>There are relative success stories in which bears have bounced back into abundance, but that can present ongoing tension. In the United States, humans and black bears navigate coexistence at the wildland-urban interface (and national park trash cans). On the eastern flanks of the Rockies, brown bears lollop into territories gone bearless for decades due to intentional extermination, now saturated with farms and people.</p>



<p>In the end, Dickie warns that only three species — black, brown and panda bears — seem well-positioned to persist in the wild in the future. Losing animals whose lives have so closely paralleled our own would be like losing family, she writes. “And in some ways, we would lose a part of our own wildness. Without bears, the woods, and our stories, would be empty.”</p>

<p>An anesthesiologist who had his funding revoked for fabricating data has earned a fourth retraction for publishing the same data in two Springer Nature journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wen-fei Tan, an anesthesiologist at The First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, is the first author of the recently retracted paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-016-9974-x">Changes in the first postoperative night bispectral index of patients after thyroidectomy with different types of primary anesthetic management: a randomized controlled trial</a>,” published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC),</em> a Springer Nature journal, in 2017. It has been cited four times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-023-01045-x">retraction notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>

It shares four authors with the newly retracted article – Tan, Ma, Jin, and Lu – and was pulled for similar reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-021-01437-z">2021 retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reached out to Tan and Ma for more information, but have not heard back. We also contacted the editor of <em>JCMC</em> who has not responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A PubPeer commenter, scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/10/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-led-to-the-identification-of-hundreds-of-fraudulent-papers/">John Loadsman</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A40E4706E084DA22977D0D8AEDD939">flagged the data duplication</a> in the most recently retracted paper in June 2020. Tan <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A40E4706E084DA22977D0D8AEDD939#2">responded</a> to the comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I received the letter from editor several days ago. We checked the original data of this paper and found that there was no problem with this paper. We have sent the original data to the editor. Thanks again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Loadsman <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/75E2D10B90BB43E5F9CB2871C807F3#1">had also posted</a> about the retracted <em>BMC Anesthesiology</em> paper that has the identical graph. Tan <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/75E2D10B90BB43E5F9CB2871C807F3#2">responded</a> there, too:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I received the letter from editor several days ago. We checked the original data of this paper and found that we did use wrong data to make the figure. We connected with the editor and waiting for decision of next step.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Loadsman first started looking into the group of authors after receiving a submission from Wen-Fei Tan for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/AIC"><em>Anaesthesia and Intensive Care</em></a>, where Loadsman is editor-in-chief. Loadsman spotted extensive alterations in the clinical trial registration and anomalies in the raw data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr Tan&#8217;s efforts to refute my concerns were perplexing and unhelpful,” Loadsman wrote in an email. He decided to reject the paper, and shortly afterwards discovered it had already been rejected by another journal because of the data irregularities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2019, Tan submitted another problematic paper to <a href="https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652044"><em>Anaesthesia</em></a>. The editors’ review of the article described it as “scientifically nonsense”, calling out significant changes in data registered on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03570645?tab=history&amp;a=1#StudyPageTop">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. Tan confirmed the data were fabricated, according to the journal’s editor-in-chief, Andrew Klein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Klein contacted The First Hospital of China Medical University about his concerns with the paper, the reply from the institution came from Hong Ma, the chair of the anesthesiology department, and an author on the retracted papers mentioned previously, who wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have known all things from Dr. Tan and it is a very serious scandal of our department. We decided to treat this as follow:</p>



<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fired the statistics staff, and she is shamed of all thing and fall in deep depression.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stop the research of Dr. Tan group and withdraw the funding.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will not publish this paper in any magazine.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let all department and institute to know all this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this June, those same four authors of the two retracted papers, along with several other anesthesiologists from The First Hospital of China Medical University, earned another retraction for the paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-017-0074-3">Effects of ultrasound-guided stellate-ganglion block on sleep and regional cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery: a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial</a>,” published in 2017 in the<em> Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10877-023-01040-2">retraction notice</a> cited overlap between panels of data as the reason for the retraction. It stated the authors provided some raw data on request, but “these did not appear to be sufficient to explain the apparent concerns.”</p>



<p>Tan and Ma are authors on yet <a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-021-00669-6">another retracted paper</a> in <em>BMC Neuroscience </em>that was pulled for duplicated data.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geothermal-energy-africa-kenya-renewable-electricity">How Kenya is helping its neighbors develop geothermal energy</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The dusty town of Naivasha sits within the Great Rift Valley, where the African continent is being divided into two. About 90 kilometers northwest of Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi, Naivasha welcomes gaggles of tourists each year trekking to Hell’s Gate National Park. The forces that are splitting apart the African tectonic plate have sculpted the area’s steep cliffs, plummeting valleys and undulating hills — a rugged landscape that inspired the backdrop of Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>



<p>Those forces have also made Naivasha the frontier of Kenya’s geothermal power industry.</p>





<p>The country’s first geothermal well was drilled there in the 1950s. By 1981, Kenya had its first geothermal power plant, harnessing a renewable resource that taps into heat generated deep within the Earth. Today, Naivasha’s Olkaria geothermal power project plus a small facility at another site are capable of generating 963 megawatts of electricity when running at full power.</p>



<p>At the end of last year, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal energy countries in the world. Geothermal accounts for 47 percent of the country’s total energy production — a percentage that’s growing. The only other geothermal energy producer in Africa, Ethiopia, started production in 1998 and has an installed capacity of just 7.5 megawatts.</p>



<p>But regional interest is growing, especially as Africa works toward universal energy access by 2030, in accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Roughly 43 percent of the continent’s population, equaling about 600&nbsp;million people, lacks access to electricity. A 2021 analysis by the Dalberg consulting firm in partnership with the U.N. showed that there’s enough renewable energy potential to power Africa’s energy needs well into the future, though the up-front costs would be higher than if fossil fuels were used to meet those energy demands.</p>



<p>If African countries pursue renewable energy to meet their electricity goals, the up-front cost would be $1.5 trillion, about 50 percent more than the $1 trillion that fossils fuels would require, says James Mwangi, formerly of Dalberg and founder of the group Climate Action Platform for Africa. But thanks to lower operating and maintenance costs, renewables eventually pay off. In one scenario in the Dalberg analysis, a renewable-heavy future would take 13 years or so to break even with one where fossil fuels are still heavily used.</p>



<p>With the renewables route, Mwangi says, “Africa could reach universal energy access much faster and ultimately have the lowest energy costs in the world.” The localized nature of renewable sources, compared with often-imported fossil fuels, could also enhance energy security and independence.</p>



<p>In East Africa, geothermal energy is an attractive option. It’s abundant thanks to the East African Rift System, which brings heat toward the surface. Like other renewable energies such as wind and solar, geothermal doesn’t emit carbon dioxide. And it comes with extra benefits. “Geothermal power is reliable,” says Anna Mwangi, senior geophysicist at the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen, the government entity that operates Olkaria (and no relation to James Mwangi). Geothermal sources are available night and day, and don’t depend on the sun, wind or rain. So geothermal energy may be more resilient to climate change than some other renewables.</p>



<p>But setting up geothermal power plants requires more money and specialized expertise than other renewable energies. And like any development project, it can come with social costs, such as displacing people from their land.</p>



<p>Given its long-standing experience, Kenya is now assisting its neighbors. “We are offering technical support to the countries in the region, as a way to help them develop their geothermal potential,” says Anna Mwangi. KenGen has already drilled multiple geothermal wells in Ethiopia and Djibouti.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why East Africa is a geothermal energy hot spot</h4>



<p>Globally, geothermal resources are often found along the boundaries of tectonic plates, such as around the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire. In Africa, a bounty of geothermal resources exist where a new boundary is forming: the East African Rift System. The exact start of the system is not clearly defined; it originates on the Arabian Peninsula before running south along the Red Sea and into Djibouti. As it runs southward in Africa, the rift zone branches into two arms: The eastern arm ends at the border between Kenya and Tanzania while the western arm goes farther south, running 6,400&nbsp;kilometers through more than 10 countries before ending in Mozambique.</p>





<p>For millions of years, the African Plate has been pulled in opposite directions, at a rate of a few centimeters per year. Eventually, this stretching will split Africa into two separate continents and create two tectonic plates, the Nubian Plate to the west and the Somalian Plate to the east.</p>



<p>The stretching also causes magma to dome up in various points along the rift system. One such place is Olkaria in Naivasha. Beneath the surface, the molten rock heats groundwater. Wells bring that hot water and steam to the surface. When harnessed at high pressure and used to turn turbines, the steam generates electricity. The hot water is then injected back into the ground to recharge the subterranean water supply.</p>



<p>There’s no comprehensive estimate for how much total energy East Africa could harvest from geothermal sources. But experts estimate that Kenya and Ethiopia could each generate 10,000 megawatts. That’s roughly triple Kenya’s total installed electricity capacity and double Ethiopia’s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where’s the heat?</h3>



<p>The total worldwide installed capacity for generating electricity from geothermal energy is 16,000 megawatts. In 2022, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal countries.<br>Source: ThinkGeoEnergy Research 2023</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Top 10 geothermal countries (megawatts of installed capacity)</h5>



<p>United States: 3,794<br>Indonesia: 2,356<br>Philippines: 1,935<br>Turkey: 1,682<br>New Zealand: 1,037<br>Mexico: 963<br>Kenya: 944*<br>Italy: 944<br>Iceland: 754<br>Japan: 621</p>



<p>*ThinkGeoEnergy’s tally of Kenya’s installed capacity, as of January 2023, differs slightly from KenGen’s.</p>
</div>



<p>For now, it’s mostly Kenya — one of the world’s fastest-growing geothermal power players — that has plumbed this deep heat. In addition to Olkaria, there’s a small site at the nearby Eburru geothermal field that can generate 2.4 megawatts of electricity. Farther to the north, a 35-megawatt power plant is expected to open this year at the Menengai geothermal field, with another one in development.</p>



<p>A push toward geothermal energy in recent years has come as droughts have dwindled some of Kenya’s hydropower sources. With rainfall and temperatures projected to become more erratic and extreme with climate change, geothermal energy may be the more dependable option, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>Geothermal power plants can run at maximum power output up to 90 percent of the time, when taking downtime due to maintenance into account, says François Le Scornet, president and senior market intelligence consultant at Carbonexit Consulting in France. That’s comparable to a nuclear power plant and about twice as reliable as a fossil fuel plant or wind farm (and four times as good as solar). Indeed, with the rise of geothermal energy, <a href="https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Feb/Global-geothermal-market-and-technology-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenya’s power outages have declined</a>, according to a report released in February by the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Geothermal Association.</p>



<p>The scalding-hot water and steam that flow up a geothermal well can do more than generate electricity; they can also be a direct source of heating. The <a href="https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2020/01055.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oserian flower farm near Naivasha</a>, for instance, pipes the water in to warm a greenhouse at night. The warmth dries out the air to prevent fungus from spoiling the roses, carnations and other flowers destined for bouquets around the world. At Olkaria, tourists in need of relaxation after a long day of exploring Hell’s Gate can soak in the geothermal spa near the power plant.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to find geothermal resources</h4>



<p>It takes a team of specialists to determine a site’s suitability for geothermal resource exploration. At minimum, what’s needed are the presence of groundwater, high temperatures — often around or above 150° Celsius — and permeable rock that will enable heated water and steam to flow into production wells, says Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geophysicist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo.</p>



<p>Certain visual characteristics on the surface may give an initial hint. Hot springs, hot mud puddles, geysers and even steam rising from the ground are signs of geothermal activity. Another clue is the presence of certain rocks, such as travertine, or mineral veins like quartz that indicate rock has been altered during interactions with hot water.</p>



<p>At Olkaria, a tip-off was the fact that the surrounding area is ring-shaped like a caldera, a collapsed volcano. A series of younger volcanic domes appear to have intruded into the caldera.</p>



<p>If the surface characteristics look promising, geochemists will step in to analyze fluid and gas samples to estimate how deep and hot the heat source might be and where the fluids flow. Seismometers might be deployed to infer the brittleness of the subsurface rock. It’s important that rock be permeable, but it needs to be strong enough to withstand the interaction of cool water being heated from the magma below.</p>



<p>If all those data look promising, exploration drilling will commence and if all goes well, a production well and eventually a full-blown power plant will follow.</p>



<p>Zaher and his colleagues recently completed a project that might help experts across the continent zero in on potential geothermal targets before starting costly on-the-ground exploration. “It is quite difficult to predict the precise power or electricity that can be produced for all of Africa,” he says. But his group incorporated a range of geologic, seismic and other geophysical data into a geographic information system to predict the most promising spots for geothermal exploration. The resulting map identifies <a href="https://geothermal-energy-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40517-022-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 areas that have high geothermal potential</a>, the team reported last year in<em> Geothermal Energy</em>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many of these locations are within the East African Rift System, though high potential also exists in northern Africa in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, as well as in Liberia, Namibia, Zambia and South Africa. In many of those countries, the tectonics are such that using geothermal energy for direct heating — as is done at the Oserian flower farm and could be applied in a variety of settings, including industrial processing — may be more feasible than for electricity generation, Zaher says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Work beyond Kenya</h4>



<p>KenGen has led on-the-ground geothermal exploration in a number of nearby countries. In addition to the drilling done in Ethiopia and Djibouti, surface studies to identify potential geothermal resources have been done in Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and the Comoros islands off the coast of Mozambique, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>In addition, KenGen — in collaboration with the Icelandic-based GRÓ Geothermal Training Programme and Kenya’s Geothermal Development Company — has been training university students, energy professionals and government officials within East Africa on geothermal resource exploration and development, as well as power plant financing and management. With help from the World Bank, Kenya is also setting up the Geothermal Centre of Excellence, which will train professionals in the region once it opens in a couple years, Mwangi says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deep-seated power</h3>

</div>



<p>Even with the right technical knowledge, though, it can take several years to go from exploration to geothermal energy production. In fact, even once a well has been drilled, it could still take up to a decade or more before a power plant is up and running. Funding constraints can be one barrier.</p>



<p>This is what Kenyan engineers were faced with in 2012, Mwangi says. Wells had already been drilled, yet funding for putting up power plants to generate electricity at full capacity was still unavailable.</p>



<p>This opened an avenue for experimentation. Typically, a power plant is supplied with water and steam from multiple wells at varying distances away. But a new wellhead approach, which hadn’t been implemented anywhere in the world, allowed for the generation of power directly and quickly from a single well, at low cost, in the meantime.</p>



<p>Once a permanent power plant is ready to be built, the wellhead installation can be disassembled and taken to another well for the same purpose. About 85 megawatts of power have been produced this way in Kenya. “Such well-based power plants give us the early generation benefit, and generate revenue in the meantime,” Mwangi says. “Otherwise, these production wells would have remained capped awaiting construction and commissioning of a new power plant.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The costs of geothermal energy</h4>



<p>Even as interest and expertise in geothermal energy grow in East Africa, financial constraints remain an impediment. In Kenya, a single geothermal well can cost about $6 million to drill, and it can be another $300 million to build a roughly 165-megawatt plant.</p>



<p>“Up-front capital cost is high in geothermal, but running costs are limited,” says Le Scornet, the energy consultant.</p>



<p>The worldwide levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE, for a new geothermal installation in 2021 averaged $0.068 per kilowatt-hour, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The LCOE is the lowest price at which electricity can be sold for an energy project to break even. The figure takes into account lifetime costs, from building a plant to operating and maintaining it.</p>



<p>Geothermal’s LCOE is about 40 percent higher than a new hydropower project or solar photovoltaic array, which have an LCOE of $0.048 per kilowatt-hour. An onshore wind farm is about half as expensive, at $0.033 per kilowatt-hour, but geothermal energy is slightly less costly than an offshore wind farm’s $0.075 per kilowatt-hour. (For context, Kenya’s per capita energy consumption in 2019 was about 168 kilowatt-hours, according to the U.N.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070123_geothermal_inline-4.jpg" alt="photo of a group of a people in yellow vests and hard hats standing next to a well in Olkaria" class="wp-image-3129430" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070123_geothermal_inline-4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070123_geothermal_inline-4-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070123_geothermal_inline-4-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070123_geothermal_inline-4-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129430">Journalists stand next to a geothermal well while on a tour of Olkaria.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129430">G. Kamadi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Le Scornet says that stable financing mechanisms are needed to provide stability and reduce actual and perceived project risks. To tackle this challenge, the <a href="https://grmf-eastafrica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility</a>, funded by the European Union and the African Union, was set up in 2012 to cofinance surface studies and drilling programs.</p>



<p>“Support from project partners like the EU, for instance, and the African Development Bank can be instrumental, especially in countries with high debt levels and where competition with alternative projects presents obvious challenges for the development of new geothermal projects,” Le Scornet says.</p>



<p>But not all costs are purely financial. Kenya’s Olkaria project demonstrates one of the social costs. In developing and expanding the project over time, some members of the local Maasai community, a seminomadic pastoralist group, have been removed from their land, says Ben Ole Koissaba, lead consultant for Rarin Consulting Services, which champions for the land rights of Indigenous communities. Relocated people “have been cut off from the rest of the community,” says Koissaba, who is a member of the Maasai. And some of the housing built for them has not been culturally appropriate, he says.</p>



<p>While some of the Maasai consider the displacement an outstanding issue, Kenya’s geothermal exploration isn’t slowing down. By 2025, the country aims to more than double its current production capacity to 2,500 megawatts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronal-rain-sun-space">Coronal rain has been seen splashing on the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>Plasma rain in the sun’s atmosphere makes a splash when it lands. New observations from the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter have revealed <a href="https://nam2023.org/press-releases/279-solar-astronomers-discover-shooting-stars-on-the-sun-s-corona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously unseen details</a> of how this coronal rain falls, including bright fireball effects and sudden upward surges in plasma.</p>



<p>“These are the highest resolution images we have ever obtained from the solar corona,” says solar physicist Patrick Antolin of Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He presented the results at the National Astronomy Meeting in Cardiff, Wales, the week of July 3 and in a paper <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/202346016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be published in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em></a>.</p>





<p>The corona is the sun’s wispy upper atmosphere, the sizzling tangle of plasma and magnetism that is visible during a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2019-total-solar-eclipse-south-america">total eclipse</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/19</em>). When clumps of scorching-hot plasma in the corona suddenly cool, they condense and fall toward the solar surface, just like water droplets in Earth’s atmosphere. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plasma-rain-sun-atmosphere-falls-surprising-places">coronal rain</a> has been observed before, but details of its formation and falling were fuzzy (<em>SN: 5/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones">2020 launch of Solar Orbiter</a> promised to change that (<em>SN: 2/9/20</em>). The probe is making passes over the sun’s unexplored polar regions, carrying high resolution cameras and other instruments to investigate solar mysteries. In late March 2022, Solar Orbiter made its closest approach to the sun to date, swooping within 49 million kilometers of our star — about a third of the distance between the sun and Earth.</p>



<p>In images from the spacecraft taken during that close encounter, Antolin and colleagues discovered a new feature in the coronal rain. As the plasma raindrops fell, the region immediately below them brightened. The researchers think the brightening came from other plasma below the falling rain getting compressed and heated, similar to the way meteors in Earth’s atmosphere can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-explodes-over-russia">create fireballs</a> just ahead of the falling rocks (<em>SN: 2/15/13</em>).</p>



<p>“This is the first time we’ve seen that kind of compression from the rain falling this clearly,” says Emily Mason, a solar physicist at Predictive Science, a research company based in San Diego, who was not involved in the study. “The resolution just wasn’t there before.”</p>



<p>Antolin and colleagues also saw a rebound and upward flow of material after coronal raindrops smacked onto the chromosphere, the thin layer of plasma that lies between the sun’s visible surface and the corona.</p>



<p>“This rain is as dense as the chromosphere,” Antolin says. “It can fall to the chromosphere and then make a splash.” This sort of splash was predicted in computer simulations but had never been observed on the actual sun before.</p>



<p>On their own, the observations won’t directly solve the biggest solar mysteries, like why the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">diffuse corona sizzles at millions of degrees</a> Celsius higher than the surface of the sun (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). But more observations of the same phenomena can help figure out details of the coronal environment, like how easily its gas compresses, or what its chemical composition is.</p>



<p>“We are not able to send a probe to the inner part of the corona because it’s so hot,” Antolin says. “So we can use these observations as indirect probes of the local environment.”</p>



<p>The observations are “an important litmus test for Solar Orbiter itself,” Mason says. “It’s good to see what Solar Orbiter is capable of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">Wildfires aren’t going away. Here’s how smoke can affect your health</a></h4>

              
                <p>North America’s summer of smoke may well be a harbinger of what’s to come. As record-breaking wildfires in Canada continue to sweep across the land, smoke has been suffusing the skies for more and more people. Frequent fires like these can mean more smoke inhaled, and over longer periods of time.</p>



<p>What are the health consequences of breathing in this fumy miasma? I asked three experts.</p>



<p>Air pollution exposure scientist Jeffrey Brook’s office at the University of Toronto is roughly 500 kilometers from some of the raging blazes that have engulfed more than 8 million hectares in Canada this year. Even at that distance, the air has been bad, he says, shrouding the city in noxious gasses and tiny particles of burned biomass. “It’s the worst particulate matter air quality I’ve seen in 30 years or more,” Brook says.</p>





<p>When I reach him, he’s on a boat on the eastern end of Lake Ontario. All around, the air is hazy from wildfire smoke; he can just make out the shoreline. Driving there from Toronto, Brook felt like he was moving through a curtain, he says.</p>



<p>Some 800 kilometers south, where atmospheric scientist Katelyn O’Dell works at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the scene has been less apocalyptic, but it can change abruptly. Some days, you can see and smell smoke in the air, and “the sky doesn’t even look blue,” she says.</p>



<p>From across the continent, at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, environmental epidemiologist Sarah Henderson says those smoky scenes look all too familiar. “We’re no strangers to wildfire smoke,” she says. In previous years, the region has seen extreme episodes driven by fires in the Pacific Northwest.</p>



<p>These three scientists have been studying the health effects of wildfire smoke for years. They talked with me about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">how smoke impacts our health, what questions remain</a> and what researchers might be able to learn from the current fires <em>(SN: 9/18/20)</em>. Our conversations have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why are scientists focusing on wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>The wildfire season has been expanding, so it&#8217;s impacting us more throughout the year. [And] wildfire smoke is different than the typical urban smog that has been studied historically.</p>



<p>[That smog], emissions from traffic and industry, has been decreasing due to successful emissions control policies — and those are projected to continue to decrease. Because those are going down and wildfire smoke is going up, it’s really important for us to study wildfire smoke and its impacts on health.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How can wildfire smoke affect people’s health?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>Wildfire smoke is a really complex form of air pollution. And we have decades of research that tells us exposure to air pollution isn&#8217;t good for us. <strong></strong></p>





<p>What we know at this point is that when smoke is occurring, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">there are measurable effects</a> in the population almost immediately <em>(SN: 6/17/22)</em>. Respiratory effects, especially for people with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], are the first things to happen. We generally see that these people need more of their rescue medications, meaning that their airways are closing up.</p>



<p>The magnitude of that impact in those populations seems to be larger for wildfire smoke than for other types of air pollution. We [also] see small detriments to cognitive performance.</p>



<p>And then [there’s] quite a bit of evidence around impacts to the developing fetus. There’s risk of preterm birth and reductions in birth weight for infants who are exposed in utero.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>People will say, “Oh, it&#8217;s natural. It&#8217;s campfire smoke, it&#8217;s OK.” No, it&#8217;s not. [Wildfire smoke] contains some of the same toxicants that we think about all the time as bad ones in air pollution.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s in wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> There are multiple pollutants in wildfire smoke that can impact health, but the one that we&#8217;re typically most concerned with is the fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5. PM 2.5 is a particle in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> Those [are] particles that can travel deep into the lungs.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> Wildfire smoke has a lot of gases in it too. Things like formaldehyde, benzene and sometimes ozone.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-air-pollution-ozone-shutdown">Ozone negatively impacts respiratory health</a> <em>(SN: 1/4/21)</em>. It&#8217;s unclear right now if benzene and formaldehyde are often at [dangerous] levels in smoke plumes, but we do know these pollutants at certain levels can negatively impact health from both short-term and long-term exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gauging air quality&nbsp; <strong></strong></h3>



<p>The Air Quality Index, or AQI, ranges from 0 to 500, based on the amount of pollution in the air at a given time. Ground-level ozone, particulate matter (both PM<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are the primary parameters considered in the index. Code orange (above a score of 100) is unhealthy for people in sensitive groups. Code red and above (151–500) is unhealthy for everyone.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What questions do researchers still have about the health effects of wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> If you have a wave of wildfire smoke multiple times every summer, how does that affect your health in the long term? It’s a very important question [and] an open area of research right now.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>It&#8217;s a slightly more challenging question to address because you might have a population that&#8217;s exposed for a couple of weeks, at a really high magnitude for one summer, and then for the next three summers, there&#8217;s no smoke and everything&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>That intermittent episodic nature of exposure might mean that [the longer-term effects of wildfire smoke] are quite different from the more steady types of air pollution that affect our air quality, day in and day out.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re still learning about what that means. We might be seeing kids, if they are exposed very early in life, [with] a lifelong detriment to their lung function.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>What if you happen to be pregnant and the fetus is at a particularly important part of development? If it’s getting really high [smoke] exposure coupled with stress because the mom’s worried about the high exposure, [could] that alter how certain organs – lungs, brain, heart – develop? We don’t know.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> [Another] open question is how the health impacts of fresh smoke differ from old smoke [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c04497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than three days old</a>]. There are a few reasons [the impacts] might be different, one being chemical changes in the smoke itself — smoke changes as it travels through the atmosphere. Another major factor is the public’s awareness of smoke. If you live close to where the fire is burning, you’re very aware that there is likely smoke. But [people] farther away, might be less aware and maybe take less action to protect their own health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn from the current wildfires?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>These fires are impacting a different population than have historically been predominantly studied. A lot of the wildfire and health studies have occurred in the western United States. This event that we&#8217;re experiencing right now [will] hopefully allow us to have a greater understanding of how wildfire smoke might impact people in the eastern states.</p>



<p>There are many factors that may lead to a different health response for those out east compared with those out west, including different baseline disease rates or levels of pre-existing conditions, different responses to smoke, level of outdoor activity, et cetera.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>What we need [are] populations that are resilient to these exposures, populations that know how to take protective measures, and policies that look at how we keep smoke out of the indoor environment to ensure that people are protected when they&#8217;re indoors. All of those types of things are going to allow us to be resilient to the smoke exposures in the decades ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can people do to protect themselves from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>[In our current lifestyle], the vast majority of us spend the vast majority of our time inside. If we are effectively reducing smoke in the indoor environment, we are effectively protecting our health for about 90 percent of the time. </p>



<p>We highly recommend that you have some sort of air cleaning device running in at least one room of the home so that you have kind of a smoke-free haven — especially the bedroom because you&#8217;re probably going to be there for at least eight hours of the day.</p>



<p>Then we can look to what happens when you’re outdoors. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">A well-fitted respirator type mask like an N95 or KN95</a> will effectively filter the particles of wildfire smoke out and probably some of the gases as well <em>(SN: 2/12/21)</em>.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a good idea to check the local air quality before you undergo any outdoor activity, and then adjust your behavior accordingly. If you really need to be outside, maybe go for a walk instead of a run, and wear a mask if it&#8217;s really bad. And if you&#8217;re in an extra-sensitive group — children, the elderly, people with preexisting conditions — you might choose to stay indoors on days that are especially smoky.</p>



<p>At the local government level, it’s good to have plans in place for when there is smoke. Do schools cancel recess? Do we open clean-air shelters for people who aren&#8217;t able to have clean air in their homes — or maybe don’t have a home — to protect that vulnerable set of the population?</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>A key principle we always follow in environmental protection is to set our policies to protect the most vulnerable. It’s always good to be cautious. If you’re healthy, smoke is a little piece of many things in your life that impact your health. But if you’re compromised, maybe you’ve got a respiratory infection or just had a heart attack or some other condition, smoke could really hinder [your] recovery.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How worried should we be about wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>We should be more worried about climate change. When you look at Canada, we’ve had fire impacts from coast to coast this year. I’ve never seen that. It’s just unprecedented. It&#8217;s a wake-up call. Like, hey folks, you&#8217;ve been hearing that these things are going to happen. And look, they’re happening sooner, they’re happening faster. Look at your air. This is not just bad luck.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>In the western United States and even in parts of Canada, [wildfires] have been increasing over the past several decades due to several factors. In the United States, one [factor is] historical fire suppression tactics, but another [is] anthropogenic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">climate change</a> <em>(SN: 6/9/23). </em>And those increases in fires, and the smoke that they emit, is expected to continue to increase across the coming century.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> &nbsp;There are people who live their daily lives in cities that are about as polluted as some of the cities we&#8217;ve seen in eastern North America over the past month. On one hand, humans are quite resilient to air pollution exposure, and on the other hand, air pollution exposure is not good for people. We need to find a balance somewhere in the middle that doesn&#8217;t make people feel panicked, [and] makes them feel empowered to make the best possible decisions for themselves in their health.</p>

<p>The German anesthesiologist <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dBoldt">Joachim Boldt</a> has lost 20 more papers since January 2023, earning him the top spot in our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>, with 184 retractions. </p>



<p>Boldt, readers may recall, was once one of the leading international figures in perioperative medicine. His work, particularly studies involving the use of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">fluid management</a> during surgery, helped inform clinical guidelines that, thanks to his misdeeds, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.362.6413.394-a">some experts believe</a> may have put patients at risk for serious harm and even death.</p>



<p>Boldt has vaulted over another anesthesiologist, Yoshitaka Fujii, to take the crown (more on that in a moment) – although one might fairly ask: Why did it take so long?</p>



<span id="more-127491"></span>



<p>The bulk of the recently retracted papers appeared in <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/134"><em>Intensive Care Medicine</em></a>, a European title published by Springer Nature. Since March, the journal has pulled 15 articles by Boldt, whose misdeeds – including but not limited to fabrication of data and lack of ethics approval in his clinical trials – first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">came to light</a> in 2010. Five more came in the journal <em>Chest</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s one<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07133-5"> notice</a>, for “Right ventricular function and cardiac surgery,” which <em>Intensive Care Medicine</em> published in June 1988. (Note that the statement from Justus Liebig University <a href="https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(20)30163-X/pdf">dates to 2020</a>.)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. A statement by Justus Liebig University (JLU) [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4#ref-CR1">1</a>] on the scientific credibility of articles by Joachim Boldt has recommended that journal editors consider retracting all articles “where Boldt is the responsible author even if there is no obvious indication of falsification”. Given the concerns about the studies performed by Joachim Boldt the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the work reported in this article. J. Boldt has not responded to correspodence [sic] from the Publisher about this retraction. The Publisher was not able to obtain a current email address for T Wollbrück, S. Sonneborn, A. Welters and G Hempelmann.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited seven times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. The new retracted article with the most citations (27) is “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4">Thrombomodulin in intensive care patients</a>.” Of those, eight came in the years since the Boldt scandal broke, and once came after 2020, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the editor of the journal about the delay. He passed us along to someone else at Springer Nature, who didn’t reply. We eventually got this statement from a spokesperson for the publisher:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors of Intensive Care Medicine and its publisher Springer Nature have been aware of concerns regarding the integrity of the work of Joachim Boldt for some time. When we were first made aware of the concerns we carefully investigated – in line with COPE best practice &#8211; and acted to retract nine articles by Boldt in 2011. A further three articles were retracted in 2020; these were review articles which were deemed to be unreliable as their content relied on articles reporting studies that had been retracted. However, a number of papers by Boldt remained unretracted as our investigations were unconclusive and the allegations could not be confirmed.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the Editors were made aware of a statement by Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU) recommending the retraction of any article for which Boldt is a responsible author. Upon further assessment, the journals Editors and the Springer Nature Research Integrity Team decided to proceed with the retraction of the remaining articles where Boldt is the responsible author. These retractions are in the process of being completed.</p>



<p>We are committed to maintaining the integrity of the scientific record, and although evidence of fraud cannot be ascertained in all cases, the Editors and Springer Nature considered it prudent to proceed with these retractions and warn readers about the unreliability of this research, in line with the recommendations of Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We wondered about the journal’s investigation into “unconfirmed allegations” against Boldt and why the letter from JLU would have affected those investigations, but did not receive a reply to that follow-up question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, at this point, we need to make something of an apology. For the last several years, we have listed the number of retractions attributed to Yoshitaka Fujii as 183. (We also included this figure in a <a href="https://nautil.us/how-the-biggest-fabricator-in-science-got-caught-235421/">2015 article for Nautilus</a>.)</p>



<p>That figure came from the list of Fujii’s paper investigators – from the Japanese Society of Anesthesiology in particular – had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/15/retraction-record-broken-again-university-report-should-up-fujii-total-to-183/">marked for retraction</a>. But as we know all too well, journals don’t always act, even when asked. More than a decade after that report, and now that the dust has (mostly) settled, we have records of only 172 retractions.</p>



<p>Although Boldt now beats the incorrect 183, and while Fujii was indeed the most-retracted researcher until Boldt’s recent bolus, details are important. We’ve updated our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> accordingly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canada-crawford-lake-beginning-anthropocene">Canada’s Crawford Lake could mark the beginning of the Anthropocene</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists are one step closer to defining a new chapter in geology, one in which humans have become the dominant driver of Earth’s climate and environment.</p>



<p>Out of 12 locations around the world, Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada, has been selected as the site that would mark the official beginning of the Anthropocene, a proposed geologic epoch starting in the 1950s, researchers announced at a July 11 news conference during the&nbsp;<a href="https://climate-conference.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Planck Society Conference for a Sustainable Anthropocene</a> in Berlin.</p>





<p>The lake bottom’s sediments hold one of the most precise records of humans’ alteration of Earth, including upticks in plutonium from nuclear weapons testing, ash from burning fossil fuels as well as heavy metals and microplastics.</p>



<p>But the Anthropocene isn’t an official geologic epoch yet. Now, several more committees must approve of the proposed epoch before it can be added to the geologic time scale. Doing so would end the nearly 12,000-year-old Holocene Epoch, which encompasses the rise of humankind since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Scientists first started using the term <em>Anthropocene</em> in the early 2000s to refer to the ongoing time of humans altering the planet on a global scale. Although framed in terms of geology, the Anthropocene lacked a formal geologic definition.</p>



<p>Still, the idea spread. “It exploded so quickly into other disciplines without it being defined,” says earth scientist Simon Turner of University College London. So “that’s what we’ve been trying to do ever since.”</p>



<p>In 2009, the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the scientific group responsible for defining geologic time, convened a committee to characterize the Anthropocene and see whether it deserved a spot on the geologic time scale. Over a decade later, that committee has now chosen Crawford Lake out of the 12 candidate sites as the Anthropocene’s “Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point,” a reference site that shows a change in its rock, ice or other layers to mark the beginning of a new geologic time.</p>



<p>From coral to ice to peat, each of the candidate sites holds a remarkable record of human activity in its layers. Selecting Crawford Lake was “like choosing a favorite child,” says Turner, secretary and a voting member of the committee.</p>



<p>Among the locations, Crawford Lake’s muddy layers have trapped one of the most precise histories of human activity. Each summer, the water’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20530196221149281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pH and warm temperatures cause mineral crystals to form near the top of the water</a>. The crystals fall to the lake’s bottom like snow, where they lay undisturbed. “You get these lovely stripes,” Turner says. “And you can resolve what year [they’re from] pretty much by counting backwards from the surface layer, like a tree ring.”</p>



<p>The layers capture a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-blasts-other-human-activity-signal-new-epoch-anthropocene">radioactivity and other evidence of human activity starting in the early 1950s</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/16</em>).</p>



<p>But not all scientists agree that the Anthropocene began merely 70 years ago, or that it should be defined as a geologic term at all. “Any time you draw a hard line in the geologic record or in any other system, you’re creating a binary —&nbsp;there’s a before and there’s an after,” says paleoecologist Jacquelyn Gill of the University of Maine in Orono. “We know human impacts began well before 1950.”</p>



<p>Retaining an informal&nbsp;and flexible concept, like what’s used now in disciplines beyond geology, might be more beneficial, she adds. “It’s more powerful as a tool in that way,” Gill says, “than it is to try to confine it or constrain it to a narrow definition that then creates confusion about everything that came before.”</p>





<p>Still, attempting to define the Anthropocene in geologic terms underscores humanity’s rapid and intense impact on the planet, Turner says. “We’ve become a geological force.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thermal-cloak-material-temperature">This ‘thermal cloak’ keeps spaces from getting either too hot or cold</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever burned your hands on a car steering wheel, you know how hot the inside of a car can get on a summer day. But a new fabric could one day help cars and other objects stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>



<p>Researchers created a prototype of the fabric, which <a href="https://cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(23)00008-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acts as a “thermal cloak”</a> that keeps the space underneath it from getting too hot or too cold. The cloak, described in the July 11 <em>Device</em>, doesn’t require an external power source, which could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reduce energy consumption</a> associated with heating and cooling (<em>SN: 9/28/18)</em>.</p>





<p>Globally, heating and cooling make up <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101427X#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20HVAC%20consumption%20represents,as%20the%20UE%20or%20Russia." target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent of energy use in buildings and 12 percent of total energy consumption</a>. Materials like this thermal cloak could help keep us comfortable during heat waves while reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity used in temperature control, says Aaswath Raman, an applied physicist at UCLA who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In the new study, Kehang Cui, an engineer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and colleagues built the cloak using two layers. The outer layer is made of white silica fibers that reflect visible light, coated with hexagonal boron nitride, a ceramic material that reflects ultraviolet light and helps dissipate heat. Together, the silica fibers and boron nitride reflect 96 percent of the sunlight that hits the fabric. At the same time, the outer layer absorbs heat from the surrounding area and emits that energy as infrared light, which also lowers the temperature under the cloak through a process called radiative cooling.</p>



<p>Though the outer layer keeps the space under the cloak cooler for longer than an uncovered area, the cloaked space slowly warms up throughout the day. The inner layer, made of aluminum foil, keeps the space warm at night by trapping some of that heat inside, similar to an insulating survival blanket.</p>



<p>The researchers tested the cloak material’s durability under several extreme conditions. They baked the fabric at 800° Celsius, just about hot enough to melt table salt. They also exposed it to extreme cold by dunking it in liquid nitrogen, subjected it to the same amount of vibration as a rocket launch, doused it in acid and blasted it with fire from a butane torch — all with virtually no changes to the material’s structure or performance. This extreme durability might lend itself to use in spacecraft or extraterrestrial environments, the team says.</p>



<p>To see the fabric in action, Cui and colleagues built a full-size prototype cloak and tested it on an electric car. On a summer day in Shanghai, the cloak kept the car at about 23° C — up to 8 degrees C lower than the outside temperature and 28 degrees C lower than the inside of an uncloaked car. The cloak also kept the car about 5 degrees C warmer than the outside air on a winter night.</p>



<p>The cloak “definitely shows the capability of saving energy, but the next step is that we want to demonstrate it in even larger-scale field tests [such as rooftops] to see the impact on our daily lives,” Cui says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-lauren-schroeder-scientists-to-watch">Lauren Schroeder looks beyond natural selection to rethink human evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lauren Schroeder has loved dinosaurs since age 3 and bones since she was 10. In her second year of university, she started studying the early evolution of the <em>Homo </em>genus and it turned into her Ph.D. Many fossils have taken her breath away, she says, but a 2-million-year-old <em>Homo habilis </em>skull holds such a special place in her heart that it’s tattooed on her forearm.</p>



<p>“I think I can safely say that I&#8217;m doing what I wanted to do,” she says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></figure></div>


<p>As a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, Schroeder works to untangle the various processes by which humans have evolved. One such process, natural selection,&nbsp;is adaptive: Changes in an organism’s features make it more suited to its environment. But some changes are not selected for, or even totally random. Despite the existence of “nonadaptive” processes, paleoanthropology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has often attributed</a> evolutionary changes in hominids to adaptation alone.</p>



<p>While a Ph.D. student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, Schroeder questioned the emphasis on natural selection to explain changes seen in the fossil record. “It was very clear that something was missing,” she says. Not much research had considered the role played by nonadaptive processes, such as genetic drift and gene flow.&nbsp;“That was really the big moment for me … these are important questions that haven&#8217;t really been asked. I should try to answer them.”</p>





<p>Since then, her research has suggested that nonadaptive processes play a much bigger role in evolution than previously realized.</p>



<p>“All aspects of Lauren’s research have been consequential for the discipline,” says Benjamin Auerbach, a biological anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “We’re witnessing maybe a change in the way we talk about human evolution.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of chance</h4>



<p>Schroeder’s research centers around questions of how and why body features in humans (or other animals) — called “morphology” — came to be.</p>



<p>They are hard questions to answer, in part because fossils often don’t contain usable DNA. Paleoanthropologists rely on patterns in the morphology, established theory and statistical analyses to try to understand the evolutionary processes at play. It’s math “all the way through,” Schroeder says —&nbsp;which is good, because she adores math.</p>



<p>Before the math, Schroeder measures the features of the fossils. During her Ph.D. research, she traveled across Africa to scan and analyze fossil <em>Homo </em>skulls dating from 2.8 million years ago until just tens of thousands of years ago. Some features of the skulls showed a strong adaptive signal, including the jaw; that means that early <em>Homo</em> jaw shape probably evolved via natural selection, driven by a changing diet. </p>



<p>But surprisingly, when Schroeder looked at the results for the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841630152X?casa_token=sK6RMWS3q8UAAAAA:8FlfRoRlTg_7tEoFdQ63zifQXHv_JpzFHDW90IYcBrjVB8_ptd8pA2iEHNTZovoFgwTWbMoJ4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of braincases</a> across the <em>Homo </em>genus, genetic drift appeared to be at play, she reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution.</em> A nonadaptive process, genetic drift is the loss of genetic variation in a population due to the chance disappearance of certain genes. In other words, the braincase shape evolved just because.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="496" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a Homo habilis skull on a black background." class="wp-image-3129182" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-525x383.jpg 525w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-617x450.jpg 617w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-255x186.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129182">During her Ph.D. work, Lauren Schroeder analyzed this <em>Homo habilis</em> skull and other fossils to better understand how the human skull evolved.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129182">Chip Clark, Smithsonian Institution</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Schroeder also turns to today’s animals to better understand the evolution of our ancestors. Another nonadaptive process — gene flow — occurs when genes spread from one population to another through breeding, including when two species hybridize. Hybrids in the fossil record could thus offer clues to evolutionary processes. But there’s currently no good way to determine whether a fossil represents a hybrid.</p>



<p>Schroeder aims to change that by developing a framework based on morphological patterns in living hybrids. So far she’s focused on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.21417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skulls of coyote-wolf hybrids</a> (chosen in part because Schroeder loves dogs), and she’s identified traits consistent with other hybrids, she and colleagues reported in 2021 in <em>Journal of Morphology</em>, including a higher incidence of dental and other anomalies.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rewriting narratives</h4>



<p>Schroeder, who grew up in South Africa, remembers noticing as early as her undergraduate years that most of the paleoanthropological research in her country was conducted by foreign researchers. In fact, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub#fig5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 percent of papers</a> published in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> from 2016 to 2021 were authored by African researchers, Schroeder reported in the journal this past January.</p>



<p>Additionally, “even though most of it is based in Africa, paleoanthropology is so white,” she says. As a Black African woman, “it was such a lonely place, actually, for a long time.” Schroeder has struggled to publish papers, received sexist reviews on papers and experienced instances of blatant racism.</p>



<p>Some things have improved. At American Association of Biological Anthropologists conferences, she used to be able to count the number of Black people on two hands, she says. When she attended this past May, she was one of many. But there is still a long way to go. She credits her mentors for helping her get through the tough early years and the <a href="https://www.blackinbioanth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black in BioAnth Collective</a> for working to transform the field.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not an easy journey getting to where she is, but she&#8217;s there,” says Rebecca Ackermann, Schroeder’s Ph.D. adviser at the University of Cape Town. “And so now the world is her oyster.”</p>



<p>Schroeder recently secured tenure at the University of Toronto. As the first in her family to attend university, it means a lot to her and her parents. “They don’t necessarily get everything I do,” she laughs. But “we’re in disbelief that I’ve gotten here.”</p>

<p>The journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> removed a scientist linked to paper mill activity from its editorial board last year, but didn’t take his name off the web page until last month, after a Retraction Watch-Undark story pointed out his association.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former editorial board member, <a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, is an assistant professor of engineering at the Islamic Azad University in Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">our story</a>, Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan, cited Afrand as an example of researchers seemingly associated with paper mills who manage to get editorial positions at reputable journals. Afrand, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127465"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences, where Afrand was cited over 130 times.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the time our story was published, on June 21, Afrand was listed as an editorial board member for mechanical engineering at <em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a week later, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/#comment-2171802">commenter</a> noted that Afrand was no longer on the website, although he had been in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230620034100/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">snapshot</a> of the webpage from June 20 in the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/#comment-2171896">replied</a> that he had emailed the journal about Afrand on May 31, 2022. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why it should take a dedicated journalist to get things done, is beyond my understanding.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, told us that while Afrand had been listed as an editorial board member on the website, the journal had “parted ways” with him in March 2022. An internal audit earlier that year had uncovered “irregularities” in how Afrand handled papers, and the journal made its decision “after an in-depth investigation following due process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as the recent update to the website, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, due to an oversight, Masoud was still listed as an Editorial Board Member on the Scientific Reports website for more than a year after his departure. The recent Retraction Watch article brought this error to our attention and we have since removed his name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Afrand has not responded to our request for comment.</p>

                <p><em>Written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; mission is to transform research communication for the good of science and society. We believe that Open Science is the key. Open Science supports rigor, reproducibility, inclusivity, and efficiency&mdash;and in doing so, results in accelerated progress, stronger research, and increased trust in results. Increasing the prevalence of Open Science is a prerequisite to reaping the full benefits. At PLOS, we work to foster openness through policy, and by creating opportunities for researchers to engage in Open Science practices as part of their everyday experience publishing in our journals.</p>



<p>But we can only succeed in driving Open Science adoption if we understand:</p>



<ol><li>The research communities we serve</li><li>Current norms in those communities</li><li>How Open Science behaviors change over time&mdash;and especially in response to new policies and offerings</li></ol>



<p>Combined with <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">other research activities</a>, <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</a> are an important source of data that help us to develop solutions that better serve PLOS authors, and the research community in general. Read on to learn more about why and how we&rsquo;re measuring Open Science practices more comprehensively and consistently at PLOS.</p>



<h2>What are Open Science Indicators?</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators are a new source of information on Open Science practices across the published literature. Produced in partnership with DataSeer, they use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp; to identify and measure Open Science practices in all PLOS articles, and in a comparator set of similar Open Access research articles. The dataset begins in January 2019, and is updated quarterly.</p>



<h2>Measuring Openness with Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS began developing Open Science Indicators in 2021 to meet our own need for better information. We needed a fuller understanding to inform a data-driven strategy that meets our aims to:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>increase adoption of Open Science practices and</li><li>increase evidence of the benefits and effects of these practices.</li></ol>



<p>But until recently, there was no easy way to measure Open Science practices, save from having an expert read every article. And we are not the only ones who need better information on Open Science practices. Research funders, institutions, and policy makers all share the same challenge.</p>



<p>Before initiating OSI we first defined <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">six guiding principles</a>. While the collective requirements we developed for Open Science Indicators are, so far, unique, much of our approach builds on&nbsp; the work of others: meta-researchers, tool developers, and community-endorsed frameworks. Our inspirations include the FAIR principles, the <a href="https://quest-dashboard.charite.de/">Charite Metrics Dashboard</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107">a major piece of meta-research</a> that analyzed different aspects of open science practice in PubMed Central. Even more recently, national efforts such as the French Open Science Monitor and UK Reproducibility Network have, respectively, <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">created solutions</a> or <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/06/30/ukrn-2nd-working-paper-open-research-indicators-sector-priorities/">explored requirements</a> for monitoring open research practices to suit their needs.</p>



<p>In shaping our own guiding principles, we felt it was important that Open Science Indicators rely on the publicly available text and metadata included in any research publication, so that the measurements might be applied not just at PLOS, but across any publicly available research article. We wanted to enable comparison across fields, regions, and publication venues in the short term, and to lay the groundwork for a system that might be easily expanded to give a broader view of the whole scientific communications landscape in the future. And of course, we wanted to make the data publicly available to all, for use at PLOS and other organizations.</p>



<h2>Selecting the first Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS journals support and facilitate a wide range of Open Science practices, so we needed to prioritize which Open Science Indicators to measure first. We selected, to begin with, three practices that are highly relevant to a large percentage of the researchers we serve, and so have high potential for broad adoption: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each has its own vital role to play in the system of Open Science.</p>



<h3>Data sharing</h3>



<p>Data is the raw output of primary research. Readers rely on raw scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research. Data are key for verification, replication and reanalysis, to inform future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p>



<p>At PLOS, our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/how-to-prepare-and-share/">pioneering data availability policy</a> requires authors to make the raw data underlying their conclusions accessible (within ethical boundaries) at the time of publication. PLOS data availability policy gives authors several options for sharing their data, depending on what works best for them and their manuscript. At the same time, we appreciate that data repositories are the most efficient and impactful way to share. Indicators help us&nbsp; track progress towards <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/how-to-prepare-and-share/">best practices</a>.</p>



<h3>Code sharing</h3>



<p>Data only mean so much without the context to understand how it was generated and analyzed, and the tools to validate and reproduce the work. Augmenting a research article with Open Code enhances understanding, facilitates reproducibility and reanalysis, promotes trust, and saves other researchers time and effort, leading to a more efficient scientific system overall.</p>



<p>Code sharing is strongly encouraged at all PLOS journals, and is <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">required at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Preprints</h3>



<p>Preprints empower researchers to take control of their research communications for more efficient and inclusive sharing. Researchers use preprints to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications.</p>



<p>PLOS journals have always welcomed preprints, and since 2018, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">we&rsquo;ve offered facilitated preprint posting</a> at submission to help make the process even easier for our authors.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Measuring data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting is one step toward understanding the state of Open Science practices today, and charting the course ahead based on researchers&rsquo; real-world behavior. PLOS uses OSIs to guide our decision-making. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritizing which repositories to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data">extend our Accessible Data icon</a> to</li><li>Monitoring the effectiveness of new solutions, such as our integration with EarthArXiv, and <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s code-sharing policy</li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#preprints">Understanding the Open Science practices</a> of researchers in different disciplines and regions, helping us to align our systems and policies with their needs, and sharing what we learn more widely&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the future, we&rsquo;ll add additional data points and new Indicators to the OSI dataset, and expand it to include more comparator content. We&rsquo;re also combining the quantitative insights from OSIs with other sources of information, such as published qualitative research, as well as our own <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">novel investigations</a> into different communities and practices. Combining qualitative insights with diverse, responsibly-applied quantitative insights provides a more complete picture of research quality and impact, and aligns with <a href="https://coara.eu/">efforts to reform research assessment</a>.</p>



<p>And we&rsquo;ll continue to make the dataset publicly available for others to read and consult, share, remix, and reuse, for the betterment of science, which ultimately is what Open Science is trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrass-chesapeake-bay-ecosystem">This seagrass is taking over the Chesapeake Bay. That’s good and bad news</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the U.S. mid-Atlantic seaboard, efforts to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay over the last 10 years have faced a mysterious challenge — massive booms and busts of the seagrass meadows that provide crucial habitats for juvenile blue crabs, black sea bass and scores of other creatures. Now researchers have uncovered the surprising reasons for these dramatic swings.</p>

<p>A weedy plant that used to lurk only at low levels in the Bay is becoming dominant, dethroning the Bay’s historically predominant eelgrass, says ecologist Chris Patrick of the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences in Gloucester Point. Widgeongrass’s ability to grow like, well, a weed has caused <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220678120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bay’s seagrass meadow to nearly triple in extent</a>, Patrick and colleagues report May 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. That was a “big shock to everyone,” he says. But widgeongrass is also more vulnerable than eelgrass to sunlight-blocking water pollution, making it prone to huge crashes.</p>



<p>These findings offer “a weird message of hope,” says VIMS ecologist Marc Hensel. Understanding the ecology of shifting seagrasses offers solutions to better protecting and restoring sea meadows, not just in the Chesapeake Bay but also for many other estuaries and coastal ecosystems.</p>





<p>The study combines aerial surveys of 26,000 hectares of habitat with 40 years of data on nutrient and sediment pollution, seagrass coverage, temperatures, plankton blooms and river flows. These data provide “an almost unprecedented record of submerged aquatic vegetation,” says ecologist and seagrass expert Emmett Duffy of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md., who was not involved in the study. Particularly important is the researchers’ ability to distinguish between seagrass species, he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where’s the seagrass?</h3>



<p>In 2019, eelgrass (blue) was the dominant seagrass in the southern parts of Chesapeake Bay (shown in this map), but it once thrived throughout the region. Many of those regions, predominately in the north, are now dominated by widgeongrass (green), which has been expanding rapidly as warming water temperatures shift the seagrass ecosystem.</p>

<p>The extent of the Bay’s eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina)</em> has plunged by more than half since 1991, the team found, despite successful <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrass-restoration-project-virginia-ecosystem-rapid-recovery">efforts to restore it</a> in some spots (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Higher water temperatures caused by climate change starve the plant by jacking up its respiration rate to burn more food than can be supplied by photosynthesis.</p>



<p>Conventional ecological wisdom holds that a more heat-tolerant species migrating from warmer southern waters would replace eelgrass. Instead, the big winner for now is wimpy-looking widgeongrass (<em>Ruppia maritima</em>). With hardy seeds, rapid growth rates and an ability to thrive in water about 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the optimal highest temperature for eelgrass (about 20° C), “widgeongrass almost literally has been waiting in the shallows for its opportunity,” Hensel says.</p>



<p>Fueled largely by widgeongrass,&nbsp;the total area of<strong>&nbsp;</strong>seagrass meadows in the Bay&nbsp;leapt from&nbsp;just over&nbsp;15,000 hectares in 1984&nbsp;to a record peak of nearly&nbsp;44,000&nbsp;hectares in 2018. The very thin and branchy leaves of widgeongrass may offer a better habitat than the eelgrass for tiny crustaceans like amphipods and isopods, Patrick suggests. But with its wispy structure and shallower roots, widgeongrass doesn’t provide as much biomass, and thus carbon storage, or as good a habitat for crabs and fish as taller, more luxuriant eelgrass does, says Duffy, who has dubbed eelgrass the “Serengeti of the sea.”</p>



<p>To some extent though, widgeongrass “is making up for the loss of the eelgrass,” Duffy says. To the researchers struggling to restore the Bay’s vegetation, the expansion of widgeongrass qualifies as a win. “When environmental conditions change, species that were always there may step up, change their roles, and do something really positive for the Bay,” Patrick says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seagrass swings</h3>



<p>Over the past four decades, warming temperatures have shifted the balance of seagrass species in Chesapeake Bay. Eelgrass (blue) has subsided while widgeongrass (green) has exploded. That surge drove total seagrass meadows (black) to nearly triple in area between 1984 and 2018. But in 2019, the meadows suffered the largest known crash when nutrient pollution wiped out about half of the widgeongrass.</p>

<p>These positives come with a big caution, though. Widgeongrass habitats are far less stable than their eelgrass predecessors. The largest recorded dieback of seagrass meadows in Chesapeake Bay history occurred in 2019, when half of the widgeongrass — about 9,000 hectares — vanished. Heavy springtime rains flushed massive amounts of nutrients and sediment into the Bay, causing algal blooms that blocked sunlight from reaching the plants’ short springtime leaves, the team found. The taller leaves of eelgrass, in contrast, reach closer to the surface, making that species less vulnerable to poor water quality conditions.</p>



<p>Similar shifts to more unstable and potentially less productive aquatic ecosystems are occurring all around the world, from Tampa Bay in Florida to the English Channel, as human influences and climate change enable weedy, more ephemeral plants to increase at the expense of the old growth, Duffy says. But the new study suggests that careful monitoring that identifies the individual species of plants, not just the total area of vegetation, then reducing the nutrient and sediment runoff reaching the most susceptible areas, may help mitigate the harm.</p>



<p>In the Chesapeake, that means targeting agricultural pollution flowing into the Bay from the Choptank River and in the Tangier Sound. While the new weedier species may not be as good as the original plants, “if we can get the right combination of environmental conditions, we can restore mature, functioning seagrass meadows in one or two decades,” Patrick says. “You can’t do that with any other ecosystem.”</p>

<p><strong>Good (for hyperkinesis) to the last drop </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavioral-sciences-127"><em>Science News, </em>July 14, 1973</a> </p>



<p>[Hyperactive] children are sometimes given amphetamines to calm them down.… [A researcher] took 11 such children off medication and gave them one cup of coffee at breakfast and lunch…. Teachers and parents rated the children as less hyperactive during the three-week period they were getting coffee instead of amphetamines.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder affects about 6 million U.S. children. Most medical professionals recommend managing symptoms with talk therapy and stimulant medications. For people with ADHD, stimulants boost levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain to improve <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-brain-differences-seen-between-girls-boys-adhd">impulse control, focus and working memory</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/17</em>). C­affeine also boosts dopa­mine, but evidence that coffee or other caffeinated foods relieve ADHD symptoms is sparse and inconsistent. </p>



<p>A few <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700297/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies in children with ADHD</a> hint that caffeine <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70037-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improves attention</a> and impulse control compared with no treatment, while other studies suggest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70037-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the opposite</a>. Pediatricians generally advise against giving kids caffeine due to its effect on sleep.</p>

<p>A journal for conference proceedings which published a duplicate article has updated the later version, after originally telling the researcher who noticed the duplication that the articles were different enough to warrant publishing both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, titled “Production and storage of polarized H2, D2, and HD molecules,” was published twice in the journal <em>Proceedings of Science</em>, in <a href="https://pos.sissa.it/324/033">2018</a> and in <a href="https://pos.sissa.it/346/099">2019</a>. The first version represented proceedings from a talk given at the 2017 XVII International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets &amp; Polarimetry in Kaist, South Korea; the second was from the 23rd International Spin Physics Symposium in Ferrara, Italy, held in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The later version has minor differences from the first, including more technical details about the study’s methods.</p>



<p><em>PoS</em>, which is run by the International School for Advanced Studies based in Trieste, Italy, functions as a repository for various conference proceedings. It is run by a small staff, and each submission is reviewed by an individual conference’s editorial board.</p>



<p>A researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, contacted <em>PoS</em> after coming across the two nearly identical versions of “Production and storage of polarized H2, D2, and HD molecules.” A journal representative first told the researcher that the journal would investigate the situation, then that “the contributions differ sufficiently in order to warrant both their publication,” according to an email seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-127412"></span>



<p>“Shocked and flabbergasted” by this response, the researcher contacted Retraction Watch about the duplication and the journal’s decision to keep both articles published. The researcher told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Proceedings of Science denied the fact that a gross plagiarism was published in their journal and actually found it to be “sufficiently different”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, Ralf Engels, the first author of the article, wrote that there was a simple explanation for the duplication. He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Both publications are proceedings of conference contributions. When I gave the corresponding talk on the first conference, I was asked to give the same talk at another conference too. For both conferences should write a proceeding and, thus, both proceedings are very similar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gabriella Furlan, a spokesperson for <em>PoS</em>, told us that the original complaint prompted the journal to review the journal’s policies, and eventually to begin working with the authors to update the second version of the article. This decision, Furlan said, was made shortly before we contacted them. She said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When the researcher raised concerns about the duplication of content, we conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and contacted the conference editors asking to carefully compare the two articles and analyze their content and structure. As a result, we acknowledge the lack of citation and therefore we are in the process of asking the author to revise the second contribution to include a precise reference to the first. In addition to it, since transparency is another PoS core value, we are asking them to add a description of the modifications introduced in the second contribution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics does not have formal guidelines for published conference proceedings, including regarding duplications. In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for COPE said there is currently a working group addressing this issue. A comment from a September 2022 COPE forum about<a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/forum-discussions/ethical-aspects-conference-proceedings"> ethical aspects of conference proceedings</a>, which does not represent official COPE guidance, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sometimes the same or very similar papers can be published in proceedings from multiple conferences which is counter to usual expectations of publication ethics (duplicate-redundant publication) in journals more broadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the absence of formal guidelines, <em>PoS</em> “has adopted an inclusive approach,” Furlan said.</p>



<p>Engels said he wasn’t aware the proceedings would be published in the same journal. At one point, he told us he had decided to request the retraction of the first version, but then said he would instead edit the second version of the article to cite the first and offer an explanation for the changes, as Furlan suggested.</p>



<p><em>PoS</em> said that in response to the researcher’s complaint, they had also decided to review their policies on duplicate publications from conference proceedings. <em>PoS</em> said they did not respond to the researcher in more detail or mention their intentions to review their policies because they decided to conduct this review shortly after sending their brief reply to the researcher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pdf of the 2019 version of the article now cites the earlier version and includes a note which reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The corresponding talk was also given at the PSTP2017 conference in Kaist, South Korea. Nevertheless, this proceeding includes recent developments and more technical details in subsection 2.1.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PoS</em> did not indicate that the first version of the article would refer to the second version in any way. Instead, they said, “it is essential that the second publication refer to the first one, as this ensures that the reader is informed about the main differences.” The first version of the article remains unchanged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither chairperson of the two conferences’ editorial boards have responded to an email from Retraction Watch.The lack of formal guidance around conference proceedings has contributed to the proliferation of not only duplicated papers, but low-quality and nonsensical publications. Retraction Watch<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/15/plague-of-anomalies-in-conference-proceedings-hint-at-systemic-issues/"> previously reported</a> on hundreds of proceedings from conferences put on by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers which show signs of plagiarism, citation fraud, and other misconduct.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-apex-predator-prey">This ancient, Lovecraftian apex predator chased and pierced soft prey</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the earliest apex predators, and perhaps the freakiest to ever haunt the sea, may have also been a delicate eater.</p>



<p>For decades, paleontologists have assumed that the long-extinct <em>Anomalocaris canadensis</em> — roughly translated as “the abnormal shrimp from Canada” — used two spiny appendages on its face to grab hard trilobites off the seafloor and crush and eat them. But a new analysis suggests the bizarre hunter may not have been up to the task. Instead, <em>A. canadensis</em> may have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0638" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swiftly hunted soft prey</a> in the water, researchers report in the July 12 <em>Proceedings of the</em> <em>Royal Society B.</em></p>





<p>“These were the orcas … the great whites of the time,” says paleontologist Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the study. <em>A. canadensis</em> was clearly adapted to be a top predator, he says, though it seems trilobites might have been too tough.</p>



<p><em>A. canadensis </em>reigned roughly 500 million years ago. With a body as long as a housecat, it was among the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-animals-have-bulked-ancient-eras">largest creatures</a> of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">Cambrian period</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/15; SN: 4/24/19</em>). Some researchers had suggested that it could have preyed upon another iconic Cambrian critter — the trilobite. Over the years, scads of fossilized injured trilobites have been unearthed, suggesting something had attacked them.</p>



<p>But paleobiologist Russell Bicknell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City had reservations. Trilobite exoskeletons were hard and thick, and no one had yet presented evidence that <em>A. canadensis</em> could break them.</p>



<p>So Bicknell and colleagues compared the flexible appendages to those of some modern arthropods and tested the primitive appendages’ toughness, range of motion and optimal swimming position via computer simulations.</p>

<p>The ancient spiky limbs would have been effective at grabbing prey, much like those of today’s whip spiders, the researchers conclude. But the extremities were probably too delicate to attack well-armored prey. Additionally, <em>A. canadensis</em> would have moved most efficiently when its appendages were outstretched in front, like Superman’s arms in flight, the team found.</p>



<p>Taken together, the results suggest that<em> A. canadensis</em> was best suited for chasing soft creatures swimming through the water and snagging them in its spiky clutches, Bicknell says. “That&#8217;s going to absolutely pincushion something soft and squishy.” </p>



<p>The findings also imply that even the earliest predators may have been specialized hunters, says evolutionary biologist Joanna Wolfe of Harvard University, who was not involved in the study. “These were complicated ecosystems, even though they&#8217;re really ancient.”</p>

The many innovative solutions, however, face limitations such as the sometimes prohibitive costs incurred during manufacturing and the need for personalised features and bespoke design. 3D printing is now commonly employed in the creation of medical devices and can provide effective solutions to both issues. The implementation of 3D printing comes with its own challenges, including selection of appropriate materials and durability of the product.<br />
The addition of the fourth dimension, time, into 3D printing can bring significant advancements in prosthetics. This state-of-the-art technology, with the capacity to alter the characteristics of prosthetic devices over time, will add tremendous value to the field.<br />
This <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/tdpp">Collection</a> welcomes submissions that bring together the use and/or development of 3D and 4D printing technologies and all aspects of the design, manufacturing and improvement of new and existing prosthetic and orthopaedic solutions. This includes dental prosthetics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tear-resistant-rubber-tough-tires">Tear-resistant rubbery materials could pave the way for tougher tires</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new material design could reduce pollution where the rubber meets the road.</p>



<p>Strategically <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding weak points along microscopic chains called polymers</a> actually makes them harder to tear, researchers report in the June 23 <em>Science</em>. Because polymers are used in car tires, the findings could help reduce plastic pollution as tires wear down over time.</p>



<p>When tires scrape against the road, they drop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-tires-and-brake-pads-produce-harmful-microplastics">tiny particles</a> of rubber and plastic polymers, which pollute waterways and contaminate the air (<em>SN: 11/12/18</em>). Every year, tires release an estimated <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/10/1265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 million metric tons</a> of these microplastics into the environment. Stronger polymers that break apart less easily could limit the amount of particles shed annually.</p>





<p>To make such tough materials, Stephen Craig, a chemist at Duke University, and colleagues added molecules called cross-linkers to the polymers. These cross-linkers connected jumbled-up polymer chains to their many neighbors, and they were specifically designed to break apart easily. At the microscopic scale, the polymers act like a tangle of spaghetti strands with the cross-linkers holding them all together and helping them retain their shape, says Craig’s collaborator Shu Wang, a chemist at MIT.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A rubbery plastic polymer with weak cross-linkers, shown on the left, requires more stretching force to tear than a similar polymer with stronger cross-linkers, shown on the right. Adding the weak cross-linkers to rubber could lead to tougher car tires.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the team stretched the polymer spaghetti, the individual cross-linkers broke easily, as expected. But the bulk material required more force to rip than they expected.</p>



<p>The secret to the increased toughness lies in the path the tear has to take, Craig says. The tear propagates through the easy-to-break cross-linkers rather than through the tougher polymer strands. Each broken connection follows the path of least resistance but dodging the long polymer strands means breaking many cross-linkers, which requires more stretching force overall.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time researchers have used weak connectors to make polymers stronger. But unlike in similar materials, the increased toughness doesn’t come at the expense of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1967.0160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other beneficial properties like stiffness</a>.</p>



<p>Craig says he hopes the findings will help extend the lifetimes of car tires and plastics, potentially limiting annual microplastic pollution.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780525657170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fires in the Dark</a><br><em>Kay Redfield Jamison<br>Knopf, $30</em></p>



<p>Mentally and spiritually devastated after surviving World War I’s combat horrors, British poet Siegfried Sassoon was treated for emotional wounds at a military hospital. He wrote a poem for his psychotherapist that included these lines: <br><br><em>Fires in the dark you build; tall quivering flames<br>In the huge midnight forest of the unknown</em></p>



<p>Kay Redfield Jamison takes the title of her new book, <em>Fires in the Dark</em>, from Sassoon’s vivid image of how medical psychologist, physician and anthropologist W.H.R. Rivers tended to his psychological war wounds. Jamison uses writings by both men to explore Sassoon’s therapeutic relationship with Rivers. Their story forms part of a deeper probe into how psychological pain can be healed and what it takes to be a great healer. Jamison writes movingly about topics ranging from the workings of ancient Greek healing temples to the tribulations of World War I nurses facing the limits of healing soldiers’ ravaged bodies and minds.</p>





<p>Jamison, a psychiatrist herself, has previously written about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pushing-mood-swings">her personal experience with bipolar disorder</a>, which informs this literary journey into healing (<em>SN: 4/8/00, p. 232</em>).</p>



<p>Since the dawn of humankind, certain individuals — who combine compelling personalities, a stout character and superior people skills — have stood out as healers of what Jamison has previously described as “unquiet minds.”</p>



<p>Effective healers accompany sufferers on a journey toward wellness, she writes. Healing tools include the deft use of suggestion, confession, memory, ritual and medicines. Healers find ways to provide consolation and hope, enabling their wounded charges to engage with meaningful work and find purpose in life.</p>



<p>That theme reverberates in Jamison’s account of how Rivers treated Sassoon, whose war reactions might today be diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. As an anthropologist, Rivers had learned about and witnessed healing rituals and supernatural beliefs of different cultures. He had written that “psycho-therapeutics would seem to be the oldest branch of medicine.”</p>



<p>Rivers struck colleagues and those he treated as forceful but caring, demanding but sympathetic. Sassoon wrote that he liked and trusted Rivers within minutes of meeting him. After listening to Sassoon relate his traumatic war experiences, Rivers focused on the soldier’s memory and imagination as key healing elements.</p>



<p>Rivers encouraged Sassoon to use poetry to memorialize friends and soldiers he had commanded but who had not survived. As verses of remembrance and grief accumulated, Sassoon achieved a measure of control over the war’s terror and futility. Feeling a sense of guilt and responsibility for soldiers still fighting, Sassoon returned to the war.</p>



<p>Psychotherapy as practiced by Rivers had roots in the powers of suggestion wielded millennia earlier by priests and sorcerers, Jamison writes. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks, for example, called on priest-physicians who performed early types of surgery, chanted against disease-causing spirits and used magic spells to amplify patients’ responses to medicinal potions.</p>



<p>Jamison includes a fascinating description of ancient Greek healing temples run by followers of Asclepius, the god of medicine. In settings designed to be peaceful refuges, individuals with mental maladies received a special herbal ointment made from imported ingredients. Sufferers were encouraged to enter meditative or hypnotic states and to tell their dreams to temple healers. Dream content guided treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>Therapists today practice a range of purely secular techniques, though they still hark back to the days of Asclepius, Jamison says. Scientifically supported approaches rest on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/questions-couch">a time-tested need for therapists to gain clients’ trust</a> and nurture self-understanding and hope for improvement (<em>SN: 11/5/05, p. 299</em>). That’s truer than ever in an era characterized by the well-funded promotion of medications and brain technologies over mere “talk” as keys to vanquishing mental problems.</p>



<p>As recently as the 20th century, Jamison writes, mental health clinicians emphasized general features of psychotherapy that promote healing. Psychiatrist and psychologist Jerome Frank, for instance, influentially argued in a 1961 book that any successful form of psychotherapy counteracts the demoralization of those who experience the world as chaotic.</p>





<p>Jamison also delves into examples of the healing powers of music, art, drama and public rituals of remembrance. She includes the poignant story of how, thanks to an Anglican army chaplain, remains of the Unknown Warrior came to be buried at Westminster Abbey in 1920 in a ceremony that lessened the postwar grief of people across Britain. Healers often find it difficult to untangle why their efforts sometimes light fires in the dark and other times fizzle out. Jamison’s stories of healing outline a process that’s still emerging from Sassoon’s huge midnight forest of the unknown.</p>

<p>Last month, a millipede expert in Denmark received an email notifying him that one of his publications had been mentioned in <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.1339/v1">a new </a>manuscript on <em>Preprints.org</em>. But when the researcher, <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/staffsnm/staff/?pure=en/persons/52118">Henrik Enghoff</a>, downloaded the paper, he learned that it cited his work for something off-topic.</p>



<p>Stranger still, the authors of the now-withdrawn preprint, a group of researchers in China and Africa, also referenced two papers by Enghoff that he knew he hadn&#8217;t written. It turned out they didn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had anything like this happen before,&#8221; Enghoff, a professor at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-127450"></span>



<p>Flabbergasted, Enghoff reached out to <a href="https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/201051">David Richard Nash</a> at the University of Copenhagen. A few months prior, Nash had been experimenting with <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT</a>, an artificial-intelligence chatbot, to see if it could be used to find scientific literature. He asked the bot to provide him with recent references on the butterfly species he works with. &#8220;It came back with 10 plausible-looking papers,” only one of which existed, Nash told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>After learning of Enghoff&#8217;s case, Nash emailed <em>Preprints.org</em>, a free preprint server owned by the scientific publisher <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/">MDPI</a>. He explained that he had looked up five random references in the preprint and found that all of them were fictitious. He also hinted that generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT could have been at work, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I suggest that you contact the authors directly and ask for an explanation (and hopefully a retraction and apology to the affected “authors” of these fake references), and also review your policies regarding accepting AI-generated textxs [sic] and references.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In correspondence shared with Retraction Watch, Lloyd Shu, preprints editor at MDPI, apologized for &#8220;the problems caused by this preprint&#8221; and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We will withdraw it immediately and add the authors of this preprint to our blacklist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Shu nor the preprint authors responded to our requests for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ioana Craciun, scientific officer at MDPI, confirmed that <em>Preprints.org</em> had “taken down a preprint that appears to have been generated using AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.preprints.org/about"><em>Preprints.org</em></a>’s website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All preprints undergo a short screening before being uploaded online. This process takes less than 24 hours in most cases. Screening includes checks for basic scientific content, author background, and compliance with ethical standards. It is carried out by the Preprints.org staff, with the support of active researchers and the Preprints.org advisory board.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Craciun explained that, because preprints do not undergo peer review, “it may be more likely for AI-generated content to be posted on preprint servers without detection.”</p>



<p>She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This case serves as a signal for us. It is not only a challenge for Preprints.org, but for all preprint servers, publishers, universities, and the scientific community as a whole. We will review our screening process to identify areas for improvement. While we can pay attention to the extremely low similarity rate of AI-generated content, we cannot rely solely on that. We hope that more powerful tools will be developed to assist in the detection of AI-generated content, and closer inspection of references may be necessary, as demonstrated in this case.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the title of the withdrawn preprint, &#8220;From Beneficial Arthropods to Soil-Dwelling Organisms: A Review on Millipedes,&#8221; is somewhat strange, its abstract appears cogent. (<em>Preprints.org</em> has removed the manuscript, but we have made it available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mawcha-et-al-2023.pdf">here</a>.) The main text is suspicious in places, however, including broken sentences such as these:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Another study by Enghoff [32] carried out on the distribution of millipedes in Southeast Asia, is known to have high levels of species richness and endemism. The distribution and ecology of millipedes and other arthropods, and notes that millipedes are found on all continents except Antarctica [48]. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;If it had gone into a journal, I would definitely be very worried,&#8221; Nash said. &#8220;Going onto a preprint server, I have to admit that slightly confirms some of my prejudice against preprint servers.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Note: The interview with Enghoff was conducted in Danish and translated by the writer, a native speaker.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-wind-antennae-whiskers-eyes">Rats sense the wind with antennae-like whiskers above their eyes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many rodents use whiskers to feel their way around their world. But rats appear to take this one step further, using special, antennae-like whiskers above their eyes to sense subtle air movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These long, thin hairs <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may help the rats detect the movements of predators or prey</a> in dark, cramped environments, researchers report July 6 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many studies of rodents have focused on the snout whiskers, says Ann Clemens, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh. But “there are a plethora of whiskers beyond the snout, on other parts of the face and the body.”</p>





<p>While working together on a research course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., Clemens and her colleagues noticed that some of the whiskers above rats’ eyes were particularly long and fine. The researchers wondered if these prominent, exposed hairs, known as supraorbital whiskers, could be used to detect wind.</p>



<p>“Wind is an important carrier of information about the environment in the form of odors, humidity and airflow, but has been barely studied by neuroscience,” says Matias Mugnaini, a neuroscientist at the Leloir Institute in Buenos Aires.</p>



<p>Mugnaini, Clemens and their colleagues compared how all the whiskers on rats’ heads behaved under different wind conditions. Supraorbital whiskers waggle more wildly under light breezes than other whisker types, they found. These light breezes are thought to more closely mimic typical air movement levels in the natural environment than strong winds.</p>



<p>High-powered X-rays showed that where a supraorbital whisker follicle meets a nerve, nerve cell projections are concentrated in a more circular structure than in other whiskers. So these whiskers may be highly sensitive to movement from many different directions, as you might see from the pushing action from wind, the researchers say.</p>

Mugnaini <em>et al</em>/<em>PLOS Biology</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous research</a> showed that trimming rats’ facial whiskers reduces the rodents’ ability to sense wind. But the new study suggests the whiskers above the eyes in particular are specialized, wind-sensing structures.&nbsp;In total darkness, the rats regularly turned toward where wind was blowing from, but when the team numbed the supraorbital whiskers with lidocaine, the rats turned less frequently.</p>



<p>“Our findings show that not all whiskers on an animal operate in the same way,” Clemens says.</p>



<p>Seals also have supraorbital whiskers that sense underwater flow patterns, Mugnaini says. Rats may use their wind-sensing whiskers to pick up the movements of predators or prey in the dark, the team suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It could be that an incoming animal is sensed through a subtle change in airflow,” Clemens says. “The rat would detect this and escape in time or attack their meal.”</p>



<p>It’s possible the whiskers could have multiple functions, says Mehdi Adibi, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the research. The hairs might detect vibrations from sound waves, for example, and could still play an important role helping rats navigate their surroundings using touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-round-new-measurement-matter-physics">Electrons are extremely round, a new measurement confirms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrons are really, really round.</p>



<p>A new measurement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms the subatomic particle’s spherical shape</a> to a record level of exactness, physicists report in the July 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That near-perfect roundness deepens the mystery behind how the universe came to be filled with matter as opposed to its counterpart, antimatter. Any asymmetry in the electron’s shape, namely the distribution of the particle’s electric charge, would point to a related asymmetry in the laws of nature, one that could explain this feature of the cosmos.</p>





<p>The measurement — of a property known in physicist-speak as the electric dipole moment of the electron — is twice as precise as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-shape-round-standard-model-physics">previous best measurement</a> of the electron’s shape (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>“I don’t think Guinness tracks this, but if they did, we’d have a new world record,” says physicist Tanya Roussy of the University of Colorado Boulder. The new measurement is so precise that, if an electron were the size of Earth, any asymmetry in its shape would have to be on a scale smaller than an atom.</p>



<p>To gauge the particle’s shape, Roussy and colleagues looked at whether electrons pivoted in an electric field. If electrons weren’t round but slightly egg-shaped, an electric field would exert a torque on them, much as gravity topples an egg standing on its end.</p>



<p>To see that torque, the team looked for changes in the energy levels of electrically charged molecules of hafnium fluoride. Any torque on the electrons would give the molecules different energy levels depending on which direction the “egg” was oriented relative to an electric field. The researchers found no difference in the molecules’ energy levels, confirming the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>At their most basic level, electrons are pointlike particles, without a definite size and shape. But in quantum field theory, electrons can be thought of as surrounded by temporary “virtual” particles that pop in and out of existence, giving each electron a spherical halo of electric charge. If that halo were found to be just slightly egg-shaped, that could point to how the universe became lopsided toward matter.</p>



<p>The Big Bang should have created matter and antimatter in equal parts — the two are mirror images of one another, with opposite electric charges. But matter in our universe is common while antimatter is scarce. Theoretical physicists have suggested that the existence of certain subatomic particles could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">tipped the balance toward matter</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). If those particles exist, they would also transiently appear and disappear around the electron, in such a way as to make it oblong.</p>



<p>Such particles would be so massive, and would therefore require so much energy to produce, that they would not be discoverable even at the world’s biggest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. That makes sensitive studies of the electron’s roundness an important test for particle physicists. And such experiments are poised to improve further, testing for particles of even larger masses, says physicist David DeMille of the University of Chicago, one of the scientists behind the previous best measurement of the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>For now, the new result shows no trace of any hidden particles, leaving unsolved the mystery of how matter gained the upper hand. And that, DeMille says, “leaves us with the question of what is out there.”</p>
