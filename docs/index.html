<p>The first weeks of the second Trump administration have brought unprecedented <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276342/nsf-freezes-grant-review-trump-executive-orders-dei-science">shock and awe</a> to science. In response, the leaders of the scientific community must cease their hand-wringing and align behind two strong approaches to dealing with the chaos: protest and candor.</p>



<p>I write these words as an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/16/guest-post-when-whistleblowers-need-lawyers/">attorney representing whistleblowers of scientific fraud</a>. Prior to law school, I was an <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/plastic-fantastic/">investigative journalist</a> focused on this same phenomenon. Today I represent scientists and technical experts independent of whether the falsified data they have uncovered support a political agenda. Twenty years of experience investigating, exposing and, when necessary, litigating cases of scientific fraud, has, however, led me to think in terms of a different kind of politics: the politics of nonconfirmatory data. Any research-based organization – a university, a healthcare provider, a laboratory or a corporation – faces a daily challenge from data gathered by scientists within that contradict the scientific hypotheses that are bringing in the money.</p>



<span id="more-130931"></span>



<p>Shock and awe disruptions exacerbate this problem.&nbsp; Too often in cases of scientific fraud, I observe a pattern of facts in which one or more experimentalists or data analysts were under severe pressure to deliver a result, while suffering from job insecurity. This can originate with the short-term nature of early career positions, or with a laboratory or institution being in a state of rapid change. Scientists do not do well facing existential job threats, because the natural pace of science is incremental. Facing setbacks in their experiments or their analysis, scientists need time to think, not reasons to hustle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only individual integrity, but professional and institutional stability, are necessary for most scientists to have a fully objective response when the data they have spent thousands of hours collecting imply that it is time to start over.&nbsp; Most also need a minimum level of job security to feel safe speaking up about failure to reproduce the results of others who are prominent in their fields of study.</p>



<p>Those who hold secure positions in scientific leadership must educate the public about this issue. Abrupt disruptions may deliver the advice a politician wants in the short term, but they will also fail to deliver the products the country wants, the medical treatments it needs and effective solutions to our problems. In the long term, the economy and technological progress will stall in a country where scientists are afraid to tell the truth about their data.</p>



<p>Yet this message is not enough. Leaders of the scientific community must also acknowledge missteps – both their own and of their peers. In my experience,&nbsp; many scientists who start out critical of the claims of others but who later identify as whistleblowers, even working with a lawyer such as myself, do so reluctantly only because authors, journals and scientific institutions have failed to respond to direct, well-evidenced allegations appropriately, or have <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-scholars-sue-their-accusers">made legal threats to silence them</a>.</p>



<p>Over time, denying and downplaying fraud is not only keeping my shop in business, it is producing a reserve of ammunition for those who misguidedly seek to control scientific results for political purposes.&nbsp; Scientific leadership must begin rolling, proactive disclosures of unaddressed issues now. They must also commit to proactively disclose new issues as they arise and before they escalate into weapons that the enemies of science can deploy against it. A whistleblower or a critic with concerns should be seen by leadership as an opportunity to stand tall and demonstrate an ability to listen and engage, not an inconvenient voice to muzzle.</p>

<p>Sage has retracted 416 articles from the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (JIFS),</em> which had a mass retraction of over 450 papers last August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the mass retraction last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">which we covered</a>, Sage paused publication of new articles from the journal, which it <a href="https://group.sagepub.com/press-releases/sage-grows-research-portfolio-by-acquiring-ios-press?_gl=1*1ol2wiz*_gcl_au*Mzc3MDgzNTM5LjE3MjQzMjE2OTg.*_ga*MTg4Mjc2NDY3MS4xNjQ5MTUxMTc3*_ga_60R758KFDG*MTcyNDMyMTY5OC4yMjUuMC4xNzI0MzIxNjk4LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;format=amp">acquired</a> when it bought IOS Press in 2023. The journal is now accepting new submissions, according to a Sage spokesperson. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219434">retraction notice</a> mentions citation and referencing “anomalies,” “incoherent, extraneous text and tortured phrases” and “unverifiable authors and reviewers,” among other signs of misconduct. “These indicators raise concerns about the authenticity of the research and the peer review process underlying the following articles. The Publisher regrets that these were not flagged during the journal’s editorial and peer review processes,” the notice reads.</p>



<p>Most of the researchers are from universities in India and China.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130922"></span>



<p>The notice also credits the Problematic Paper Screener’s (PPS)&nbsp; “Feet of Clay,” a detector which flags articles citing retracted material. The <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a> makes use of the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, which is now part of Crossref. Guillaume Cabanac, the sleuth who created the PPS, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">told Retraction Watch</a> in August the retractions “will feed the Feet of Clay even more” as information is collected by metadata providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, Feet of Clay had flagged 674 papers by <em>JIFS,</em> not all of which had been retracted. The number is now <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">up to 716</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to suspicion of “citation stacking,” Clarivate did not give the journal an impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in 2020</a>. And in 2021, IOS Press retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">nearly 50 articles</a> from <em>JIFS</em> for “literature sources that have no relation to the subject matter of the citing article,” according to the <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219218">notice</a>.</p>



<p>The editor in chief of the journal, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/langari-reza.html">Reza Langari of Texas A&amp;M</a> University in College Station,&nbsp; resigned last June. He told us at the time his decision was “due to differences of opinion on how to proceed.” He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Langari-comment.pdf">told us</a> growth in the AI field, which the journal covers, meant they received over 10,000 submissions in 2023 and rejected over 80% of them, “some of which were clearly manufactured by paper mills or else using AI tools.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage was aware of issues with the journal before acquiring IOS Press, the publisher’s spokesperson said in August:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For any new journal we take on, we use our resources to make sure we’re publishing at a high standard and in accordance with COPE. If there are any issues with specific journals then we’ll take corrective action as needed.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>Rebecca ‘Becca’ Williams is a computational neuroscience PhD student at the University of Cambridge and a passionate scientific communicator. As part of her public engagement extracurricular activities, Becca posts as a guest writer for the dementia researcher blog. In her </strong></span><u><a href="https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/blog-the-binary-of-science-femininity/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>most recent piece</strong></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>, Becca discussed the Women in Neuroscience UK 2024 Awards event: “It was an evening of celebrating some incredibly inspiring scientists, mentors, and activists. An evening of celebrating some incredibly inspiring women. Women in cerebral ear-rings and hot pink suits, neuron necklaces, and Purkinje dresses. Women whose innovation and impact were in no way diminished by their high heels”. </strong></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>Becca pondered her previously internalised perception of women and science being binary terms, with no overlap, and the connotations we attach to the word scientist: “analytical and rational, never emotional. Decisive and confident, never passive and soft. Because to be a scientist is to be independent, assertive, and logical. It’s a strange coincidence of fate that these are also traits typically ascribed to masculinity. And so, at a young age, and entirely subconsciously, I had to choose between being perceived as intelligent and being perceived as feminine”.</strong></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK) founder, Lizzie English, shares her response to Becca&apos;s blog post below:</strong></span></em></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_5020ca3eaa5e42d5872309b36bf30147~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Packing #WiNUKAwards2024 certificates and trophies"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">“I loved listening to this blog post and here’s why:</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">I packed remaining #WiNUKAwards2024 Women in Neuroscience UK certificates and trophies yesterday, ready for posting, but I nearly stopped myself doing pretty pink calligraphy, with femininity too often seen as unprofessional…</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">Women in Neuroscience UK branding is often hyper-feminine - more feminine than I express myself on most days. This may sometimes feel uncomfortable but is very much intentional.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">We see a professional world where masculinity is praised, whilst feminine appearances and attributes are too often frowned upon. Scientists might not always want to express femininity to the level of WiNUK’s branding (and my aim is certainly not to force this), but by being hyperfeminine, WiNUK shows everyone that it is possible to be both feminine and professional at the same time</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">It’s wonderful to hear that Women in Neuroscience UK is opening possibilities for scientists to be more confident in their gender expression at work  We should each feel able to show up as ourselves to achieve our best work ”</span></p>
<p><br /></p>

                <p>Author: Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager, PLOS</p>



<p>The latest version of the PLOS Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset extends its coverage to articles from January 1st 2018 to September 30th 2024. These data on 147,619 articles offer insights into open science practices over even more time and, with improved metadata integrated from <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a>, this and future versions of the data can be explored in new ways.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686.v9"><strong>Download the dataset</strong></a></p>



<p>This release includes the latest results for data and code sharing, and preprint posting. Previously released preliminary rates of study registration, and protocol sharing are also included.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="205" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1024x205.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22575" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1024x205.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-300x60.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-768x153.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1536x307.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-2048x409.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 1: Open Science Indicators for PLOS and comparator content by publication quarter Q1 2018-Q3 2024. Rates are given as a proportion of all published articles.</em></p>



<p>Previous versions of the dataset have included information on the country associated with the first corresponding author and disciplinary information taken from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/">MeSH terms</a> associated with the article on PubMed. In this version, the country and discipline metadata has been replaced with openly available data from OpenAlex to provide better coverage and standardised names across the articles (OpenAlex is an open and free bibliographic catalogue of scientific papers, authors and institutions). Users of OSI told us they needed different &ndash; including less granular &ndash; ways of exploring trends by discipline, and better coverage of geographic information across the comparator (non-PLOS) dataset.</p>



<p>This update allows a more thorough examination of trends by country as well as by discipline. The new fields included in OSI version 9 are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&ldquo;Primary Topic Field&rdquo; and &ldquo;Primary Topic Subfield&rdquo;&nbsp; &ndash; these give disciplinary information about each article from two levels of the <a href="https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/topics">OpenAlex Topic hierarchy.</a> The &ldquo;Primary Topic Field&rdquo; has 26 distinct categories, whereas the Subfield category gives more granular information.</li>



<li>&ldquo;Corresponding Author Country&rdquo; and &ldquo;First Author Country&rdquo; give the geographic location of the affiliation of the authors. Both are provided as &ldquo;First Author Country&rdquo;, which gives better coverage across the whole dataset than &ldquo;Corresponding Author Country&rdquo;. Where data for both are available, the country matches in &gt;95% of cases.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Examples of using the new metadata</strong></p>



<p>Example 1</p>



<p>Using First Author Country and looking at the data across the whole dataset, we can examine preprint posting trends in specific countries (Figure 2). In this case, trends for the USA, China and India can be observed. Not only do we see how the results change over time, with differences emerging post COVID pandemic, but also how rates differ between countries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-1024x630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22576" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-1024x630.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-300x185.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-768x472.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2.png 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 2: Preprint posting rate for three countries based on publication date of the article. 2024 is for Q1-3 only.</em></p>



<p>Example 2</p>



<p>Integrating disciplinary data from OpenAlex with the OSIs facilitates exploring the data with specific subject-based communities in mind. For example, the graph below (Figure 3) shows the rates of data shared in a repository by articles that fall into the Environmental Science primary topic for articles published in PLOS and articles published elsewhere. This allows us to get a better sense of the open science practices that are happening within different communities and therefore tailor solutions that work with existing community practices and norms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="629" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22577" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-1024x629.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-300x184.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-768x471.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3.png 1497w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 3: Rates of data shared in a repository for articles published PLOS articles versus those in the Comparator dataset where Primary Topic Field is &ldquo;Environmental Science&rdquo; based on publication year. 2024 is for Q1-3 only.</em></p>



<p>We hope that other users of the OSI data find these improvements useful and we welcome any feedback from and collaboration with users of the data.</p>



<p><strong>Future OSI releases</strong></p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll be making some changes to how, and how often, we release the OSI dataset in 2025 so that we best support the needs of OSI&rsquo;s users, and PLOS&rsquo; mission. As such there won&rsquo;t be an OSI public release in March/April 2025. Our commitment to <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889.v1">the OSI principles</a> including open data and methods for OSI results will not change. We&rsquo;ll share more information on our OSI plans later in 2025, and meanwhile feel free to <a href="mailto:lcadwallader@plos.org">contact us</a> with questions about using the data.</p>

<p>An English university has issued a finding of research misconduct against a former graduate student and is requesting 10 retractions of his published work, which they say bears the marks of being papermilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former student, Sameer Quazi, was enrolled at the University of Manchester in 2021 in the school’s “PGCert” program in clinical bioinformatics, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-quazi-81628811a/?originalSubdomain=in">LinkedIn profile</a>. The <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-certificate-diploma/#:~:text=A%20postgraduate%20certificate%20(PGCert)%20or,to%20complement%20your%20professional%20experience.">certificate program</a> sits between undergraduate and masters training. Quazi’s profile states he is currently enrolled in a master’s program in biomedical sciences at Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a January 30 <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/statement-on-research-misconduct/">statement from the university</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130918"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In September 2023 a concern was raised about the conduct of Sameer Quazi, Founder and CEO of GenLab Biosolutions Private Limited, India, regarding publication ethics.</p>



<p>The University of Manchester completed an investigation and reached a finding of research misconduct against Mr Quazi, who is no longer enrolled as a student at the University.</p>



<p>The investigation was conducted in accordance with the University’s Code of Practice for Investigating Concerns about the Conduct of Research.&nbsp; The Panel of Investigation noted no research in the papers was completed at The University of Manchester and found a large number of instances of other types of research misconduct in relation to Mr Quazi’s sole- and co-authored papers. The Panel of Investigation was of the view that Mr Quazi was running a paper mill.&nbsp; Publishers have been contacted to request retraction of ten papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Quazi has had at least <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dQuazi%252c%2bSameer">two papers retracted</a>, both published and pulled in 2023 from Frontiers journals.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioengineering-and-biotechnology/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1343822/full">notice</a> on one of those, “Application of biosensors in cancers, an overview,” which appeared in <em>Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology</em>, reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, concerns were raised regarding the contribution of the author of this article. Our investigation, conducted in accordance with Frontiers policies, confirmed a serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics; the article is therefore retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Quazi was the single author on that article and objected to the retraction, according to the notice. He was the second author on the other retracted paper, “New insights into molecular signalling pathways and current advancements in prostate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics,” from <em>Frontiers in Oncology</em>. The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1343833/full">retraction notice</a> is identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university does not identify the papers involved in the case. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Sameer+Quazi&amp;sort=date&amp;sort_order=asc">search of Pubmed</a> turned up 10 articles by Quazi published between 2021 and 2022, on topics ranging from the gut microbiome to AI in medicine. Quazi was the sole author on eight of those articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AB633BE8B28635C58A2C1E3D2A5E">April 2024 PubPeer comment</a> on one his papers notes likely “tortured phrases” and reference problems.</p>



<p>The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We emailed Quazi for comment but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Quazi <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7175352761415315456/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7175352761415315456%2C7175380990750507008)&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7175380990750507008%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7175352761415315456)">opined on LinkedIn</a> about university ranking systems, many of which rely heavily on citations – an easily gamed metric that is often the focus of paper mills:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While I appreciate the intention to challenge the current rankings system, boycotting may not be the most effective solution. It could be more beneficial to work towards improving the current ranking criteria or creating an alternative system that focuses on quality of teaching and research. Simply boycotting may not lead to the desired change.</p>

<p>In 2018, a biochemist in Scotland became aware of image irregularities in two of his papers through comments on PubPeer, each in a different journal. The researcher, <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/dario-alessi">Dario Alessi</a>, a professor at the University of Dundee, said he alerted his home institution immediately.</p>



<p>In July and October 2024, the papers were retracted.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FOI_296_Inke-Nathke-FEBS-letters.pdf">Emails</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FOI_296_Inke-Nathke_Biochem-Journ-letters.pdf">obtained</a> by <em>Retraction Watch</em> through a public records request show what happened in the intervening six years: Consecutive investigations by Dundee and a funder, then delays as the journals juggled conflicting narratives. In the meantime, the papers continued racking up citations.</p>



<span id="more-130908"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Alessi said he came across comments on Pubpeer in April 2018 “suggesting irregularities” in one of his publications. The comments raised concerns about two of his 2005 papers: “<a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2005.05.040">Role of the PDK1–PKB–GSK3 pathway in regulating glycogen synthase and glucose uptake in the heart</a>” published in<em> FEBS Letters</em>, and “<a href="https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/385/3/639/78666/Deficiency-of-PDK1-in-liver-results-in-glucose?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Deficiency of PDK1 in liver results in glucose intolerance, impairment of insulin-regulated gene expression and liver failure</a>” published in <em>Biochemical Journal (BJ)</em>.</p>



<p>In January 2019, following a preliminary investigation, the research integrity group at Dundee’s School of Life Sciences recommended a formal investigation, according to emails <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/inke-nathke">Inke Nathke</a>, the interim dean and top research integrity officer at the School of Life Sciences, sent to the journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group came to the conclusion there were “additional issues beyond those flagged on PubPeer at the time,” Alessi told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Alessi was also affiliated with the UK-based Medical Research Council (MRC), they undertook the second investigation. But appointing the investigation panel took two years – during which the COVID-19 pandemic happened. The panel began its work in July 2021 and in December 2022 determined the two papers be retracted. </p>



<p>Six months later, Nathke contacted the journals with the results of both investigations.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">She waited four months for a response. In an October 2023 email to Nathke, a <em>BJ</em> representative wrote that their office “has been contacted separately by the co-corresponding author on this publication … who has appealed the proposed retraction.” (The name of the researcher was redacted by the University of Dundee before they provided us the emails.)</p>



<p>We emailed both corresponding authors of the <em>BJ </em>paper, Calum Sutherland and Alfonso Mora, asking if they appealed the retraction. <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/calum-sutherland">Sutherland</a>, also a researcher at Dundee, responded, simply: “Not me, sorry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, Nathke referred to “an appeal by the first author.” In both papers, the first author is <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6397-4836">Mora</a>, a researcher at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares and Organ Crosstalk in Metabolic Diseases Group in Madrid, Spain, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54353-4">recent publication</a>. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaining author, presumably Mora, “did not think the MRC investigation was fair,” according to the Portland Press Editorial Office, which&nbsp; publishes&nbsp; <em>BJ</em>. Lapses in communication and disagreement over the text of the retraction notice&nbsp; — which remained unchanged, despite the co-author’s objections — delayed the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from complaints from Mora, <em>BJ</em> investigated the existence of the PubPeer comments Alessi said caused concern in 2018. No PubPeer comments on either the <em>BJ</em> or <em>FEBS </em>papers date before 2024; however, Alessi’s other works have received <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7D714F52420D956BEBA5CAD8FAD04F">comments</a> going back to 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails between <em>BJ</em> and Nathke reference Mora’s objections to the retraction, which we have&nbsp; not seen. Nathke wrote in the October 2023 email, in response to the appeal: “my view is that whether something has or has not appeared on PubPeer is not relevant. What is relevant is that issues discovered with data in the publication remain questionable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nathke told us: “With regards to the PubPeer alert that you cannot find, there are two possible reasons. I think some problems were discovered by the research integrity group in [the School of Life Sciences] when they started investigating, which were not on PubPeer, and (I do not know this) but it is possible that the MRC may have received independent report(s) directly.”</p>



<p>The Portland Press representative blamed the delay on the lack of comments posted about the paper on PubPeer,” and “the issues that were raised to us that were investigated were due to direct emails from the University of Dundee rather than via PubPeer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether or not PubPeer comments on the papers existed at the time, they do now. The <em>BJ</em> paper has two <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1E8D6C4D24F6B5FB3B900DF87FAA36">comments</a> published October 2024, after the paper had already been retracted, pointing out that the images were “Much more similar than expected.”</p>



<p>The <em>FEBS Letters</em> paper also has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9B1C4149398B76FC82516DCA8B9733">comments</a> from October 2024, underneath the announcement of the retraction. One says: “Much more similar than expected after vertical resizing.” Several simply contain links to announcements of the awards and grants Alessi has received in the past few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alessi didn’t respond to our questions about the PubPeer comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In December 2023, Nathke wrote in an email to the <em>BJ</em> editorial team that Alessi “kindly shared with me your update about taking the retraction forward.”</p>



<p>It still took more than six months. On July 25, 2024, after several follow-up emails from Nathke, a staff member at the journal said the retraction was “just in the process of being published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, the <a href="https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/481/15/981/234735/Retraction-Deficiency-of-PDK1-in-liver-results-in">retraction</a> notice appeared, stating:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article is being retracted from the Biochemical Journal at the request of the authors. The authors willingly supported independent investigations, which have confirmed concerns regarding image duplications in Figures 3B and 5B in the original publication. The authors apologise for the inconvenience caused. The Editorial Board agrees with the decision to retract.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for the seven-month delay after agreement that the retraction would move forward: “Unfortunately, this delay was caused by unforeseen changes in staffing arrangements,” the Portland Press Editorial Office told us in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, at <em>FEBS Letters,</em> things were quiet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2023, soon after Nathke sent her initial email requesting the retraction, an “Image Integrity Analyst” was assigned. “This may take some time to look into,” an unnamed editorial assistant said in an email obtained through a public records request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After over a year of the journal not responding and Nathke’s repeated follow-up emails, a representative for the publication said they had “initiated an investigation, but recently had some staffing changes so things may have gotten side-tracked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was finally retracted in October 2024, “by agreement between the authors; the journal Editor-in-Chief, Michael Brunner; FEBS Press; and John Wiley and Sons Ltd.,” according to the <a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.15044">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal was contacted by a representative of the research integrity group at the authors&#8217; institute, since an institutional investigation revealed inappropriate splicing and duplication of image sections within Fig. 2A, B and Fig. 3A. Consequently, the conclusions of the paper are substantially compromised, and the institute has recommended the paper to be retracted. The editors of the journal agree with the retraction based on the institutional investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we asked for clarification regarding staffing issues, a representative from the editorial office told us the retraction “was indeed delayed, due to internal miscommunication during a time of staff turnover. Nevertheless, the article has been retracted, and we feel that the matter is now closed.”</p>



<p>This case is hardly the first time we’ve seen a protracted retraction. Last year, for example, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/17/a-universitys-three-year-battle-to-retract-papers-with-fake-data/">covered</a> the University of Maryland’s mission to retract a researcher’s faked data, and in 2020, philosophy professor Michael Dougherty <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/30/a-two-year-drama-the-anatomy-of-a-retraction-request/">detailed</a> his “two year drama” to get a plagiarized paper retracted.</p>



<p>In the six years it took for the papers to be retracted, the paper in <em>FEBS Letters </em>was cited 19 times and the <em>BJ </em>paper 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. They have been cited 78 times and 71 times in total, respectively.</p>



<p>The retraction “took longer than anticipated due to the involvement of multiple institutions (UoD, MRC, Journals) and an appeal by the first author,” Nathke told us, but she still defended the journals: “I would like to emphasise that in my experience over the last year, journals are responding and take action very quickly.”</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Oluwatomi ‘Tomi’ Akingbade, Advisor for WiNUK, is the Founder of the </span></span><u><a href="https://www.bwisnetwork.co.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Black Women in Science (BWiS) Network</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. The global BWiS Network is volunteer-led and aims to provide a safe space for Black women to seek advice and support in their career journeys and through changing legislation, generating tangible change in the STEM industry. Tomi’s role involves running the day-to-day activities of the BWiS network and managing a team of amazing volunteers that help to keep the important work running.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi graduated from BSc Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham, before becoming a Medical Laboratory Assistant for the NHS and then a Research Technician at UKDRI Imperial Care Research and Technology Centre. She is now completing her PhD at the University of Cambridge, studying the mechanisms of inflammation caused by aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi was asked to be Head Judge because “she is a passionate advocate for equality and representation in the scientific landscape, with a strong commitment to supporting underrepresented groups”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Presenting our winner of the Inclusive Workplace Development Award:</strong></span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Associate Professor Rebecca ‘Becky’ Trueman works at the University of Nottingham and was the winner of the Inclusive Workplace Development award! Becky’s role is split between teaching and research, both of which she enjoys. Studying Neuroscience as an undergraduate at Cardiff University, Becky’s research career began with work on Huntington’s Disease, before moving into stroke research later on. More recently, her work has been focused on drug discovery for Myotonic Dystrophy, another genetic disorder, and she is working within a fantastic multidisciplinary team. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky was nominated for this award because she strives to create an inclusive environment in her research group, believing that science is a team sport. Within her teaching endeavours, Becky has worked on a number of initiatives to improve inclusivity, including work with Emily Herrod (British Neuroscience Association, BNA, Placement student 2021), Anne Cooke (BNA), Hannah Thurgur (BNA) and Emily Sena (University of Edinburgh) to develop anti-racist tools for Neuroscience, helping to develop a Faculties Inclusive Curriculum toolkit.</span></span></p>

<p>Dr Katie Long is a Research Fellow at King’s College London, where she started her own lab with an MRC Career Development Award in 2019. Her lab investigates how the human brain develops to the right size and shape. She works with many fantastic basic science and clinical colleagues to address these questions in human foetal development using an interdisciplinary approach – from biomechanics and computational modelling to cell biology and immunology.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie studied Biomedical Science at Sheffield University before going on to do a PhD in developmental neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh (with Charles ffrench-Constant), exploring how brains are ‘built’ during development. She then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden (with Wieland Huttner) where she began working on brain development in different species, becoming interested in how brains have evolved into such unique anatomical structures.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie was nominated for this award because diversity is a key part of her research, from the experimental approaches she uses to the people she works with. Her commitment to an inclusive and open workplace includes, but is not limited to: hosting ethics lab meetings, encouraging open dialogue in her weekly lab meetings, highlighting important equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) topics, prioritising the career development of her lab members, providing a platform for anonymous feedback, establishing a mentoring programme and collaborating on Routes Collective. This is an organisation dedicated to supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women in London.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Kamar ‘Kam’ Ameen Ali has been a Senior Lecturer in Biomedical Science at Teesside University since 2022. Kam splits her time between teaching and pursuing an independent programme of dementia research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam gained her PhD in behavioural neuroscience and neurobiology at Durham University, using an animal model to understand complex forms of memory. Her first postdoctoral position at the University of Sheffield investigated cognitive and neuropathological changes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Following this, Kam decided to gain some experience outside of academia, taking up a position as regional programme manager for the NC3Rs, a research funder in the UK. Gaining this type of experience helped her to reflect on her career and fuelled her decision to return to academia. Kam then took two successive postdoctoral positions, firstly at Newcastle University, looking at the relationship between stroke and dementia using human post-mortem brain tissue, and then at the University of Glasgow looking at the relationship between traumatic brain injury and dementia, again using human post-mortem brain tissue. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam was asked to be a judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she is a passionate advocate for academic researchers, and regularly contributes to the Dementia Researcher Blog to share her insights on life as a researcher. She is also a committed mentor as part of the BNA Scholars Programme and through ARUK’s cross centre mentorship scheme. </span></span></p>

<p>Jo completed her undergraduate medical training at Bristol University, where she was fortunate to receive MRC funding for an intercalated BSc. This confirmed her passion for immunology and medical research. So, after initial postgraduate medical training in the Southwest, in 2003 she moved to Cambridge to study for a PhD with Professors Alasdair Coles and Alastair Compston, working on a novel immune therapy for MS (Campath-1H – now licensed as Lemtrada). She thought the project was incredible, with a fantastic supervisor and research team.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Following Jo’s PhD, she returned to full-time neurology training for a few years before being appointed as a Clinical Lecturer in Neurology – a role made possible by a newly established national scheme. This allowed her to develop her research ideas and to generate the data needed to secure a Wellcome Trust Intermediate Clinical Fellowship, which provided the time and funding she needed to establish her own lab. After her fellowship, she was appointed as an Assistant Professor, and later promoted to Associate Professor, the role that she currently holds. Jo was awarded tenure last year. Over the years her group has grown; Jo now leads an outstanding team of talented individuals including a lab manager, five post-doctoral researchers and six PhD students. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jo was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because “she is not only inspiring as a scientific leader in her field, she is an exceptional leader with a true dedication to mentoring and empowering the next generation of scientists”. Jo&apos;s lab truly celebrates an inclusive environment, championing gender and racial equity both in the lab and the wider department: “She ensures everyone feels welcome, is given support (both career and more broadly) and she stands out in her support of early-career researchers, whatever their chosen career path, after their time in her lab”. She leads the EDI group in her department, which has included sessions on parental leave, and actively promotes the representation of women in neuroscience through organising, supporting and participating in conferences, workshops, and outreach efforts.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Hilary Richardson is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. Most of her research examines the neural correlates of social cognitive development in childhood. She is interested in the development of brain regions that take on particular cognitive functions, and the role of intrinsic and experiential factors on this development. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, she worked as a research assistant in a developmental psychology lab led by Professor Henry Wellman and contributed to studies on children’s ‘theory of mind’ development (‘theory of mind’ describes the human ability to reason about others’ internal mental states – their beliefs, desires, and emotions). When Hilary graduated from university, she took a full-time research assistantship position at MIT; this position provided her with more experience in development social cognitive neuroscience research,using fMRI as a key method. She stayed at MIT to complete her PhD in Neuroscience (with Professor Rebecca Saxe) and then completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (with Professor Charles Nelson). During the fellowship, Hilary learned how to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to study social brain development in young children. Hilary started as a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at the University of Edinburgh in 2020.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary was nominated because she is a dedicated mentor, supporting her most senior PhD student through two first-author publications, a prior MSc student with a first-author publication, four undergraduate/MSc students to obtain PhD positions and a postdoctoral researcher to a Lectureship position. She tailors her advice to suit each of her mentees and makes professional development a priority in her lab meetings and one-to-ones. Hilary promotes an inclusive and supportive environment by organising group activities with low/no financial costs, hosting open lab meetings, and celebrating both small and big achievements through announcements in monthly lab meetings. </span></span></p>

<p>Dr Emma Cahill has been a Lecturer in Neuroscience at the University of Bristol since 2021, where she teaches undergraduate courses on the brain, neuropharmacology and behaviour, as well as leading a research team conducting  experimental work on the neurological mechanisms underlying memory.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her undergraduate degree was in Neuroscience, from Trinity College Dublin, where she first discovered her love for lab work (her summer project investigated how exercise could enhance object recognition memory in rats!). Emma then travelled to France for her Masters and PhD research. Her PhD programme was for international students, so she met people from lots of different countries and made lifelong friends. Her PhD thesis was on understanding the effect of cocaine on the NMDA-type glutamate receptor and Dopamine type 1 receptor and involved mostly wet-lab work and cell culture. It had ups and downs, but Emma recalls enjoying working in a team and leading a research project to completion. She also got her French up to scratch and started teaching in the University Paris VI.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Post-PhD, Emma decided she wanted to continue to study glutamate and dopamine interactions, but this time in the context of fear memories. She was aiming to secure a post-doctoral position, and she reflected on how she “pretty much stalked relevant groups at big conferences” and managed to secure a position with a team focused on behaviour analysis in Cambridge. As a postdoctoral researcher, Emma continued to teach and perform experiments on how dopamine regulates fear memory persistence. She obtained her own research funding from the BBSRC and an Industry collaborative grant, so she stayed in Cambridge on a temporary lectureship for three years, during which time her first PhD student started. These grants helped Emma to pave the way for her own research that she now continues in Bristol.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Emma was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ for her investment in the scientific development of her mentees, sharing curated opportunities, facilitating networking and assisting in the gain of a wide variety of skills. She is incredibly inclusive of all students, believing in them equally, treating them as individuals and never assuming ability. Her nominator particularly appreciates that “personal flair is always encouraged and you never feel as if you’re being pushed into a mould” and truly believes that “neuroscience, and science at large, would be vastly improved if more people mentored like Emma”.</p>

<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Importance of Mentorship</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In our research roles, it can often feel as though we are being stretched too thin, with teaching, meetings and all the other essential tasks required of us! Trying to fit being a mentor into our busy schedules can be incredibly difficult, but it is one of the most invaluable uses of your time. There’s a reason that universities often have mentorship schemes for individuals all the way from undergraduate students up to Professors - there’s always something we can learn or teach. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi was in agreement and also recognised that everyone’s journey is different, even if we end up in similar positions eventually. She remarked that mentorship is important because “it allows people to expand their knowledge - it’s a true personification of “a problem shared, is a problem halved”.” Tomi also recognised that mentorship opens the door to sponsorship opportunities, which are an “ever-growing important part of scientific career progression.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky has been lucky enough to consider many wonderful people to have been mentors throughout her career, sharing that they are the people “who give great practical advice and push you to do things you didn’t think you were quite ready for, and the ones who are there for fantastic emotional support when nothing seems to be working.” She reflected that she has always tried to “search out mentors who hold similar values to [her] and strive to create a positive research culture” and that mentors are “hugely important to help you navigate the rocky road of academia”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie shared that we are not always the best at providing guidance and support for ourselves, instead we are “often much better at seeing the good in other people and their work than we are at seeing our own. Having a mentor (or better yet more than one!) is so important to help you see your own strengths and to navigate your career in a way that you enjoy”. It is equally as important to help those you mentor to do the same. Being a mentor to others can highlight just how critical we can all be of ourselves sometimes. Having that outside perspective really can make all the difference.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, Kam commented that “mentorship is important now more than ever, because we know that women and people from under-represented groups face structural inequalities in academia and are disproportionately affected by things such as precarious contracts and work casualisation”. She explained that mentorship is an “effective way of supporting early- and mid-career researchers through providing guidance and enabling them to develop and make choices that will allow them to progress in their careers”. Whilst Kam has tried to model many of the skills and qualities she sees in her mentors, she acknowledges that “it’s important to be flexible and tailor your mentorship for the needs of each mentee”. After all, we’re all different and require different types of support!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo has learned that mentorship is a dynamic, two-way process, stating that “mentors provide guidance, but they also learn from their mentees. Effective mentorship requires active listening, tailored support, and encouragement of independence”. She highlighted how although it is tempting to solve every problem brought to you, “often it is just helpful for someone to be able to talk issues through. As a mentee, I’ve benefited from mentors who not only provided technical expertise but also encouraged me and helped me navigate career challenges”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary asserted, “Mentorship is hard! It is a skill to be continually refined”. Recognising how crucial supporting and advising others is, she observed that mentorship is the part of her job that feels most impactful: “No one is an island in academia; my mentors provided me with training and access to opportunities that changed the way that I think and helped me define and push me towards my professional goals”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma recognised that being a mentor has not only benefited her mentees, but has also helped her to develop new ways to manage herself, saying “it’s always a two-way process and there is something to be gained by both mentee and mentor.” She shared that being a mentor involved being flexible and adapting your approach, depending on the mentee’s requirements, as “there is not a one-fit rule either. As a mentor, you may need to adjust your approach for different situations or different persons, and your own experience might not be relevant. So, it helps to be flexible. In the same way, search out different mentors for different aspects of support.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Essential Advice for Early Career Researchers</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Since we all have to start somewhere, we asked our seven neuroscientists to give some useful words of advice to the early career researchers out there:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wants you to remain authentic and to ask for help (because it’s OK not to know everything!). She also imparts that no goals are “too big” - set goals that you truly want to achieve!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky would like you to “believe in yourself, do not be afraid to take up space, your thoughts and opinions are valid. Find mentors – they don’t have to officially be mentors and don’t need to be in your field – but people who you can knock on the door of and will reassure you when you need it, push you to take those next big steps and help you find the connections and network you need”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie acknowledges that “research can be such a fun and rewarding career path, despite the challenges” and recommends that you “find the things that you enjoy, the questions that you love to work on, the surprise directions that excite you and the people who will support and motivate you. You may find these things in places you weren’t expecting to, so be open to new directions and opportunities to enjoy what you do”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam shares the advice that she always gives to ECRs: “Have an idea of what you’re interested in, but keep your mind open to different opportunities that come your way. If you follow what you’re interested in, you can’t go wrong, but be open for that to change. In academia we develop such a variety of skills, and we have a range of different career options open to us because of that. Even if you decide to pursue one option, you are not committing yourself to that path forever. More and more people are moving between academic and non-academic jobs, and employers are increasingly seeing the benefit of researchers who have worked across sectors”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For Jo, prioritising “building a strong network, collaborations and mentorship” is one of the most invaluable things you can do throughout your career. “Be proactive in seeking opportunities, but also learn to say no sometimes to protect your time. Resilience is key; setbacks are inevitable in research, but they offer valuable learning experiences. Finally, advocate for yourself - whether it’s for funding, authorship, or career progression, don’t be afraid to make your contributions and ambitions known!”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary emphasises the importance of pursuing questions that “excite you, with people who challenge and support you. Scientific outputs take a lot of time and effort; being genuinely interested in ‘the answer’ that a particular project provides is a good sign that a project is worth doing”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma stressed the value of some inner reflection: “Know what works for you and what you need help with, [so that you can] search out people who are excited by your science”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We also chatted to them about their thoughts and feelings surrounding their award category.</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wanted to be Head Judge for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’ because she thinks it is great to acknowledge the work of others; “Often this work is done without reward, whilst the nominees do this work without expectation, it is wonderful to be part of highlighting these individuals”. Along with her panel of judges, Tomi selected Becky Trueman and Katie Long as the finalists. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite all of the fantastic work Becky has done to create a supportive environment for her team, she remarked that she was “surprised [to be nominated], and to be honest did not feel deserving, as much of [her] work to create a more inclusive environment has been done with others. I want to acknowledge the many incredible individuals I&apos;ve had the privilege to collaborate with in my inclusivity work, as well as those whose open conversations, social media posts, books, and other media have made me consider my own biases. A significant number of these have been women from minoritised groups, whose contributions have been instrumental in driving progress in this area. As we continue to work to improve inclusion for women in our field, it’s crucial to recognise the importance of intersectionality. Different groups experience unique and often compounded barriers to advancement, and we must be mindful of these nuances.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I would not be here if it was not for the work of others, and to name a few key people:  Errolinda Ward, who started the inclusive curricula project within my School; Yvonne Mbaki and Rakesh Patel, who led our faculty toolkit; and the fantastic Emily Sena, University of Edinburgh, who suggested we approach the BNA when I was discussing resources for decolonising Neuroscience teaching with her. And all the teams who worked with me on these projects, along with the groups of students who have helped co-create resources”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie was really grateful to be nominated for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’: “I’m very lucky to have the support from my colleagues, mentors and team to help make our environment more inclusive, and to have seen some fantastic examples of improving inclusivity, diversity and accessibility of science, many of them driven by amazing women that I work with. They are an incredibly inspiring group and I hope together we can continue to help show that science is a space for everyone”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam made the decision to be Head Judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she “fully supports the work of WiNUK and thought it was an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of some outstanding female neuroscientists and provide greater visibility for them and their work”. Kam and the rest of the judges selected Jo, Hilary and Emma as the finalists.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo remarked that she was “Delighted!” to be nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’, explaining that she “had no idea [she] had been nominated - the first I heard was when I received an invitation to the awards ceremony saying I’d been short-listed. I’m incredibly grateful to those who took the time out of their busy lives to put me forward.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary also felt “grateful and honoured [to be nominated]! I’m so lucky to work with my team”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As did Emma, who was “really happy and appreciative of the effort of a nomination” and “was excited to meet other people through the network too”.</span></span></p>

<p>The editor-in-chief of a journal updated a retraction notice to acknowledge the data in the paper were “completely plagiarized” following allegations in a letter to the editor that were the subject of a Retraction Watch post last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original retraction, requested by the authors, cited only “major errors in data.” The <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/IJCCM/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24548">notice</a> for the October 2023 paper, which is signed by the <em>Indian Journal for Critical Care Medicine (IJCCM) </em>editor-in-chief Atul Kulkarni, now reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following scrutiny of the article further and other facts brought to the notice of the IJCCM, I have decided to change the reason for the retraction. This article is withdrawn after having been found that the data was completely plagiarized (in toto) from the work of another researcher.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-130900"></span>



<p>The undated notice was updated January 23, a day after our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/22/researcher-alleges-group-stole-thesis-data-presented-at-conference/">reporting</a> about the journal noted that a letter to the editor of the journal had claimed that the work had been stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to Sundara Kannan, the researcher mentioned in the notice who wrote the <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24766">letter to the editor</a> in November 2024, the researchers had plagiarized the data from his 2022 post-graduate <a href="https://www.eventscribe.net/2023/UltraCon/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1195173&amp;mode=presinfo">thesis</a>. The data were presented at a 2022 conference, which required electronic submission to the India Society for Critical Care Medicine, an organization associated with <em>IJCCM, </em>according to their <a href="https://www.isccm.org/">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Kulkarni or managing editor Prashant Kaushik responded to our immediate request for comment. Neither did Kannan nor the paper’s corresponding author, Nitesh Gupta.</p>

                Cricket frogs were once thought to hop on the water’s surface. They actually leap in and out of the water in a form of locomotion called porpoising.

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is pleased to once again partner with the Einstein Foundation Berlin for this awards program. Watch this space in the coming weeks for profiles of last year&rsquo;s finalists prior to the award ceremony of the 2024 winners in March. Below is the Einstein Foundation&rsquo;s announcement calling for entries.</p>



<p>The annual &euro;350,000 <strong><em>Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</em></strong><em> in cooperation with the </em><strong><em>QUEST Center for Responsible Research at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charit&eacute; (BIH) </em></strong>is inviting applications and nominations again.</p>



<p>The international award is open to any researcher, or group of researchers, institution, organization, and early career researcher around the globe whose work helps to fundamentally advance the quality, transparency, and reproducibility of science and research.</p>



<p><a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/for-applicants-nominators">&rarr; Submit online</a></p>



<p><strong>The deadline for entries is April 30, 2025 (10:00 pm UTC).</strong> The awardees will be announced by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>The award recognizes successful candidates in the following three categories:</p>



<p><strong>Individual Award (&euro;150,000):</strong> Individuals or small teams who have outstandingly contributed to fostering research quality can be nominated. Nominators are strongly encouraged to consider a diverse set of criteria, including gender, race/ethnicity, geography, and career stage.</p>



<p><strong>Institutional Award (&euro;100,000):</strong> Governmental and non-governmental organizations, institutions, or other entities that have notably enhanced research quality can apply or be nominated. Successful governmental organizations or institutions will not receive any funds in addition to the award itself.</p>



<p><strong>Early Career Award (&euro;100,000):</strong> Individuals or teams can submit a project proposal that seeks to foster research quality and value. Eligible candidates must hold a doctorate or have equivalent research experience and should have been an independent researcher for no longer than five years. In the case of a team entry, the majority must be Early Career Researchers.</p>



<p>In 2024, Dutch microbiologist and science whistleblower<strong> Elisabeth Bik </strong>won the Individual Award. Bik has uncovered the use of fraudulent or erroneous data for more than 7,600 scientif&shy;ic papers and has shed light on the practice of selling authorship for fabricated studies. &nbsp;The Institutional Award went to <strong>PubPeer, </strong>a platform for rapid post-publication review and discussion of published scientific data which helped identify flaws in the work of eminent scientists, combatted fraud, and fostered the emergence of an international, multidisciplinary community of research integrity experts. The Early Career Award was won by<strong> PixelQuality</strong> the project led by <strong>Christopher Schmied </strong>and<strong> Helena Jambor</strong>. The team aims to improve scientific image reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2025/01/24/2025-agency-gained-and-lost/">2025: Agency gained and lost</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve had even a passing glance at tech journalism over the past few months, you know the top buzzword for AI in 2025 is <em>agentic</em>. Agentic AI (according to many think pieces and press releases at least) is going to revolutionize industry. It’s going to streamline complex pipelines and maximize efficiency. It will make corporations smarter, better, faster, and for cheaper. What makes agentic AI so powerful? Agentic AI can take action. These models—equipped with language modules, external databases, and ‘chain of thought’ reasoning—are designed to set goals, make plans, and execute actions. As a result they can have real impact in the world.</p>



<p>But what about us?</p>



<p>2025 is not just the year of agentic AI but also the start of a second Trump administration.  In the short time since the Nazi-salute-containing inauguration day, the administration has enacted a slew of executive orders impacting everything from prescription drug prices to offshore drilling. ICE agents are conducting raids in previously safe spaces like churches and hospitals and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/24/ice-raid-newark-new-jersey-immigration-us-citizens">sweeping up US citizens in the process</a>. Government employees are actively encouraged to snitch on their peers. Scientists are being silenced and their funding requests halted or even canceled. Combined with the legacy of the first Trump administration, we are currently facing an upheaval in our access to everything from healthcare to voting to clean energy.</p>



<p>Each of these efforts constricts the space around every one of us, making our possible set of actions smaller and smaller. Thinking of expressing an opinion on diversity at work? Be careful, your co-worked may report you. Want to attend a Spanish mass in Chicago? They’re canceled, for fear of raids. Need to look up a fact about climate change or Jan. 6 investigations? The government websites are gone. </p>



<p>The result (and intention) of these rules and actions are to create a learned helplessness in us&#8212;to reduce our own sense of agency. And in fact we see signs of it working. Voter turnout dipped by about 5 million people in 2024 compared to 2020. The Women’s March and other protests that mobilized hundreds of thousands after the first Trump inauguration dwindled to a much smaller trickle this year.</p>



<p>Even the simple act of social media activism has been constrained. The owners of the largest information sharing channels in the world sat as esteemed guests at the inauguration, and their actions within their companies suggest the invitation was a welcome one. X (formerly twitter) won’t be of much use unless the actions you want to take are to the right. Threads has always been clear that it is not interested in political content, preferring to support the brand-rot banter of social media interns at large corporations instead. And should you manage to actually get a useful and actionable post out, say about how women can access Plan C, onto Instagram or Facebook, it will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/instagram-facebook-abortion-pill-providers.html">taken down</a> before many people can see. </p>

<p>So it seems the same people who want to push AI agents on us in their tech also want desperately to remove our own agency in real life. Wouldn’t Instagram be a nicer place if all the pesky, politically-motivated humans just sat back and observed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/meta-ai-powered-instagram-facebook-profiles">(fake) actions of AI-generated social media accounts</a>? Perhaps the writers of Wall-E had the most accurate take on the future: an Earth so covered in trash it is abandoned, but nobody really cares because they’re given a constant stream of personalized entertainment without having to lift a finger, or even make a decision. Leave the agency to the robots. </p>



<p>The truth is, it can actually be a lot more fun to be an observer than an agent. I know, because I spent much of my life not feeling like an agent at all. Perhaps because I grew up in a cornfield-filled suburb where nobody really did anything that mattered, I never expected I would either. And so I simply observed. I observed the physical world and human behavior and patterns of thought. And this turned me into a scientist. But even doing science can feel like not really <em>doing</em> anything. A lot of academic scientists joke about getting a “real job” some day.</p>



<p>But through a combination of events personal, professional, and political, my perspective began to change. When my dad died shortly before I finished my PhD I was confronted with the uncomfortable possibility that I was now the adult in the room. When the pandemic struck and global chaos abounded I realized that people in power are—terrifyingly—just like me. And when I published a book and eventually heard from young people that this book impacted them, sometimes to the point of changing their careers, I realized that I was already acting in the world. And so I decided to take on the identity of an agent more strongly.</p>



<p>And this is how I know that living as an agent is both essential and life-giving, and also an unbearable burden. With agency comes responsibility. If you have the power to change the world then why aren’t you? ‘Can’ quickly becomes ‘ought’. Even after deciding to <a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2022/10/19/an-introduction-to-the-lindsay-lab-what-we-are-researching-and-why/">shift my career towards climate change</a> (an agentic move if I ever made one), I still wonder if I’m doing enough. Even when I became directly involved in political campaigning (including overcoming my millennial phone-phobia to make calls for the Harris campaign), there was always the sense that I could have, and should have, done more. If modern AI agents had to experience<em> true </em>agency, with the moral weight that is intrinsically tied to it, their chains of thought would snap under the pressure.</p>



<p>Counterintuitively, this moral weight can feel even more acute the more constrained your action space is. I don’t have billions of dollars to invest in clean energy and so instead I agonize over every decision to take a flight or use a disposable cup. There is a stifling sadness in these small actions. When those with power take action free from moral constraints, you can feel like an ant moving grains of sand in the shadow of a bulldozer. You still can act. In fact you must act, but will your tiny actions matter?</p>



<p>I think a lot about the phrase “May you live in interesting times”, wrongly claimed to be a Chinese curse. If it is a curse, it is only a curse for the agent. To an observer, interesting times are entertainment: think of all the gripping movies that have been written about past times of turmoil and will be written about the current one. To the agent, though, who is actively trying to write the story as they live in it, interesting times are a minefield of potential wrong decisions and wasted efforts. At the same they also present the very real possibility of <em>impact</em>.</p>



<p>When we think of the current moment we have to remember why so many people in power want to constrict our agency. It is obviously because our actions <em>do </em>matter. Uncertain times present many possible futures. We, individually and collectively, do have the power to set the course. If our efforts were like a child playing with a toy cellphone, pressing buttons that lead to no outcomes, there would be no reason to take them away. The game of finding your route to greatest impact has certainly gotten harder, with more hurdles and dead-ends added along the way. But all that means is that we need to be cleverer, more committed, and take more action. In short, we need 2025 to be the year not of agentic AI but of <em>agentic</em> <em>humans, </em>operating with the full moral urgency that comes with that term and that the moment demands.</p>

<p>Nearly 20 years after the publication of a paper on phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women, one of the authors said the study had never been performed, according to a recently published retraction notice.</p>



<p>The retraction is the second for two of the authors. It comes after sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">Ben Mol</a> and his colleagues initially <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/high-profile-ob-gyn-accused-of-duplicating-data-threatens-to-sue-critic/">discovered data similarities between the recently-retracted study and another by the same group</a>, as we reported last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers that seem to share data appeared in <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, an Elsevier publication, in 2004 and 2006.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130892"></span>



<p>Table 1 of the 2006 paper “<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)04214-7/pdf">Psychological assessment of the effects of treatment with phytoestrogens on postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study</a>” was identical to Table 1 of the 2004 article “<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00530-8/fulltext">Endometrial effects of long-term treatment with phytoestrogens: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a threefold difference in participant number between the two studies, both groups of women represented in the tables had a 165.5 centimeter mean height and the same standard deviation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only the 2006 article was <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282%2824%2902432-4/fulltext">retracted</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The corresponding author did not reply to inquiries; however, one of the coauthors did respond and admitted that the study published above was not actually performed. Inquiries were made to the coauthors and their institutions, who did not provide any information to alter or contradict this admission. Therefore, the [Publications] Committee has determined to retract the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 104 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meredith Sauls, managing editor of <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, said in an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em> the journal has “nothing to add to the published retraction.” She did not respond to our questions regarding a potential investigation of the 2004 paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers shared two co-authors, <a href="https://unicamillus.org/en/lecturers/vittorio-unfer/">Vittorio Unfer</a>, a professor at the International Medical University in Rome, and <a href="https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1691836/cv_casini_maria_luisa_05042022.pdf">Maria Luisa Casini</a>, currently a pharmacologist at Italian Medicines Agency in Rome. At the time of the publications, both were researchers at Sapienza University in Rome. Neither responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gsdinternational.com/doctors/enrico-papaleo">Enrico Papaleo</a>, a co-author of the 2006 study and a gynecologist in Milan, left a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BA1967E4767C8C8751C006422C98D?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">comment</a> on PubPeer about a paper by the same group <a href="https://www.europeanreview.org/article/33752">retracted</a> in 2023:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In consideration of concerns raised about this article above, I would like to point out that my participation in this study did not include clinical management of patients or database management. In view of the concerns raised, I no longer take responsibility for these papers. Apart from this public statement, I have informed the journal about my position.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Papaleo did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, a 2001 paper by Unfer, Papaleo, and Guido Marelli, a co-author of the retracted 2006 article, received an <a href="https://karger.com/goi/article/89/1/71/894474/Expression-of-concern-Low-Dose-of-Ethinyl">expression of concern</a>. Gian Carlo Di Renzo, a co-author of the 2004 study and a researcher at the University of Perugia, was also an author of the <a href="https://karger.com/goi/article-abstract/51/2/120/151478/Low-Dose-of-Ethinyl-Estradiol-Can-Reverse-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext">paper</a>, which was published in <em>Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation</em>. The notice cites concerns about “similarities between the results presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2,” and states the corresponding author stood by the data, blaming “local data storage regulations” for why the original data were lost. </p>



<p>Grainne McNamara, a publication ethics manager at Karger Publishers, said <em>Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation</em> is “aware” of the 2006 article. “We immediately contacted the research integrity team at the publisher of <em>Fertility and Sterility</em> in December 2024 to request more information and the investigation remains ongoing.”</p>
