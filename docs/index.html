              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implants-chronic-pain">Brain implants have revealed a signature for chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists can see chronic pain in the brain with new clarity.</p>



<p>Over months, electrodes implanted in the brains of four people picked up specific signs of their persistent pain. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01338-z" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01338-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed view of chronic pain</a>, described May 22 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, suggests new ways to curtail the devastating condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The approach “provides a way into the brain to track pain,” says Katherine Martucci, a neuroscientist who studies chronic pain at Duke University School of Medicine.</p>





<p>Chronic pain is incredibly common. In the United States from 2019 to 2020, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more adults were diagnosed with chronic pain</a> than with diabetes, depression or high blood pressure, researchers reported May 16 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Chronic pain is also incredibly complex, an amalgam influenced by the body, brain, context, emotions and expectations, Martucci says. That complexity makes chronic pain seemingly invisible to an outsider, and very difficult to treat.</p>



<p>One treatment approach is to stimulate the brain with electricity. As part of a clinical trial, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco implanted four electrode wires into the brains of four volunteers with chronic pain. These electrodes can both monitor and stimulate nerve cells in two brain areas: the orbitofrontal cortex, or OFC, and the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC. The OFC isn’t known to be a key pain influencer in the brain, but this region has lots of neural connections to pain-related areas, including the ACC, which is thought to be involved in how people experience pain.</p>

These electrodes are controlled by two devices implanted on the upper chest.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124784">P. Shirvalkar</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But before researchers stimulated the brain, they needed to know how chronic pain was affecting it. For about 3 to 6 months, the implanted electrodes monitored brain signals of these people as they went about their lives. During that time, the participants rated their pain on standard scales two to eight times a day.<br><br>Using sophisticated machine learning approaches, researchers then linked each person’s pain ratings to their brain activity patterns, ultimately landing on a signature of each person’s chronic pain.</p>



<p>In many ways, the patterns were unique to each person, but there was overlap: Brain activity in the OFC, an area at the front of the brain just behind the eyes, tracked with people’s chronic pain levels. Some unexpected pain patterns cropped up along the way, too. Two volunteers’ pain fluctuated on a roughly three-day cycle, for instance.</p>



<p>Brain activity in the OFC could represent a solid biomarker of chronic pain, a signal that could both help doctors track treatment responses and serve as new targets for treatment, says neuroscientist Chelsea Kaplan of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>





<p>The study was done on only four people, three with pain from a stroke and one with phantom limb pain after a leg amputation. “We would need to know if these findings can generalize to other patients and pain conditions,” Kaplan says.</p>



<p>If brain activity patterns end up being common across people with chronic pain, they might one day be used to measure pain in people who can’t communicate, Martucci says. That includes people in nonresponsive states such as those with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-activity-unconscious-patients-offers-new-views-awareness">locked-in syndrome</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/15</em>).</p>



<p>Yet the goal of identifying reliable markers of chronic pain is not necessarily to establish whether a person is in pain, or serve as a yes-no diagnostic test, study coauthor Prasad Shirvalkar, a neurologist at UCSF, said in a May 18 news briefing. Instead, it’s to guide treatment. Shirvalkar and his colleagues are now conducting a clinical trial that involves stimulating peoples’ brains to treat chronic pain. “I think of [the biomarker] as one tool to actually help treat a patient, to actually make them feel more seen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-400-million-years-age">Saturn’s rings may be no more than 400 million years old</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s rings might have formed while trilobites scuttled about on Earth. Space dust has been accumulating on the icy halos for <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf8537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no more than 400 million years</a>, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The 4.5-billion-year-old planet appears to have acquired its iconic ornamentation relatively recently, says physicist Sascha Kempf of the University of Colorado Boulder. “We’re quite lucky to see a ring in the first place.”</p>



<p>The rings of Saturn are made of countless icy particles, which become covered with dust as tiny meteoroids strike them. These dustings darken the rings’ complexion, like mud sullies snow on roads in winter.</p>





<p>This cosmic staining was key to the new analysis, as was the now-defunct Cassini spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyzer. From 2004 to 2017, the instrument caught dust-sized micrometeoroids moving around Saturn, measuring their velocity, mass, charge and composition.</p>



<p>Kempf and colleagues identified about 160 particles — out of millions — that could have hailed from beyond the Saturn system. The researchers estimated the rate at which the incoming dust accumulates on Saturn’s rings, and calculated how long it would have taken to darken the rings to their observed color. The planet’s hoops might have materialized more than 100 million years after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fly-fossils-might-challenge-idea-ancient-trilobites-crystal-eyes">trilobites</a> — mysterious, extinct invertebrates — appeared on Earth, the team found (<em>SN: 8/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>The age of the rings has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experts-dont-agree-age-saturn-rings">debated for decades</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/16</em>). Even after the new study, there’s still disagreement.</p>



<p>If the rings are somehow losing dust over time, they could be ancient, says planetary scientist Aurélien Crida of Université Côte d&#8217;Azur in Nice, France, who was not involved in the study. “Possibly as old as Saturn.”</p>



<p>It seems clear that the rings have been exposed to micrometeoroid impacts for at least a hundred million years, Crida says. But simulations of the rings’ formation from the gravitational shredding of an early moon suggest their size is consistent with an age of billions of years, he says. And researchers have reported silicate grains <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-ring-rain-surprising-cocktail-chemicals">falling from the rings</a> into Saturn’s atmosphere (<em>SN: 10/4/18)</em>. Some unidentified process might be cleaning the rings of the micrometeoroid dust, making them appear younger than they are, Crida says.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the previously reported falling dust might come from meteoroid impacts that shatter ring ice, Kempf says.</p>





<p>Experiments that smash micrometeoroids into ice particles could help resolve the discrepancy, Crida says. For now, the debate over the age of the rings lives on.</p>

<p>In 2018, a newly minted PhD made an uncomfortable discovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a conference, he saw other researchers presenting the results of their attempt to replicate the work of one of his fellow students at Wageningen University in the Netherlands who had found a relationship between heavy rainfall and the number of prisoners in Nigeria in the first half of the 20th century.</p>



<p>But they couldn’t replicate the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127138"></span>



<p>After the presentation, the researchers discussed the discrepancy, and found that while both projects had used the same colonial records as the basis for their work, the numbers the PhD student at Wageningen University had used differed dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery sparked an investigation that led to the revocation of the student’s degree in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The student challenged the withdrawal of his degree in court, but the Dutch Court of Gelderland sided with the university in a <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2023:2068">decision</a> issued last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it is very important that we now have a court ruling showing a university can revoke a doctorate that was granted under false pretenses,” Arthur Mol, rector magnificus of Wageningen University, said in an <a href="https://issuu.com/wageningenur/docs/eng_1-32p_resource_1716/18">interview</a> with the university’s magazine. Dutch law does not say explicitly that universities can revoke degrees, Mol said, but this case was the first time anyone had challenged their ability to do so in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar ruling issued last month thousands of miles away, the Texas Supreme Court also <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/education/universities-can-revoke-former-student-degrees/269-981fb3b9-468e-438e-a9a6-3cca409bd328">decided</a> that two state universities could revoke degrees for misconduct. In one of the cases involved in the ruling, which we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/12/university-of-texas-lacks-authority-to-revoke-phds-judge-rules/">previously covered</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/12/university-of-texas-lacks-authority-to-revoke-phds-judge-rules/">Suvi Orr</a>, now director of chemistry for the gastroenterology drug discovery unit at Takeda, sued the University of Texas at Austin after the university revoked her PhD in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Dutch court ruling and the university’s <a href="https://www.wur.nl/nl/nieuws/wageningen-university-krijgt-toestemming-rechter-voor-intrekken-doctorsgraad.htm">announcement</a> of the decision do not name the student whose degree was revoked, but sleuth Elisabeth Bik and one of her Twitter followers identified a <a href="https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/522422">retracted thesis</a> with the same issue date and research topic mentioned in the court’s decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603085622/https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/522422">archived version</a> of the thesis, “‘Force of Nature’ : climate shocks, food crises and conflict in Colonial Africa and Asia, 1880-1960,” by Kostadis J. Papaioannou, has three chapters that correspond to published articles:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962629815000578">Climate shocks and conflict: Evidence from colonial Nigeria</a>,” published in <em>Political Geography</em> in 2016.&nbsp;</li>



<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X17300359?via%3Dihub">Weather Shocks and Agricultural Commercialization in Colonial Tropical Africa: Did Cash Crops Alleviate Social Distress?</a>” published in <em>World Development</em> in 2017.&nbsp;</li>



<li>“<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article/21/1/1/2911958">‘Hunger makes a thief of any man’: Poverty and crime in British colonial Asia</a>,” published in <em>European Review of Economic History</em> in 2017.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Wageningen University’s press release stated that “the editors of the scientific journals will be asked to withdraw the associated articles.” The articles have been cited a few dozen times altogether, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the <em>World Development</em> article received an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17303856">extensive corrigendum</a> that began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors regret that in the original published version of the study, there were several errors in the description of the effect sizes, measured in standard deviations. These errors were purely textual, and did not bear any relation to the study’s empirical results, which are (correctly) summarized in Table 2 (page 355) and Table 3 (page 356) of the paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The same work had <a href="https://esshc.iisg.amsterdam/en/award-jury-report-20202021">received an award</a> at the European Social Science History Conference in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we contacted Wageningen University for comment, a spokesperson referred us to Mol’s magazine interview. We have not been able to reach Papaioannou for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The court decision notes that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Plaintiff disputes that he manipulated data for his dissertation and misrepresented quotes. There is no question of (deliberate) manipulation of data and misrepresentation of quotes, according to the claimant. He also disputes that there are substantial errors in the thesis and/or errors that influenced the conclusions drawn in the thesis with regard to his data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the decision continued</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The court is of the opinion that the Board has made it sufficiently plausible that the plaintiff manipulated quantitative and qualitative data in chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of his dissertation to the extent stated by the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Later, the judges wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Court agrees with the Board in its considerations that the interests of (the reputation of) WU and the trust in science in general, given the nature, seriousness and extent of the manipulations found, outweigh plaintiff&#8217;s interest in retaining his doctoral degree.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2023/05/22/revolutionizing-medicine-unlocking-the-potential-of-machine-learning/">Revolutionizing medicine: Unlocking the potential of machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AdobeStock_277867778-140x110.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The electronic medical record (EMR) as a big data source entails a large volume of data produced at a high speed. Hence, the complexity of the datasets it generates hinders analysis through traditional methods. Machine learning is an alternative to conventional data analysis that aids in understanding these large datasets.</p>
<h4>The good</h4>
<p>Machine learning models have a dynamic nature. They can <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/11/1/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn</a> from new observations and improve their predictive accuracy as the size of the datasets increases. These models are particularly <a href="https://www.ecrjournal.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-cardiovascular-risk-prediction-all-glitters-not-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useful</a> for managing multiple predictor variables with countless potential interactions, which may require more work to account for using traditional models.</p>
<p>The algorithms used in this branch of artificial intelligence incorporate predictor variables that may not be visible by mere background knowledge. Furthermore, when unsupervised <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.001593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning methods</a> are used, unknown patterns can be unveiled.</p>
<p>Another advantage of machine learning is that algorithms don&#8217;t <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/190/8/1476/6159690?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make assumptions</a> about the relationship between predictors and outcome variables (e.g. linear relationship). Instead, they rely on data rather than human decisions to generate a model that closely explains the data&#8217;s behavior. This leads to improved accuracy of the models.</p>
<p>However, there are also drawbacks to consider when it comes to machine learning.</p>
<h4>The bad and the ugly</h4>
<p>One of the biggest <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a> faced by machine learning models is interpretation and determining causality from evidence.</p>
<p>Physicians are typically well-versed in interpreting conventional statistics like odds and relative ratios. However, they may not have the same level of familiarity with the more complex statistics used in machine learning, such as in random forest models, where multiple decision trees are used to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nur.22122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predict</a> the classification of an outcome. Furthermore, as more predictors are added to the model, interpretability becomes even more difficult. To address this issue, methods using <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/17/6609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dimension reduction</a> may help with interpretability at the expense of accuracy.</p>
<p>Finally, another potential pitfall of machine learning is <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89010-0_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overfitting</a>, where the model becomes too reliant on the input data. This can be prevented by ensuring a proper balance between the size of the training data and the validation data.</p>
<h4>The future of fetal heart rate monitoring: a machine learning approach</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05632-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our study</a>, we used a machine learning approach to identify the important predictor variables to forecast changes in fetal heart rate after neuraxial analgesia during labor.</p>
<p>This type of analgesia has been associated with fetal heart rate changes. A significant drop in fetal heart rate may indicate potential issues with the baby&#8217;s health. However, several factors can increase the likelihood of a slow heart rate in the fetus, and it can be difficult for doctors to predict this outcome.</p>
<p>The multifactorial nature of fetal heart rate changes requires analyzing multiple possible predictor variables in a poorly understood medical problem. That is why our study utilized a machine learning approach to identify the important variables for our model.</p>
<p>We evaluated the predictive capabilities of four models &#8211; Principal Components Regression, Random Forest, Elastic Net Model, and Multiple Linear Regression &#8211; for fetal heart rate changes. Among them, the Random Forest model had the best performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9, while the other models had an MSE above 42. MSE is a measure of accuracy that represents the average difference between the predicted and measured values.</p>
<p>According to our research, certain factors such as the technique used for neuraxial analgesia (combined spinal-epidural), the amount of bupivacaine administered, the mother&#8217;s BMI, and the length of the initial stage of labor play a significant role in determining fetal heart rate changes following neuraxial analgesia during labor.</p>
<p>Our findings have practical implications for the medical field. They may increase the physician&#8217;s awareness of the potential risks for fetal heart rate drops in healthy pregnant patients and adjust their treatment plans accordingly. For example, if a patient has a high BMI, the physician can be extra cautious and avoid certain techniques or medications, such as a combined spinal-epidural technique or high doses of bupivacaine.</p>
<h4>Key points to take home</h4>
<p>Our article showcases how machine learning can assist in understanding medical problems that remain unclear. When applied correctly, machine learning is a valuable resource that can enhance healthcare procedures and improve patient care by using a greater amount of data from EMRs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-microwave-insecticide-spray">Microwaving an insecticide restores its mosquito-killing power</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heating an insecticide can give it new life.</p>



<p>Microwaving the insecticide deltamethrin rearranges its crystal structure but doesn’t change its chemical composition. The rearrangement <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04554-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renews deltamethrin’s ability to kill mosquitoes</a> that have become resistant to the insecticide, researchers report April 21 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t set out to revive insecticides, says Bart Kahr, a crystallographer at New York University. He and colleagues had been working on crystal growth experiments. “And it turns out that a very good crystal for the experiment that we wanted to do was DDT, the very old, notorious insecticide from the last century.” The researchers realized that DDT has two crystal forms, one of which works better than the other.</p>





<p>They then started experimenting with deltamethrin, an insecticide that is commonly used against mosquitoes that can carry malaria. The chemical is often incorporated into bed nets or sprayed on walls or other surfaces in homes. Mosquitoes absorb the insecticide when they come in contact with it. Kahr and colleagues previously discovered that heating deltamethrin <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-deltamethrin-pesticide-resistant-mosquitoes-insecticide">changed its crystal structure</a>, which let it work faster (<em>SN: 10/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>Altering the arrangement of crystals is a tried-and-true way of giving drugs new and different properties, Kahr says. But no one had thought to rearrange insecticide crystals to give them new life, he says. “We just were surprised at how relevant it really was, and a little surprised that nobody has looked at this before,” he says. “Different communities of scientists just have different urgencies. And sometimes when you come from the outside, you look at things from a completely different way.”</p>



<p>Kahr’s team heated a chalk formulation of deltamethrin called D-Fense Dust either in an oven or in a microwave. In the oven, the researchers could precisely control the temperature, he says. “But just for kicks, we said because this deltamethrin is a consumer product, what if you just pop it in the microwave for five minutes? Does that achieve the same thing as heating it to a prescribed temperature in the oven?” The microwave worked just as well, but Kahr cautions that people shouldn’t use the same microwave for heating food and insecticides.</p>

Tests of heated deltamethrin crystals (right) showed that they are effective against mosquitoes resistant to the insecticide’s usual form.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124723">Jingxiang Yang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previously, the researchers had tested the heated deltamethrin crystals on mosquitoes that were already sensitive to the insecticide. In the new study, the scientists teamed up with entomologists to test the heated crystals on five strains of <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes from West Africa that are resistant to deltamethrin. In all cases, the rearranged crystals killed the resistant mosquitoes.</p>



<p>That’s important because insecticide resistance is a growing problem and is impairing the ability to control mosquito populations to tamp down malaria spread, says Janet Hemingway, a geneticist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England who was not involved in the new study. “We&#8217;re now at the point where almost nowhere in Africa is fully susceptible.”</p>





<p>It is encouraging that heated insecticide killed highly resistant mosquitoes, says Hemingway, who directs the <a href="https://www.infectioninnovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infection Innovation Consortium</a>, a public-private effort to find new ways to combat infectious diseases. But, she says, “this is not something we can take and use that tomorrow.”</p>



<p>For instance, insecticide-treated bed nets are made by mixing deltamethrin with fibers before yarn is extruded. The insecticide migrates to the outside of the yarn and forms crystals. Depending on the manufacturer, “the crystal structures that end up on the surfaces of those bed nets can be quite different,” Hemingway says. </p>



<p>It’s not certain that the heat-treated deltamethrin would retain its more potent crystal structure through the net-making process. And you couldn’t just pop bed nets in the microwave to rearrange the deltamethrin crystals, she says. “You&#8217;d need some pretty big microwaves given these things come in shipping containers.”</p>



<p>Kahr’s team is working on incorporating the heat-treated crystal into nets. Liquid sprays are out since the rearranged crystals don’t retain their structure when mixed into water. People could spray the heated chalk instead, but few people would probably want chalky walls, Kahr says. “There are all kinds of social and cultural things that you could propose from a scientific perspective that wouldn&#8217;t be welcomed by a community of homeowners.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/formula-one-race-car-drivers-blink">Race car drivers tend to blink at the same places in each lap</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world goes dark for about one-fifth of a second every time you blink, a fraction of an instant that’s hardly noticeable to most people. But for a Formula One race car driver traveling up to 354 kilometers per hour, that one-fifth means almost 20 meters of lost vision. </p>



<p>Considering how often people blink (up to 30 times every minute), a driver could lose as much as 595 meters — over a third of a mile — worth of visual information per minute due to blinking.</p>





<p>People are often thought to blink at random intervals, but researchers found that wasn’t the case for three Formula drivers. Instead, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.106803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the drivers tended to blink at the same parts of the course</a> during each lap, cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Nishizono and colleagues report in the May 19 <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>Nishizono, of NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Atsugi, Japan, was inspired to study how humans process information during physical activity by his past as a professional racing cyclist.</p>



<p>He was surprised to find almost no literature on blinking behavior in active humans even though under extreme conditions like motor racing or cycling, “a slight mistake could lead to life-threatening danger,” Nishizono says. So he partnered with a Japanese Formula car racing team to examine how humans blink during high-speed driving.</p>



<p>Nishizono and colleagues mounted eye trackers on the helmets of three drivers and had them drive three Formula circuits — Fuji, Suzuka and Sugo — for a total of 304 laps.</p>



<p>Where the drivers blinked was surprisingly predictable, the team found. The drivers had a shared pattern of blinking that had a strong connection with acceleration, such that drivers tended not to blink while changing speed or direction — like while on a curve in the track — but did blink while on relatively safer straightaways.</p>



<p>The finding highlights the trade-off between keeping our eyes moist and not losing vision during crucial tasks, says Jonathan Matthis, a neuroscientist at Northeastern University in Boston who studies human movement and was not involved in the research. “We think of blinking as this nothing behavior,” he says, “but it&#8217;s not just wiping the eyes. Blinking is a part of our visual system.”</p>



<p>Nishizono next wants to explore what processes in the brain allow or inhibit blinking in a given moment, he says, and is also interested in how blinking behavior varies among the general population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/counter-birth-control-pill-reproductive">How over-the-counter birth control pills could improve reproductive health</a></h4>

              
                <p>Being able to buy birth control pills off the shelf took a big step forward on May 10. Two advisory committees to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO65CZ_PDeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a birth control pill available without a prescription</a>.</p>



<p>The pill, called Opill and known by the generic name norgestrel, is a <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/progestin-only-hormonal-birth-control-pill-and-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progestin-only pill</a>. That’s in contrast to combined oral contraceptive pills, which contain progestin—or another form of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/estrogen-birth-control-reduced">progesterone — along with a form of estrogen</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/23</em>). Progesterone and estrogen are two of the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.</p>





<p>Opill gained FDA approval for prescription use in the United States in 1973, under a different brand name. The advisory committees that recently met were tasked with considering a switch from prescription to over-the-counter status, which involves reviewing data that the drug can be used safely and effectively without the oversight of a physician.</p>



<p>The FDA committees — one with expertise on non-prescription drugs, the other with obstetric and gynecological drugs — endorsed the switch, and they are not alone. Medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians are also in favor of an over-the-counter birth control pill. The FDA is expected to announce a decision on the recommendation this summer.</p>



<p>If Opill gets the over-the-counter nod, it would become the most effective birth control method on store shelves, surpassing existing options like condoms and sponges. It would also remove barriers that can make getting this birth control option challenging for many people. </p>



<p>The possibility that a birth control pill could become more easily available comes as the United States faces a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maternal mortality crisis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abortion bans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/court-mifepristone-abortion-pill-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible restrictions on an FDA-approved abortion medication</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 3/16/23; SN: 6/24/22;&nbsp;SN: 5/18/23</em>). <em>Science News</em> talked with two sexual and reproductive health equity researchers about the impact of over-the-counter access to the pill on reproductive health and autonomy. The interviews were edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What barriers do adults and adolescents face in terms of access to different birth control methods?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rachel Logan, University of California, San Francisco:</strong> I think it’s the same barriers for both groups, although I think <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17305086" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adolescents face more</a>. It is transportation to health care appointments. [There are] barriers within care, such as some <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2018/10/the-utility-of-and-indications-for-routine-pelvic-examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providers requiring a pelvic examination</a> or a full gynecological exam before providing or prescribing contraceptive methods. [It is] a lack of insurance coverage. Unfortunately in this country, because we don’t have federally mandated, comprehensive sex ed, some people just <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379711009068?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not know about all of the contraceptive methods</a> that exist. </p>



<p>There continues to be the stigma associated with needing contraception and who uses contraception that is very patriarchal and really demeaning to people, like it says something about you if you have to use these methods, as opposed to [contraception being] an essential tool in your reproductive health journey. Another area that I don’t think is talked enough about is contraceptive coercion — that could be from a parent, a partner or a health care provider — where your options to use the method of your choice are limited for whatever reason.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What could it mean for adults and adolescents to have over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control, especially considering the maternal mortality crisis and abortion bans?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anu</strong><strong> Manchikanti Gómez of the University of California, Berkeley:</strong> Providing people the opportunity to be unpregnant is always important, but more important than ever because of these additional crises. Abortion <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bans have many effects, obviously, on people’s ability to access abortion</a>. But [bans are also] having a chilling effect on health care providers in some states. Maybe they are leaving those states where abortion is banned, or not coming [to those states] in the first place. Those are generally the same providers who might be doing contraceptive counseling or providing pap smears or prenatal care, [so] there can be less access to this care. Birth control can’t solve those issues, but there may be ways that more access is going to be particularly helpful when access is being lost in other ways.</p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> It feels like we’re in a very critical moment where reproductive autonomy is definitely under threat. So this could mean extending options to people who otherwise may not have an option or a way to obtain a method of birth control that works for them. Being able to walk into a store and pick something off of the shelf that you can use and is very safe and effective is life changing.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What do we know about the historical impact of prescription birth control?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> The availability of hormonal birth control has been transformative for, historically, cis gender women’s participation in the world, in <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/Goldin_PowerPill.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the workforce, in their ability to engage in education</a>. Being able to control your fertility is such an important part about being able to control your destiny. There are many things that can affect our ability to live the lives that we want, but if you are a person who can become pregnant, [it’s] really important to have the option of deciding if, when and how you want to become pregnant or remain pregnant.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: When choosing a birth control method, what does it mean to take a person-centered contraceptive care approach?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> A person-centered approach, if we’re talking about contraceptive access, means … actually support[ing] the person in making the decision that’s best for them versus what someone else thinks they should be doing. There’s a long history of <a href="https://apha.org/Policies-and-Advocacy/Public-Health-Policy-Statements/Policy-Database/2022/01/07/Opposing-Coercion-in-Contraceptive-Access-and-Care-to-Promote-Reproductive-Health-Equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth control abuse and coercion</a> in the United States, from forced sterilization to aggressive promotion of certain methods toward Black communities and people who are poor. Even though there are different levels of effectiveness of different types of methods, that doesn’t make one more medically appropriate. </p>



<p>For some people, they don’t like something that they can’t stop using without going to see a health care provider [such as an implant or other long-acting reversible contraception]. You may feel that you’re losing bodily autonomy through using a method that you can’t stop using on your own. That’s a very real concern for some people, and it’s definitely grounded in some of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4167937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical abuses and racism and ongoing experiences</a> of low-quality care that some people, too many people, experience.</p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> [A person-centered approach] is being <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(23)00072-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OK with people saying, “no,&nbsp; I don’t want to use that method,”</a> and saying, “that’s fine,” as opposed to [providers] feeling like it’s their job to convince people to get on a method or to use a particular method. [It’s] showing people that you care about them using what feels right and best for them. We’re aligning people’s preferences with methods that are available.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Does the possible over-the-counter availability of hormonal birth control assist with this approach?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Logan:</strong> Yes. It gives people the power that they need without these constraints that are really only hurdles. This is in no way to replace routine preventative care. It is to reduce barriers to methods that we know are safe and effective that people can use independently. I think the health care system is already very strained. Is it a good thing that we’re moving some services that we know to be safe and effective outside of the health care system? I would say yes.</p>



<p><strong>Gómez:</strong> [Easier access] can make a huge difference for people. Being able to start using [a birth control pill] without seeing a provider, that removes many layers of barriers. All of those can reduce people’s ability to use it at all or to use it continuously. Not everyone wants to use the pill, [but for those who do] having over-the-counter access is really going to help people.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-rna-editing-dna-cephalopods">Octopuses and squid are masters of RNA editing while leaving DNA intact</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Many writers grouse when an editor makes a change in a story, but the consequences of changing a single word usually aren’t that dire.</p>



<p>Not so with genetic instructions for making proteins. Even a small change can prevent a protein from doing its job properly, with possibly deadly consequences. Only occasionally is a change beneficial. It seems wisest to preserve genetic instructions as they are written. Unless you’re an octopus.</p>



<p>Octopuses are like aliens living among us — they do a lot of things differently from land animals, or even other sea creatures. Their flexible tentacles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">taste</a> what they touch and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-move-uncoordinated-arms">have minds of their own</a>. Octopuses’ eyes are color-blind, but their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-can-see-their-skin">skin can detect light</a> on its own (<em>SN: 6/27/15, p. 10</em>). They are masters of disguise, changing color and skin textures to blend into their surroundings or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/skin-color-changes-reveal-octopus-drama">scare off rivals</a>. And to a greater extent than most creatures, octopuses squirt the molecular equivalent of red ink over their genetic instructions with astounding abandon, like a copy editor run amok.</p>





<p>These edits modify RNA, the molecule used to translate information from the genetic blueprint stored in DNA, while leaving the DNA unaltered.</p>



<p>Scientists don’t yet know for sure why octopuses, and other shell-less cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish, are such prolific editors. Researchers are debating whether this form of genetic editing gave cephalopods an evolutionary leg (or tentacle) up or whether the editing is just a sometimes useful accident. Scientists are also probing what consequences the RNA alterations may have under various conditions. Some evidence suggests <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cephalopods-may-have-traded-evolution-gains-extra-smarts">editing may give cephalopods some of their smarts</a> but could come at the cost of holding back evolution in their DNA (<em>SN:&nbsp;4/29/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>“These animals are just magical,” says Caroline Albertin, a comparative developmental biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. “They have all sorts of different solutions to living in the world they come from.” RNA editing may help give the creatures vast numbers of solutions for problems they may face.</p>

<h4>How cephalopods modify their RNA</h4>



<p>Molecular biology’s central dogma holds that instructions for building an organism are contained in DNA. Cells copy those instructions into messenger RNAs, or mRNAs. Then, cellular machinery called ribosomes read the mRNAs to build proteins by stringing amino acids together. Most of the time, the protein’s composition conforms to the DNA template for the protein’s sequence of amino acids.</p>





<p>But RNA editing can cause divergences from the DNA instructions, creating some proteins that have different amino acids than specified by the DNA.</p>



<p>Editing chemically modifies one of RNA’s four building blocks, or bases. Those bases are often referred to by the first letters of their names: A, C, G and U, for adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil (RNA’s version of the DNA base thymine). In an RNA molecule, the bases are linked to sugars; the adenine-sugar unit, for instance, is referred to as adenosine.</p>



<p>There are many ways to edit RNA letters. Cephalopods excel at a type of editing known as adenosine to inosine, or A-to-I, editing. This happens when an enzyme called ADAR2 strips a nitrogen and two hydrogen atoms off adenosine (the A). That chemical peel turns adenosine into inosine (I).</p>



<p>Ribosomes read inosine as guanine instead of adenine. Sometimes that switch has no effect on the resulting protein’s chain of amino acids. But in some cases, having a G where an A should be results in a different amino acid being inserted into the protein. Such protein-altering RNA editing is called RNA recoding.</p>



<p>Soft-bodied cephalopods have embraced RNA recoding with all of their arms while even closely related species are more tentative about accepting rewrites, Albertin says. “Other mollusks don’t seem to do it” to the same extent.</p>



<p>RNA editing isn’t limited to creatures of the deep. Almost every multicellular organism has one or more RNA editing enzymes called ADAR enzymes, short for “adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA,” says Joshua Rosenthal, a molecular neurobiologist also at the Marine Biological Laboratory.</p>



<p>Cephalopods have two ADAR enzymes. Humans have versions of them, too. “In our brains, we edit a ton of RNA. We do it a lot,” Rosenthal says. Over the last decade, scientists have discovered millions of places in human RNAs where editing occurs.</p>



<p>But those edits rarely change the amino acids in a protein. For instance, Eli Eisenberg of Tel Aviv University and colleagues identified more than 4.6 million editing sites in human RNAs. Of those, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28841-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 1,517 recode proteins</a>, the researchers reported last year in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Of those recoding sites, up to 835 are shared with other mammals, suggesting that evolutionary forces preserved editing at those locations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How does RNA editing work?</h3>



<p>In a common form of RNA editing, an adenosine becomes an inosine through a reaction that removes an amino group and replaces it with an oxygen (arrows). The illustration shows an ADAR enzyme attaching to a double-stranded RNA at the “dsRNA binding domain.” The region of the enzyme that will interact to cause the reaction, the “deaminase domain,” is positioned near the adenosine that will become an inosine.</p>

<p>Cephalopods take RNA recoding to a whole new level, Albertin says. Longfin squid (<em>Doryteuthis pealeii</em>) <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/05198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have 57,108 recoding sites</a>, Rosenthal, Eisenberg and colleagues reported in 2015 in <em>eLife</em>. Since then, the researchers have examined multiple species of octopus, squid and cuttlefish, each time finding tens of thousands of recoding sites.</p>



<p>Soft-bodied, or coleoid, cephalopods may have more opportunities for editing than other animals because of where at least one of the ADAR enzymes, ADAR2, is located in the cell. Most animals edit RNAs in the nucleus — the compartment where DNA is stored and copied into RNA — before sending the messages out to meet up with ribosomes. But cephalopods also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-their-genetic-material-uniquely-weird-place">have the enzymes in the cytoplasm</a>, the cells’ jellylike guts, Rosenthal and colleagues discovered (<em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Having editing enzymes in two locales doesn’t fully explain why cephalopods’ RNA recoding so far outstrips that of humans and other animals. Nor does it explain the patterns of editing scientists have uncovered.</p>



<h4>RNA editing may give cephalopods flexibility</h4>



<p>Editing isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. Rarely are all copies of an RNA in a cell edited. It’s much more common for some percentage of RNAs to be edited while the rest retain their original information. The percentage, or frequency, of editing can vary widely from RNA to RNA or between cells or tissues, and may depend on water temperature or other conditions. In longfin squid, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29748-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most RNA editing sites were edited 2 percent or less of the time</a>, Albertin and colleagues reported last year in <em>Nature Communications</em>. But the researchers also found more than 205,000 sites that were edited 25 percent of the time or more.</p>



<p>In most of a cephalopod’s body, RNA editing doesn’t often affect the makeup of proteins. But in the nervous system, it’s a different story. In longfin squids’ nervous systems, 70 percent of edits in protein-producing RNAs recode proteins. And RNAs in the nervous system of the California two-spot octopus (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) are recoded three to six times as often as in other organs or tissues.</p>

RNA recoding might help the squid respond more flexibly to its environment, but whether recoding has evolutionary value is not yet clear.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124674">ELAINE BEARER</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Some mRNAs have multiple edit sites that alter amino acids in the proteins the mRNAs encode. In the longfin squid’s nervous system, for instance, 27 percent of mRNAs have three or more recoding sites. Some contain 10 or more such sites. Combinations of those editing sites could result in multiple versions of a protein being made in a cell.</p>



<p>Having a wide selection of proteins may give cephalopods “more flexibility in responding to the environment,” Albertin says, “or give you a variety of solutions to the problem in front of you.” In the nervous system, RNA editing might contribute to flexibility in thinking, which could help explain why octopuses can unlock cages or use tools, some researchers think. Editing could be an easy way to create one or more versions of a protein in the nervous system and different ones in the rest of the body, Albertin says.</p>



<p>When humans and other vertebrates have different versions of a protein, it often comes from having multiple copies of a gene. Doubling, tripling or quadrupling copies of a gene “results in a whole genetic playground to allow genes to go off and do different functions,” Albertin says. But cephalopods tend not to duplicate genes. Instead, their innovations come from editing.</p>



<p>And there is a lot of room for innovation. In squid, mRNAs for building the alpha-spectrin protein <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-animal-060322-114534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have 242 recoding sites</a>. All the combinations of edited and unedited sites theoretically could create up to 7 x 10<sup>72</sup> forms of the protein, Rosenthal and Eisenberg report in this year’s issue of <em>Annual Review of Animal Biosciences</em>. “To put this number in perspective,” the researchers wrote, “suffice it to say that it dwarfs the number of all alpha-spectrin molecules (or, for that matter, all protein molecules) synthesized in all cells of all the squids that have ever lived on our planet since the dawn of time.”</p>



<p>That incredible level of complexity would be possible only if every site were independent, says Kavita Rangan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Diego. Rangan has been studying RNA recoding in California market squid (<em>Doryteuthis opalescens</em>) and in longfin squid. Water temperature triggers the squid to recode motor proteins called kinesins that move cargo inside cells.</p>



<p>In longfin squid, the mRNA that produces kinesin-1 has 14&nbsp;recoding sites, Rangan has found. She examined mRNAs from the optic lobe — the part of the brain that processes visual information — and from the stellate ganglion, a collection of nerves involved in generating the muscle contractions that produce jets of water to propel the squid.</p>



<p>Each tissue made several versions of the protein. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">certain sites tended to be edited together</a>, Rangan and Samara Reck-Peterson, also of UC San Diego, reported last September in a preprint posted online at bioRxiv.org. Their data suggest that editing of some sites is coordinated and “very strongly rejects the idea that editing is independent,” Rangan says. “The frequency of the combos that we see don’t match if every site was edited independently.”</p>



<p>Yoking editing sites may prevent squid and other cephalopods from reaching the pinnacles of complexity that they’re theoretically capable of. Still, RNA editing provides cephalopods a way to try out many versions of a protein without getting locked into a permanent change in DNA, Rangan says.</p>



<p>That lack of commitment puzzles Jianzhi Zhang, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “It doesn’t make sense to me,” he says. “If you want a particular amino acid in a protein, you should change the DNA. Why do you change the RNA?”</p>



<h4>Is there evolutionary value to RNA editing?</h4>



<p>Perhaps RNA editing provides some evolutionary advantage. To test that idea, Zhang and then–graduate student Daohan Jiang compared “synonymous” sites, where edits do not change amino acids, with “nonsynonymous” sites where recoding happens. Since synonymous edits don’t change amino acids, the researchers considered those edits to be neutral as far as evolution is concerned. In humans, recoding, or nonsynonymous editing, happens at fewer sites than synonymous editing, and the percentage of RNA molecules that are edited is lower than at synonymous sites.</p>



<p>“If we assume synonymous editing is just like noise that happens in the cell, and nonsynonymous editing is less frequent and [at a] lower level, that suggests nonsynonymous editing is actually harmful,” Zhang says. Even though recoding in cephalopods happens much more frequently than for humans, in most cases, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13275-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoding is not advantageous</a>, or adaptive, for cephalopods, the researchers argued in 2019 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>There are a few shared sites where octopuses, squid and cuttlefish all recode their RNAs, the researchers found, suggesting the recoding is useful in those instances. But this is a small fraction of editing sites. A few other sites that are edited in one species of cephalopod but not others were also adaptive, Zhang and Jiang found.</p>



<p>If it’s not all that helpful, why have cephalopods persisted with RNA recoding for hundreds of millions of years? RNA editing may stick around not because it is adaptive, but because it is addictive, Zhang says.</p>



<p>He and Jiang proposed a harm-permitting model (that is, a situation that permits harmful changes to DNA). Imagine, he says, a situation in which a G (guanine) in an organism’s DNA gets mutated to an A (adenine). If that mutation leads to a harmful amino acid change in a protein, natural selection should weed out individuals that carry that mutation. But if, by chance, the organism has RNA editing, the mistake in the DNA might be corrected by editing RNA, essentially changing the A back to G. If the protein is essential for life, then the RNA would have to be edited at high levels so that nearly every copy is corrected.</p>



<p>When that happens, “You’re locked into the system,” Zhang says. Now the organism is dependent on RNA editing machinery. “It cannot be lost, because you will require the A to be edited back to G for survival, so the editing will be kept at high levels.… In the beginning you really didn’t need it, but after you got it, you became addicted.”</p>



<p>Zhang argues that that sort of editing is neutral, not adaptive. But other research suggests RNA editing can be adaptive.</p>



<p>RNA editing may work as a transition phase, letting organisms try out a switch from adenine to guanine without making a permanent change in their DNA. Over the course of evolution, sites where adenines are recoded in RNA in one cephalopod species are more likely than unedited adenines to be <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/10456/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced with guanine in the DNA of one or more related specie</a>s, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>PeerJ</em>. And for heavily edited sites, evolution across cephalopods seems to favor a transition from A to G in DNA (rather than to cytosine or thymine, the other two DNA building blocks). That favors the idea that editing can be adaptive.</p>



<p>Other recent work by Rosenthal and colleagues, which examined A-to-G replacements in different species, suggests that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/9/3775/6281225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having an editable A is an evolutionary boon</a> over an uneditable A or a hardwired G.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h5>How common is RNA recording?</h5>



<p>Soft-bodied cephalopod species including octopuses, squid and cuttlefish recode RNA in their nervous systems at tens of thousands of sites, compared with about a thousand or fewer sites in humans, mice, fruit flies and other animal species. Though scientists have been documenting the number of editing sites, they will need new tools to directly test how recoding influences cephalopod biology.</p>

<h4>There are a lot of open questions</h4>



<p>Evidence for and against RNA recoding’s evolutionary value has come mainly from examining the total genetic makeup, or genomes, of various cephalopod species. But scientists would like to directly test whether recoded RNAs have an effect on cephalopod biology. Doing that will require some new tools and creative thinking.</p>



<p>Rangan tested synthetic versions of squid motor proteins and found that two edited versions that squid make in the cold <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">moved slower but traveled farther</a> along protein tracks called microtubules than unedited proteins did. But that’s in artificial laboratory conditions on microscope slides. To understand what is happening in cells, Rangan says, she would like to be able to grow squid cells in lab dishes. Right now, she has to take tissue directly from the squid and can only get snapshots of what is happening. Lab-grown cells might allow her to follow what happens over time.</p>



<p>Zhang says he is testing his harm-permitting hypothesis by getting yeast hooked on RNA editing. Baker’s yeast (<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) doesn’t have ADAR enzymes. But Zhang engineered a strain of the yeast to carry a human version of the enzyme. The ADAR enzymes make the yeast sick and grow slowly, he says. To speed up the experiment, the strain he is using has a higher-than-normal mutation rate, and may build up G-to-A mutations. But if RNA editing can correct those mutations, the ADAR-carrying yeast may grow better than ones that don’t have the enzyme. And after many generations, the yeast may become addicted to editing, Zhang predicts.</p>



<p>Albertin, Rosenthal and colleagues have developed ways to change the genes of squid with the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9. The team <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30985-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created an albino squid</a> by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out, or disable, a gene that produces pigment. The researchers may be able to change editing sites in DNA or in RNA and test their function, Albertin says.</p>



<p>This science is still in its early stages, and the story may lead somewhere unexpected. Still, with cephalopods’ skillful editing, it’s bound to be a good read.</p>

<p>Tokyo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/">Waseda University</a> is investigating alleged misconduct by an assistant professor at the institution, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The probe is focusing on at least three works by <a href="https://w-rdb.waseda.jp/html/100002891_en.html">Woohyang Sim</a>, of the Faculty of International Research and Education, including her 2020 doctoral dissertation, titled &#8220;What is Higher Education For? Educational Aspirations and Career Prospects of Women in the Arab Gulf.&#8221; Two of Sim’s published papers are also under scrutiny, according to a source familiar with the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2022, an anonymous commenter on PubPeer flagged several problems with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B412918881783FB611BBFBADE6ADA3">these publications</a>, as well as with Sim&#8217;s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3FF17ABF75D18032052CF0ADA5CFD8#3">master&#8217;s thesis and another one of her papers</a>. That same month, a whistleblower notified the Japanese government about the concerns, according to the source.</p>



<span id="more-127146"></span>



<p>Waseda has faced problems with research misconduct in the past. In 2015, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/04/university-revokes-phd-of-lead-author-on-retracted-stap-stem-cell-papers/">the school revoked the PhD</a> of cell scientist Haruko Obokata, due partly to plagiarism concerns, as we reported that year. Obokata was first author on a pair of controversial <em>Nature</em> papers describing an easy way to create stem cells with the so-called <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/26/stap-stem-cell-researcher-obokata-loses-another-paper/#more-37272">STAP method</a>; both articles were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/02/stap-stem-cell-papers-officially-retracted-as-nature-argues-peer-review-couldnt-have-detected-fatal-problems/">retracted in 2014</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the heels of the scandal, Waseda said it would be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/04/08/waseda-university-checking-dissertations-for-plagiarism-in-wake-of-stap-stem-cell-misconduct-finding/">vetting all dissertations</a> submitted to the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering for signs of plagiarism and other irregularities.</p>



<p>Waseda University told Retraction Watch it &#8220;takes strict measures in dealing with any compliance violation, including research misconduct&#8221; but that &#8220;currently there is no information that we are able to disclose.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sim did not respond to our requests for comments about the new investigation. But in a May 16 email Retraction Watch has seen, Sim acknowledged: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am currently undergoing a research ethic committee process and cooperating fully with the procedure. I have provided all raw data I possess and I am awaiting the committee&#8217;s final report.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sim, who is listed as a &#8220;co-researcher&#8221; on a <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/qatarchair">$13 million joint project</a> between Waseda University and Qatar University, also wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to address the concerns raised about my work, acknowledging that I have identified a few inconsistencies resulting from careless mistakes. As a non-native speaker of English, I admit that I placed significant emphasis on accurately translating my work into a language in which I do not feel entirely comfortable. In the process of writing, driven by anxiety, I may have overlooked some crucial details that required more attention.</p>



<p>However, I want to assure that any mistakes in the paper were unintentional, and I did not intentionally fabricate or alter any information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the papers that were flagged on PubPeer, &#8220;<a href="https://fire-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/FIRE/article/view/109">The Educational Aspirations of Saudi Arabian Youth: Implications for Creating a New Framework to Explain Saudi Arabian Society</a>,” published in <em>FIRE: Forum for International Research in Education</em> in 2016, no longer resolves from its <a href="https://doi.org/10.18275/fire201603021081">DOI</a>.</p>



<p>The journal&#8217;s senior editor, <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/education/our-people/Faculty/alexander_wiseman.php">Alexander W. Wiseman</a> of Texas Tech University, did not respond to our emails or phone calls. Nor did we hear back from Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania, which is responsible for maintaining the paper&#8217;s DOI.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predators-coyotes-bobcats-wolves-people">Large predators push coyotes and bobcats near people and to their demise</a></h4>

              
                <p>When wild animals take refuge from predators by straying near people, the illusion of safety can be deadly.</p>



<p>In the wilderness, mid-sized predators like coyotes have learned to fear larger carnivores like wolves and cougars, which will violently attack and kill those smaller carnivores. A new study finds that when those larger predators are around, the smaller ones will try to evade attack by moving into spaces shaped by people. But that ends up putting them at a much higher risk of getting killed — by people, scientists report in the May 19 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The study is among the first to show that large cats and wolves shape the behavior of other predators outside of wilderness areas, says Laura Prugh, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>When large carnivore populations plummeted from being hunted in vast stretches of North America, predators less threatening to humans flourished. Then, as large predators were reintroduced into the wild — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-genes-ancestry">wolves in Yellowstone National Park</a> — scientists started to notice deadly (and mostly-one sided) violence erupting between old and new meat-eating residents (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>What the aftermath of this violence looks like is something that Prugh has witnessed firsthand. During a field season in Alaska, the wildlife ecologist came across the remains of coyotes massacred by wolves.</p>



<p>“The wolves had buried [the coyotes’] heads in the snow,” recalls Prugh. “It was a little macabre.”</p>



<p>Understandably, smaller predators will try to stay clear of their murderous kin. Yet how this works outside of wilderness areas is unclear. Some animals will hide from danger in spaces shaped by people — be it farms or suburbs — in a phenomenon called the human shield effect. But other research indicates that mid-sized predators keep away from people when given the chance.</p>



<p>“Animals are really, really scared of humans,” explains Taal Levi, a wildlife ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who was not involved in the study. In experiments where scientists played recordings of either growling or human voices, smaller meat-eaters like coyotes were more likely to “avoid areas where you play recordings of Rush Limbaugh or people talking in general,” he says.</p>



<p>To see how smaller predators behave near human territory, Prugh and her colleagues attached radio collars to 37 bobcats and 35 coyotes, as well as to 22 wolves and 60 cougars, in two rural areas of Washington State. These collars tracked the location of the animals every four hours for up to two years — “one of the most impressive datasets” on predator movement outside of a wilderness area to date, Levi says.</p>



<p>Tracking these animals revealed that coyotes and bobcats, the mid-sized predators, were twice as likely to spend time near ranches, roads, fields and towns when large carnivores were around. But the animals traded one threat for another: People shot, trapped or otherwise killed 25 bobcats and coyotes during the study period. Wolves and cougars killed just eight, meaning people killed three times as many coyotes and bobcats than the large predators.</p>

Humans were responsible for 14 coyote deaths during the study period.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124714">Savanah Walker</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This may be because animals aren’t good at reading danger signs from people in a modern world, Prugh says. A coyote is unlikely to make the connection that a person is behind a gun. But the smell and sound of wolves — which evolved alongside coyotes for millennia — are hard to forget if you’ve been attacked.</p>



<p>The study shows that large carnivores shape the behavior of smaller predators even outside wilderness areas, something not all scientist agreed would be the case, Levi says.</p>





<p>“As wolves recover outside of national parks, there was this major question about whether they could recover enough to actually fulfill their ecological role” of controlling the numbers of smaller carnivores, he says. This study shows that large carnivores can — and will — shape how smaller meat-eaters live and die near people.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-lakes-drying-shrinking-climate">More than half of the world’s largest lakes are drying up</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than half of the world’s largest lakes <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrank over the last three decades</a>, researchers report in the May 19 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>That’s a big problem for the people who depend on those lakes for drinking water and irrigation. Drying lakes also threaten the survival of local ecosystems and migrating birds, and can even give rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">insalubrious dust storms</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/23</em>).</p>



<p>“About one-quarter of the Earth’s population lives in these basins with lake water losses,” says surface hydrologist Fangfang Yao of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.</p>





<p>Using satellite observations from 1992 to 2020, Yao, then at the University of Colorado Boulder, and colleagues estimated the area and water levels of <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/globallakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 2,000 freshwater bodies</a>. That work provided a continuous stream of lake volume measurements. The lakes account for 96 percent of Earth’s total natural lake storage and 83 percent of that in reservoirs. The team also used population data to estimate the number of people living by the drying lakes.</p>



<p>About 53 percent of the world’s lakes have clearly shrunk, the researchers found, while only 22 percent made gains. From these bodies of water, roughly 600 cubic kilometers of water were lost over the 28-year time span. That’s around 17 times the maximum capacity of Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States.</p>



<p>The researchers used hydrologic and climate simulations to tease out the processes influencing the fluctuating water bodies. They found climate change and human consumption were the main causes of the decline in natural lakes, while in reservoirs, sediment buildup was the primary driver of storage loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/court-mifepristone-abortion-pill-safety">As U.S. courts weigh in on mifepristone, here’s the abortion pill’s safety record</a></h4>

              
                <p>A widely used abortion medicine is in legal jeopardy, despite decades of data supporting its use.</p>



<p>The medicine, called mifepristone, is part of two-drug regimen that can end a pregnancy, and was used in more than half of abortions in the United States in 2020. Late last year, a group of antiabortion doctors and others sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/abortion-pills-whats-going-on?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=281219&amp;post_id=108194767&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging mifepristone’s initial approval</a> in 2000 and the changes the agency later made to broaden access to the drug.</p>





<p>In the <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/abortion-pills-whats-going-on?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=281219&amp;post_id=108194767&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a>, they claim that the drug isn’t safe, that the FDA improperly approved it and failed to follow the science, and that mifepristone is illegal to send in the mail. The U.S. District Court judge that first heard the case sided with the group. Now, the case is being reviewed by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans; on May 17, the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments related to the judge’s ruling. The matter may ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p>



<p>But the original scientific evidence used in the FDA’s approval process offered a clear answer to the drug’s safety, says Thomas Kosasa, an obstetrician gynecologist at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who served on a 1996 committee that advised the FDA. “We made sure that it was a safe medication,” he says. “It was also effective.”</p>



<p>In the 23 years since the agency approved mifepristone, the drug has amassed a long track record of safety data — in the United States and around the world, says Lauren Owens, an obstetrician gynecologist at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. In 2020 in the United States alone, there were nearly 500,000 medication-induced abortions, which relied on mifepristone and a second drug, misoprostol, to terminate a pregnancy. The drugs are also used to manage miscarriages. And during the coronavirus pandemic, an influx of new safety data supported what earlier studies had found.</p>



<p>“Millions of people have used this medication,” Owens says. She and other doctors and scientists say decades of data demonstrate mifepristone’s safety and note that the court’s decision could affect access to the drug — even in states where abortion is legal. The case comes nearly a year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling">after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>Owens says she’s concerned that a court’s decision could potentially override medical experts. “If the FDA doesn’t get to say what medications are safe,” she says, “where does that stop?”</p>



<h4>The FDA approved mifepristone 2000. What data did it use to decide?</h4>



<p>On a hot day in July 1996, a group of doctors and scientists who were part of the FDA’s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee gathered in Gaithersburg, Md., to evaluate mifepristone, also known as RU-486 as well as Mifeprex. The drug had already been approved in France, England, Sweden and China. The committee’s job was to review data on the drug’s safety and efficacy for ending an early pregnancy and vote on whether to recommend its use in the United States.</p>





<p>Such committee meetings were typically held at the FDA’s offices in Rockville, but this time was different. This time, the committee members traveled with armed guards. Concern for their safety may have stemmed, in part, from recent violence at abortion clinics in Florida and Massachusetts, Kosasa recalls. The agency held the meeting in a small building north of Rockville; the eight committee members rode in bulletproof vehicles, police escorts leading and trailing the group.</p>



<p>The meeting was open to the public, but security was tight. Visitors went through metal detectors and had their bags scanned. People packed in to hear the proceedings, says committee member Diana Petitti, a physician and epidemiologist who retired from the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix in 2017. “It was totally full,” she recalls. The FDA set up an overflow room nearby for a crowd to watch the meeting on video. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>A timeline of the FDA’s decisions on mifepristone</h3>



<p>Over the last few decades, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed data on the abortion medication mifepristone and updated the conditions of its approval.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1996:</strong> An FDA committee reviewed mifepristone safety data, concluding the benefits outweighed the risks</li>



<li><strong>2000:</strong> The FDA approved mifepristone (Mifeprex) for termination of pregnancy up to seven weeks</li>



<li><strong>2016:</strong> The FDA extended the drug approval through 10 weeks of pregnancy</li>



<li><strong>2021:</strong> An FDA update now allowed people to receive the drug in the mail, without visiting a clinic in person</li>



<li><strong>2021:</strong> The FDA added a requirement that pharmacies that dispense the drug be certified </li>
</ul>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=The%20FDA%20first%20approved%20Mifeprex,200%20mg%2C%20in%20April%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA </a> </div>
</div>



<p>FDA’s then-commissioner David Kessler opened the meeting with clear instructions for the committee: “What you need to do today is to focus on the science,” he said, according to a <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170403223214/https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/96/transcpt/3198t1a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript</a>. “Examine the clinical data carefully. Ask the tough questions and then give the FDA your best scientific advice based on the data.”</p>



<p>The data came from two clinical trials in France and an ongoing trial in the United States. The French trials enrolled 2,480 women, most of whom were seven weeks pregnant or less, and doctors used a dose of mifepristone followed by misoprostol two days later, if needed, to end the pregnancy. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, causing the lining of the uterus to break down. Misoprostol triggers contractions that help expel that broken-down tissue. </p>



<p>In the French trials, this regimen worked in about 95 percent of women, with few serious side effects, such as severe bleeding. Many women reported painful contractions, and some experienced nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Those are expected side effects of the drugs, Petitti says. “But nothing popped out as something we really ought to be worried about.” Altogether, she says, “The safety question was pretty straightforward.”</p>



<p>The committee took the day to discuss mifepristone and voted 6 to 0 that the benefits exceeded the risks. Two members abstained from voting.</p>



<p>After multiple rounds of reviews, the FDA ultimately followed the committees’ advice and approved mifepristone in 2000, with some restrictions in place. Notably, people could take the medication up to seven weeks of pregnancy, but only under doctor supervision. And patients had to come to the office three times­ — once for mifepristone, once for misoprostol and then again for a follow-up visit.</p>



<p>Petitti says she’s surprised that mifepristone’s safety has been called into question. “I just keep waiting for somebody to show me evidence that shows something different than the evidence I saw in 1996.”</p>



<h4>Doctors collected data on mifepristone during the coronavirus pandemic. Here’s what they found.</h4>



<p>Since mifepristone’s approval, the FDA has eased some of its original restrictions. A&nbsp;2016 update allowed for the drug’s use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy and required just one clinic visit instead of three. Then, the coronavirus pandemic spurred another change that allowed people to access mifepristone by mail, without coming into a clinic in person at all.</p>



<p>The FDA’s updates gave scientists a new way to investigate the safety of the drug, specifically whether past restrictions kept people safer or not. The clinic visit was one of those lifted restrictions, says Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>



<p>Even without the typical pre-abortion ultrasound or pelvic exam, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790319?resultClick=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the medicine was about 95 percent effective at terminating a pregnancy and serious complications were rare</a>, show data that Upadhyay and colleagues collected from February 2020 through January 2021 on nearly 4,000 people throughout the United States. The study “confirms that mifepristone is extremely safe and extremely effective,” she says.</p>



<p>The results echo data from other countries, including a massive study from the United Kingdom that analyzed the records of more than 18,000 telemedicine patients who had medication abortions. The drugs were <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">99 percent effective, and serious outcomes, such as a blood transfusion or major surgery, &nbsp;occurred in just 0.02 percent of people</a>, researchers reported in 2021.</p>



<p>The latest data suggest that doctors can prescribe mifepristone safely, without any special exams, Upadhyay says.</p>



<p>That’s how prescriptions of the medication work in Canada, where mifepristone became widely available in late 2017. Canada’s drug regulators “took a really unprecedented step of treating mifepristone as any other medication,” says Laura Schummers, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. That meant any physician or nurse practitioner can prescribe mifepristone, any pharmacy can dispense it, and patients can take the medication at home “if, when and where they choose,” she says.</p>



<p>Within a few years, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa2109779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the percent of abortions by surgery in Canada dropped from 98 percent to about 69 percent</a>. By early 2020, more than 30 percent of first trimester abortions were provided using medication, Schummers’ team reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 2022. The scientists also analyzed safety trends. “The take-home message was that there was no change at all to the safety outcomes,” Schummers says.</p>



<p>Her team’s paper adds to the stack of studies validating mifepristone’s safety. And medication abortion, she points out, is safer than childbirth, which can be deadly. As scientists reported this year, U.S. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity">maternal deaths continue to climb</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>In the United States, abortion is already difficult to access, Upadhyay says, especially for people of color and people with low incomes. Any decision to restrict or ban mifepristone, she says, “would be devastating for people who are most in need of care.”</p>



<p>In April, a Supreme Court ruling left the drug available for use while the case proceeds with the Fifth Circuit. But the appeals court decision may not be the final word; the Supreme Court could end up having the final say.</p>



<p>This judicial review of medication concerns not only Owens, of the University of Washington, but also Kosasa. He worries what the outcome of the case will mean for the FDA, and the agency’s ability to evaluate and approve drugs — even ones, like mifepristone, with a well-supported safety record.</p>



<p>If courts can go against “a whole tremendous amount of scientific evidence,” Kosasa says, “that just doesn’t seem right.”</p>

<p>The chair of the Department of Pulmonary Immunology at the University of Texas at Tyler Health Science Center lost a paper last year after an institutional investigation found several issues with the data in the article.</p>



<p>Although the researcher, <a href="https://www.uthct.edu/directory-profile/?smid=22942">Ramakrishna Vankayalapati</a>, is still identified as the chair on his online profile and the <a href="https://archive.is/8kijx">department’s website</a>, he no longer holds that position, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17310-5">Ornithine-A urea cycle metabolite enhances autophagy and controls <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection</a>,” was published in <em>Nature Communications</em> in July 2020. It has been cited 21 times, according to the journal&#8217;s statistics.</p>



<span id="more-127132"></span>



<p>Soon after publication, scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a> posted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/57EBD9F0C323014FEB6E0CFE62B64C">several comments on PubPeer</a> about similarities between images in the paper that she and a “reader” had noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thank you so much for letting me know,” Vankayalapati <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/57EBD9F0C323014FEB6E0CFE62B64C#12">responded</a>. “I will look at all data to proceed further. Thanks again.”</p>



<p>After two years with no further response, Bik posted again last July to ask if Vankalapati had contacted the journal. He did not reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last October, the paper was retracted. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33608-y">notice</a> detailed issues with the images Bik had called out in her PubPeer posts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>Vankayalapati has not responded to our request for comment. A spokesperson for the university confirmed that the school had conducted the investigation mentioned in the notice, and that Vankayalapati “is not currently the chair of the department of pulmonary immunology.” She declined to say whether his departure from the role was related to the investigation, citing a policy against discussing personnel matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.txbiomed.org/about/leadership/dr-larry-schlesinger-presidentceo/">Larry S.

                <p>PLOS is committed to openness and equity to ensure everyone has the opportunity to thrive in the workplace. As a nonprofit mission-driven publisher spread across four countries, we recognize that our 175+ global staff are the reason behind our success, and following the announcement that 34 of our US colleagues have called to unionize, we would like to acknowledge the important role that unions play in improving employees&rsquo; working conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The formation of a US-based Union is a significant step for the organization and one that requires time to consider. We believe that all colleagues across our global workforce deserve to be part of this conversation, as the unionization of a section of regional staff has the potential to disproportionately influence our global organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to take the time to understand the complexities of this action and therefore have&nbsp; elected not to voluntarily recognize the Union at this stage. We will move forward with due process for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the US to ensure we continue a meaningful and constructive dialogue on this important issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain committed to working with all of our staff to ensure PLOS is a thriving, engaged environment for all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-scaled-drawing-desert-kite">The oldest scaled-down drawings of actual structures go back 9,000 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two large, engraved stones found in the Middle East display the oldest known building plans drawn to scale, researchers say.</p>



<p>One carved depiction covers part of a rectangular stone found at a Jordanian campsite dating to about 9,000 years ago. Two other engravings were made roughly 8,000 years ago on a boulder discovered at the base of a cliff in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Carvings on these stones <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0277927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depict nearby desert kites</a>, massive structures once used to capture animal herds, scientists report May 17 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Desert kites consist of stone walls up to five kilometers long that narrow into large enclosures surrounded by pits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killing-fields-ancient-syria-revealed">where hunters trapped animals</a>, such as gazelles and deer (<em>SN: 4/18/11</em>). Kite depictions at the two sites closely resemble the shape, layout and proportions of desert kites found close by, archaeologist Rémy Crassard and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Scale drawings etched in rock may have served as maps that helped hunters plan strategies for driving animal herds into specific desert kites, the scientists report. These engravings might also have been blueprints for building desert kites, or public displays of their makers’ ability to transfer large, 3-D structures onto small, flat surfaces.</p>

<p>As farming and animal domestication took root in parts of the Middle East, regional hunting groups that built desert kites to trap wild animal herds maintained a special regard for massive hunting structures, says Crassard, of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Lyon.</p>



<p>Other ancient maps and structural plans, intended as scaled-down drawings, date to about 4,300 years ago in Mesopotamia. Those depictions, Crassard says, were not as accurate as the newly discovered desert kite engravings.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals driving cerebellar learning, but
mechanisms causing the variable CF responses in Purkinje cells (PCs) are not fully
understood. Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we unveil the ionic mechanisms
underlying CF-evoked distinct spike waveforms on different parts of the PC. We demonstrate
that voltage can gate both the amplitude and the spatial range of CF-evoked Ca2+ influx by
the availability of K+ currents. This makes the energy consumed during a complex spike
(CS) also voltage dependent. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with
individual branches as computational units for CF input. The variability of somatic CSs
can be explained by voltage state, CF activation phase, and instantaneous CF firing rate.
Concurrent clustered synaptic inputs affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a
spatially precise way. The voltage- and branch-specific CF responses can increase
dendritic computational capacity and enable PCs to actively integrate CF signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antenor-firmin-anthropology-racism-haiti">Anténor Firmin challenged anthropology’s racist roots 150 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the end of the 19th century, one of the hottest debates among anthropologists was whether human beings originated from a single ancestor or many (the answer: just one). Members of both camps, though, largely agreed that whatever their origins, some races were superior to others. Haitian anthropologist Anténor Firmin knew that premise to be false.</p>



<p>“Human beings everywhere are endowed with the same qualities and defects, without distinctions based on color or anatomical shape,” Firmin wrote in French in his 1885 book, <em>The Equality of the Human Races</em>. “The races are equal.”</p>





<p>Firmin was ahead of his time. Today, genetic research confirms that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">human populations cannot be divided</a> into distinct racial groups.</p>



<p>But few scholars in the nascent field of anthropology, or any other contemporaries, read his treatise. Instead, leaders in the field were deeply influenced by the French white supremacist Arthur de Gobineau’s four-volume <em>Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races</em>, published in the 1850s. Against that backdrop, in 1859, Paul Broca, a French physician and brain researcher interested in the study of human origins, founded the Société d’Anthropologie de Paris, one of the first anthropological societies in Europe. Broca believed he could use skull measurements to identify human populations, which could then be categorized into a racial hierarchy. When Firmin joined that society in the 1880s, such racist views had become foundational to anthropology.</p>



<p>Few anthropologists outside of Firmin’s native Haiti have heard of <em>The Equality of the Human Races, </em>anthropologist Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban of Rhode Island College in Providence wrote in <em>American Anthropologist</em> in 2000<em>.</em> “This is hardly surprising since most of the early [Black] pioneers of anthropology have only recently been brought to light.”</p>



<p>Those leaders include many other Haitians, such as doctor and writer Louis-Joseph Janvier, who wrote <em>The Equality of Races</em> in 1884, and politician Hannibal Price, who wrote <em>On the Rehabilitation of the Black Race by the Republic of Haiti </em>in 1900. American abolitionist Martin Delany wrote<em> Principia of Ethnology: The Origin of Races and Color</em> in 1879.</p>



<p>Firmin would probably still be languishing in near-total obscurity if not for an English translation of his book that came out in 2000. Following that publication, a small number of anthropologists and other social scientists began calling for Firmin to be recognized as a founding father of anthropology. His arguments, after all, predated by several decades similar arguments by the German-American scholar Franz Boas, often considered the father of modern anthropology. Like Firmin, Boas argued that race was a cultural construct.</p>



<p>Firmin was among the first to view anthropology as the study of all humankind, rather than the more divisive approach common in his day, says Fluehr-Lobban, who wrote the introduction to the English translation.</p>



<p>Firmin also brought to his book a deep scientific rigor that was not yet common in the field. His highest priority was that “the case be made on the facts,” Fluehr-Lobban says. &nbsp;</p>





<h4>No evidence for racial hierarchies</h4>



<p>Firmin was born in the northern town of Cap-Haitien in 1850 to a working-class family. He grew up at a time of tremendous national pride. Haiti achieved independence from France in 1804, making it the first free Black republic in the world and the first independent nation in the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="503" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042023_SG_firmin_inline.jpg" alt="An image of a large group Haitian soldiers fighting against a group of French soldiers with rifles and bayonets." class="wp-image-3124379" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042023_SG_firmin_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042023_SG_firmin_inline-518x383.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042023_SG_firmin_inline-608x450.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042023_SG_firmin_inline-251x186.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124379">After a revolution spanning more than a decade, Haiti achieved independence from France in 1804, making it the first free Black republic in the world.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124379">Auguste Raffet</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a young adult, Firmin studied law, which led to a career in politics. He served as the inspector of schools in Cap-Haitien and as a Haitian government official in Caracas, Venezuela. He married his neighbor, Rosa Salnave, in 1881. In 1883, Firmin became Haiti’s diplomat for France and moved to Paris.</p>



<p>Firmin, like many scholars of his day, read across fields, Fluehr-Lobban says. That led him to become interested in the study of humankind. While in Paris, Firmin spoke of this interest with French physician Ernest Aubertin, who invited him to join the Société d&#8217;Anthropologie de Paris.</p>



<p>It did not take long for Firmin to question his membership in a group openly hostile to people who looked like him. Faced with such a tough environment, Firmin remained silent at meetings. He acknowledges this reluctance to strike up a debate with other society members in his book’s preface: “I risked being perceived as an intruder and, being ill-disposed against me, my colleagues might have rejected my request without further thought.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Firmin penned his 451-page rebuttal, using a title that clearly contradicted de Gobineau’s influential work.</p>



<p>On a general level, Firmin takes aim at the nonscientific tenor of many society members’ arguments. “On the one hand, there is a dearth of solid principles in anthropological science at this point; on the other hand, and precisely for this reason, its practitioners, with their methodical minds, are able to construct the most extravagant theories, from which they can draw the most absurd and pretentious conclusions,” Firmin writes in a chapter devoted to dismantling the then-popular classification of races using cranial measurements.</p>



<p>Firmin uses the bulk of the book, though, to flesh out his argument in precise detail. For instance, Firmin conducts a thorough analysis of the physical factors that were purported to separate the races, such as height, size, muscularity and cranium shape. He then painstakingly combs through the data to debunk prevalent theories of racial hierarchies.</p>



<p>“What can we conclude here from these observations? Can we find here any indication of hierarchy at all?” he queries at one point in reference to a chart on brain volume. The question is rhetorical. The measurements of supposedly distinct racial groups instead often overlap. Nor do the measurements conform to established racial hierarchies. “It is all so very anarchic,” he concludes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The power of Firmin’s writings stem from his deep commitment to following the evidence, says Niccolo Caldararo, an anthropologist at San Francisco State University. “His criticism of European, especially French scientists, was so careful, was so precise, was so perfectly defined that he undermined their practice as bias rather than empiricism.”</p>



<h4>Firmin’s modern-day relevance</h4>



<p>The translation of Firmin’s text came out of a chance encounter between Fluehr-Lobban and a Haitian student in her Race and Racism class in 1988. That student approached Fluehr-Lobban and asked if she had ever heard of Firmin. She had not but was intrigued.</p>



<p>In collaboration with Asselin Charles, a Haitian-born literary scholar then at neighboring Brown University, the duo set out to find a copy of the book. That turned out to be no easy feat. “There were three copies in the United States,” Fluehr-Lobban says. “One of them was in the Library of Congress.”</p>



<p>To Fluehr-Lobban’s surprise, upon receiving her request, library staffers sent her the book. Charles served as translator. “As a result of this book coming out in English, it had a whole new life,” Fluehr-Lobban says. Still, she adds, the book has yet to get its due: “It has not gotten into the canon of anthropology.”</p>



<p>Fluehr-Lobban hopes that will change, especially given the book’s modern-day relevance. Despite clear evidence that race has no biological basis, some scientists still use the concept as an organizing principle. And racism remains prevalent.</p>



<p>“This was a critical race theory book [written] in 1885,” Fluehr-Lobban says.</p>



<p>Firmin, however, remained optimistic that science would eventually get the last word. “Truth is like light: one may hide it for as long as human intelligence can conceive, it will still shine in the cellar where it has been related; at the least opportunity, its rays will pierce the darkness and, as it shines for all, it will compel the most rebellious minds to bend before its laws,” he wrote. “Science owes all its prestige only to this power, to this intransigence of the truth.” &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spleen-ultrasound-treatment-inflammation">Stimulating spleens with ultrasound hints at a treatment for inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <p>We typically think of using ultrasound to take pictures of our organs and tissues to check if they are healthy. But a slight tweak to the tool might lead to treatments for certain diseases, scientists suggest.</p>



<p>Stimulating people’s spleens with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X23017436#abs0015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrasound waves appears to briefly reduce a sign of inflammation</a> in samples of their blood, researchers report in the May–June issue of <em>Brain Stimulation</em>. If validated in further studies, the results could lead the way toward a noninvasive therapy for chronic inflammation, the team says.</p>





<p>The ultrasound waves used in the new study are more intense than what’s used to generate images, and they’re specially designed to stimulate nerves. Past research on targeting different brain areas or the spinal cord with such intense sound waves has shown potential for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00549/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treating neurological diseases</a>. And when directed at the liver, the technique — called focused ultrasound stimulation, or FUS — has helped to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00870-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce signs of diabetes</a> in mice, rats and pigs.</p>



<p>It “is a pretty active area of research right now,” says neurophysiologist Stavros Zanos of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Long Island, New York.</p>



<p>Zanos and his team wondered whether FUS targeted at the spleen could help to tamp down inflammation. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/not-so-dispensable-spleen">spleen</a> stores and filters blood (<em>SN: 7/30/09</em>). When something goes awry anywhere in the body and a distress signal is sent via the blood, immune cells in the organ know about it. So do cells in the splenic nerve, which reacts to the signal by telling immune cells how strong of an inflammatory response to initiate.</p>



<p>Zanos’ group recently showed that targeting rodents’ spleen with FUS <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08750-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to reduce inflammation</a>. “It was about time to test [the technique] in humans to see if it has any chance of working,” he says.</p>



<p>The team administered FUS to 60 healthy people, in slightly different locations of the spleen and at different intensities. Researchers then exposed a blood sample drawn from each of 60 participants who had FUS and 10 who did not to a type of toxin that would normally trigger an inflammatory response. (For safety reasons, the team could not directly expose the participants to the toxin.)</p>



<p>One hallmark of an inflammatory response is that white blood cells release a blood protein called TNF, tumor necrosis factor. The more TNF, the larger the response. All samples from participants who received FUS, regardless of the intensity or location, had about a third the amount of TNF — 300 picograms per milliliter on average — than samples from individuals who had not had the treatment, suggesting the treatment dampened overall immune response. The effect seen in the blood sample lasted more than two hours, and there were no safety issues with FUS, the team reports.</p>



<p>“This really portrays the strength of the ultrasound as a noninvasive intervention that can successfully modulate neurons,” says Jan Kubanek, a biomedical engineer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>But Kubanek has reservations about the applicability of the results because the inflammation test was done outside the body. He says he would like to see results showing that inflammation in the body drops after FUS, especially in people with chronic inflammation.</p>



<p>Practical challenges, such as the delivery and frequency of FUS treatments, could also stand in the way of spleen-targeted FUS leaving the lab, he says.</p>



<p>Zanos agrees. “There are so many questions of how applicable this therapy will be to treating real patients, even if it’s effective,” he says. “I think it&#8217;s an important thing for people to remember, especially patients who expect a lot from these new technologies,” he says. “We shouldn&#8217;t overpromise.”</p>

<p>A university in Japan has revoked the doctoral degree of a former student found to have manipulated images and graphs in a dissertation and two published papers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although our university has been working to raise awareness of research ethics in order to prevent research misconduct, it is extremely regrettable that such a situation has occurred,&#8221; Tohoku University President Hideo Ohno said in an <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/japanese/2023/03/news20230330-koho.html">announcement</a> made on March 30 (translated from the Japanese using Google Translate).</p>



<p>The school did not name the former student, who was first author on both papers. But details mentioned in its investigation <a href="https://www.bureau.tohoku.ac.jp/kenkyo/fb/files/rules/61.pdf">report</a> (in Japanese) point to a researcher called Nan Li. Li was also named on a <a href="https://blog.goo.ne.jp/lemon-stoism/e/2b2270b33aa72eae7f44283aa10e8e34">blog</a> in Japan that covered the case (in Japanese).&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127126"></span>



<p>We reached out to Tohoku for confirmation, but the school declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Google translation of Tohoku&#8217;s report, the former student admitted to &#8220;cutting and pasting&#8221; part of a figure in a paper and was found to have &#8220;deliberately committed misconduct.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since the fabrication/falsification involved fraudulent acts in an important part of Article 1 and affected the conclusion, the degree of maliciousness of the act was judged to be &#8216;high,'&#8221; the report states, noting that &#8220;the article was retracted immediately after publication.&#8221;</p>



<p>A paper titled &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/62/4/e1/6140782">Chloroplast proteotoxic stress-induced autophagy is involved in the degradation of chloroplast proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</a>&#8221; was published in 2021 in <em>Plant and Cell Physiology</em> and retracted the same year.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antidote-death-cap-mushrooms">Scientists may have found an antidote for death cap mushrooms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Death cap mushrooms get their name for a reason: The poisonous fungi can kill if ingested in even small amounts. But researchers may have found an antidote for one of the mushroom’s most deadly toxins.</p>



<p>A dye already used in medical procedures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37714-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can block damage from the mushroom’s alpha-amanitin toxin</a>, researchers report May 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The work was done with human cells grown in lab dishes and with mice. If the finding holds up in trials with people, the antidote has potential to save lives.</p>





<p>Death cap mushrooms (<em>Amanita phalloides</em>) are responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6621a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the majority of deaths from mushroom poisonings</a> worldwide. Symptoms may appear as soon as six hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If a person isn’t treated immediately, the toxins can cause liver and kidney damage that can lead to death within 48 hours after ingestion. There is no antidote currently available, but people can be treated with fluids, activated charcoal and other therapies.</p>



<p>How alpha-amanitin kills isn’t fully understood. A team of researchers in China and Australia used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9</a> to determine which human genes the toxin triggers to cause cell damage and death (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). One of those genes makes a protein called STT3B, which helps attach sugars to proteins. Scientists hadn’t known that that process was important for mushroom toxicity.</p>



<p>The team then screened a library of more than 3,000 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for molecules that could inhibit STT3B’s action. The team found that the dye indocyanine green could stop the protein from doing its job and prevent human cells in lab dishes from dying after being treated with alpha-amanitin.</p>



<p>In tests with mice poisoned with alpha-amanitin, the dye reduced liver and kidney damage and increased survival rates if given one to four hours after poisoning. Waiting eight to 12 hours to administer the antidote reduced its effectiveness, the team found, probably because irreversible organ damage had already occurred.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant emerging science—free  of charge, arXiv relies on members to support our mission with funding and expertise. The membership program is inclusive and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible, and complements arXiv’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">other funding sources, including affiliates and sponsors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  arXiv members—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">universities, libraries, research institutes, and labs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—contribute approximately 30% of arXiv&#8217;s operating budget, and this critical funding ensures arXiv&#8217;s ability to serve the global research community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A benefit of arXiv membership is access to an institution-specific </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard, containing an overview of the articles an institutions’ researchers have posted on the platform, including a subject category breakdown. We are happy to report that updated membership dashboards, based on data from 2020-2022, are now available to arXiv member institutions. In addition, </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/reports/2022_institution_submissions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated worldwide submission ranks by organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are openly available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information on how to access the dashboards has been provided to member institutions by email.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Member institutions who did not receive notification or who have questions about the dashboard should contact </span><a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">membership@arXiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deliberate-ignorance-knowledge-stasi">Deliberate ignorance is useful in certain circumstances, researchers say</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1961, renowned German novelist Günter Grass openly criticized communist East Germany for building the Berlin Wall ostensibly to prevent West Germans from infiltrating the country. In reality, the wall was more effective at preventing East Germans from defecting.</p>



<p>From that point on, East German secret police known as the Stasi shadowed Grass, a West German who frequently visited his neighbors to the East. In their notes, the Stasi refer to Grass with the code name “Bolzen,” or Bolt. When Germany was reunited in 1990, the Stasi’s file on Bolzen contained over 1,200 pages.</p>





<p>While extreme, Grass’ case was not unique. For 40 years, the Stasi wiretapped homes, bugged phones and encouraged people to come forward with information about potential government dissenters. Today, the Stasi Records Archives, housed throughout Germany, are so vast that if measured end to end, they would span 111 kilometers.</p>



<p>Following the reunification of Germany, government leaders made those records public. They assumed that most people living in former East Germany would want to find out if a file on them existed and, if so, read it. Knowledge, it was widely believed, would help people reclaim their life stories.</p>



<p>The East German regime controlled so many aspects of people’s lives, says cognitive psychologist and decision scientist Ralph Hertwig of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. Officials could decide whether someone in the country could go to university, or get a person fired from their job without explanation. They could arrest people in stealth so that their loved ones had no way of knowing where they had gone. Why would people not want to know what prompted such decisions or, perhaps, who betrayed them?</p>



<p>“At first glance, it seems there are many good reasons to want to find out,” Hertwig says.</p>



<p>That sentiment aligns with the conventional wisdom that knowledge tends to be always beneficial or desirable, say Hertwig and others. But that’s not what he and historian Dagmar Ellerbrock of the Technische Universität Dresden in Germany learned.</p>



<p>More people did not read their files than read them, the researchers found in an unpublished survey of over 2,300 residents of former East Germany. In a new paper, the team surveyed 134 former East Germans who opted out of reading their files to better understand their rationale. That survey, along with in-depth interviews with another 22 participants, revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722002359#:~:text=Our%20findings%20reveal%20a%20diverse,system&#039;s%20authority%20over%20the%20files." target="_blank" rel="noopener">people deliberately, rather than passively, chose ignorance</a>, the scientists reported in the December <em>Cognition.</em> &nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding aligns with other research showing that, under certain conditions, deliberate ignorance about certain matters also has merit.</p>





<h4>‘A veil of ignorance’ can be useful</h4>



<p>Imagine having to create a society from scratch, but with a hitch. You know nothing about yourself —&nbsp; such as your gender, economic status, nationality, education level or even appearance. What if you create a patriarchy and find out you’re female, or you block immigration only to find out you are an immigrant yourself? U.S. philosopher John Rawls developed this thought experiment in his 1971 book <em>A Theory of Justice </em>to show how operating behind a “veil of ignorance” could lead to a fairer society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The veil of ignorance is the idea that sometimes … knowledge may distract us, may bias us,” Hertwig says.</p>



<p>That thought experiment has played out in various ways in real life. For instance, in a seminal study, economists showed how creating a veil of ignorance around hiring decisions can override human bias. That is, placing music directors behind a shield — a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.90.4.715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literal veil of ignorance</a> — during auditions led to substantially more women gaining a seat in symphony orchestras, researchers reported in 2000 in the <em>American Economic Review.</em></p>



<p>In a similar vein, many East Germans chose their own veil of ignorance to protect themselves and others, Hertwig and Ellerbrock’s research suggests.</p>



<p>A survey of the 134 individuals who chose not to view their files revealed that more than 75 percent of participants cited the information as irrelevant because the past couldn’t be changed and thus didn’t need to be revisited. Over half said they did not want to know if their informants included colleagues, family or friends. And roughly 30 percent of respondents doubted their files would even reflect the truth. In effect, by denying the Stasi claim to their story, people stripped the regime of their power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That appears to have been Grass’ stance. “These Stasi files were like a poison because they were seen as valid documents. What they said had to be true,” Grass once said. “People trusted the statements and did not consider that large parts were exaggerated or even made up.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Choosing not to know</h3>



<p>After the fall of East Germany, officially known as the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, people were given access to the files kept on them by the East German secret police, the Stasi. But many chose not to read them. Researchers surveyed 134 individuals to find out why, offering 15 reasons. Here are the top 10 listed by percentage of individuals who cited each one.</p>

<h4>Why do people choose ignorance?</h4>



<p>The findings enhance a growing body of work by psychologists to understand when and why people choose to seek knowledge or, conversely, to remain ignorant.</p>



<p>In a study posted in January 2020 in <em>Nature Human Behaviour, </em>researchers suggested that people consider<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0793-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> three specific questions</a>: How useful is the information? How will the information make me feel? And does the information gel with my world view?</p>



<p>Those questions can help explain people’s decisions not to view their Stasi files, says study coauthor and cognitive neuroscientist Tali Sharot of the University College London. For one, the information was no longer useful or relevant once the East German regime fell. And the information in the files had a high likelihood of containing information that would make people feel bad. Knowing, in other words, felt more harmful than not knowing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rob MacCoun, a psychologist and law professor at Stanford University, likens the decision to people deciding not to get genetic testing for diseases with no cure. “Both cases suggest that there are situations in which people intuit that learning something will lead them down a path they don&#8217;t want to walk. It is a kind of mental hygiene,” he says, “and maybe there’s some wisdom in that.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What to do when knowledge is necessary</h4>



<p>For Sharot and many researchers studying deliberate ignorance, focusing on situations where ignorance represents a poor choice, rather than a worthy one, is the more pressing area of inquiry.</p>



<p>For instance, when people actively avoid information that might conflict with their view of the world, they can create dangerous echo chambers. “If someone is skeptical of climate change, they may not go out and seek information that suggests climate change is real,” Sharot says. But that ignorance imperils the health of the planet.</p>



<p>Research also shows that 10 percent of people who take an HIV test <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5525219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never come back</a> for the results. Such individuals probably choose ignorance out of fear, but they also put others at risk of contracting the disease, Sharot says.</p>



<p>Tweaking the message, when it comes to medical information, overcomes people’s desire not to know, Sharot’s unpublished work suggests. She and her team wanted to see how to get more people to receive potentially scary information on their predisposition for certain genetic diseases.</p>



<p>One group of study participants was told that the additional information would help them take precautionary measures to ward off a given disease’s onset. Another group received a more neutral message. Those receiving the helpful message were more likely than others to overcome their fears and agree to receive such information.</p>



<p>Hertwig agrees this research is essential. But digging into instances where ignorance makes sense, and no change in behavior is needed, also has important implications, he says. The study of East Germans, for instance, provides clues about how societies handle periods of political upheaval. Across time, societies have had to grapple with how to move on from oppressive regimes. Should the leaders of a new regime make all former leaders and informants atone for their sins? Or should they mostly put the past behind them and move on?</p>



<p>“There is no simple answer to the question,” Hertwig says. What makes sense in one society may not make sense in another.</p>



<p>In the case of the Stasi files, people’s decision to ignore information en masse was a way of taking power away from their former tormentors, Hertwig says, allowing citizens in the reunified Germany to build a new and more peaceful future.</p>

<p>In my prior career as an investigative science journalist and now as a whistleblower lawyer, I’ve seen institutions react to allegations of scientific fraud in two ways. </p>



<p>The first could be called “Investigate and Disclose.” This strategy was exemplified by Bell Laboratories’ 2002 investigation of allegations that Jan Hendrik Schön, a member of the technical staff, mishandled data. The allegations were published in <em>The New York Times</em> in May. In September, Bell Labs released a thorough report on its inquiry revealing fabrications in multiple <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em> papers, which were promptly retracted. The report made possible a 2009 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Fantastic-Biggest-Scientific-MacMillan/dp/0230224679">book</a> I wrote about the scandal, because once a proper investigation began (and it took a while to get going), the company clarified within months that Schön had faked his data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second, more common response is “Delay and Deny” or “Delay and Downplay,” which is a more common – but insidious – strategy. A Delay and Deny response is not helpful to anyone outside a tiny inner circle of administrators, irrespective of the merit of the allegations.</p>



<span id="more-127109"></span>



<p>Strategies in Delay and Deny/Downplay include taking years to conduct investigations and issuing platitudes about what was <em>not</em> found (no criminal intent, no pattern, no effect on scientific conclusions), as opposed to disclosing the facts that the investigation has uncovered, along with any conclusions that independent experts have drawn. The lack of detail from institutions compares unfavorably with the hard work from many whistleblowers to document their concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the legal system can shake out information or data that is otherwise being hidden. As a journalist, I once sued under the Freedom of Information Act and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/475020a">shed light on what had gone wrong in a fraud case</a> even without obtaining the record I originally sought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a legal context, Delay and Deny/Downplay can also become a costly institutional strategy. In 2019, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/duke-university-agrees-pay-us-1125-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations-related">Duke University paid $112.5 million</a> to settle a False Claims Act (“FCA”) lawsuit brought by a whistleblower who knew of multiple instances of data fabrication affecting federal grants. (John Thomas, the lead lawyer in that case, has written a three-part series about the FCA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/john-thomas/">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Duke case contrasts with a government investigation I participated in during law school in 2016. The investigation began after Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Harvard teaching hospital, disclosed internal concerns about the work of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/harvard-brigham-retractions-stem-cell/">Piero Anversa</a>, a stem cell pioneer. The amount of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/partners-healthcare-and-brigham-and-women-s-hospital-agree-pay-10-million-resolve">the eventual settlement</a> was $10 million – a favorable outcome when compared with Duke’s $112.5 million, for what I would estimate was fraud of a similar scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going public with allegations of misconduct can sometimes produce an appropriate community reckoning, as I found as a reporter. But after working for many years as an investigative journalist, I was propelled towards getting my law degree by research institutions that were so shameless about Delay and Deny/Downplay that they either did not care about negative media coverage or reacted to it by doubling down.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Recently, I&nbsp; created a new kind of whistleblower law firm, <a href="http://www.eugeniereichlaw.com/">Eugenie Reich Law LLC</a>. My new firm has two objectives that are especially relevant to whistleblowers of scientific fraud.</p>



<p>First, the firm will provide legal services, advice, and education to whistleblowers of research misconduct that will be independent of any research institution or journal, and that will not involve charging fees (unless the case results in a financial recovery, as discussed below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many scientists think too many lawyers are involved in research misconduct investigations already, the majority are paid by journals, research institutions, or scientists accused of fraud (who are sometimes but not always defended by institutions).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The imbalance in access to legal services between these organizations and the whistleblowers has resulted in many whistleblowers of scientific fraud being intimidated by libel threats, cease-and-desist demands, and confidentiality strictures. Indeed, even critics of bad science – put aside whistleblowers of fraud – sometimes feel afraid to call out mishandled data. Ironically, the greater the evidence for fraud, the harder it is to point out errors.</p>



<p>I intend the existence of my firm to go some way to change the imbalance. With the caveat that everything in this guest post is intended as general comments and not legal advice for any specific reader, I observe common mistakes by whistleblowers such as providing inadequate documentation (even when they possess more), or lack of clarity about what is being alleged and what steps are needed to investigate further. I also see situations in which it has been hard to nip retaliation in the bud, because it was not clear at the start that the critique being offered was, or might become, a fraud allegation. That said, I would still put the majority of the blame for the struggles of whistleblowers on aggressive tactics from institutional attorneys or administrators that warrant strategic rather than idealistic thinking in response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A second objective of my firm will be to seek legal accountability for research organizations that cover-up allegations of misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recoveries in egregious cases that I will bring using the FCA will be a lever for accountability and a source of revenue to sustain my firm, as whistleblowers can qualify for a percentage of the funding agency’s recovery and their lawyer can get paid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I expect that around half of the FCA cases I bring will involve frauds in fields that have more money in them than academia, areas such as technology, healthcare, and the pharmaceutical industry. At my former firm, for example, I served as a core member of <a href="https://www.taf.org/2022-lawyers-of-the-year-recipients/">a team that achieved a record settlement of $900 million</a> in a whistleblower lawsuit alleging kickbacks by a pharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Duke case shows, grant frauds can also be large. And I hope to encourage more scientists to consider the FCA to target small grant frauds in the interests of institutional transparency, even if the dollar amounts are modest.</p>



<p>I understand that some academic scientists feel that whistleblowers should not make any money from their allegations, but I am not afraid that recovering money discredit their motives, for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the timelines of events in good cases usually make clear that the whistleblower started asking questions long before they knew of any financial incentive to litigate the answers. Second, I detect a social shift in academia, with increasing recognition that many scientists are underpaid, and that too much of the funding and rewards are associated with hyping results rather than troubleshooting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It takes time to document a concern, fully investigate a situation, and explain the problems with other people’s data. If those who do so end up getting paid for that work by means of a law firm taking up their cause, that’s more likely than ever before to be seen as a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, nothing requires the whistleblowers who receive major windfalls to keep the money. A successful whistleblower can put their share of a government recovery back into research, or into a nonprofit dedicated to research transparency or other values that they care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, the share that goes to reward a whistleblower is less significant than the much larger amount deducted from institutional budgets. That’s a metric even the most cynical administrators or board of trustees understand.</p>

Colella and Eden B. King</a></p><p><em>Introducing the editors of&nbsp;</em>The Oxford Handbook of Workplace Discrimination<em>: Adrienne J. Colella is Professor and the McFarland Distinguished Chair in Business at Tulane University, and Eden B. King is Associate Professor of Industrial Organizational Psychology at George Mason University. Their work synthesizes research across psychology, sociology, and management, and inspires a new era of scientific practice on understanding and reducing workplace discrimination.</em></p><p><em>Adrienne and Eden share their insights on workplace discrimination and the future of work.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>What can organizations do to tackle workplace discrimination?</h2><p>Workplace discrimination cannot be eradicated by a single policy or process. Instead, organizations need to develop strategic, comprehensive initiatives that cut across levels, units, and talent management cycles. Aligned with such strategy, leaders need to be visibly committed and held accountable to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Ongoing transparent assessment and accountability for DEI will help to ensure positive change. Finally, organizations need to create and sustain a culture where respect, empathy, and justice are core values. &nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Leaders need to be visibly committed and held accountable to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>How can academic research practically reduce discrimination within organizations? &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><p>Academic research can help to inform practice by providing robust evidence regarding the unique experiences of people who face discrimination as well as the strategies that are most effective in addressing these issues. In other words, good science can inform good practice.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</h2><p>Leader development requires the opportunity to engage in a variety of challenging tasks and to receive feedback about performance. The specific nature of the experiences, and the ways in which feedback is transmitted, are constantly evolving with technology and the environment. At the core, then, leader development will be the same—challenging tasks and feedback—but the conditions will evolve. It is yet to be seen whether the nature of leadership and the traits and behaviors which make leaders effective will also change in a more remote world.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Like most things, the increase in remote work has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, many people have found flexibility for opportunities to engage with family and leisure activities. In addition, people with disabilities and chronic health conditions have found better access to work. On the negative side, however, remote work can create challenges for human connections, increase loneliness, and blur the lines between work and home in a manner that is exhausting. And, of course, many types of work (especially low wage jobs) cannot be done remotely, potentially exacerbating socioeconomic divides. Experience and evidence in the upcoming months and years will help us understand for whom, how, when, and where flexibility can yield the most positive effects.</p><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?&nbsp;</h2><p>Given the rapid, unexpected changes we have experienced in the last few years, this question is really difficult to answer. We expect that rapid advances in technology will come with both unforeseen advantages and disadvantages for employers and employees and that the notion of “going to work” will change. Beyond this, we can’t predict.&nbsp;</p><p><em><sub>Feature image credit: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/740890361/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/740890361/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f05%2fDiscrimination-Stock-Image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/740890361/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-joe-ungemah/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Joe Ungemah</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/05/an-inflation-proof-methodology-to-measuring-policy-effects-on-poverty/">An inflation-proof methodology to measuring policy effects on poverty</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/studying-ancient-tsunamis-is-all-about-glasses/">Studying ancient tsunamis is all about glasses</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radiation-belt-outside-solar-system">The first radiation belt outside the solar system has been spotted</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have spotted a band of radiation surrounding an object outside our solar system.</p>



<p>A belt of energetic electrons <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06138-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encircles a Jupiter-sized body about 18 light-years from Earth</a>, astronomers report May 15 in <em>Nature</em>. As the electrons move, they radiate radio waves. Such radiation belts give insight into the shape of a cosmic object’s magnetic field, its interior structure and maybe even whether it has moons.</p>



<p>In our solar system, every planet with a worldwide magnetic field has radiation belts. Earth has the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/how-earths-radiation-belt-gets-its-stripes">Van Allen belts</a>, rings of electrons captured from the sun (<em>SN: 3/19/14</em>). Jupiter’s radiation belts get most of their particles from the volcanic moon Io. In these cases, the planet’s magnetic field traps electrons in a bubble around the planet, like fireflies in a jar.</p>





<p>To find similar belts outside the solar system, astronomer Melodie Kao and colleagues observed a Jupiter-sized object called LSR J1835+3259 with a network of 39 radio dishes spanning from Hawaii to Germany. Together, the dishes effectively created a radio telescope about as wide as Earth, letting the team zero in on the object’s environment.</p>



<p>The team spotted a belt that looks a lot like those of Jupiter’s but 10 million times as bright, says Kao, of the University of California, Santa Cruz. The object is nearly 80 times as massive as Jupiter, making it either a diminutive star or a massive brown dwarf, a dim starlike body not hefty enough to sustain hydrogen fusion.</p>



<p>One big mystery is where the electrons come from. The object doesn’t orbit a star, and it doesn’t seem to emit flares. A volcanic satellite would fit the bill, Kao says, but that’s still speculative.</p>



<p>Knowing that LSR J1835+3259 has a radiation belt will help researchers interpret data from&nbsp;exoplanets in the future, even if astronomers can’t see such belts directly.</p>



<p>“Exoplanet magnetism is truly at its infancy,” Kao says. “Until we can characterize exoplanet magnetic fields, we&#8217;ll miss entire segments of their life stories.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-mutation-alzheimers-gene">A rare mutation helped one man stave off Alzheimer’s for decades</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rare genetic mutation never seen before protected a man with an inherited form of Alzheimer’s from developing the disease for decades.</p>



<p>He is the second person found to have such protection, following a report in 2019 of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colombia-family-genetic-mutation-alzheimers-dementia-treatment">a woman with a different mutation</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/20</em>). Both mutations may have staved off the disease for years by acting in similar ways in the brain, an insight that could lead to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02318-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new treatments for all forms of Alzheimer’s</a>, scientists report May 15 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>





<p>But some researchers are cautious about concluding too much from just two cases. “The results look very promising, but it would be useful to see replication in more samples,” says neurologist Rudolph Tanzi of Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new study. Still, the work is important as “it can serve as a useful guide for drug discovery,” he says.</p>



<p>Both the man and woman were members of a Colombian family who have a mutation in the <em>PSEN1</em> gene that causes the rare inherited variety of Alzheimer’s. People with “familial” Alzheimer’s usually start showing signs in their 40s. The more common “sporadic” form does not cause symptoms until people are in their 70s or 80s.</p>



<p>The woman stayed sharp into her 70s, while the man described in the new study was still mentally healthy at 67. “That means they were protected, because they should have gotten the disease 30 years earlier, and they didn’t,” says Diego Sepulveda-Falla, a neurologist at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany.</p>



<p>The woman had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a protective mutation in a gene closely linked to Alzheimer’s</a>, <em>APOE</em>. This mutation is known as the Christchurch variant, after the city in New Zealand where it was first found. The mutation identified in the new study was in a gene called <em>RELN</em>. Sepulveda-Falla and colleagues named this new mutation <em>RELN-COLBOS</em>, after a joint Colombia-Boston study that the man participated in. He died three years ago, at age 74, from other causes, and his family donated his brain for study.</p>



<p>The researchers compared the two cases, finding striking similarities and differences. Amyloid plaques, thought by many researchers to be deeply involved in Alzheimer’s, were abundant in both patients’ brains. But the woman had low levels of another possible Alzheimer’s culprit, clusters of proteins called tau tangles. The researchers think this is what spared her from dementia for decades, as tau is more tightly linked to symptoms than amyloid, researchers suspect.</p>



<p>In the Colombian man’s brain, the researchers found a different picture for tau. “Unlike the Christchurch case, this case was severely affected by tau,” Sepulveda-Falla says. “This shocked us initially, then we figured out we needed to roll our sleeves up and dig deeper.”</p>



<p>Some brain regions, notably the entorhinal cortex, which is important for memory and one of the earliest areas affected in Alzheimer’s, had been spared from the tau buildup, the team found.</p>





<p>The difference in tau between the two cases is due to where the two protective genes are active in the brain. In adults, <em>RELN</em> is active in only a few places, including the entorhinal cortex. <em>APOE</em> is active everywhere. “Since APOE is ubiquitous, in one patient you get protection all around,” Sepulveda-Falla says. “In this other, the protection is localized to [certain] neurons, and by chance they happen to be the neurons that are key for preserving cognition.”</p>



<p>Despite affecting different genes, both mutations produce proteins that attach to the same molecules on cells, and, ultimately, appear to reduce the formation of tau tangles. Sepulveda-Falla and colleagues confirmed this for the new mutation using mice genetically engineered to produce tau. Introducing the <em>RELN-COLBOS</em> mutation into these mice prevented tau buildup. This mechanism, common to both mutations, could be targeted by new treatments aiming to stave off all types of Alzheimer’s, the researchers say.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781250850881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Once Upon a Prime</a><br><em>Sarah Hart<br>Flatiron Books, $29.99</em></p>



<p>“Mathematical symbolism and metaphor are present in every kind of literature, from the humblest of fairy tales right through to <em>War and Peace</em>,” claims mathematician Sarah Hart. In <em>Once Upon a Prime</em>, she lays bare some of this hidden math and meaning in a host of poetry, novels and folklore.</p>



<p>She starts with nursery rhymes, often rife with counting — such as “One, Two, Buckle My Shoe” — showing how numbers bleed into our very first encounters with the world of words. This is not just through counting but also more subtly through the rhythms and rhyme patterns. It’s also through trebling — where a word or phrase is repeated three times, such as “Row, row, row your boat.”</p>





<p>The number three has a special hold on Western literature and languages in general. It pervades common phrases — “Three cheers for…,” “Ready, Set, Go,” “Learning your ABCs.” It’s also central to story structure; for example, trilogies are more prevalent than tetralogies. Characters tend to come in threes too, like “The Three Little Pigs,” and even in jokes like “A priest, a minister and a rabbi…”</p>



<p>Hart suggests this emphasis on three has some basis in geometry. Three is the minimum number of points that can define a two-dimensional shape, and the minimum number of sticks that can be bound to make a stable rigid structure, that is, a triangle. And the equilateral triangle is the only shape with both equal-length sides and equidistant corners. These geometric properties give the number three “a sense of strength and completeness, and also often of equitability,” Hart writes.</p>



<p>It’s a poetic argument, if not completely convincing. To bolster her case, she also points to trichotomies. Take a number, any number, and every other number is either more, less or equal to that number — a trichotomy that has direct parallels with Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean: “Every ethical virtue is a golden mean (just right) between two vices — one an excess, the other a deficiency,” as Hart describes it. This doctrine is playfully illustrated in Goldilocks’ experiences with porridge, chairs and beds.</p>



<p>For a book about math and literature, it’s not surprising that Hart focuses quite a bit on poetry, which is often defined by patterns of some sort. Perhaps more revelatory is her look at how math also molds the structure or pace of novels. </p>



<p>For example, I had noticed Amor Towles was not moving through time in a strictly linear fashion when I read his 2016 book <em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em>, but I completely missed how the number two orchestrates the story’s structure. The novel takes us through 32 years in the protagonist’s life, starting in 1922 when he begins living under house arrest. Each chapter advances in a roughly doubling interval of time since his sentence begins: the first day after, then the second, fifth, 10th, three weeks after, six weeks after and so on. Then from the middle of the book, the intervals climb down again, reversing the sequence.</p>





<p>Some readers may wonder if Hart’s love of math simply leads her to find patterns like this everywhere. But the odds must be astronomically high for the examples she presents to be mere chance.</p>



<p>Among the numerous math-loving authors Hart cites is Herman Melville, who steals the limelight for a good 10 pages that are sheer joy to read. Melville tended to lace his novels with so much philosophy and mathematics that his publisher worried about profitability. At one point, Melville promised his next novels would have “no metaphysics, no conic-sections, nothing but cakes &amp; ale.” He did not keep that promise. One of his next books was <em>Moby-Dick</em>. The novel is thick with math, from the concept of a quoin — a kind of lopsided wedge, which the main character Ishmael defines through geometric descriptions of a sperm whale’s head — to the analogy for how such a creature must see two distinct views of the world from eyes on either side of its head, “as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid.”</p>



<p>Cover to cover, Hart’s love of math fizzes off the page, such as when she implores readers to put down the book and twist a line of paper into a Möbius strip. She admits it’s a bit of a detour, but in her defense, it is leading up to a discussion of a 1974 short story called “Mobius the Stripper,” which has a particular kind of circular narrative.</p>



<p>Hart’s simple breakdowns of both math and literature make the book easy for anyone to follow, no matter their proficiency in either subject, though a familiarity with some of the math and literature references might make for a slightly more satisfying read. Not everyone will finish the book primed (ha!) to discover the mathematical gems hidden in a book or poem. But that takes little away from the charm of reading <em>Once Upon a Prime</em>, a joyous tour de force of mathematical and literary delights.</p>

<p>An article based on results from an online survey has been retracted for data issues, and an Australian university is investigating what happened.</p>



<p>The<em> </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471595323001142">article</a>, “International nursing students’ perceptions and experiences of transition to the nursing workforce &#8211; A cross-sectional survey,” became available online on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>



<p>Published in the journal <em>Nurse Education in Practice</em>, the study reported 110 responses to an online survey of nursing students who came to Australia from other countries and planned to remain there to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, posted this month, stated:</p>



<span id="more-127103"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the authors because the data reported in the manuscript are likely to have been compromised. It came to the co-authors’ attention after the publication of the article that a large proportion of the surveys reported in the study had been completed by a respondent using the first author’s IP addresses.</p>



<p>The authors would like to apologize to readers for this error.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Della John McKitterick of the University of South Australia, and the first author on the paper, seemed to dispute the information in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the respondents has used my username (not my IP address) to enter the data,” McKitterick told us. McKitterick, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5413-806X">whose ORCID profile</a> indicates she is a PhD student at the university, did not tell us how she learned of the data breach or respond to our follow up query about the discrepancy between the retraction notice and her statement regarding the IP address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of South Australia is investigating the matter, which McKitterick cited as her reason for not divulging further details. None of the article’s other authors replied to requests for comment.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the University of South Australia confirmed the ongoing investigation to <em>Retraction Watch</em> but declined to comment further.</p>



<p>Roger Watson, the editor-in-chief of <em>Nurse Education in Practice, </em>was unaware of McKitterick’s disagreement with the retraction notice but expressed an interest in correcting the note after we asked him about it.</p>



<p>Watson said he does not believe McKitterick was aware of the survey fraud in advance or its perpetrator.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The issue with this article was brought to our attention by the corresponding author of the article. They did the right thing as soon as they became aware of the problem with the data &#8211; beyond that we don’t know how they found this themselves. They helped us draft the retraction notice.</p>

<p>Mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, affect approximately one third of cancer patients and can negatively affect cancer prognosis. Despite the availability of effective psychological and pharmacologic treatments, around half of affected cancer patients globally do not access support for mental health disorders. Reasons include prioritization of cancer treatment and accepting mental distress as a normal state.</p>
<p>Supporting patients in their decision-making process can increase the uptake of mental health treatment. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools to assist patients by providing information about benefits and downsides of potential treatment options. While there are PDAs available for cancer treatment decisions and for mental health treatment decisions in the general population, there is no PDA to support cancer patients considering mental health treatment.</p>
<p>To address this gap, the authors of this paper developed a prototype PDA for cancer patients with anxiety and/or depression. They then sought feedback from both clinicians and patients as to the accuracy, acceptability, and usability. This feedback was used to improve the PDA so that it would provide clear and comprehensive information to support decision making for cancer patients with mental health disorders.</p>

<p>Ichthyosaurs were giant reptiles who roamed the seas in the Mesozoic era. Unlike most reptiles alive today, ichthyosaurs are thought to have been viviparous, giving birth to live young rather than to eggs. The prevailing theory on ichthyosaur birth has been that the fetus is oriented tail-first as an adaptation to being born underwater, due to asphyxiation risk.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper investigated the evolutionary origin of viviparity and the prevalence of tail-first vs. head-first birth in ichthyosaurs. Examining three fossils, they found that two showed tail-first orientation of the fetus and one showed head-first orientation.</p>
<p>The authors then compared ichthyosaur birth orientation to that of other viviparous reptiles, extant and extinct, and aquatic mammals. Based on their findings, they conclude that asphyxiation risk is unlikely to be a driver of selection for birth orientation in ichthyosaurs or more generally. Rather, body shape likely determines preferred birth orientation, with features such as neck flexibility and pelvic girdle width affecting birth dynamics.</p>

<p>Suicide is a major health concern in Pakistan, with pesticide poisoning reported as one of the leading causes of death by suicide. However, the problem is understudied, partially due to a lack of national suicide data.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the scope of the problem and to determine the most commonly used pesticides for suicide, the authors of this study conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. The pesticides identified in the studies were grouped by hazard level and legal status in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The review identified two commonly used pesticides responsible for the majority of the identified cases of self-poisoning, but found that the reported data was incomplete. The authors propose changes to regulation and availability of highly hazardous pesticides that could reduce their use in suicide, as well as comprehensive data collection to allow the problem to be studied more closely and better policies to be enacted.</p>

<p>Preterm birth, before 37 weeks gestation, is a risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. While many pregnant women who present with threatened preterm labor go on to deliver at term with no intervention, women who progress to preterm labor require timely interventions to delay birth and support fetal development. Ultrasound measurement of the cervix can allow for accurate prediction of risk and determining which women require intervention, however it is difficult and not universally available.</p>
<p>Another way to measure preterm birth risk in women with threatened preterm labor is with biomarkers. The authors of this paper studied the use of quantitative measurement of fetal fibronectin in vaginal secretions in order to predict preterm birth in women with symptoms of preterm labor. They found that increasing concentrations of fetal fibronectin correlated with increasing rates of preterm birth. They also determined specific thresholds for reliable prediction of birth within two days and within two weeks of testing.</p>
<p>These thresholds allow for classifying risk of preterm birth into very low, intermediate, and high. Women at very low risk of preterm birth could be managed with monitoring only, rather than with interventions, reducing the use of unnecessary interventions.</p>

While it is known that simpler spots on the wings of pierid butterflies share some genetic circuitry with nymphalid eyespots, they have not been as thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>To facilitate investigation into the genetic basis of pierid spots, the authors of this study generated a high-quality draft genome for <i>Pieris canidia</i>, the Indian cabbage white butterfly. They then used differential gene analysis on very small pieces of pupal wing tissue sampled from in and around the developing spot region to identify the genes involved in spot formation and compared these to those involved in eyespot formation in nymphalid butterflies.</p>
<p>Among the genes identified as contributing to spot development were pigmentation genes, transcription factors, and signaling pathways. Some of these signaling pathways are also used in nymphalid eyespot development. Further research is needed to determine if these are evolutionarily conserved pathways or represent convergent evolution in different lineages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sonoran-desert-toad-psychedelic-animal-chemistry">The Sonoran Desert toad can alter your mind — it’s not the only animal</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The adage “all attention is good attention” may be true for marketers — not so for the Sonoran Desert toad. Last fall, the U.S. National Park Service sent out a message on Facebook asking visitors to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=503416565159338&amp;set=a.227456602755337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“refrain from licking” the toad</a> (technically <em>Incilius alvarius</em> but commonly called <em>Bufo alvarius</em>). That message came months after a <em>New York Times </em>article covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/toad-venom-psychedelic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the booming interest in the psychedelic compound</a> that the toad excretes from its skin — along with the “poaching, over-harvesting and illegal trafficking” that have accompanied that interest.</p>



<p>People don’t typically lick the toads to get high, says Robert Villa, a community outreach specialist at the University of Arizona’s Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill. The secretions the toads produce are toxic when ingested. They “work orally, through the mucous membranes, and cause really dangerous side effects, like cardiac arrest,” Villa says.</p>





<p>Instead, for decades, people have been collecting the secretions, then drying and smoking them. When inhaled, a compound within, 5-MeO-DMT, can cause auditory and visual hallucinations. “It’s a very powerful psychedelic sometimes called the ‘God molecule,’ ” says pharmacologist and chemist David Nichols of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>The drug’s growing popularity could be bad news for toad populations. “If you relocate it outside of its home territory,” Villa says, which often happens when people collect a toad for its secretions, “it gets lost and its chances for survival go way down.” What’s more, collecting large numbers of toads increases the risk of disease transmission, like chytrid fungus, between toads.</p>



<p>We at <em>Science News</em> heard the PSA loud and clear: Just leave this toad alone. But we couldn’t help but wonder: What other amazing animals may have psychedelic potential? Join us on a tour, by land and sea, of some of the world’s mind-altering fauna.</p>



<h4>Sonoran Desert toad (<em>Incilius alvarius</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>The Sonoran Desert, in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="471" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of a Sonoran Desert toad siting on small rocks." class="wp-image-3124366" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-553x383.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-650x450.jpg 650w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline1-269x186.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124366">The Sonoran Desert toad secretes an enzyme that converts bufotenine, a compound also made by other toads, into 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful hallucinogen related to the psychedelic drug DMT.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124366">HOLGER KRISP/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 3.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>All toads secrete toxins from their skin. These secretions, whose specific compounds vary from species to species, probably evolved as a way to keep a toad’s body moist. Over time, the compounds, which can also act on the brain and affect heart muscle when ingested, came to aid in self-defense.</p>



<p>But the Sonoran Desert toad, also known as the Colorado River toad, appears to have taken evolution one step further.</p>





<p>The toad, one of the largest in North America, secretes an enzyme that converts bufotenine, a compound also made by other toads, into 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful hallucinogen related to the psychedelic drug DMT.</p>



<p>A frightened Sonoran Desert toad gushes its toxic mix, which includes 5-MeO-DMT, from its parotoid glands — located behind each eye — and from glands on its legs. It’s a way to say, “Please don’t eat me! I don’t taste good!” When swallowed in large quantities by a potential predator, the toxins can cause coma, cardiac arrest and even death.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t yet sure why the Sonoran Desert toad produces 5-MeO-DMT, and why it is the only toad known to make it. “There’s a lot of mystery,” Villa says.</p>



<h4>Giant monkey frog (<em>Phyllomedusa bicolor</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>The Amazon Basin in South America</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2.jpg" alt="A photo of a giant monkey frog resting on the fingers of a person." class="wp-image-3124367" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline2-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124367">Some people who use kambô, the toxic secretion produced by the giant monkey frog, report having spiritual experiences.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124367">© BEASTMASTER/INATURALIST (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s no scientific consensus on whether kambô, the name for the toxic secretion produced by the giant monkey frog, should be considered a psychedelic. The term psychedelic comes from Greek meaning “mind manifesting,” Nichols says. “You can imagine, it’s enhancing the properties of your mind, rather than just intoxicating you.” Other compounds such as stimulants and depressants modify the activity of the brain, but they don’t leave users with the kind of new insights and memorable experiences that come with psychedelics.</p>



<p>Wuelton Monteiro, a tropical medicine researcher at the Universidade do Estado do Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, points to a 2020 study in <em>Scientific Reports</em> as an example of why the classification has been unclear. In the small study, nearly half of participants <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who reported using kambô</a> said they had a spiritual experience, and some experiences came with what resembled the afterglow often associated with hallucinogens. But kambô doesn’t activate the 5-HT2A receptor, a protein that senses the chemical messenger serotonin, while classic psychedelics do.</p>



<p>Among Indigenous populations in the southwestern Amazon, the frog’s skin secretions have been used for centuries as a stimulant in shamanistic rituals. According to Villa, the secretions are usually applied on small, superficial burns on the body to increase the stamina of hunters.</p>



<p>In predators attempting to gobble the frog, kambô might cause regurgitation, seizures and a change in heart function. Researchers are still trying to decipher the specific compounds that explain these effects, but they do know that species of <em>Phyllomedusa</em> collectively produce over 200 short protein fragments that can influence body function. Some might <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be promising for future medicines</a>.</p>



<h4>California harvester ant (<em>Pogonomyrmex californicus</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>Southwestern United States and northern Mexico</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3.jpg" alt="A close up photo of eight California harvester ants standing on sand." class="wp-image-3124368" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline3-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124368">Indigenous peoples of central California once ate California harvester ants during rituals including vision quests.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124368">© MATT REALA/INATURALIST (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The venom of the California harvester ant is made up of enzymes that aren’t known to cause hallucinations on their own, but the Indigenous peoples of central California once ate them during rituals including vision quests. Ethnographic reports suggest people would swallow hundreds of live ants in balls of eagle down feathers. No doubt the people were stung, likely on the insides.</p>



<p>Justin Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwestern Biological Institute and University of Arizona in Tucson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/science/justin-o-schmidt-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who died in February</a>, said the pain of being stung by so many ants, along with extreme cold, fasting and in some cases sleep deprivation, triggered hallucinations that connected the people with spiritual guides.</p>



<p>A harvester ant’s sting is “nothing like a bee sting,” Schmidt wrote in<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-books-deliver-double-dose-venomous-animal-facts"> <em>The Sting of the Wild</em></a> (<em>SN: 8/6/16, p.&nbsp;26</em>). “The pain is intense, comes in waves, and is deeply visceral.” Lasting from four to eight hours, the pain is accompanied by a numb sensation at the site of the sting. The ants deliver stings to defend their colonies from large predators, including lizards, birds and people. (Smaller enemies such as other insects and spiders are bitten.)</p>



<p>A person who eats 1,000 ants would probably die; according to Schmidt’s book, one ant is enough to kill a mouse. But some predators have defenses: The regal horned lizard (<em>Phrynosoma solare</em>) has a mucus lining its mouth and digestive system that allows it to eat hundreds of ants and a substance in its blood that neutralizes the venom. Some birds somehow avoid getting stung too.</p>



<p>It’s hard to get more information on how the ants were used in rituals and the nature of the experience. Disease and violence that came with Westerners during California’s gold rush destroyed the Indigenous communities in the Central Valley and their way of life.</p>



<h4>Salema (<em>Sarpa salpa</em>)</h4>



<p><strong>Habitat: </strong>Temperate and tropical ocean waters, from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-675x450.jpg" alt="A close up photo of a Sarpa Salpa fish on a black background." class="wp-image-3124369" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_psychedelic_inline4.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124369">Some fish including <em>Sarpa salpa</em> can cause auditory and visual hallucinations when eaten.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124369">BRIAN GRATWICKE/FLICKR (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 2.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fishes including this species of sea bream, as well as some sea chubs and clownfish, can cause auditory and visual hallucinations when eaten, though reports are rare. <em>Sarpa salpa</em> was known as the “dream fish” in ancient Rome, according to<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00153/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a 2018 review of psychedelic fauna</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em>. Two cases of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16615678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hallucinatory fish poisoning</a> were documented in 2006 in the journal <em>Clinical Toxicology</em>. In one case, a 40-year-old man ate baked <em>S. salpa</em> and later experienced hallucinations of screaming animals and giant arthropods surrounding his car. The symptoms went away, with medical attention, 36 hours after he ate the fish.</p>



<p>Researchers don’t know what compounds cause this ichthyoallyeinotoxism, or fish poisoning, which can include nightmares. Evolutionary biologist Leo Smith of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, who studies fish history and diversification, says he and other scientists suspect that the compounds are a by-product of the fishes’ diets.</p>



<p>But ichthyoallyeinotoxism is distinct from two other forms of fish poisoning. Symbiotic bacteria within puffer fish produce a neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, or TTX, that can cause paralysis and death. And ciguatera fish poisoning comes from eating fish contaminated with a neurotoxin produced by some dinoflagellates. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting and weakness, as well as a reverse sensory disruption, where hot things seem cold and vice versa. But it does not cause hallucinations, says Sandric Leong, a biological oceanographer at the National University of Singapore.</p>



<p>How and why many of these neurotoxins are produced is still being worked out. “There are so many relationships with the marine environment which we are not very sure of,” Leong says.</p>

<p>The pitted sponge and some other sponges including <em>Smenospongia aura</em> and <em>S. echina</em> contain 5-bromo-DMT and 5,6-dibromo-DMT. Because of their relationship with the psychedelic drug DMT, these compounds are plausible psychedelics. American chemist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/dr-ecstasy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Shulgin</a>, famous for his research into psychedelic compounds and for introducing the world to the synthetic hallucinogen MDMA, or ecstasy, and his wife Ann Shulgin wrote in <em>TIHKAL: The Continuation</em> that they don’t know whether the sponge compounds are activated by smoking or not. They are, however, “quantitatively reduced to DMT by stirring under hydrogen in methanol, in the presence of palladium on charcoal.”</p>



<p>The pitted sponge is known to concentrate in its tissue chemicals called monoamines that can modify the behavior of nerve cells. Not only can these compounds make the sponge taste bitter, but they can also alter the behavior of predatory fish that dine on the sponge.</p>



<p>“They wouldn’t prevent the fish from ever trying to take a bite, but it would prevent it from persisting or consuming the sponge any beyond an initial several bites,” says Mark Hamann, a pharmacologist from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</p>



<p><em>V. rigida</em>’s ability to alter animal behavior intrigued Hamann, who reported in a 2008 study in the <em>Journal of Natural Products</em> that 5,6-dibromo-DMT <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918908/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acted like an antidepressant</a> in rats, while 5-bromo-DMT acted like a sedative. Hamann says that related compounds may one day be isolated and might make for promising antidepressants, anxiety-reducing drugs or pain relievers in people.</p>
