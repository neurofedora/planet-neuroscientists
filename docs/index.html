                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Alireza Poshtkohi will talk about his PhD research in the talk entitled: &quot;Mathematical Modelling of Plasma Membrane Electrophysiology and Calcium Dynamics in Microglia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Microglia, a type of glial cell, perform many tasks while interacting with neurons,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Despite moderate advances in the characterisation of
microglia in laboratory rodents, very little information is known about the physiology of
microglia in the human brain. This is a challenging task and consequently this research
attempts to advance knowledge of microglia function through mathematical modelling.
Microglia restructure their intracellular actin cytoskeleton to enable motility; this
requires a complex molecular cascade involving a set of ionic channels, membrane-coupled
receptors, and cytosolic components. In this research, we develop a theoretical foundation
for studying P2-mediated calcium and PI3K/Akt signalling in human microglial cells.
Firstly, a detailed mathematical model is built for the dynamics of human P2XRs in
microglia. Subsequently, experimental whole-cell currents are used to derive the
P2X-mediated electrophysiology of human microglia (sodium and calcium dynamics, and
membrane potential). Secondly, microglial-directed motility involves a complex family of
intracellular signalling pathways that are mainly controlled by P2Y-mediated cytosolic
calcium (Ca2+) signalling and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This work addresses the
development of mathematical models for these two complex aspects of microglial functions
and investigates the interconnecting role of PI3K pathway to Ca2+.
Our predictions reveal new quantitative insights into how P2Rs regulate ionic concentrations
in terms of physiological interactions and transient responses. Simulation results show that
kink-like, intricate Ca2+ responses mediated by P2XRs arise from a complex cooperative
activation of both P2XRs, and ionic extruders and pumps. More importantly, the proposed
model supports our hypothesis that calcium influx via P2YR and P2XR can explain the
experimentally observed twin peaks in the phosphorylated Akt. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first biophysical model that aims to predict complicated Akt and
P2-mediated Ca2+ responses in microglia. The biophysical models provide direction for new
fundamental experimental research.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541601826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Math Real?</a><br><em>Eugenia Cheng<br>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>Every mathematician has a story that goes something like this. You’re at a party, and someone asks what you do for a living. “I’m a mathematician,” you say. “You must be a genius!” they reply. Or perhaps you end up being an impromptu therapist to someone who needs to vent about traumatic experiences they had in math class decades ago. </p>



<p>Mathematics is treated with both reverence and fear: People often see math as an objective, apolitical tool that can buttress or refute arguments, but they also feel intimidated and anxious when they think they might have to use it.</p>





<p>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng has spent much of her career working to alleviate those anxieties. As scientist in residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she teaches mathematics to artists, many of whom have never seen themselves as “math people.” She has also written several books, for both adults and children, that seek to cultivate mathematical curiosity and illustrate some of the ways mathematical thinking can enrich our lives. Her latest, <em>Is Math Real?: How Simple Questions Lead Us to Mathematics’ Deepest Truths</em>, demonstrates the ways that seemingly naïve questions can unlock fascinating journeys to understanding math for math’s sake, rather than purely in service of real-world applications.</p>



<p>Math has a reputation for supplying concise, black-or-white answers to questions. Getting straightforward math questions right or wrong is often presented as the litmus test of whether someone has mathematical ability. But that view of math is simplistic, Cheng explains. Rather than a tool for obtaining objective right answers, math is a method for asking questions and exploring the possibilities those questions raise.</p>



<p>Students are naturally curious about numbers and patterns, but math classes often teach them that math facts should be accepted without question. For instance, a student might learn that a prime number is defined as a whole number — a positive number without a fractional or decimal part — that is only divisible by itself and 1. The number 1, however, is not considered a prime number. If a student asks why not, they will likely be told it just isn’t; deal with it.</p>



<p>But in fact, there is a good reason to exclude 1 from the prime numbers. As Cheng describes, the prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of the whole numbers; every whole number greater than 1 can be broken down as a product of prime numbers. Because multiplying by 1 doesn’t do anything to a number, 1 isn’t needed to build the other whole numbers, at least when multiplication is considered. (For addition, it’s a whole different story.) Excluding 1 from the primes allows us to break every whole number greater than 1 down into a product of primes in only one way — 12 is the product of two copies of 2 and one copy of 3, for example, and cannot be broken down into any different set of primes. If 1 were a prime number, those products would no longer be unique. You could toss any number of 1s into the mix and still get the same product.</p>



<p>Mathematicians have found the uniqueness of these products useful for exploring properties of numbers, so they came to the consensus not to include 1 in the primes about a century ago. Considering the reasons mathematicians define primes precisely the way they do is more interesting than simply accepting the definition so you can get an A on a math test.</p>



<p>The prime number example is just one of many simple questions that Cheng poses in the book to motivate deep dives into the logical foundations of Western mathematics: Why does 1+1 = 2? Why does −(−1) = 1? Why does 2+4 = 4+2? And, yes, is math real? Cheng’s answers to those questions touch not only on our understanding of mathematics itself, but also on her personal experiences with math education as both student and teacher. </p>



<p>She also examines how mathematical thinking intersects with life within and outside of the classroom, from the subtle imperialism of the commonly used Mercator map projection, which inflates the perceived size of countries that were colonialist powers, to the parallels between open-mindedness to new mathematical ideas and open-mindedness to the experiences of marginalized groups in society.</p>



<p><em>Is Math Real?</em> will help readers understand the questions that drive mathematicians and encourage people to see the value of math in their own lives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strike-against-venus-lightning">Here’s another strike against Venus having copious lightning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Venus has long been depicted as having a hellish atmosphere. Despite that reputation, evidence increasingly suggests that our neighbor’s cloudy shroud isn’t riddled with lightning.</p>



<p>Last month, planetary scientists proposed that most if not all of the bright flashes observed in Venus’ atmosphere <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-atmosphere-meteor-lightning-space">could be explained by meteors</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/23</em>). Now, a separate team suggests that whistling electromagnetic waves often created by lightning on Earth and other planets are not sparked by lightning on Venus.</p>





<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">Parker Solar Probe</a> swung past the nighttime side of Venus on its way toward the sun (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). As it did, its instruments picked up radio waves that scientists have dubbed whistler waves. Such disturbances got their name because their frequency quickly changes from high to low before they disappear, says Harriet George, a space physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Oddly, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venus’ whistler waves were traveling downward toward the planet</a>, not up and away from it, as they would have been if they’d been caused by lightning, George and her team report in the Oct. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>An alternate source of energy for these whistler waves could be disturbances in Venus’ weak magnetic fields, the researchers suggest. As magnetic field lines shift and reconnect, they can release prodigious amounts of energy, George says. In other milieus, magnetic reconnections <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">accelerate the solar wind</a>, help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">heat the sun’s outer atmosphere</a> and help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watching-northern-lights-form">trigger Earth’s auroras</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/23; SN: 11/14/19; SN: 7/24/08</em>). They’ve got the right characteristics to create whistler waves on Venus too.</p>

For example, in a study published with her as senior author <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100355">Verdier et al. (2022)</a> on an entirely different topic, they showed that optogenetic stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle could be used to improve behavioral training of mice and replace water restriction protocols very effectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.07.536077">Lai, Tanaka et al. (2023)</a> from Albert Lee’s lab wrote a very cool paper where they made rats navigate mentally. In short, they used the spiking output of the hippocampus, which they extracted online, to control a virtual reality that (1) represented themselves in a spatial context (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;), or that (2) represented another object in a spatial context (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;). Using this approach, the authors tried to show that hippocampus represents mental navigation of the self but also mental navigation of objects in the external world.<br />A minor issue I had with the paper was that the authors write very prominently that they constructed a low-latency (&#8220;real-time&#8221;) closed-loop system, feeding back neuronal activity into the virtual environment. However, this ultra-fast feedback is first going through a decoder that uses a 5-s running window, basically eliminating the speed of the feedback loop. This secret is hidden somewhere in the Methods section.<br />In addition, I had the feeling that the claim of “mental navigation” would require slightly stronger evidence that the animal did not really move physically while performing “mental navigation”. The existing analyses could have been deepened a bit. However, in general I really liked the paper, both for its ideas and for its technical implementation of the brain-machine interface for rats. Definitely worth a read!<br />Let&#8217;s try to dig a bit into the conceptual space around this study. The manuscript made me wonder how different it is whether we mentally move objects (like tetris objects, &#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) or avatars (like in a 1<sup>st</sup> person video game, &#8220;mental navigation&#8221;). Do both situations feel the same for us? We do certainly identify with avatars viewed from a 3<sup>rd</sup> person perspective (as in many video games). The transition from 3rd person avatars (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;) to movable objects (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) seems pretty smooth from my perspective. A pixelized avatar from super mario feels almost like an object, and we treat pacman for sure like an avater, even though it is barely more than an object. There does not seem to be a sharp transition between an eating blob like pacman or snake to something less animated like a tetris element. It seems like introspection might be a good way to better understand how we as humans differentially treat virtual avatars or virtual objects in our mind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stem-cells-breast-cancer-spine">Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine</a></h4>

              
                <p>When breast cancer spreads, it often targets the spine. Now scientists may have finally discovered why.</p>



<p>A newfound kind of stem cell <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06519-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drives cancer cells to bones in the vertebrae</a>, pathologist Matthew Greenblatt of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues report September 13 in <em>Nature. </em>The find helps explain a long-standing mystery of metastasis: why some cancers break away from their site of origin, journey through the bloodstream and take up residence in the backbone.</p>





<p>“This is a major advance in our understanding of bone metastasis,” says Xiang Zhang, a cancer biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>In people with metastatic breast cancer, some 70 percent experience subsequent bone cancer. And of the bones in the skeleton, cancer cells preferentially seek out vertebrae. For these patients, “spine metastases are one of the most common complications,” Greenblatt says, “and one of the most dreaded.” Tumors that take root in the spine can crush the spinal cord, which houses nerve bundles crucial for body sensation and movement. Such damage can hamper people’s ability to walk and control their bladder and bowels, and shorten their life spans.</p>



<p>Doctors have known for decades that some cancers preferentially seek out the spine, Greenblatt says, but no one has had a good explanation for why. One idea proposed in 1940, that actions like coughing jolt blood off course and somehow send cancerous cells to the vertebrae, still hangs on today. It’s what Greenblatt learned when he was a medical student. But for him and his team, “that didn&#8217;t make sense to us scientifically.”</p>



<p>What did end up making sense was stem cells. The researchers had a hunch that stem cells inside vertebral bones differed from those in other sites in the skeleton, like the long bones in the arms and legs. In the lab, that’s just what they found. Greenblatt’s team pulled out a population of stem cells from mice vertebrae distinctly unlike ones collected from long bones. These new stem cells switched on a separate set of genes and behaved differently in experiments, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Until now, scientists didn’t know that these two types of bones held distinct populations of stem cells. “We assumed they were the same,” says Geert Carmeliet, a cell and molecular endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium who was not involved with the work, but wrote an accompanying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02768-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentary</a>. The team’s discovery raised the possibility that spinal stem cells might play a role in spinal disease.</p>

Sun <em>et al</em>./<em>Nature</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In one key experiment, Greenblatt’s team transplanted spinal stem cells into one hind leg of mice and long bone stem cells into the other. Each transplant formed miniature bones, or organoids, in the animals’ bodies — a tiny vertebra on the right, for example, and a bit of long bone on the left. Then, the researchers injected breast cancer cells into the mice and watched where they ended up.</p>



<p>The cells traveled to the mini vertebra nearly twice as often as they did to the little long bone, as if lured by a cancer-calling Pied Piper. It’s an elegant way to show that “tumor cells preferentially come to the [vertebra] organoid and not to the organoid of the long bone,” Carmeliet says.</p>



<p>The newly identified spinal stem cells, found in both mice and humans, secrete a protein called MFGE8 that acts as a tumor attractant, the team discovered, drawing cancer cells to spinal tissue. The protein may not be only factor involved, Greenblatt says, “but it&#8217;s an important one in driving tumor cells to the spine.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that blocking MFGE8 could prevent or treat spine metastasis. “I think it&#8217;s definitely worth further investigation,” Zhang says. But, he notes, it’s still too early to know what the therapeutic implications may be.</p>





<p>Greenblatt’s team is now exploring whether the new stem cells can recruit other types of tumor cells to the spine. When prostate cancer spreads, for example, it also tends to travel to vertebrae over other types of bone. He and his colleagues are also curious whether our bones may be hiding anything else. “We&#8217;re starting to think about what other stem cells may be left to discover in the skeleton.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-jet-nova-blast-m87-galaxy">The black hole–powered jet in galaxy M87 is making stars explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-speed gas shooting from the galaxy M87 is causing stars to go nova, a study suggests, and no one knows how.</p>



<p>A nova occurs after a dense star known as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">white dwarf receives gas from an orbiting star</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). As the white dwarf’s intense gravity squeezes the gas, it heats up and explodes, but both stars survive the violence. In fact, over millions of years, the same star goes nova again and again. Recent observations indicate that these eruptions forged much, and perhaps most, of the universe’s supply of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the valuable metal lithium</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>).</p>





<p>Nova explosions erupt in our galaxy as well as others, including the giant elliptical M87, whose jet of fast-moving gas is powered by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">black hole</a> at the galaxy’s center (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Now Hubble Space Telescope data show that there’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excess of these explosions along M87’s jet</a>, researchers report in a study submitted September 28 to arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Alec Lessing, an undergraduate student at Stanford University, Michael Shara, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and their colleagues used the telescope to locate 135 nova outbursts in M87, whose jet is many thousands of light-years long. The galaxy itself is 54 million light-years from Earth, at the heart of the nearest galaxy cluster, named Virgo.</p>

<p>After identifying the nova explosions, the team plotted their positions in the galaxy. “It was striking to the eye,” Shara says of the plot. “The novae appeared to be preferentially aligned with the jet.”</p>



<p>By dividing the galaxy into 10 equal sectors, the astronomers found that 25 blasts occurred along the jet — versus only 10 to 16 in each of the galaxy’s other sectors. The chance that this is just a statistical fluke is only about 0.3 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised,” says Massimo Della Valle, an astronomer at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in Naples, who was not involved with the new study. “If these objects are novae, the jet has to be responsible for this somehow.”</p>



<p>Perhaps, he says, the jet pushes interstellar gas onto white dwarf stars in nova systems, increasing the amount of material that accumulates on the stars’ surfaces. As a result, the white dwarfs explode more frequently than they otherwise would, accounting for the surplus of nova outbursts along the jet.</p>



<p>The jet itself, Shara says, doesn’t seem to supply enough gas or radiation to explain the explosions. “The jet is to blame, but we just don’t know why or how,” he says. “It is somehow causing the novae to be more prevalent in that sector, but whether it’s because it’s triggering the novae somehow or birthing the novae — making more of them there — or some other process … we don’t know.”</p>



<p>For additional clues, Shara hopes to use Hubble to examine other galaxies that resemble M87, to see whether their jets are also accompanied by such eruptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-genetically-modified-silkworms-spider-silk">In a first, genetically modified silkworms produced pure spider silk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spider silk is prized for its unrivaled strength and toughness. But figuring out a way to mass-produce it is no easy feat. Spiders cannot be put to work to pump out the fibers the way silkworms can: They’re extremely territorial and inclined to eat their neighbors, and they refuse to keep at the task for long. So for decades, scientists have tried to genetically-engineer various organisms — including bacteria, yeast, mice, hamsters and even goats — to produce spider silk, but with only partial success.</p>



<p>Now, for the first time, researchers from China have coaxed <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(23)00421-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure spider silk out of genetically modified silkworms</a>. The material is six times as tough as the Kevlar used in bulletproof vests, the team reports in the Oct. 4 <em>Matter</em>.</p>





<p>The fibers flaunt “better mechanical properties than anybody else has been able to show,” says molecular biologist Randy Lewis, a spider silk expert at Utah State University in Logan who wasn’t involved with the study.</p>



<p>The strands are not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silk">strong or as stretchy as natural spider silk</a>, but they are an advance (<em>SN: 11/7/08</em>). Previous work in silkworms generated weaker fiber blends of only 30 to 50 percent spider silk.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the complete instructions for making spider silk protein into silkworms and make sure the protein wound up in the silkworms’ silk-making glands. That allowed the team to take advantage of the insect’s natural machinery. Breeding the tweaked silkworms then resulted in some that inherited the spider silk gene from both parents, meaning they could produce purer spider silk.</p>



<p>If the silk someday makes it out of the laboratory, doctors could use it to sew extra-sturdy sutures. Police officers could don stronger armored vests. And a more environmentally friendly fiber could replace common synthetics like nylon and polyester.</p>



<p>“Spider silk stands as a strategic resource in urgent need of exploration,” Junpeng Mi, a synthetic biologist from Donghua University in Shanghai, said in a news release. Mi estimates that the surgical applications of spider silk alone could aid millions worldwide.</p>



<p>Yet mass production of spider silk faces hurdles. Mi and colleagues will first need to confirm that the genetic changes they induced in the silkworms will last several generations. If not, manufacturers may need to regularly jump-start the engineering process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of silk worm spun spider silk wrapped around four black tubes." class="wp-image-3132126" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline-330x179.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132126">Genetically modified silkworms produced the spider silk wound around these black tubes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132126">J. Mi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers would also confront the same challenges of traditional silkworm farmers, including ensuring the insects’ health. Biologist Justin Jones, another spider silk researcher at Utah State University, notes that silkworms are notoriously vulnerable to infection.</p>



<p>Even when the silkworms are healthy, these factory workers can create disparate silk fibers. “In the silk world, as we’ve discovered, the real problem is that there are hundreds and hundreds of strains of silkworms out there that farms use, and … they don’t give you the same mechanical properties,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>Still, silkworms make one of the most attractive candidates for this type of genetic engineering. Most of the other modified creatures eke out only small amounts of usable fiber, in part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-can-be-coaxed-making-toughest-kind-spider-silk">their enzymes chop up the DNA responsible for spider silk protein</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/19)</em>.</p>





<p>And pumping out protein is just one part of the process; spiders then dissolve the protein in a liquid called dope, and transform the resulting goop into a sturdy fiber. Although silkworms can be tricky to work with, the worms sidestep both challenges: Their bodies are already accustomed to producing silk.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Mi’s team hopes to develop even stronger and stretchier fibers. By incorporating artificial amino acids into the spider silk protein, Mi imagines the researchers could potentially push past even the upper limits of the natural fiber.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-brain-cells-new-census">What a look at more than 3,000 kinds of cells in the human brain tells us</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the human brain is beginning to reveal the inner lives of its cellular residents.</p>



<p>The human brain holds a dizzying collection of diverse cells, and no two brains are the same, cellularly speaking. Those are the prevailing conclusions of an onslaught of 21 papers published online October 12 in <em>Science</em>, <em>Science Advances</em> and <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The results just start to scratch the surface of understanding the mysteries of the brain. Still,&nbsp;they provide the most intimate look yet at the cells that build the brain, and offer clues about how the brain enables thoughts, actions and memories. The collection of data may also guide researchers in their hunt for the causes of brain disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and depression.</p>





<p>The new brain map is a result of a coordinated international research effort called the National Institutes of Health’s Brain Initiative Cell Census Network, or BICCN, which ramped up in 2017. Many of the studies in the collection are based on a powerful technology called single-cell genomics. The method reveals which genes are active inside of a single cell, information that provides clues about the cell’s identity and job.</p>



<p>As part of the BICCN, researchers examined all sorts of brains. One project detailed the cells in small pieces of live brain tissue taken from 75 people undergoing surgery for tumors or epilepsy, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experiment-live-human-brain-helps-scientists-map-nerve-cells">approach that’s been used on smaller scales</a> before (<em>SN: 8/7/19</em>). Another looked at samples taken from the brains of 17 deceased children. Still another looked at brain tissue from seven people, seven chimpanzees, four gorillas, three rhesus macaques and three marmosets.</p>



<p>The resolution provided by single-cell genomics revealed details about human brain cells in a way that previous methods couldn’t. “It’s remarkable how well it works,” says Ed Lein, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle and one of the lead researchers in the BICCN group. Collectively, the new studies describe over 3,000 cell types that reside in the human brain.</p>



<p>The main takeaway, Lein says, is that “the brain is really complex, from a cellular perspective.”</p>



<p>Amid that complexity, several key insights have already emerged, including hints about how human brains develop, how they vary among people, and how they differ from the brains of close primate relatives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Growing brains</h4>



<p>Some of the studies focused on very young brains. A study of the first two trimesters of brain growth, for instance, turned up previously <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf9941" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknown details</a> about the identities of nerve cells in the thalamus, a kind of waystation for information coming into the brain. Many of those cells, called GABAergic neurons, are born elsewhere in the developing brain and migrate into the thalamus.</p>



<p>Other results show that the early years matter, a lot. Seth Ament, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, and his colleagues <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at brain cells in the cerebellum</a>, a brain region at the back bottom of the brain. In children who died with inflammation in their brains, certain kinds of nerve cells there — Purkinje and Golgi neurons — had altered levels of active genes. The pattern, which held across eight brains, suggest that inflammation early in life could alter nerve cell development in certain spots.</p>



<p>“I’m amazed we saw something so consistent across the samples,” Ament says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Unique brains</h4>





<p>Some of the studies focused on variability between brain regions and between people.</p>



<p>One study looked at cells from about 100 spots taken from four adult brains. The researchers found, among many other things, that cells called astrocytes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add7046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used their genes differently </a>depending on where they reside. The finding hints that these cells, which are known to help nerve cells form connections and keep brain tissue healthy, may be specialized for their region.</p>



<p>Another study examined <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf6812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight regions</a> of the neocortex, the wrinkly outer area responsible for sophisticated thinking. &nbsp;Cells in those regions are somewhat standardized, sorting consistently into 24 categories, the scientists found. But the regions do have differences in the proportions of the cells. &nbsp;What that means for how these regions work is anybody’s guess.</p>



<p>Similarities also exist between people. Researchers found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf2359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly consistent patterns</a> of cells when they compared brain cells from 75 people. But there was plenty of wiggle room, too. Microglia, immune cells in the brain that also sculpt nerve cell connections, were especially unique in the genes they use from person to person, for instance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Primate brains</h4>



<p>Some of the research compares human brains with primate relatives, including chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques and marmosets. By looking at cells in other primates’ brains, Lein says, “we finally get to ask the question about what makes humans unique.&#8221;</p>



<p>Overall, cells in the middle temporal gyrus, a part of the brain’s cortex, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ a lot between the primate brains</a>. “It’s really remarkable that this complex cellular makeup is so conserved,&#8221; Lein says. &#8220;But you also have these changes.”</p>



<p>Compared with other primates, human brain cells use certain genes differently — in particular, genes related to how the cells form connections and communicate, researchers found. The analysis also turned up a few hundred genes that appear to behave in human-specific ways in brain cells. The researchers don’t yet know what those genes might be doing.</p>



<p>Imaging neuroanatomist Matthew Glasser cautions that it can be hard to tell exactly which brain areas are comparable among primates. Still, the results are “the first step in something really cool,” says Glasser, of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who was not involved in these studies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Even better brain maps are coming</h4>



<p>Overall, the progress represented by these and related results “is truly mind-blowing,” says cortical cartographer David Van Essen, who didn’t work on the new studies. “The community will certainly benefit from what’s coming out in this collection of papers.”</p>



<p>But, more importantly, it’s just a glimpse of what’s to come. “It’s not an end point in my view,&#8221; says Van Essen, also at Washington University. “It’s more a midpoint.”</p>



<p>Ament agrees. “These papers, as important as I think they are, are not the end,” he says. “It’s more the starting of it, and now we have a lot more work to do.”</p>



<p>The new brain maps will probably be revised, refined and added to, Lein says. Scientists are already working on the next iterations, which seek to combine zoomed-out views of brain networks and brain behavior with the ultrafine details provided by single-cell technology.</p>



<p>“Now that we have these techniques,” Glasser says, “we’re trying to combine them with brain imaging and systems neuroscience to actually try and figure out the puzzle.”</p>

<p>An education researcher who had four papers <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dIloh%252c%2bConstance">flagged for plagiarism</a> and citation issues threatened to sue the publisher and editors who decided to retract one of the articles, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We obtained the emails containing legal threats by Constance Iloh, formerly an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, through a public records request. Iloh, who was named to Forbes&#8217; “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/lmh45mmmd/constance-iloh-28/#99c978d6afbd">30 Under 30</a>” top figures in education in 2016 and briefly <a href="https://jbhe.com/2021/07/five-black-scholars-who-have-been-appointed-to-new-faculty-positions/">taught at Azusa Pacific University after leaving Irvine</a>, sued to prevent the university from giving us the emails, but after a two-year legal battle, a state appeals court affirmed the records should be released. That battle is described in more detail in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/12/our-two-year-fight-for-the-release-of-public-records/">this post</a>.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">our reporting in August 2020</a> on the retraction of one of Iloh’s articles for plagiarism, the disappearance of another, and the correction of two more, we requested post-publication correspondence between UCI, Iloh, and the journals where the papers had appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails UCI released to us in May of this year shed light on the processes three journals took after concerns were raised about Iloh’s work, and how she responded.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128039"></span>



<p>The documents do not indicate UCI had any formal involvement in correcting the scholarly record. Whether the university opened an investigation into allegations of research misconduct is unclear; they told us they were “not in possession of responsive releasable documents” when we requested reports of such an inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh and her lawyer, Elvin Tabah, have not responded to our request for comment. In a <a href="https://constance-iloh.medium.com/how-does-it-feel-to-be-a-problem-b851e959abd6">Medium post</a>, Iloh claimed she experienced “academic mobbing and bullying” at UCI, actions that include “attack, harassment, humiliation, trolling, stalking, death threats, doxxing, and even online identity impersonation.” She described anonymous complaints asking the university to investigate her work for plagiarism as “a hit job” and called coverage of the actions journals took with her papers – presumably our posts – “deviant clickbait.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our previous emails to Iloh offering her an opportunity to comment, another UCI faculty member <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/04/professors-legal-threats-were-personal-and-not-made-on-behalf-of-the-university-says-university-of-california-irvine/">sent us legal threats</a>, which the university said “were personal and not made on behalf of the University.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iloh’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Francis-redacted.pdf">emails with staff at Taylor &amp; Francis</a>, which in 2017 published her article “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1371603">Paving effective community college pathways by recognizing the Latino post-traditional student</a>,” in the <em>Journal of Latinos and Education</em>, reveal that two years elapsed between the publisher opening an investigation into the article and publishing a retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2019, a production editor at Taylor &amp; Francis sent Iloh a PDF copy of her manuscript for her to mark up or submit a list of changes. Iloh replied with an updated manuscript on March 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 3, the managing editor of the Routledge US Education Journals informed Iloh the publisher had received “feedback [that] inquires about the originality of some sections of text” of her article. The editor offered her “the opportunity to provide clarification on the text in question,” specifically “the decision of the specific material cited (primary versus secondary sources) and the use of direct reproduction of text from sources.”</p>



<p>Iloh responded a few days later. She asked for the “original feedback” to give to her lawyers and said she was not sure what the managing editor was asking of her. “It seems as though you have already made a judgment with ‘decisions’ so I am just not sure specifically what you are asking me to do.”</p>



<p>In the ensuing exchange, the editor gave Iloh multiple opportunities to comment on particular parts of her article and explain “the specific texts used and/or referenced within your article where there is a high degree of similarity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh made veiled legal threats at multiple points, claiming the article didn’t go through copy-editing before publication and she had tried to correct it. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have reached out to the journal with edits that I was told would be done and instead, I was accused of making “decisions” on an article the journal acknowledged having published without copy-edits and me ever completing them.</p>



<p>It was also made clear to me “someone” was clearly “out to get” me, so I already have working understanding this matter is more than what is described.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The managing editor’s response gave Iloh a deadline of October 18 to comment on the “textual overlap that was brought to our attention.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next email in the records, dated March 12, 2020, the managing editor informed Iloh of the publisher’s decision to retract the paper due to “significant textual overlap between your article and several other works.” She gave Iloh a week to respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh’s responses repeated her claims that the article had not been copy-edited and she should be able to correct the article with added quotation marks and references. She again threatened legal action against the publisher and the whistleblower:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I wish to reiterate legal recourse in event of aforementioned direction from your prior correspondence. I would also like a copy of the original accusation from the “anonymous” so that they and those colluding with them are accordingly dealt with in legal proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The managing editor replied to Iloh the next week with documentation that the article had indeed been copy-edited and Iloh had made corrections in the process before publication. She explained that the publisher had opened an investigation on Nov. 1, 2018 into “textual similarities in your article we had been alerted to.” She also explained the publisher’s process of reviewing requests to change articles after publication, and that they do not make changes while investigating an article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next few months, Iloh and the managing editor exchanged more emails in which Iloh repeatedly threatened legal action and called the decision to retract her article “problematic and unlawful.” The managing editor reiterated Taylor &amp; Francis’ decision and policies, including that the changes Iloh had requested “are too extensive for us to publish as a correction notice.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2020.1769961">retraction notice</a> was published on August 10, and we posted our first story on Iloh <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">later that month</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In subsequent emails, including one sent to Taylor &amp; Francis executives with further threats to sue the company, Iloh accused the journal’s editors of “bias.” She also cited an error in the original retraction notice and claimed that journal staff were “determined to cause harm to me and retract my article, even on faulty grounds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2020.1816396">corrected</a> the retraction notice, which said her 2017 article had “text overlap” with an article she had published in 2019, but otherwise stood by its processes and decision to retract the article in a letter from Jessica Vivian, the global portfolio director in charge of education journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivian’s letter reviewed the publisher’s documentation that the article had been copy-edited, contrary to Iloh’s claims, and the process they had taken to retract the article and give Iloh an opportunity to explain the textual overlap, which she did not do. The letter also reiterated the company’s plagiarism policy and assessment that “the amount of textual overlap was far too substantial to warrant addressing the textual overlap through a correction.”</p>



<p>“​​With regards to your allegations of abuse and mishandling of your case,” Vivian wrote, “I would welcome the opportunity to review evidence against this claim. If you have this, please do share that with me at your earliest convenience.”</p>



<p>Vivian sent the letter on September 8, the day we filed our records request, so it is the last document included in the records UCI released to us. We do not know how Iloh may have responded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s investigation “was conducted properly and professionally and we stand by the conclusions of the re-review of this case,” Mark Robinson, corporate media relations manager for Taylor &amp; Francis, told us in an email. “There was a careful investigation into concerns about the article and extensive correspondence with the author, which is why the process took some time.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sage-correspondence.pdf">correspondence we obtained</a>, Iloh and staff at the publisher Sage took six months to agree on and publish the wording of a correction notice. Iloh objected to language indicating the original article had problems that were being fixed; staff described the changes she wanted to make to proposed wording as “not transparent enough.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article at issue, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1477971418785384">Does distance education go the distance for adult learners? Evidence from a qualitative study at an American community college</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Adult and Continuing Education</em> in 2018. The emails we obtained start in January 2019 with Iloh apparently sending an updated version of the article attached to an email with no body text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another email to the journal’s editor and a Sage employee who managed the journal, dated March 21, Iloh seemingly sent an attachment related to the correction, but the email’s subject is blank and the body text does not specify what she attached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The managing editor’s reply on March 27 thanked Iloh for “reviewing the draft corrigendum,” but continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>However, we have concerns about the changes which you have made, particularly removing the record of references which have been amended/included in the updated version of your article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editor explained Sage’s policies “in line with best practices of transparency when making changes to a published version of record.”</p>



<p>The early version of the corrigendum stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The author regrets that at the time of submission the following sources were not adequately referenced</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I hope this email finds you well. Per my previous email, this is not accurate however. Those references were not left out, they were added because of new text. I also do not approve of any language that includes “the author regrets.” I can send a new version as again I do not approve of the current and would never allow such. I will submit shortly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After waiting for Iloh to send her updated version, the Sage editor sent a new revision with “only the information that it is essential to inform the readers of the changes to the version of record.” Iloh did not approve of it, either, and sent her proposed version on May 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that time, the previous managing editor had left Sage, and a new staffer had taken on the role. The editor responded on May 15:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have accommodated your changes as best we can, however the latest changes you have suggested are not transparent enough to meet the criteria set out in the COPE guidelines. We have the agreement of the Editor of the <em>Journal of Adult and Continuing Education</em> on the corrigendum wording, and will therefore be proceeding with the publication of the corrigendum text as attached with this email. I would like to thank you for your co-operation on this matter and hope you appreciate that SAGE and the Editor of the journal are responsible for ensuring transparency and that relevant procedures are adhered to, and therefore have full discretion regarding the content of the corrigendum wording.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh sent another version the same day, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As you can see, those references were added in updating the text but they were not missing in the one from before so I want accuracy as well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editors accepted Iloh’s revision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After extensive emails in the proofing stage of production as Iloh questioned whether one reference was written correctly and asked to remove two references to her prior work (the article Taylor &amp; Francis was in the process of retracting and another that would be removed), the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1477971419857491">correction</a> was published in July 2019. It stated that “sections throughout the original manuscript have been re-written and updated and this manuscript also includes new references.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked SAGE about the journal’s decision to publish Iloh’s correction to the article, which added eight references. A spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Those at Sage who were involved with the decision to publish a correction notice for the article are no longer at the company. Our current research integrity team is looking into what, if any, action we should take on the article now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iloh’s article “Not non-traditional, the new normal: adult learners and the role of student affairs in supporting older college students” appeared in the 2018 edition of the <em>Journal of Student Affairs.</em> The entire issue had been removed when we wrote our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">August 2020 post</a>, without any notice. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/JSA-and-other-pubs.pdf">emails</a> we obtained shed light on what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2019, Iloh emailed Colorado State University’s Student Affairs in Higher Education program, which publishes the <em>Journal of Student Affairs</em>, with an updated version of her article. According to the researcher, the new text had&nbsp; “minor errors corrected” and two additional references. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I did not know there wasn&#8217;t a copy editing stage, after receiving a revise and resubmit and then an acceptance. I wanted to make sure I took time to carefully correct any errors following my return from family tragedies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the next email in the records, sent in December 2019, a CSU professor informed Iloh that the school’s leadership had decided to remove her article from the 2018 issue of the journal after a “plagiarism check” indicated “significant cause for concern.” The professor attached the TurnItIn report, which revealed&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>direct use of others’ words, including whole sentences, without proper attribution. The most significant of which include the improper use of work by Chen (2017), Ke (2010), and Panacci (2015), as well as of your own work and a Concordia University website.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I regret this situation keeps dogging you,” wrote the professor, who also mentioned talking with Iloh at an education conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Iloh had tried to make changes to the article after publication, the professor offered Iloh the opportunity to submit a revision “with the plagiarism issues noted in the reports corrected.” If Iloh submitted a new manuscript, the professor wrote, “we will scan it again and assuming all issues have been corrected, we will republish the article online with an errata note that it was originally published in 2018 and revised due to errors in attribution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Iloh did not resubmit, the professor wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>JSA must then note in the journal archives that your article was pulled from the issue due to significant errors in attribution.</p>



<p>I regret that we must take this course of action, but the integrity of the journal and these students’ work as editors must be upheld.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh submitted an updated version of the article the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of 2020, the professor conveyed the journal’s decision that the new version didn’t sufficiently address the plagiarism issues, and the journal would not replace the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although the percentages of individual similar content is very small, I still find issues with inappropriate use of secondary sources appearing as primary sources,” the professor wrote. “Consequently, it is thought that the core issues found with the original manuscript, although reduced, are still evident due to not appropriately attributing secondary sources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh replied later that day:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>No worries, it is fine just being left it out. Thanks for your correspondence and I hope you are taking good care. I am not even sure what version I sent when I received your first email (as I was dealing with family deaths but wanted to respond given the nature), but these issues will never arise again. I apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We pointed out to the <em>Journal of Student Affairs&#8217;</em> current leadership that at the time we were reporting this article, a <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://sahe.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2023/08/The-Journal-2018.pdf">PDF</a> of the journal issue in which Iloh’s article appeared included the text as it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JSA-Iloh.pdf">originally appeared</a>, with no notice. The professor now in charge of the journal thanked us for pointing out “an error in our website” and said the journal would take the issue down “until an original file can be located to edit and reupload.”</p>

<p>In September 2020, we requested records from the University of California, Irvine, regarding four papers by an assistant professor of education that had been retracted, corrected, or taken down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction and correction notices for the articles, written by Constance Iloh, mentioned plagiarism and misuse of references. After our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">initial reporting</a>, we wanted to see if we could learn more about what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took approximately two and a half years for us to obtain the records, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/12/author-threatened-to-sue-publisher-over-retraction-then-sued-to-block-release-of-emails/">detailed in this post</a>. The emails we obtained shed light on the processes three journals took after concerns were raised about Iloh’s work, and how she responded – including with legal threats. </p>



<p>Here, we tell the story of how we fought in court to get the records, represented by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/opengovlaw/">Kelly Aviles</a>, who specializes in cases involving the California Public Records Act and has successfully sued <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-25/judge-orders-l-a-sheriffs-department-to-release-misconduct-use-of-force-records-after-l-a-times-lawsuit">on behalf of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128036"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On Sept. 8, 2020, we asked UCI for copies of correspondence between the university and Iloh related to the journal articles, and correspondence between the university or Iloh with the journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UCI planned to release the records to us on April 30, 2021, but Iloh filed suit to stop the release, arguing “the correspondences do not relate to conduct of the public’s benefit, Petitioner has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the balance of interests favors nondisclosure.” UCI agreed not to release the records until the court ruled on the case.</p>



<p>In July, Iloh re-filed her suit naming the Center for Scientific Integrity (CSI), Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, as a “real party of interest.” In a legal filing opposing Iloh’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent UCI from disclosing the records, Aviles argued that the requested correspondence is indeed a public record, and Iloh can’t “demonstrate any recognized privacy right in the emails related to her alleged wrongdoing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That November, a judge denied Iloh’s request for a preliminary injunction, and Iloh appealed the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January of this year, the appeals court affirmed the decision. Iloh’s appeal rights ended in April, after which UCI released the records to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We also filed an anti-SLAPP motion, under California’s version of a law to “<a href="https://www.rcfp.org/introduction-anti-slapp-guide/">provide defendants a way to quickly dismiss meritless lawsuits—known as ‘SLAPPs’ or ‘Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation’—filed against them for exercising their First Amendment rights</a>.”</p>



<p>The trial court judge denied our motion, but the appeals court reversed the denial and sent the matter back to the trial court for further analysis. The decision stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By targeting and seeking to impede CSI&#8217;s newsgathering activity, Iloh&#8217;s petition threatens to chill CSI&#8217;s speech-related processes like newsgathering; if successful, this could inhibit CSI&#8217;s exercise of free speech. This is the type of lawsuit the anti-SLAPP statute is designed to address, and it should be stricken if Iloh cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing on her petition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The appeal court’s decision that the anti-SLAPP statute applies to our case “is essentially a game changer” for legal cases to prevent the disclosure of public records, Aviles said. “Ensuring the anti-SLAPP statute applies is critical,” and if the decision stands, she expects everyone facing such a suit to invoke the statute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh has asked for California’s Supreme Court to review the decision, but the court has not yet decided whether to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, we’ve paid about $4,000 in filing and other court fees. If you would like to help us defray those costs, please make a U.S. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/support-retraction-watch/">tax-deductible donation here</a>.</p>



<p>The long court battle for the release of public records is “not the way any of this is supposed to work,” Aviles said, but “unfortunately way too common.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The public is entitled to this information, she has no basis to stop disclosure, and yet here we are, years later,” she said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-hunt-cave-lion-skeleton-first-direct-evidence">Neandertals hunted cave lions at least 48,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly 48,000 years ago, Neandertals killed a cave lion by thrusting a wooden spear into its abdomen, lion remains from Germany suggest.</p>



<p>The discovery represents the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42764-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first direct evidence of Neandertals hunting cave lions</a>, and the oldest evidence of any hominid slaying a large predator, researchers say. But such behavior probably began much earlier among Neandertals, zooarchaeologist Gabriele Russo and colleagues report October 12 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers also examined three cave lion paw bones from another German site that date to at least roughly 190,000 years ago. These bones, discovered in 2019, were originally part of a pelt that Neandertals skinned off a freshly killed cave lion (<em>Panthera spelaea</em>), the researchers suspect. The bones lay close together and included one with marks typically made during skinning of animal hides. No evidence indicates that the paw bones were used as pendants or as parts of clothing.</p>





<p>“A lion pelt with attached claws could have embodied many meanings for Neandertals and been worn as a special piece of clothing for warmth, significant occasions or simply displayed,” says Russo, of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>



<p>A puncture wound on a rib from the cave lion’s skeleton, unearthed in 1985, resembles impact marks made by wooden spears, the researchers say. Based on the wound’s angle, hunters approached the lion, probably an old male, from behind and stabbed it in the lower abdomen while it lay on its right side. Stone tool marks on other skeletal parts indicate that hunters butchered the animal.</p>



<p>Previous finds have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/german-mine-yields-ancient-hunting-spears">Neandertals used wooden spears to hunt wild horses</a> 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, and to hunt deer and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-rotten-putrid-paleo-diet-fire-neanderthal">possibly elephants roughly 125,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/97; SN: 3/29/23</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-first-insects-ensnared-plastic-pollution">Ants may be the first known insects ensnared in plastic pollution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some Canary Island ants have picked up an unwelcome stowaway — plastic waste.</p>



<p>Plastic entanglement is commonly associated with aquatic and ocean life. Finding plastic-wrapped ants suggests that humankind’s <a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/een.13284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pernicious polymer pollution</a> affects a wider range of wildlife than previously thought, researchers report September 18 in <em>Ecological Entomology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists noticed the tangled insects while studying 113 ants they’d collected from the volcanic island of La Palma. One <em>Lasius grandis </em>ant was ensnared in a thin, red fiber, while a <em>Monomorium</em> ant was wrapped in a black fiber. Chemical and physical analyses of the fibers, which were woven around the ants’ bodies and legs, revealed they were made of plastic.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Plastic waste is famously treacherous for seabirds and marine mammals, but it can cause problems for landlubbing animals too, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camel-eating-plastic-trash-waste-deadly-masses">clogging camels’ guts</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-ppe-trash-masks-gloves-pollution-deadly-wildlife">killing songbirds</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>12/15/20</em>; <em>SN</em>: <em>4/12/21</em>). Scientists have also documented some insects interacting with plastics. Aquatic caddisfly larvae <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-020-08790-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can use small plastic fragments</a> to construct their protective body casings, says Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>There’s little evidence of plastic binding up ants and other small land insects, though. The La Palma ants represent one of the first known examples of a plastic trash–entangled terrestrial invertebrate.</p>



<p>“These last 15 years, we have acquired enormous knowledge about what happens in marine ecosystems, but it is time to expand to other systems and species for obtaining a greater perspective,” says urban ecologist Álvaro Luna of the European University of Madrid.</p>



<p>The two ants, which Luna and colleagues collected from a pine forest and near the summit of La Palma’s volcano, may have picked up the plastic accidentally while foraging. Because the ants were still alive and mobile when captured, it’s unclear whether the plastic harmed them, Luna says.</p>



<p>Adjacent roads and hiking trails could serve as the fibers’ origins, the researchers suspect. Plastic particles can be carried long distances by the wind to remote areas like those in parts of La Palma where the team found the ants, says marine ecologist Melanie Bergmann of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.</p>



<p>It’s possible that insects have been getting tangled in plastic for a long time and it’s just gone unnoticed. “The more we research, the clearer it becomes that plastic pollution is ubiquitous,” Bergmann says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">NASA’s first look at a sample from asteroid Bennu reveals life’s building blocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA scientists are just beginning to reveal details about roughly 250 grams of dust and rocks brought back to Earth from the asteroid Bennu. The samples are the result of the first U.S. mission to return a sample from an asteroid, and the largest cache of material ever collected beyond the orbit of the moon.</p>



<p>This mission is the beginning of “a new era of exploration, and this is the era of sample science,” said Makenzie Lystrup, director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvIuSpACQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live streaming event</a> on October 11. “This is when sample science really begins.”</p>





<p>The mission began seven years ago when the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft left Earth to rendezvous with Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid that may hold clues to the formation of the solar system and the origin of life on Earth. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx lightly touched down on Bennu</a> in 2020, scooped up a coffee cup–sized sample and sealed it away for the long trip back home (<em>SN</em>: 10/21/20) .</p>



<p>OSIRIS-REx<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth"> jettisoned its sample return capsule</a> back to Earth on September 24 (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). The spacecraft continued on its way, under the new name OSIRIS-APEX, as it headed out on its next mission — going into orbit around the near-Earth asteroid Apophis.</p>



<p>The capsule containing the Bennu samples parachuted down to a desert landing site in Utah, where it was picked up and helicoptered to NASA’s Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston. NASA scientists carefully opened the capsule in a dedicated clean room designed to ensure that the pristine asteroid material wouldn’t be contaminated by any terrestrial material.</p>



<p>The material in the capsule was collected by blowing dust and rocks into a container with blasts of nitrogen gas. The sample consists primarily of asteroid material from as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-has-picked-osiris-rex-landing-site-asteroid-bennu">deep as 50 centimeters below the surface</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>). Additional dust and grit that adhered to the spacecraft landing pads when OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu will offer a look at the composition of the surface of the asteroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission returned some bonus material as well, in the form of loose debris that was inadvertently kicked up into the capsule in the area around the collection container, prior to the capsule sealing up for the trip home. The science team has delayed opening the main sample canister, instead taking time to collect and analyze the bonus sample.</p>



<p>Much of that material is made up of water-bearing clay minerals. “The reason that Earth is the habitable world that we have, with oceans and lakes and rivers and rain,” said planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission, “is because these clay minerals, like the ones we&#8217;re seeing from Bennu, landed on Earth 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years ago, making our world habitable.”</p>



<p>Other grains contain elements common on Earth, including carbon and iron, Lauretta said, as well as platelike sulfur structures that may have been crucial for jump-starting life.</p>



<p>A quarter of the Bennu sample will go to scientists on the OSIRIS-REx mission for analysis. The rest will be divvied up among scientists around the globe, with a portion set aside for future study.</p>



<p>“This stuff is an astrobiologist&#8217;s dream,” said Daniel Glavin, a senior scientist for sample return at Goddard. “I just can&#8217;t wait to get at it. And this material will be around for generations and generations.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A monkey that received a kidney from a genetically engineered miniature pig <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06594-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived for more than two years after the transplant</a>, scientists report October 11 in <em>Nature</em>. The team took a molecular red pen to donor pigs’ genomes, editing the animals’ organs to be more of a match for humans. Such an editing strategy could one day make it more likely for people’s bodies to accept organs from different species.</p>





<p>The work, funded by biotechnology company eGenesis, is the latest in a string of efforts seeking to use other species to address global organ shortages. The new study is “promising work and a step in the right direction,” says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>In the United States, the demand for new organs to replace damaged or diseased ones far outpaces supply. As of October 11, nearly <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">104,000 Americans sit on the national transplant waiting list</a>. Some 89,000 of these people are seeking kidneys. “There just simply aren’t enough kidneys to go around,” said eGenesis president and CEO Mike Curtis in a news conference on October 10. Most people waiting will never get the offer, he says. “They will die on dialysis.”</p>



<p>That’s where cross-species transplantation — giving people organs from other animals — comes in, Curtis said. It’s “the only near-term viable solution to solving this huge shortfall in organ availability.”</p>



<p>But the path forward is studded with scientific stumbling blocks. Pig organs aren’t a molecular match for human bodies, for one. Porcine cells display suspicious-looking sugars that spell “stranger” to our immune systems. This can prompt rejection of a transplanted organ.</p>



<p>If the body sees those sugars, “It’s like, ‘whoa, you’re not supposed to be here,’ and the immune system attacks,” says Jayme Locke, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Scientists tweak donor animals’ genomes to “make the pig kidney as human as possible so that our body recognizes it and doesn’t immediately attack it,” she says.</p>



<p>Locke and others have already made progress in this field. In 2021, a team at NYU Langone Health <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">tested how well a kidney from a genetically modified pig</a> functioned by attaching it to a brain-dead woman (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). In 2022, Locke’s group upped the ante, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/12566-uab-announces-first-clinical-grade-transplant-of-gene-edited-pig-kidneys-into-brain-dead-human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing the first peer-reviewed study on a gene-edited pig kidney transplanted into a brain-dead person</a>.</p>



<p>That year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">doctors also transplanted modified pig hearts into two brain-dead people</a> — and even a living man (<em>SN: 7/12/22</em>). The man, 57-year-old David Bennett from Maryland, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">survived for two months with the transplanted organ</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/22</em>). This September, another patient, Lawrence Faucette, became the second living person to receive a genetically modified pig heart.</p>



<p>In August, Locke’s team reported that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2808483?guestAccessKey=b0ebd45b-dbfd-4566-bcda-0411f989ae23&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=081623" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig kidneys transplanted into a brain-dead man can function normally</a>, producing urine over the course of a seven-day study. Her team worked with a different kind of genetically modified pig than the ones Curtis and his colleagues created — one with 10 genomic edits rather than up to 69.</p>



<p>The edits, which strip away some pig aspects and add in human ones, fall into three main categories designed to make the animals’ organs safer for human use. They lop off stranger-danger sugars from pigs’ cells, insert human genes to help prevent organ rejection and knock out potentially harmful retroviruses embedded in the pigs’ genomes. “This is probably the most genetically modified pig that I&#8217;ve seen described in the literature,” Locke says.</p>



<p>Curtis’ team mixed and matched edits in different pigs and transplanted their kidneys into monkeys. Because these are pig kidneys genetically tailored for humans, scientists have to dose the monkeys with powerful immunosuppressive drugs, so the animals don’t reject the new organs. But these types of animal studies are important, Locke says, because they can demonstrate long-term organ function, which is difficult to show in people with brain death.</p>





<p>Eight out of 15 monkeys that received pig kidneys lacking the sugars and carrying the human genes survived 176 days or longer, Curtis&#8217; team showed. One monkey lasted much longer, living 758 days after the kidney transplant. Monkeys with pig kidneys missing the human genes didn’t fare nearly as well, surviving a median of 24 days.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s encouraging when you see a pig kidney being able to function for two years,” Vagefi says. “But I think it’s even more encouraging when you see it done consistently.” Like any good study, he says, the work opens a chasm of questions. He wonders, for example, how many more genetic edits pig organs may need to succeed long-term in monkeys regularly.</p>



<p>Even then, there might not be a single kind of pig donor that’s right for every person, Locke points out. She thinks it’s important to have options. Doctors may “need more than one type of genetically edited pig in order to serve all the people in need.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-collision-first-afterglow-infrared-light">In a first, astronomers spot the afterglow of an exoplanet collision</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a solar system about 1,800 light-years from Earth, two planets smacked into one another in an impact that vaporized them both. And astronomers caught them in the act.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06573-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incandescent blob of leftover planet</a>, lingering after an impact, could explain a surge of infrared light from a remote star, researchers report October 11 in <em>Nature</em>. And the ensuing debris field could also explain a subsequent dimming of the star, the team says. While scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">glimpsed planetary debris in other solar systems</a> before, no one has seen the smoldering remains of a collision between exoplanets until now (<em>SN: 5/8/23</em>).</p>





<p>“The possible detection of a post-impact body is really exciting,” says astrophysicist Philip Carter of the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the new study. “As far as I’m aware, no one&#8217;s claimed this before.”</p>



<p>As is often the case for exciting astronomical discoveries, detecting the aftermath of this cosmic smackdown involved more than a little luck.</p>



<p>Astronomer Matthew Kenworthy wasn’t hunting for giant impacts. “I was looking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-rings-encircle-young-exoplanet">for rings</a>” around exoplanets, he says (<em>SN: 2/1/15</em>). So he was scouring telescope survey data for stars that flicker or dim in unusual ways. And when the ASAS-SN survey — an ongoing project to monitor the entire sky for exploding stars — captured the sunlike star ASASSN-21qj repeatedly dimming in visible light, “I immediately jumped on it,” says Kenworthy, of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>As he was analyzing the fading star, Kenworthy stumbled upon another clue — on social media. One of his posts on Twitter (now called X) about ASASSN-21qj’s unusual behavior caught the eye of citizen scientist Arttu Sainio. “I tweeted out saying: ‘Oh, this is amazing, this star is fading!’” Kenworthy says. “Then he said: ‘Oh, by the way, did you realize the star had brightened up [in infrared]?’”</p>



<p>Sainio pointed out that infrared data from NASA’s orbiting WISE telescope showed a strong uptick in infrared radiation from the star about 900 days before the dimming started. Kenworthy’s hopes for rings were dashed. But maybe he and his colleagues had found something else just as fascinating.</p>



<p>“It just totally changed the story,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>The researchers realized that a giant impact could neatly tie together the spontaneous infrared glow and the visible light dimming that followed more than two years later. Their calculations suggest that two Neptune-sized planets collided, vaporizing each other and forming a hot, donut-shaped body of vaporized rock —&nbsp;the source of the infrared glow. ASASSN-21qj later dimmed when impact debris smeared out around the star and blocked some of its light.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two exoplanets collided in a smashup that left behind a glob of hot, vaporized rock and a debris cloud. Astronomers first observed the afterglow of the collision in infrared light. Then, 900 days later, they saw the pulverized planets’ star dim as impact debris drifted in front of it, between the star and Earth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alternatively, it’s possible that astronomers observed two separate events: an infrared glow from dust warmed by starlight, perhaps left behind by a collision between close-orbiting protoplanets, followed by dimming as a big disk of unrelated material passed in front of the star. But two rare events happening in close succession is “really, really, really unlikely,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>The putative post-impact blob could one day coalesce into a planet. And as the remaining debris shears out into a disk orbiting the star, it too might eventually collect onto the new planet or form moons around it.</p>





<p>How long all that might take isn’t clear, Carter says. It could happen within a few years or perhaps several thousand. “The models of these impact remnants are still in the very early stages,” he says. Either way, continuing to observe the post-impact material over the coming years will give scientists a rare chance to witness, not just simulate, what happens after a planetary collision.</p>



<p>“You expect astronomical processes to take astronomical amounts of time. And it&#8217;s like: Nope! This was very fast. This happened over just a few years,” Kenworthy says. “It&#8217;ll just be fascinating to see how it evolves over time, in the next 10 or 20 years.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-chicken-resistant-bird-flu">Gene editing can make chickens resistant to bird flu</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chickens genetically modified to be impervious to bird flu may one day prevent the spread of the disease on farms, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Just small tweaks to a single gene made<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41476-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> chickens resistant to an avian influenza infection</a>, researchers report October 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The gene, known as <em>ANP32A</em>, provides the instructions that tell chicken cells how to make a protein that flu viruses rely on to successfully hijack cells. Disrupting the avian virus’s ability to commandeer the protein stopped most genetically edited birds from getting infected.</p>





<p>Testing the gene editing in such a ubiquitous agricultural animal that&#8217;s susceptible to bird flu makes the new study “especially impactful and important,” says Jacob Yount, a viral immunologist at Ohio State University in Columbus who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>The virus can rapidly spread among birds on poultry farms, sometimes with devastating consequences. Beginning in 2022, an outbreak hit the global poultry industry hard, pushing farmers to cull millions of birds in the United States alone. After a summer lull, on October 4, a turkey farm in South Dakota confirmed the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first case on a U.S. poultry farm since April</a>, affecting around 47,300 birds. </p>



<p>While many avian flu strains cause only mild illness in birds, such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">deadly strains like the one behind the global outbreak can kill domesticated and wild birds</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). Chickens also occasionally transmit flu to farm animals like pigs or, less often, people. </p>



<p>Ideally genetic editing would completely stop the virus from replicating inside the animals, so it can’t pose a risk to birds, or people, at all. But in the new study, some edited chickens still got infected, meaning the technique isn’t yet 100 percent effective.</p>



<p>The new research “isn’t all the way there yet, but I think it’s an amazing first step and an amazing proof of concept,” Yount says.</p>



<p>Vaccines to defend poultry from flu exist, but the tactic is expensive, and the virus swiftly adapts to evade that protection, developmental biologist Mike McGrew of the University of Edinburgh said in an October 5 news conference. Gene editing, on the other hand, offers a way to make permanent changes that leave an animal resistant to a particular disease.</p>



<p><em>ANP32A</em> is a good gene to tweak in chickens because it’s “absolutely essential” for the virus’s replication, virologist Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London said at the news conference.</p>



<p>In the study, Barclay, McGrew and colleagues made two changes to <em>ANP32A</em> using the molecular scissors CRISPR/Cas9, so that the gene’s protein could no longer interact with avian flu viruses. After monitoring the birds for two years, the edited chickens were healthy, and hens laid eggs normally just like unedited birds, genetic engineer Alewo Idoko-Akoh of the University of Bristol in England said at the news conference. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then placed 10 normal and 10 gene-edited chicks in separate incubators and exposed them to a dose of around 1,000 infectious particles of avian influenza directly in the nasal cavity. The strain was one that could infect the birds but not make them severely ill. A day later, the two groups of 2-week-old chicks were then each joined by 10 unexposed peers, called sentinels. The unedited birds were paired with unedited sentinels, and gene-edited birds were paired with gene-edited sentinels.</p>



<p>All 10 unedited chickens got infected and had high levels of virus in their bodies, and so did seven of their sentinels. Only one of the gene-edited birds contracted the virus.</p>





<p>That infected modified bird had low levels of virus, and it didn’t transmit the virus to any of the edited sentinels. But “we felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous, to stress test this and ask, are these chickens truly resistant?” Barclay said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So the researchers repeated the experiment, exposing chickens to 1,000 times as much virus as before, about 1 million infectious particles — an abnormally high dose that contains more virus than the birds would likely be exposed to on poultry farms. The team also mixed in both unedited and edited sentinels with exposed chickens.</p>



<p>In one incubator, all the normal chickens got infected and transmitted the virus to every unedited sentinel. No edited sentinel birds in that incubator caught the flu. In the other incubator, five of 10 modified chickens became infected after exposure, transmitting the virus to one unedited sentinel but no edited ones. That suggests that even though the virus could infect chicks at high doses, the animals weren’t very contagious.</p>



<p>Viruses from the gene-edited chickens that got infected had adapted in ways that allowed the viruses to ditch their reliance on the ANP32A protein and instead co-opt two other proteins in the same family to replicate. That means editing more than one gene may be necessary to make chickens fully resistant to flu.</p>



<p>“If this was a disease that only infected chickens, then the resistance that we created would be better than what we would get with a vaccine,” McGrew said. “But because this is a zoonotic disease and can be spread potentially to humans, we really need to aim for complete resistance.”</p>



<p>Eliminating all three <em>ANP32</em> genes from chicken cells grown in a lab dish stopped the virus from replicating at all. But because having at least some ANP32 proteins may be important for developing chick brains, bones and hearts, that strategy might cause problems for live chickens. More work is needed to figure out if that is true, Yount says, and whether other genes outside of the <em>ANP32 </em>family might also be good candidates for editing.</p>



<p>The use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks">not without controversy</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/16</em>). But it’s important to continue such work in chickens, Idoko-Akoh said, “so that then when maybe it becomes widely or more culturally accepted, we can take advantage of the technology.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mobius-strip-mystery-solved-math">An enduring Möbius strip mystery has finally been solved</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any attempt to better understand Möbius strips is bound to run into some kinks.</p>



<p>The twisted loops are so strange that mathematicians have struggled to answer some basic questions about them. For example: “What’s the shortest Möbius strip you can make for a paper band of a given width?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question hooked mathematician Richard Evan Schwartz. A mistake in a computer program almost prevented him from finding the answer. Simply messing around with strips of paper finally helped him solve the mystery.</p>





<p>A Möbius strip is a mathematical oddity that anyone can make. Cut a strip of paper, twist one end halfway around, and tape the two ends together to form a loop with a twist in it. The result is a one-sided surface. The strips have inspired mathematicians, artists and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mobius-strip-carbon-atoms-chemistry">scientists</a> in a variety of fields (<em>SN: 5/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>A long, skinny Möbius strip is easier to make than a stumpy one. With a very short strip, the paper has to contort so much that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twist-m%C3%B6bius-band">flattens into an equilateral triangle</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/07</em>). (You can see this shape form if you slowly pull one end of an untaped Möbius strip to shorten it.) The triangular Möbius strip is made from a piece of paper that has a length that’s √3, or about 1.73, times its width.</p>



<p>In 1977, mathematicians hypothesized that the triangular Möbius strip was as short as you can go. Specifically, it’s the limit for an idealized mathematical version of paper that is infinitely thin, smooth and nonstretchy, and which, like real-world paper, can’t pass through itself. But in the nearly 50 years that followed, no one had been able to prove it. Mathematicians could show only that the ratio between a Möbius strip’s length and width must be greater than π/2, or about 1.57.</p>



<p>The stumper piqued Schwartz’s interest. He is fond of simple problems that befuddle mathematicians. “I like it when no one has any idea what to do,” he says. A bonus: “If I bomb out on this, there’s no shame in it. I’m just like everybody else.”</p>



<p>Schwartz focused on a key property of Möbius strips: While the paper curves this way and that to form the loop, at every point on the band there’s a direction in which the paper follows a straight line from edge to edge, with no curvature at all. (That’s not true of all surfaces. Think of a bowl: There are no straight lines to be found.) He realized that, in any Möbius strip, there must always be two such lines that are perpendicular and in the same plane, as in the letter T.</p>



<p>Based on how the paper contorts to form this T shape, Schwartz found a new minimum length-to-width ratio. To his disappointment, it was not √3 but <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-021-00648-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number achingly close to it</a>, about 1.69, he reported in <em>Geometriae Dedicata</em> in 2021.</p>

Although he gets creative with paper in his spare time, most of his research is on the computer — a fact that held up his early attempts at solving a Möbius strip mystery.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132184">Brienne Brown</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Schwartz moved on to other topics but couldn’t stop thinking about the problem. One day, on a whim, he began playing with strips of paper. In a head-smacking jolt, he realized he’d made an error.</p>



<p>Schwartz had assumed that slicing open a Möbius strip along a diagonal and flattening it forms a parallelogram. But when Schwartz cut open one of his paper Möbius strips, he saw in front of him not a parallelogram, but a trapezoid. “I instantly said, ‘uh oh,’” he says.</p>



<p>It was a simple mistake. But Schwartz had been investigating Möbius strips primarily on the computer. He’d flubbed the setup of his computer program, which led to the parallelogram whoopsie. “Once I’d made the mistake,” he says, “it’s like it got locked into my brain.”</p>





<p>Schwartz says he hardly ever used paper Möbius strips in his research. But that’s what it took to jolt him out of his stagnant thought pattern. It’s a bit curious that Schwartz didn’t turn to paper earlier. He fiddles with paper as a hobby, designing elaborate masks of dangling paper.</p>



<p>Once Schwartz redid the calculation with the trapezoid fix, √3 popped out. He’d <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally proved</a>, that the length of a Möbius strip must be greater than √3 times its width, Schwartz reported August 24 at arXiv.org. The triangular Möbius strip is truly the limit for paper Möbius strips.</p>



<p>Now, Schwartz is interested in taking this work further. What, he wonders, is the minimum length for a loop with two twists, or three twists, instead of one? This time, perhaps, he’ll spend more time playing with paper.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a child prodigy – famously writing music at an age when other children need lullabies to help them to fall asleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite how prolific he was, however, Mozart did not write an album called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B006LWWRDO">Bedtime Mozart</a>.” That has now created a headache for the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02746-4">study</a> published in <em>Pediatric Research</em> in August that found the particular set of melodies helped soothe babies during a particular blood test.</p>



<p>Like many “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/06/28/128104580/mozart-effect-was-just-what-we-wanted-to-hear">Mozart Effect</a>” studies before it, the new research prompted a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/999373">press release</a> referring to Mozart in its headline, and plenty of <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/153406696/news">press coverage</a>. But Hinnerk Feldwisch-Drentrup, a correspondent for <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em>, thought something was off-key: </p>



<span id="more-128018"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The question arises as to whether the newborns actually listened to Wolfgang Amadeus: The YouTube video linked in the press release, which is supposed to contain a piece from an album “Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies”, sounds tinny and is difficult for adults to bear &#8211; that Gedudel, published under the song title “Deep Sleep”, could hardly have been written by Mozart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Feldwisch-Drentrup <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/medizin-ernaehrung/mozart-effekt-angebliche-wunderwirkung-auf-babys-mit-schmerzen-19134866.html">reported in August</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After this newspaper inquired about these discrepancies, the Springer Nature press office deleted the word “Mozart” from the press release; the authorship of the song could not be clarified &#8211; now there is only talk of a lullaby. It initially remained unclear whether the study would be revised accordingly. According to a spokeswoman, the publisher contacted media that reported on Mozart&#8217;s effects on babies and apologized for the inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The press release lost the word “Mozart,” and the paper has now indeed been revised. A correction, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02834-5">ran on September 29</a>, reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The original online version of this article was revised: the music used for this study is from an album called ‘Bedtime Mozart’ and not necessarily music composed by Mozart. Any references to Mozart music have been corrected accordingly. The original article has been corrected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saminathan-anbalagan/">Saminathan Anbalagan</a>, the corresponding author of the paper, told Feldwisch-Drentrup in August his team used the recording “because it had previously been used for research on ‘Mozart’ effects.” Anbalagan did not respond to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Good news for composers not named Mozart, though: Your music, too, can soothe babies undergoing minor medical procedures.</p>

In support of furthering knowledge, academic journals work with researchers to disseminate findings, engage with the scholarly community, and share academic advances.</p><p>Oxford University Press (OUP) publishes more than 500 high-quality trusted journals, two-thirds of which are published in partnership with societies, organizations, or institutions. The remaining third is a list of journals owned and operated by the Press. Fundamental to this list of owned journals is our mission to create world-class academic and educational resources and make them available as widely as possible, including expanding our fully open access options for authors. As a not-for-profit university press, our financial surplus is reinvested for the purpose of educational and scholarly objectives of the University and the Press, thereby fostering the continued growth of open access initiatives and supporting the scholarly community.</p><h2>How do we support researchers in different career stages through our journals?</h2><div aria-hidden="true"></div><h3>Early Career Researchers: nurturing talent</h3><p>For early career researchers (ECRs), having their work published in a reputable journal is a crucial step in establishing their academic reputation.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/measuring-protocol-sharing/">Measuring protocol sharing: are we on the right track?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Marcel LaFlamme</em></p>



<p>For almost a year, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-science-indicators">Open Science Indicators</a> have offered the ability to measure three Open Science practices: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting. Now, PLOS and <a href="https://dataseer.ai/">DataSeer</a> are adding a fourth indicator for protocol sharing. As we expand the tool&rsquo;s capabilities, we invite your feedback on the approach we&rsquo;ve taken in this <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">preliminary data release</a>.</p>



<h2>What is a protocol?</h2>



<p>The word <em>protocol </em>means different things in different fields, so first we want to clearly signal what types of research output are in scope for this indicator. In line with the community-developed definition used in <a href="https://osf.io/x85gh/">the PRO-MaP recommendations</a>, we are defining protocol as &ldquo;detailed and/or step-by-step instructions for carrying out a research procedure.&rdquo; Clinical study protocols, review protocols, registered report protocols, and other protocols describing a study that will take place in the future generally do not meet this definition, although we&rsquo;re currently scoping work on a fifth indicator that is likely to include these outputs.</p>



<h2>How we got here</h2>



<p>In 2022, PLOS <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav">conducted a study</a> of researcher practices and priorities around sharing detailed methods information including protocols. The study found that, while methods sections of research articles are regarded as adequate for evaluating study findings, they are not widely perceived as adequate for reproducing results or reusing a method in a different context. To ensure that methods information is usable for a range of research tasks, study participants reported publicly sharing protocols through channels including peer-reviewed publications, supplementary information, dedicated repositories, and other websites.</p>



<p>With these results in mind, we drafted a set of requirements built on our <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">OSI measurement framework</a> and consulted on them with stakeholders including tool providers, meta-researchers, and other methods experts. We then worked with DataSeer to operationalize the requirements. Our current approach detects links to or citations of outputs from an allowlist of publications and repositories known to focus on protocols. In keeping with our approach to measuring data and code sharing, we also detect relevant metadata from supplementary information where available. Please consult our <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=42508123">methods documentation</a> for more detail.</p>



<h2>What the data say</h2>



<p>From 2019 through mid-2023, the rate of protocol sharing for research articles published in PLOS journals hovered around 8%. In contrast to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/open-science-indicators-q2-2023">trends in other Open Science practices</a> over the same period, adoption of protocol sharing by PLOS authors did not appear to change appreciably &ndash; according to these preliminary results. We assume that not all articles generate protocols, but the rate of protocol generation was not calculated for this release.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="606" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-1024x606.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21631" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-1024x606.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-300x178.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-768x455.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-1536x909.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-rates-2048x1212.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Among a comparator set of about 18,000 Open Access research articles from PubMed Central, the rate of protocol sharing did appear to increase from 10% in 2019 to 15% in the first half of 2023. Additional qualitative research may help to explain why these trendlines diverge, whether because of limitations in our data sources or actual differences in author behavior.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="604" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-1024x604.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21669" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-1024x604.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-300x177.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-768x453.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-1536x906.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/protocol-locations-1-2048x1208.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Preliminary analysis of the locations of protocols associated with PLOS articles indicates that a clear majority (84%) appear as peer-reviewed publications, with <em>Nature Protocols</em> and the Springer Protocols collection as the most cited sources. Sharing in dedicated repositories like protocols.io and Protocol Exchange became less common over the reporting period, falling from 11% in 2019 to 2% in the first half of 2023, while sharing via supplementary information became more common. The use of repositories is often viewed as a <a href="https://osf.io/x85gh/">best practice</a> for protocol sharing because these protocols can be updated as they evolve over time.</p>



<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>



<p>Our roadmap for further developing the protocols indicator includes adding detection of protocols on lab websites and other online locations. We plan to look more deeply at citations of published protocols, so that we can understand the extent to which authors are pointing to procedures actually used in their study as opposed to referencing protocols for some other reason. We also want to be able to assess how often researchers share their own protocols versus protocols created by others.</p>



<p>Just as importantly, we&rsquo;d like to hear from you: are there publications or repositories missing from <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=42508123">our allowlist</a>? How should we address the limitations of an allowlist-based approach? And are there other ways of communicating detailed methods information that we should consider? We&rsquo;d be grateful for your input by <strong>November 15</strong>; you can comment below or write to mlaflamme [at] plos.org to share your perspective.</p>

<p>In 2022, Guillaume Cabanac noticed something unusual: a study had attracted more than 100 citations in a short span of less than two months of being published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse in France, initially <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A172115FC8D0A5F44B31A18B08BB26">flagged the study on PubPeer</a> after it was highlighted by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04895">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, which automatically identifies research papers with certain issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The screener flagged this particular paper &#8212; which has <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2022/3685419/">since been retracted</a> &#8212; for containing so-called <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a>, strange twists on established terms that were probably introduced by translation software or humans looking to circumvent plagiarism checkers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Cabanac noticed something weird: The study had been cited 107 times according to the ‘Altmetrics donut,’ an indicator of an article’s potential impact, yet it had been downloaded just 62 times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128012"></span>



<p>What’s more, according to Google Scholar, this paper had been cited only once. “There was a clear discrepancy between the counts on Google Scholar and the counts on Altmetrics/Dimensions,” Cabanac says. That gap is especially significant since “we know that usually Google Scholar overestimates the number of citations,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a little probing,&nbsp; Cabanac and his sleuthing colleagues figured out where the extra citations were coming from: the metadata files submitted to Crossref, a repository for unique identifiers for scholarly metadata, as the group report in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192">preprint</a> posted to the arXiv server October 4. Google Scholar doesn’t use metadata files submitted to Crossref; instead it text-mines PDF versions of studies, Cabanac says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe we found an undocumented way of cheating with citation counts,” Cabanac tells Retraction Watch. “It’s original because it doesn’t require fraudsters to alter the version of record, meaning the PDF or HTML version of the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">&nbsp;The metadata files of the papers in question seem to contain more references than are in the HTML or PDF versions, Cabanac says. According to Cabanac, the references are sneaked in at some point into metadata files that are submitted to Crossref and automatically ingested. Since metadata files can be resubmitted as many times as one likes, updated metadata files can also be submitted anytime after an article is published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These extra undue citations ultimately inflate the Altmetrics score represented by the donut, which depicts how often an article is being cited and mentioned on social media. That’s problematic because these inflated citation scores are ultimately reflected on bibliographic platforms like Dimensions. Citation counts are frequently used as a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">way to judge researchers</a> and apportion funding so boosting such indicators could falsely amplify a researcher’s perceived impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the study, the introduced references seem to be coming largely from journals published by Technoscience Academy, an open access publisher run out of Gujarat, India, and a Crossref member. Technoscience Academy did not reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It isn’t clear who is manipulating the metadata files or whether the issue is due to a technical glitch, is unclear. But Cabanac says the phenomenon is a result of lack of gatekeeping. One way of addressing the issue would be by building tools and systems to regularly compare the references within PDFs, HTMLs and metadata files of the whole scholarly literature, he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac says if it becomes clear a publisher’s output includes cooked references, its Crossref membership should be scrutinized. Being the signatory on the agreement with Crossref, “the publisher is responsible for their actions,” Cabanac says. “They can run an audit in their own premises to see who the malevolent person is.”</p>



<p>“It looks really dodgy,” says Ginny Hendricks, director of member and community outreach at Crossref, who notes the case is the first time her organization has heard of sneaked references. “It definitely seems like a side effect of the community’s obsession with citation as a metric [and] a measure of impact or importance, which is unfortunate.”</p>



<p>She adds that Crossref will look into the issue, noting that the organization rarely ever revokes membership for cause. The only member it has excluded for cause in the past is Omics International, Henricks says: “They were causing harm to the whole community.”</p>



<p>Hendricks says Crossref has so far not considered introducing extensive gatekeeping but she encourages third parties to use Crossref’s open data to develop systems to do just that. “We’re not the people that decide scientific legitimacy,” she says.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The study analyzed the content of three journals published by Technoscience Academy, each of which have minted more than 1,000 digital object identifiers at Crossref. It found that around 9% of references included in metadata files of the papers published by these three journals — 5,978 references out of a total of 65,836 — benefitted just two researchers who had co-authored the studies being cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the researchers in question is J. Nageswara Rao of the Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology in Visakhapatnam, India, who benefitted from 3,103 extra citations, the study found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch contacted Rao for a comment but has yet to hear back. The <a href="https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2023/9767064.pdf">retraction notice</a> for the paper Cabanac found reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted by Hindawi following an investigation undertaken by the publisher [1]. This investigation has uncovered evidence of one or more of the following indicators of systematic manipulation of the publication process:&nbsp;</p>



<p>(1) Discrepancies in scope&nbsp;</p>



<p>(2) Discrepancies in the description of the research reported&nbsp;</p>



<p>(3) Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described&nbsp;</p>



<p>(4) Inappropriate citations&nbsp;</p>



<p>(5) Incoherent, meaningless and/or irrelevant content included in the article&nbsp;</p>



<p>(6) Peer-review manipulation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The second author that the study namechecks as benefiting from the sneaked references is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nBXNb5YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Bhavesh Kataria</a> of the LDRP Institute of Technology and Research in Gandhinagar, India, who has benefitted from 1,564 extra citations, according to the study. Retraction Watch could not find contact details for Kataria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three journals also profited from the sneaked citations, the study found. The<em> International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology</em> gained an extra 826 citations followed by the <em>International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology </em>and the <em>Turkish Journal of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation</em> with 537 and 428, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to sneaked references, the study also reports on instances of ‘lost references,’ which are references that are in the HTML/PDF but not in Crossref metadata files. “Users of the Crossref metadata (e.g., Dimensions) disregard some references because they are not in their database or because they failed to properly textmine the text of the references provided in the metadata,” Cabanac says. The study found that to be the case for 56% (36,939 out of 65,836) references in HTML versions of papers. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watch-microbial-life-earth">Watch: Recent microbial discoveries are changing our view of life on Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gumdrop with an earring.</p>



<p>That’s what pops to mind when I look at Sebastian Hess’ photos of a kind of plump, violent, single-celled creature he collected from a pond rich in sphagnum moss in southern Germany. The shape-shifting amoebozoan cell, prowling for algal cells to attack, curls its long strand of a flagellum into an earringlike loop. Holding the loop steady, the cell somehow glides. Yet the loop doesn’t flick, lash or wave. “They look basically like tiny flying saucers,” Hess says.</p>





<p>He first collected the creatures, with no species name and a baffling form of locomotion, in 2010 and wondered for years how the locomotion worked. Hess has been seeking and tending such single-celled wonders since he was a teenager with a windowsill microzoo. As a grown-up, now at Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, he specializes in the microscopic group his zoo featured: the protists.</p>



<p>This big, varied group of single cells are among the closest microbial cousins to multicellular life, and they wrap their genetic material inside a cell nucleus just as animals, plants and fungi do. Schoolroom trees of life for much of the 20th century and sometimes afterward often relegated the protist kingdom to some lower branch beneath the glorious crown of mostly multicellular kingdoms. Biologists think a little differently now, and bigger than mere kingdoms.</p>



<p>Today’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">more modern schemes</a> feature at least two vast hoops of microbial creatures, called the domains of Bacteria and Archaea (<em>SN: 7/29/15</em>). A third hoop, the Eukaryota, sweeps together the protists and the formerly proud treetop kingdoms: the animals, plants and fungi. Another sweep may be imminent, as the whole domain of eukaryotes, including the protists and the people who classify them, appear to be a branch of Archaea.</p>



<p>As for the flying saucers, Hess and colleagues worked off and on for almost 10 years to understand how such a cell moves so strangely. It’s a form of locomotion never found before in a living being, Hess says. This toroidal, or “doughnut,” swimming inspired Hess and colleagues in 2019 to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0478-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put the newfound species in its own new genus</a> — <em>Idionectes</em>, roughly meaning “peculiar swimmer.”</p>



<p>More in a bit on how to swim like a doughnut, but the species, <em>Idionectes vortex</em>, makes a fine example of how high-tech biology plus old-fashioned boots-in-mud exploration are creating a rush of discovery for a charismatic group of tiny lives on Earth. These single-celled organisms are far from boring little dots. Plus, they’re adding some unexpected twigs and branches to the evolutionary tree of life.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We live on a non-animal planet</h4>



<p>To pick just a few examples of 2023’s new protists, a species named in June has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head. In this roughly globe-shaped cell discovered in a South American termite’s gut, the top spins steadily around without ripping or self-strangling. Discoverers picked <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a demon-themed name, <em>Daimonympha friedkini</em></a>, inspired by the spinning head of the demonically possessed child in director William Friedkin’s 1973 film <em>The Exorcist</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The recently discovered protist <em>Daimonympha friedkini </em>has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some other new species belong to the odd-looking but ecologically important coccolithophores. This branch as a whole may do as much as 10 percent of the oceans’ photosynthesis, turning sunlight into stuff other creatures eat. Each coccolithophore cell covers itself in what look like tiny hubcaps. Among the distinctive features of the newly named <em>Calciopappus curvus</em> is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1434461023000457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pair of thumblike stubs on some of those hubcaps</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers in China named a notably small species in the <em>Euplotes </em>genus, <em>E. mazeii</em>. <em>Euplotes</em> cells grow several sets of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-023-5506-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skinny projections called cirri</a> that look like stick-drawing legs. Even with no brain or nervous system, the various kinds of <em>Euplotes</em> can move their legs with enough coordination to walk on an underwater surface. Engineers seeking inspiration for microscale robots have been analyzing such gaits.</p>

<p>Even long-known protists have allure as a form of micro­wildlife. Like big cats and polar bears, many of these charismatic microfauna deserve their own nature documentaries. Hess has helped film one of his longtime favorite protists, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>. This mildly pretty teardrop-shaped cell chases prey by shooting out a cartoonishly long swan neck that can stretch more than seven times the organism’s original body length. The neck, with a headlike bump at the end, swerves this way and that lithe as a snake, until a sudden pounce finally snags dinner.</p>





<p>“Stunning” is Hess’ word for protists. “They really behave like entire organisms. But they are just cells.”</p>



<p>Or consider five new species of tiny, voracious cells nicknamed nibblerids. Only about 3 micrometers across in their sickle-shaped hungry form, these protists bite (sort of) their typically larger victims by closing down on them with a special body groove armored with hardened toothlike bits called denticles.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This teardrop-shaped single cell, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>, hunts by shooting out a long necklike projection. The neck can follow fleeing prey until the enlarged end gets a grip.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The nibblerids and their closest known relatives, called nebulids, represent such a distinct and ancient lineage that they deserve their own big branch on the eukaryote family tree, evolutionary biologist Patrick Keeling of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and colleagues reported last year. Keeling speaks passionately about the importance of predators as more than nature-watching fun. “If you took all the lions and cheetahs and killed them all,” he says, “the whole ecosystem would go wacky.” That’s likely the case with protists, too.</p>



<p>Today’s protists are sorted into supergroups, which are branches bigger than the classic eukaryote kingdoms and give a broad and deep view of evolution. The Amorphea supergroup, for example, spans all animals and fungi plus some one-celled relatives including many amoebas. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05511-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new supergroup named for the nibblerids and nebulids, Provora</a>, alludes to “devouring voracious protists,” Keeling and his colleagues wrote.</p>



<p><em>Idionectes</em> too, for all its serene UFO-like travel, is a fierce predator. When it finds algae to feed on, the gliding spaceship becomes an attack amoeba. It dissolves a hole through the algal cell wall but doesn’t feed tiger-style, flesh-ripping from outside the kill. Instead, <em>Idionectes</em> slides through the hole in the wall, decanting itself into the doomed prey cell. Then this hunter devours its prey from the inside.</p>



<p>Watching protists could be terrifying, if they were bigger. Or if humans were smaller.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The microbial environment is totally different</h4>



<p>“We spend so much time trying to imagine alien worlds,” says Keeling. “There’s one right under our noses, more weird than anything we can think of.”</p>



<p>He’s not being theatrical. Consider the way specks of protist bodies experience water, for example. It’s radically different from the way giant lumbering humans and other macroscopic swimmers do. Lone cells are so tiny, the properties of plain water push them down evolutionary paths barely recognizable to us.</p>



<p>Dive into a swimming pool and, “if you’re not kicking, you still go forwards for quite a while until you stop, right?” Keeling says. A single cell, though, is so small that even the viscosity of water means the tiny <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microswimmers-make-splash">swimmer barely glides at all</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/09</em>). If it stops swimming, it just … stops. “It’s more like you’re in corn syrup,” Keeling says.</p>



<p>Besides slowing locomotion to a creep, the Syrup World no longer allows for certain swimming strokes. A scallop normally jets around by opening its shell slowly and closing it fast. But if magically miniaturized, the scallop would be stuck in place, flapping, physicists have predicted. It would make progress by shutting its shell but unmake that progress opening it again.</p>



<p>On the upside, though, motions that are useless for full-size people or scallops could propel a tiny swimmer. In 1952, physicist Geoffrey Ingram Taylor theorized that a microbial swimmer shaped like a doughnut <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1951.0218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could move itself</a> with a sort of inward rotation. (The idea gets credited to a charming talk in 1976 by U.S.&nbsp;Nobel laureate and physicist Edward Mills Purcell, but Taylor came before Purcell.)</p>



<p>That rotation is basically how the loop <em>Idionectes</em> cell turned out to swim, Hess and colleagues announced nearly 70 years after Taylor’s suggestion. The cell’s long, stringy flagellum curls into the scrawniest, skinniest thing ever likely to be described as a doughnut. It’s far more hole than dough, but it still approximates Taylor’s notion.</p>



<p>In a diagram developed by Taylor, the sides of a doughnut rise through the hole, over the rim and wrap around the other side for another slide into the middle. At first, Hess could tell that his gumdrop cell clearly spun, but looking at the flagellum’s skimpy doughnut-shape with plain microscopy, “you cannot see any movement,” he says. But when he and colleagues made underwater blizzards of latex microparticles in syrupy fluid (a technique that gave the researchers a breakthrough eight years into their efforts), Hess saw telltale particle movements showing the flagellum was rotating.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How one protist spins and swims</h4>



<p>The protist <em>Idionectes vortex</em> was discovered in 2010, but only recently did scientists show that it moves via toroidal swimming. Its flagellum loops like a doughnut. The flagellum and the dome-shaped part both rotate (purple arrows).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How protists are discovered</h4>



<p>Vittorio Boscaro, in Keeling’s lab at the University of British Columbia, has another rotation mystery. “We have no idea why they’re doing this,” he says. We’re on a video call, and he’s sharing his screen to show the new protist species with a rotating head, <em>D. friedkini</em>. In the ghostly grays of light microscopy video, a chunky cell swims as its top, like a large knobby polar ice cap, steadily rotates. It’s mesmerizing.</p>



<p>The 2023 paper announcing the discovery of <em>D. friedkini </em>calls rotating wheel structures “famously rare” in biology. Bacteria can freely spin their flagella without twisting themselves into pieces, but cells with more built-in structures rarely manage.</p>



<p>Still, this wasn’t the first spin-top among complex cells. Analyzing genetic material, researchers worked out a probable family tree of near and far relatives. Oddly, this beast doesn’t seem that closely related to another species with a rotating head informally called rubberneckia, which researchers have sporadically written about since 1974. To study protists is to live in weirdness.</p>



<p>That the new species came from a termite gut was no big deal, Boscaro gently tells me, because protistologists have been gutting termites in search of new species of rotating protists (rubberneckia and <em>D. friedkini</em> both belong to a group called Parabasalia) for more than a century.</p>



<p>Protists are everywhere. Kiran More, then an undergraduate at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, picked up a bunch when he added a little bit of species prospecting to a family trip in 2016.</p>



<p>As summer waned before More’s senior year, his family went driving through the eastern countryside of Nova Scotia. They stopped at a village on Cape Breton Island to admire a replica of the beloved 1920s schooner pictured on the Canadian dime, and More scooped up some shore sand. It took only a matter of minutes; he had packed a set of sampling tubes just in case. “I just carried it from hotel room to hotel room and stuck it in the minifridge, when there was a minifridge,” he says.</p>



<p>When he returned to school, the sludge became part of his undergraduate project looking for unknown species of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-microbes-sucked-some-ancient-life-dry">marine amoebas called vampyrellids</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/15</em>). The name may conjure nightmares, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeu.12698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even two of More’s ferocious finds</a> look less jaw-and-claw and more bed-and-breakfast. They resemble a fried egg.</p>

MORE <em>ET AL</em>/<em>J. OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY</em> 2018</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Though vampyrellid body plans vary, in this case, the egg’s “white” is the structure that breaks through the outer covering of prey to harvest the nutritious insides. Watching a small algal cell caught by the vampyrellid reveals the predator pressing against the algal cell until the victim stops moving, draining the dying cell’s innards in five to 10 minutes.</p>



<p>More’s single sample of collected sand ended up providing at least seven visibly different kinds of vampyrellid amoebas. <em>Placopus melkoniani</em> and <em>P. pusillus</em>, fried-egg vampyrellids now named as new species, hunt by rolling forward. Their outer membranes move “like a conveyor belt,” More says, or the treads on a tank. “You can see all their cell contents inside also rotating as the outer membrane rotates, which is almost beautiful,” he says.</p>



<p>In 2021, that same vacation sample delivered a third new species. More, by then a graduate student in systematics and evolution at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and colleagues named that new species <em>Sericomyxa perlucida</em>, meaning “transparent silken slime.” It looks like a road-killed badminton shuttlecock but with exquisitely delicate tufts. And it was <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just a new species in a new genus</a> but also represented a whole new family.</p>



<p>Any ornithologist or mammalogist would have been thrilled with the results. But in the giddy frontier of protist discovery, “I was disappointed,” More says. “I was so determined that I was going to find an environmental lineage where no one had seen anything before.”</p>



<p>When Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, the 18th century founder of Western science’s biological naming system, studied single-celled organisms, he was limited to looking. He named relatively few single-celled organisms and put most in a genus he eventually called <em>Chaos</em>. Today’s biologists have many more high-tech tools at their disposal, but the evolution of life on Earth still looks chaotic. One cell of a type of protist called a cryptomonad has seven separate sets of genes, according to research reported this year. Three of the extra sets come from little organs descended from long-ago free-living cells, two from symbiotic bacteria that had apparently become essential and another from a virus hitchhiking in one of the bacteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Microbes dominate Earth</h4>



<p>“We’re an aberration,” says Maureen O’Malley, a philosopher of microbiology at the University of Sydney, as one multicellular earthling talking to another. In the modern view of life, single-celled microbes — protists among them — dominate the planet. Big multicellular life-forms now look like the rare, outlier freaks. A 2018 comparison estimates that Earth’s protists account for twice the gigatons of carbon as all the animals put together. Add in other microbes, and together they hold 40 times the biomass.</p>

<p>Earth was entirely a microbe’s world for some 2.5 billion years or more, the majority of life’s history, O’Malley points out. We big multicellulars evolved on the backs of microbe innovations. Just a few examples: The oxygenated atmosphere came from cyanobacteria photosynthesizing 2.7 billion years ago. Even today an estimated half of the oxygen we breathe comes from microbial sources, not from plants. And plants’ ability to generate oxygen came from engulfing the microbial technology we know as chloroplasts.</p>



<p>Termites “eat” wood thanks to the protists packed into their guts. Tomato plants grow better with more of the predatory protists in the soil around their roots. Bobtail squid get the glow in their light organs from engulfed bacteria. Tsetse flies can’t sustain milk-feeding for their bizarre live-birthed young without specialized live-in bacteria to provide B vitamins. The list goes on and on for influential microbes. They shaped the world and keep us alive in it.</p>



<p>O’Malley sums up microbes as “the dominant life-forms not only in today’s world, but also in all past eras of the living Earth.” For bird watchers, wildflower lovers and nature enthusiasts of all stripes, truly seeing these invisibly small creatures for the first time can be like realizing dark matter exists. And not only that it exists, but that it makes up so much more of the universe than the supposed ordinary stuff.</p>



<p>New discoveries of protists and other microbial species and their ways of living are creating a very different view and appreciation for life in all its forms. With a few quirky exceptions — including us — to be an earthling is to be microscopic.</p>
