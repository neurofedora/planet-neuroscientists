              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-pollen-insects-280-million-years">The oldest known pollen-carrying insects lived about 280 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oldest known fossils of pollen-laden insects are of earwig-like ground-dwellers that lived in what is now Russia about 280 million years ago, researchers report. Their finding pushes back the fossil record of insects transporting pollen from one plant to another, a key aspect of modern-day pollination, by about 120 million years.</p>



<p>The insects — from a pollen-eating genus named <em>Tillyardembia</em> first described in 1937 — were typically about 1.5 centimeters long, says Alexander Khramov, a paleoentomologist at the Borissiak Paleontological Institute in Moscow. Flimsy wings probably kept the creatures mostly on the forest floor, he says, leaving them to climb trees to find and consume their pollen.</p>



<p>Recently, Khramov and his colleagues scrutinized 425 fossils of <em>Tillyardembia</em> in the institute’s collection. Six had clumps of pollen grains <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trapped on their heads, legs, thoraxes or abdomens</a>, the team reports February 28 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. A proportion that small isn’t surprising, Khramov says, because the fossils were preserved in what started out as fine-grained sediments. The early stages of fossilization in such material would tend to wash away pollen from the insects’ remains.</p>

<p>The pollen-laden insects had only a couple of types of pollen trapped on them, the team found, suggesting that the critters were very selective in the tree species they visited. “That sort of specialization is in line with potential pollinators,” says Michael Engel, a paleoentomologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who was not involved in the study. “There’s probably vast amounts of such specialization that occurred even before <em>Tillyardembia</em>, we just don’t have evidence of it yet.”</p>



<p>Further study of these fossils might reveal if <em>Tillyardembia </em>had evolved special pollen-trapping hairs or other such structures on their bodies or heads, says Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., also not part of the study. It would also be interesting, he says, to see if something about the pollen helped it stick to the insects.&nbsp;If the pollen grains had structures that enabled them to clump more readily, for example, then those same&nbsp;features&nbsp;may have helped them grab Velcro-like onto&nbsp;any hairlike structures on&nbsp;the insects’ bodies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snapping-shrimp-fastest-claw-biology">The fastest claw in the sea belongs to young snapping shrimp</a></h4>

              
                <p>Full-grown snapping shrimp were already known to have some of the fastest claws under the waves. But it turns out they’re nothing compared with their kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Juvenile snapping shrimp produce <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.244645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest known underwater accelerations</a> of any reusable body part, researchers report February 28 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.&nbsp;While the claws’ top speed isn’t terribly impressive, they go from zero to full throttle in record time.</p>



<p>To deter predators or competitors, snapping shrimp create shock waves with their powerful claws. The shrimp store energy in the flexing exoskeleton of their claw as it opens, latching it in place much like a bow-and-arrow mechanism, says Jacob Harrison, a biologist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>





<p>Firing the claw and releasing this elastic energy produces a speeding jet of water. Bubbles form behind it and promptly implode, liberating a huge amount of energy, momentarily <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shrimps-spew-bubbles-hot-sun">flashing as hot as the sun</a> and creating a deafening crack (<em>SN: 10/3/01</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn&#8217;t know anything about how this mechanism developed.”</p>



<p>While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (<em>Alpheus heterochaelis</em>) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a young snapping shrimp shut its claw in slow motion | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rwmEvSOJMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It takes less than a millisecond for a juvenile snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) to slam its claw shut. But thanks to footage taken at 300,000 frames per second and then slowed down by 10,000 times, the human eye can capture this extreme acceleration and the imploding bubble it creates.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dracula ants (<em>Mystrium camillae</em>) and some termites produce more explosive bites but aren’t pushing against water. The stinging cells of jellyfish launch their venomous harpoons about 100 times as fast, but their firing mechanism is inherently single use. Snapping shrimp, on the other hand, can fire their claws again and again.</p>





<p>The juveniles’ firing and bubble creation weren’t very reliable at the smallest sizes, but the shrimp routinely tried snapping anyway. The team wonders if the young shrimp could be practicing and training the necessary musculature.</p>



<p>If so, that training might ultimately be crucial to the claw’s function, says Kate Feller, a visual ecologist at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who studies similarly ultrafast mantis shrimp and was not involved in the new study. “If you were to somehow manipulate the claws so that they couldn’t properly close and they couldn’t snap,” she wonders, “would that affect their ability to develop these mechanisms?”</p>



<p>Understanding the storage of elastic energy in biological materials and how it flows through them is “tricky,” Harrison says. Figuring out how such tiny claws store so much energy without fracturing may help researchers illuminate this superpower.</p>

<p>In April 2022, Ioannis Kalpouzos, a professor at Harvard Law, received an invitation to join the editorial board of the newly-launched <em>American Yearbook of International Law</em>. But something gave him pause.</p>



<p>“The title sounded a bit dodgy &#8211; it sounded like something I should have heard of,” Kalpouzos told Retraction Watch, adding that with some Googling he “found that it wasn’t really a thing.”</p>



<p>“If somebody’s not in the know, it’s easier for them to be duped, I suppose,” Kalpouzos said, but his instincts told him that such a yearbook would most likely be published by an established law review.</p>



<p>So he declined.</p>

<p>Saeed Bagheri, a professor at Reading Law School in Reading, England, responded by posting his editorial board invitation letter, and several other legal scholars noted they had received similar invitations:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The title is one of three new journals launched by Dimitris Liakopoulos, a legal researcher who at the time of this writing sits on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLiakopoulos%252c%2bDimitris">33 retractions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/14/legal-researcher-up-to-23-retractions-for-false-affiliations-plagiarism/">previously reported</a>, Liakopoulos had falsely claimed to be a professor at several universities, including Columbia Law School, Stetson University, and various European institutions. In 2020, a representative of Tufts University, where Liakopoulos had claimed to be on faculty, told us that he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Liakopoulos_nonaffiliate.pdf">had never been affiliated with the school</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the retraction notices on Liakopoulos’s work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/14/itinerant-legal-scholar-who-claimed-tufts-affiliation-up-to-10-retractions/">cite concerns</a> about his stated affiliations, and they often note plagiarism, such as the <a href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789047431145/Bej.9789004177710.i-234_001.xml">note</a> retracting an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/03/legal-researcher-who-claimed-false-affiliation-up-to-31-retractions/">entire book</a> Liakopoulos co-authored.</p>



<p>Under the auspices of the putative non-profit <a href="https://theceij.jimdofree.com/">Center of European and International Justice</a>, Liakopoulos has recently launched the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/ayil">American Yearbook of International Law</a>, the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yeucl/index">Yearbook of European Union and Comparative Law</a>, and the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yiecpl/index">Yearbook of International &amp; European Criminal and Procedural Law</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As yearbooks, the volumes appear annually rather than publishing articles throughout any given year. All three yearbooks have one volume so far, from 2022.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The web site for the Center of European and International Justice states its address as 777 UN Plaza, which is across the street from the United Nations building in New York City. That address is the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Center_for_the_United_Nations">Church Center for the United Nations,</a> which boasts a chapel regularly used for weddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the web address for the center includes the clause jimdofree.com. This indicates it is from a <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/">web domain service</a> that gives people free online hosting, rather than the .org domain one would expect from a legitimate non-profit.</p>



<p>Besides the dubious affiliation, at least two yearbook articles, both by Liakopoulos, have had concerns raised about plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A PubPeer sleuth notes that one article in the American yearbook <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B532E64DAAAE67C926196F9CC46592">lifts</a> from a doctoral thesis originally published in Italian, while an article from one of the European yearbooks <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/56C9F0E47EE3CB1197108D5778C45E">pulls</a> text from a previously published Italian paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The yearbooks are published by the National Documentation Center of Greece, a cultural heritage organization sponsored by the Greek government. We contacted the Documentation Center to ask about how they had vetted the reliability of the yearbooks but did not hear back.</p>



<p>We also used the contact email provided on the yearbook web pages (purportedly directed to a person named Sara Cristain) to ask Liakopoulos some questions about the journals.</p>



<p>A few days later, we received a vituperative note from one Klaus Volger, who assured us that the yearbooks are legitimate, citing among other things – all without evidence – the imprimatur of the Greek government. Volger also asserted that no article in the yearbooks is plagiarized, and said that <em>Retraction Watch </em>is only interested in this topic for “money and publicity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Volger, or someone using his name, had responded similarly after our previous posts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-lightning-strike-wildfire-spark-risk-climate-change">An incendiary form of lightning may surge under climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>A form of lightning with a knack for sparking wildfires may surge under climate change.</p>



<p>An analysis of satellite data suggests “hot lightning” — strikes that channel electrical charge for an extended period — may be more likely to set landscapes ablaze than more ephemeral flashes, researchers report February 10 in <em>Nature Communications.</em> Each 1 degree Celsius of warming could spur <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 10 percent increase in the most incendiary of these Promethean bolts</a>, boosting their flash rate to about four times per second by 2090 — up from nearly three times per second in 2011.</p>





<p>That’s dangerous, warns physicist Francisco Javier Pérez-Invernón of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain. “There will be more risk of lightning-ignited wildfires.”</p>



<p>Among all the forces of nature, lightning sets off the most blazes. Flashes that touch down amid minimal or no rainfall — known as dry lightning — are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac84a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially effective fire starters</a>. These bolts have initiated some of the most destructive wildfires in recent years, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">2020 blazes in California</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>But more than parched circumstances can influence a blast’s ability to spark flames. <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/21/17529/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Field observations</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711220301260?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laboratory experiments</a> have suggested the most enduring form of hot lightning — “long continuing current lightning”— may be especially combustible. These strikes channel current for more than 40 milliseconds. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some last longer than one-third of a second</a> — the typical duration of a human eye blink.</p>



<p>“This type of lightning can transport a huge amount of electrical discharge from clouds to the ground or to vegetation,” Pérez-Invernón says. Hot lightning’s flair for fire is analogous to lighting a candle; the more time a wick or vegetation is exposed to incendiary energy, the easier it kindles.</p>



<p>Previous research has proposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lightning-strikes-will-surge-climate-change">lightning may surge under climate change</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/14</em>). But it has remained less clear how hot lightning — and its ability to spark wildfires — might evolve.</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón and his colleagues examined the relationship between hot lightning and U.S. wildfires, using lightning data collected by a <a href="https://www.goes-r.gov/multimedia/dataAndImageryImagesGoes-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather satellite</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfire</a> data from 1992 to 2018.</p>



<p>Long continuing current lightning could have sparked up to 90 percent of the roughly 5,600 blazes encompassed in the analysis, the team found. Since <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10 percent</a> of all lightning strikes during the summer in the western United States have long continuing current, the relatively high ignition count led the researchers to infer that flashes of hot lightning were more prone to sparking fire than typical bolts.</p>





<p>The researchers also probed the repercussions of climate change. They ran computer simulations of the global activity of lightning during 2009 to 2011 and from 2090 to 2095, under a future scenario in which annual greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2080 and then decline.</p>



<p>The team found that in the later period, climate change may boost updraft within thunderstorms, causing hot lightning flashes to increase in frequency to about 4 strikes per second globally — about a 40 percent increase from 2011. Meanwhile, the rate of all cloud-to-ground strikes might increase to nearly 8 flashes per second, a 28 percent increase.</p>



<p>After accounting for changes in precipitation, humidity and temperature, the researchers predicted wildfire risk will significantly increase in Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and Australia, and risk will go up most dramatically in North America and Europe. However, risk may decrease in many polar regions, where rainfall is projected to increase while hot lightning rates remain constant.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s valuable to show that risk may evolve differently in different places, says Earth systems scientist Yang Chen of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But, he notes, the analysis uses sparse data from polar regions, so there is a lot of uncertainty. Harnessing additional data from ground-based lightning detectors and other data sources could help, he says. “That [region is] important, because a lot of carbon can be released from permafrost.”</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón agrees more data will help improve projections of rates of lightning-induced wildfire, not just in the polar regions, but also in Africa, where blazes are common but fire reports are lacking.</p>

But there are countless other individuals who may benefit from knowing some of the “brain basics” concerning music that have been discovered over the past few decades. </p><p>Music communicates emotion, but sometimes the failure to wire musical information securely in the brain during practice, or experiencing anxiety about technique or memory during performance causes emotional communication to suffer. Some knowledge of brain basics can help us study and teach with greater efficiency and confidence, thus giving us more freedom in performance to concentrate on communicating the emotional essence of the music. Consider the following:</p><h2><strong>1. We are hardwired for music as we are for language</strong></h2><p>Infants are born with amazing musical abilities. They can detect a missing downbeat at the age of two to three days and begin moving to music as soon as they have control of their limbs. They prefer singing to speaking, can recognize variations in complex rhythms at six months, and have a very good memory for music. Many of these abilities are lost by the age of one because they are not nurtured, as is the case with language. Perhaps we should rethink “how” and “when” we begin teaching music to children because music is part of who we are as human beings. Or as well-known music educator Edwin Gordon said, “Music is as basic as language to human development and existence.”</p><h2><strong>2. Practicing drives brain neuroplasticity</strong></h2><p>We all have similar brains, but each person’s brain develops in a unique way based on his learning and experience. For example, the brain of a cardiac surgeon will look a bit different from that of a musician. Many areas of the brain are involved in making music, including the areas for processing visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and motor information, as well as areas for processing emotion and memory. As we practice an instrument or voice, connections develop among all of these areas through vast neural networks, and our brains change as a result. The more we practice, the more the brain changes. These changes in the brain are called neuroplasticity. There are some ways of practicing that lead to stronger wiring or greater neuroplasticity in the brain, meaning increasingly better technical and musical skills and stronger memory for music.</p><h2><strong>3. Practicing happens in the brain, not in the muscles</strong></h2><p>Motor imagery is a powerful practice technique that involves imagining all of the movements necessary to play or sing a piece of music. One hears the music in one’s mind and imagines making the movements to create the sound—“feeling” the movements in one’s mind. Research has shown that when we practice using motor imagery, all of the areas of the brain that would normally be involved when we physically practice are active—with the single exception of the motor cortex that sends signals to the muscles to make movements. So, if we imagine every aspect of making music, our brain is practicing, and the result is nearly the same as if we had physically practiced. Imagine the implications this technique has for being able to practice if injured, if one has no access to an instrument, or if needing additional practice on something technically demanding without the possibility of causing injury from physically over-practicing.</p><h2><strong>4. Sleep may be one of the most important practice strategies of all&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>What happens in the brain during sleep reinforces the idea that practicing occurs in the brain, not in the muscles. With the discovery in the 1950s of REM and NREM sleep, researchers realized that the brain is quite active during sleep, and they subsequently have found that several stages of the sleep cycle are vitally important for the encoding and consolidation of procedural memory (motor skill memory) as well as for encoding and consolidation of declarative memory (memory for a particular piece of music). Lack of sleep impairs both our initial learning of, as well as our memory for, a piece of music.</p><h2><strong>5. The visual is important in learning and making music</strong></h2><p>We think of music as being strictly about sound, but the visual is involved as well. Amazing brain cells called mirror neurons fire not only when we make a motion ourselves but also when we see someone else making that motion or hear the sound resulting from that motion (such as the sound of a musical instrument). If we are trying to learn the violin, our brain “learns” by watching someone else play and develops a template for that motion and for the sound that motion creates, a template on which we can build as we practice. So, observation and listening are tremendously important in teaching or learning an instrument or voice. And surprisingly, these mirror neurons also have an impact on how we hear a live performance as a member of the audience. What we see affects what we hear.</p><p>Over the past few decades, we have added a great deal of information about the mind and body to our vocal and instrumental study. With the recent explosion of information about neuroscience and music, perhaps it’s time to incorporate some information about the brain as well into how we think about studying and making music.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by Damir Kopezhanov from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/-Oo_nApUwRg">Unsplash</a> (public domain)</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/729104960/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/729104960/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f02%2fdamir-kopezhanov-Oo_nApUwRg-unsplash-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/new-perspectives-on-the-american-civil-war-reading-list/">New perspectives on the American Civil War [reading list]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/saving-earths-refrigerator-what-does-global-warming-mean-for-our-planets-future/">Saving Earth&#x2019;s Refrigerator: what does global warming mean for our planet&#x2019;s future?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/explore-environmental-history-in-eight-books-reading-list/">Explore environmental history in eight books [reading list]</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eye-drops-delay-nearsightedness-child">Medicated eye drops may delay nearsightedness in children</a></h4>

              
                <p>An eye drop a day could keep myopia at bay — at least temporarily.</p>



<p>Using nightly eye drops with 0.05 percent atropine, a medication that relaxes the eye muscle responsible for focusing vision, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may delay myopia onset in children</a>, researchers report February 14 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Myopia, also called nearsightedness, is an irreversible condition in which the eyeball grows too long front to back, causing blurred distant vision. It typically begins in childhood, and the earlier it starts, the worse eye health can become later in life. Elongated eyes increase the risk for ocular complications including cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.</p>





<p>The prevalence of myopia has risen rapidly over the last few decades. About one-fourth of the global population currently has the condition. It is expected to affect half of people worldwide by 2050.</p>



<p>Genetics plays a large role in the condition. A 2020 study found that <a href="https://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(20)30265-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myopia risk is more than 10 times as high in children of two highly myopic parents as in children of nonmyopic parents</a>, says ophthalmologist Jason Yam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>But he and other scientists speculate that environmental factors such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-eyes">less time outdoors</a> and more intensive education are causing the recent boom (<em>SN: 1/24/13</em>). “It’s happening too quickly to be a purely genetic or inherited issue,” says optometrist Kathryn Saunders of Ulster University in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, who was not involved in the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low-dose atropine eye drops are already used to slow myopia progression in several countries in Asia. Yam and colleagues wanted to see if the medication could also delay myopia onset. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team recruited nonmyopic children ages 4 through 9 who lived in Hong Kong. Each participant received nightly eye drops but was randomly assigned to receive drops with 0.05 percent atropine, 0.01 percent atropine or a placebo. Families and clinicians didn’t know which treatment group the children were in.</p>



<p>A total of 353 children used their assigned eye drops for two years. Only about 25 percent of children who took 0.05 percent atropine eye drops, roughly 30 kids, developed myopia in at least one eye, compared with about 50 percent of those who used 0.01 percent atropine or placebo eye drops, around 60 kids in each group. The percentages in each group were similar for eye elongation not severe enough to be considered myopia.</p>





<p>“It’s a great first step to encourage us to explore more,” Saunders says.</p>



<p>Scientists will need to conduct studies in more diverse populations and environments to reach generalizable conclusions since the trial took place in only Hong Kong. Eye color may also influence dosing, as lighter-pigmented eyes might be more susceptible to side effects, including sensitivity to light.</p>



<p>How atropine slows myopia onset and progression remains a mystery. The medication might improve blood circulation in the eye, Yam says, but that’s just one existing hypothesis.</p>



<p>The new study was too short to suggest that atropine eye drops can prevent myopia. But an ongoing follow-up period in which participants continue taking the medication through their teenage years — when eye length stabilizes — will help the team understand if atropine eye drops can ward off the condition altogether.</p>

                <p><em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-023-08002-8">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for long COVID (HOT-LoCO), an interim safety report from a randomised controlled trial</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13160 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/longcovid.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="136" />Post COVID-19 Condition or long COVID, can affect anyone exposed to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or severity of original symptoms. It is commonly defined as the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least two months. Such symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others.</p>
<p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is suggested to be effective in similar conditions, such as Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue syndrome, but is not an accepted treatment for patients diagnosed with long COVID. In a randomized controlled trial conducted at Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, Kjellberg et al. sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for individuals with long COVID symptoms.</p>
<p>Twenty previously healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a placebo treatment. Data on potential side effects or adverse events that occurred during the treatment were collected, and long COVID symptoms before and after the treatment were assessed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was found to be overall safe, with no serious adverse events reported during treatment or follow-up. The most common adverse effects were cough and chest pain or discomfort, however these were mild and transient.</p>
<p>Overall, this interim safety report published in <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> provides preliminary evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be a safe treatment for individuals suffering from long COVID and could help other researchers design similar trials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>BMC Endocrine Disorders</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-022-01208-y#Abs1">Lifestyle management in polycystic ovary syndrome – beyond diet and physical activity</a></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13161 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/lifestyle.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="147" />Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women. Women with PCOS might experience a combination of reproductive, metabolic, and psychological comorbidities. A review by Cowan et al. published in <em>BMC Endocrine Disorders </em>provides an overview of the evidence to date on lifestyle strategies used to optimize management of PCOS.</p>
<p>Modifying protein, carbohydrate or fat quality or quantity seem to affect similarly the presentation of the syndrome. Vigorous aerobic exercise, however, which has been shown to improve body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and insulin resistance, seems to benefit women with PCOS. Also, psychological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction, to support the specific mental health needs of women with PCOS warrant further investigation, while improving sleep quality might be critical for promoting healthy lifestyle changes and help reduce related symptoms. The authors of the review highlight, however, that while optimizing sleep and emotional wellbeing may aid symptom management, research exploring the efficacy of clinical interventions is lacking. The use of traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine approaches, including acupuncture and yoga, by women with PCOS has been growing fast; however, the research evidence is not sufficiently robust to support their integration into routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this review provides support for the idea that a holistic approach to lifestyle management is likely to be beneficial for managing PCOS symptoms.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13162 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/antenatal.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="148" />In a study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>, Cheng et al. aimed to evaluate the impact of the teach-back method on maternal health literacy, postpartum health behavior, and maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, pregnant women with limited maternal health literacy were randomly assigned to either the control group, where they received routine education sessions, or the intervention group, where they received routine education sessions <em>as well as</em> the teach-back method. This method involves pregnant women being asked to use their own words to restate what they have just learned. The educator then assesses women’s understanding of the subject, identifies any misunderstandings, corrects mistakes, and provides additional information, if needed, until all women can correctly restate what they have learned.</p>
<p>The researchers observed that the teach-back method led to positive postpartum health behavior and improved postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. In particular, women in the intervention group scored higher in terms of their knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy related to postpartum maternal-infant health, and also had significantly fewer postpartum complications compared to women in the control group.</p>
<p>Overall, the study provides support for the idea that the teach-back method can improve postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. The authors suggest that this method could be potentially incorporated into education programs to improve health outcomes for this population.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13163 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/VR.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="159" />Virtual Reality has been increasingly used in the training of healthcare professionals, with several studies showing that students who participate in activities that use Virtual Reality tend to be more engaged and motivated than students who are trained via traditional methods. A study published in <em>BMC Medical Education</em> aimed to compare the effectiveness of using Virtual Reality versus role-playing methodology in teaching Basic Life Support skills.</p>
<p>Professionals working in healthcare facilities in Catalonia who were enrolled in Basic Life Support courses were randomly assigned to either the Virtual Reality group or the role-playing group. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare learning outcomes in the two groups. Secondary aims included evaluating satisfaction levels in the two groups with regard to the training provided, as well as analyzing the costs associated with each type of training.</p>
<p>No significant differences between the two groups were observed in terms of learning outcomes. However, participants in the VR group reported greater satisfaction with the training compared to those in the role-playing group. Also, the costs of using Virtual Reality proved to be slightly higher per student than the costs of using traditional training. However, as noted by the authors, if Virtual Reality training were to be extensively used, platform costs would possibly decrease and such differences would likely disappear.</p>
<p>In sum, Virtual Reality can be particularly useful for online training programs. However, further research is needed to explore its potential benefits for different professionals.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13164 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/adolescents.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="66" />Longitudinal health studies investigating the transition from adolescence into early adulthood are critical for understanding developmental changes, and for providing insights as to how health behavior might change as a function of age. However, the success of such studies depends on participant recruitment and retention, which prove to be challenging factors when conducting research with adolescents. In a study published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em>, Jong et al. investigated adolescents’ perspectives regarding signing up and continued involvement in longitudinal health studies.</p>
<p>Forty-eight individuals from England between the ages of 15 and 20 years participated in nine in-person focus groups about recruitment and retention in research. The main reasons for signing up included joining with peer groups, being offered financial incentives, and receiving personalized feedback. Recruitment via social media with simple messages tailored to their needs, building trust and rapport with the research staff, and user-friendly and flexible data collection were further perceived as key factors to continued involvement.</p>
<p>The findings from this study highlight the importance of understanding adolescents’ interests and motivations behind study enrolment and dropout, and can help inform the development of effective strategies for recruiting and retaining adolescents in longitudinal health research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mommy-brain-transforms-pregnancy">‘Mommy brain’ doesn’t capture how the brain transforms during pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain. That sounds bad. Throw in the forgetfulness and fogginess, or “momnesia,” that many moms report, and what’s left is the notion that for the brain, the transition to motherhood is a net loss.</p>



<p>“I see it on social media all the time,” says neuroscientist and therapist Jodi Pawluski of the University of Rennes in France. “Your brain shrunk. This is why [you] forget everything.”</p>



<p>But that’s just not true, Pawluski says. The perception that the maternal brain is dysfunctional has gone on long enough: It’s time to “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2801288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start giving the maternal brain the credit it deserves</a>,” Pawluski and her colleagues write February 6 in in <em>JAMA Neurology.</em></p>





<p>Pregnancy does kick-start structural changes in the brain, including a loss of gray matter. But the loss isn’t <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">automatically a bad thing</a> — reductions can reflect a fine-tuning process that makes the brain more efficient (<em>SN: 3/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the transition to motherhood, the brain reorganizes its connections, strengthening those that are useful and letting go of those that aren’t, Pawluski says. This reorganization prepares the brain “to learn rapidly to keep a baby alive,” she says.</p>



<p>In a 2016 study, for example, researchers reported brain changes, including reductions, that appear to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-linked-long-term-changes-moms-brain">foster attachment to a new baby</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>). Other work by this team found pregnancy-triggered decreases in the volume of the ventral striatum, a region involved in motivation and reward. Those reductions in mothers’ brains were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31757430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with a heightened responsiveness</a> toward their babies, the team reported in <em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Still, many pregnant and postpartum women do report memory loss. Studies haven’t found large differences when testing memory for new moms compared with nonmothers, Pawluski says, but more research is needed to understand the mental load of parenthood — the impact of endless tasks and distractions.</p>



<p>A possible explanation for “momnesia” or “mommy brain” is that new mothers turn their attention toward baby and away from other things. Indeed, pregnant women, in contrast to never-pregnant women, demonstrated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2021.2019280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a boost in learning about baby-related objects</a> as compared with adult-related items, researchers reported in <em>Memory</em> in 2022. Pregnant women also fared better with recalling relationships between objects and locations.</p>



<p>The changes in the maternal brain are akin to those seen during adolescence. A study of first-time mothers and female adolescents found that the reductions in volume in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal brain matched those seen in the teens</a>, researchers reported in <em>Human Brain Mapping</em> in 2019. “We accept adolescence as being a time of transition and a lot of neuroplasticity,” or the brain’s ability to change, Pawluski says. The shift to motherhood is just as impactful on the brain, she says.</p>





<p>Giving the maternal brain its due for its incredible adaptations does not mean that caregiving is a skill exclusive to those who give birth. While hormones trigger brain modifications during pregnancy, nonbirthing parents’ brains change with the experience of having a newborn. After the birth of their first child, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhac333/6691667?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new fathers’ brains showed a reduction in gray matter</a>, but childless men’s brains didn’t, researchers reported in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em> in 2022.</p>



<p>Changing misperceptions about the brain during the transition to motherhood “comes back to acknowledging the importance of caregiving,” Pawluski says, by all parents. “The ability for your brain to actually learn to keep a baby alive is a big deal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-impressionist-monet-painters">Air pollution made an impression on Monet and other 19th century painters</a></h4>

              
                <p>The 19th century landscape paintings hanging in London’s Tate Britain museum looked awfully familiar to climate physicist Anna Lea Albright. Artist Joseph Mallord William Turner&#8217;s signature way of shrouding his vistas in fog and smoke reminded Albright of her own research tracking air pollution.<br><br>“I started wondering if there was a connection,” says Albright, who had been visiting the museum on a day off from the Laboratory for Dynamical Meteorology in Paris. After all, Turner — a forerunner of the impressionist movement — was painting as Britain’s industrial revolution gathered steam, and a growing number of belching manufacturing plants earned London the nickname “The Big Smoke.”</p>



<p>Turner’s early works, such as his 1814 painting “Apullia in Search of Appullus,” were rendered in sharp details. Later works, like his celebrated 1844 painting “Rain, Steam and Speed — the Great Western Railway,” embraced a dreamier, fuzzier aesthetic.</p>





<p>Perhaps, Albright thought, this burgeoning painting style wasn’t a purely artistic phenomenon. Perhaps Turner and his successors painted exactly what they saw: their environs becoming more and more obscured by smokestack haze.</p>



<p>To find out how much realism there is in impressionism, Albright teamed up with Harvard University climatologist Peter Huybers, who’s an expert in reconstructing pollution before instruments existed to closely track air quality. Their analysis of nearly 130 paintings by Turner, Paris-based impressionist Claude Monet and several others tells a tale of two modernizing cities.</p>



<p>Low contrast and whiter hues are hallmarks of the impressionist style. They are also hallmarks of air pollution, which can affect how a distant scene looks to the naked eye. Tiny airborne particles, or aerosols, can absorb or scatter light. That makes the bright parts of objects appear dimmer while also shifting the entire scene’s color toward neutral white.</p>



<p>The artworks that Albright and Huybers investigated, which span from the late 1700s to the early 1900s, decrease in contrast as the 19th century progresses. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2219118120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That trend tracks with an increase in air pollution</a>, estimated from historical records of coal sales, Albright and Huybers report in the Feb. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our results indicate that [19th century] paintings capture changes in the optical environment associated with increasingly polluted atmospheres during the industrial revolution,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albright and Huybers distinguished art from aerosol by first using a mathematical model to analyze the contrast and color of 60 paintings that Turner made between 1796 and 1850 as well as 38 Monet works from 1864 to 1901. They then compared the findings to sulfur dioxide emissions over the century, estimated from the trend in the annual amount of coal sold and burned in London and Paris. When sulfur dioxide reacts with molecules in the atmosphere, aerosols form.</p>

<p>As sulfur dioxide emissions increased over time, the amount of contrast in both Turner’s and Monet’s paintings decreased. However, paintings of Paris that Monet made from 1864 to 1872 have much higher contrast than Turner&#8217;s last paintings of London made two decades earlier.</p>



<p>The difference, Albright and Huybers say, can be attributed to the much slower start of the industrial revolution in France. Paris’ air pollution level around 1870 was about what London’s was when Turner started painting in the early 1800s. It confirms that the similar progression in their painting styles can&#8217;t be chalked up to coincidence, but is guided by air pollution, the pair conclude.</p>





<p>The researchers also analyzed the paintings’ visibility, or the distance at which an object can be clearly seen. Before 1830, the visibility in Turner&#8217;s paintings averaged about 25 kilometers, the team found. Paintings made after 1830 had an average visibility of about 10 kilometers. Paintings made by Monet in London around 1900, such as “Charing Cross Bridge,” have a visibility of less than five kilometers. That’s similar to estimates for modern-day megacities such as Delhi and Beijing, Albright and Huybers say.</p>



<p>To strengthen their argument, the researchers also analyzed 18 paintings from four other London- and Paris-based impressionists. Again, as outdoor air pollution increased over time, the contrast and visibility in the paintings decreased, the team found. What’s more, the decrease seen in French paintings lagged behind the decrease seen in British ones.</p>



<p>Overall, air pollution can explain about 61 percent of contrast differences between the paintings, the researchers calculate. In that respect, &#8220;different painters will paint in a similar way when the environment is similar,&#8221; Albright says. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to overstep and say: Oh, we can explain all of impressionism.&#8221;</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">Trish Tran narrates her life in staccato notes.</p>



<p>“I remember carrying my little sister on my back because she’s too tired and walking through the huge sunflower fields … and me feeling so tired I didn’t think I could walk another step.”</p>



<p>“I remember being in a taxi with my mother, coming back to the man who had been violently abusive to all of us…. Her words to me were, ‘Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.’ ”</p>





<p>“I’m waiting at a train station … to meet my mother who I haven’t seen in many years…. Hours pass and eventually I try to call her … and she says to me, ‘I’m sorry, Trish. My neighbor was upset, and I needed to stay back with them.’ And her voice was slurring quite a lot, so I knew she had been drinking.”</p>



<p>Tran, who lives in Perth, Australia, is dispassionate as she describes a difficult childhood. Her account lacks what are generally considered classic signs of trauma: She makes no mention of flashbacks, appears to have a generally positive outlook and speaks with relative ease about distressing events. Yet she narrates her life growing up and living in the Australian Outback as a series of disconnected events; her life story lacks connective glue.</p>

<p>That disjointed style is not how people, at least people in the West, tend to talk about themselves, says psychologist Christin Camia. Autobiographical accounts, like any good narrative, typically contain a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">curation of key past experiences</a>, transitions linking those experiences and larger arcs about where life is headed. People use these stories to make sense of their lives, says Camia, of Zayed University’s Abu Dhabi campus in the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<p>But a growing body of evidence from fields as wide-ranging as psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy and literary studies suggests that, as with Tran, trauma can shatter the narrative coherence of one’s life. People lose the plot.</p>



<p>Life’s crises can trigger an existential crisis, Camia says. People think: “I don’t know who I am, and I don’t know where I go from here.”</p>





<p>One therapy now in testing aims to re-tether traumatized individuals to their mental timelines, or their sense of themselves as connected across past, present and future. The therapy focuses on the future, which once rife with possibilities now appears as a void. It asks: What would it take for someone like Tran, or anyone traumatized by war, abuse, mass shootings, the ongoing pandemic and other calamities, to flip their life script, to say that they know who they are and where they go from here?</p>



<h4>People maintain a sense of self across time</h4>



<p>In a nod to an established research approach, I have asked Tran to tell me her story in two parts. First, she should narrate seven snapshots of key moments in her life. Second, Tran, who is a lecturer on mental health recovery at Curtin University in Perth, should stitch those snapshots together to tell me how she became who she is today.</p>



<p>The first task comes easy. The second task eludes her. She switches to generalities. “I’ve always been a highly reflective person,” she says. “I’ve had to rely on my brains to keep myself and my family alive.”</p>



<p>I try to nudge her toward specifics, but her timeline disintegrates. She repeatedly attempted suicide. Her mother brought home many violent men.</p>



<p>The developer of this two-question approach, psychologist Tilmann Habermas, wasn’t focused on people who had experienced trauma. Habermas, now at Goethe University Frankfurt, wanted to understand how adolescents develop a narrative identity and then sustain that sense of self over time.</p>



<p>In 2003, Habermas launched a study that would follow participants for up to 16 years. Participants came into the lab every four years and dictated their life story in roughly 20-minute increments, using the two-task format I tried with Tran. Habermas analyzed the resulting transcripts line by line, coding them for emotion, tense, transitions and other features.</p>



<p>With few psychologists at the time studying autobiography as a window into the mind, Habermas turned to theorists from other fields for guidance. “After I read psychology, I read narratology, literary theory, linguistics, social linguistics,” he says. “I had to steal … all these concepts from the other areas.”</p>



<p>One of Habermas’ questions was how people retain their sense of self in the face of life’s many disturbances, such as divorce, illness, job loss or moving to a new location.</p>



<p>Philosophers have been puzzling over this question for millennia. “Your body has changed. Your experiences have changed. Your knowledge has changed. And yet, people generally think of themselves as being the same person … in the past and future,” says psychologist Yosef Sokol of Touro University in New York City. “That’s a hard problem.”</p>



<p>This general belief in self-continuity appears universal, even though how it is constructed may differ across cultures.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>An autobiographical outlook</h3>



<p>Autobiographical reasoning is a type of thinking that links the self across space and time. Below are three categories of this reasoning and example arguments for each.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: &#8220;After that I told myself, when I fall in love the next time, I must take care that school doesn&#8217;t suffer.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Developmental status</strong>: &#8220;At the time I wasn&#8217;t aware of any that, after all, I was still too young for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Formative experience</strong>: &#8220;My burnout has led me to no longer attach so much importance to money today.&#8221;</p>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: T. HABERMAS AND C. KÖBER/<em>MEMORY</em> 2015</div>
</div>



<p>In the third wave of Habermas’ long-term study, when 150 participants were ages 16, 20, 28, 44 and 69, Habermas and Camia, who joined Habermas’ lab in 2009, also analyzed the transcripts for a type of thinking called autobiographical reasoning. This reasoning links the self across space and time.</p>



<p>“Autobiographical reasoning is this conscious reflection. How did my past impact me? How did I become the person I am today, and what does it mean for my future?” Camia says. Such reasoning tends to stem from change, she adds. “If there is perfect stability in life, you don’t do a lot of autobiographical reasoning … it’s the changes and the crises that compel meaning-making.”</p>



<p>The researchers divvied such reasoning into eight categories, such as turning points, lessons learned, generalized insights and using an event to explain a change in personality.</p>



<p>Participants also filled out two surveys. One survey summed up the number of big life changes experienced over the previous four years. The other gauged self-continuity, with participants rating the truth of statements such as, “When I look at pictures of myself four years back, it feels a little unfamiliar” and “I have the feeling that at the core I am the same person I was four years ago.”</p>



<p>Researchers then compared the three variables: autobiographical reasoning, levels of life change and sense of self-continuity. As expected, levels of autobiographical reasoning showed no discernible pattern among participants who experienced few changes in life, the team reported in 2015 in <em>Memory</em>.</p>



<p>But when the researchers zoomed in on the quarter of participants reporting the greatest level of change, more autobiographical reasoning <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24912017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came with higher levels of self-continuity</a>. “Constructing continuity in the life story buffers against the effect of change in your life,” Habermas says. Other teams have made similar findings.</p>

<h3>Finding life’s plot</h3>



<p>As part of a long-term study, participants shared their life stories in roughly 20-minute increments. Researchers analyzed those stories for autobiographical arguments — statements about how the past influences a person today. Among those who experienced the most life changes (quartile 4 in the chart), more autobiographical reasoning correlated with a greater sense of self-continuity.</p>

<p>Most disruptions, however, do not rise to the level of trauma — such as that experienced by Tran. Several years later, Camia would study how traumatic events, notably being forced to flee one’s home and the resulting isolation and bereavement, affect people’s sense of self.</p>



<h4>Trauma messes with our sense of time</h4>



<p>“What does war change first? <a href="https://lithub.com/poetry-after-bucha-serhiy-zhadan-on-ukraine-russia-and-the-demands-war-makes-of-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One’s sense of time</a>, one’s sense of space,” said Ukrainian writer Serhiy Zhadan in an October speech translated to English in the online magazine LitHub.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks from experience. But the idea that trauma disrupts time perception is also borne out by research. Researchers have found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> frequently dictate whether we experience time as passing fast or slow. And traumatic events, which come with intense emotions, can cause people to experience time in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00196/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow motion</a>, researchers reported in 2012 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>During a car accident, for instance, a person’s whole body is ready to act, says Marc Wittmann, a psychologist with the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany. “Your inner workings, your processing, is speeded up. Relative to that, your outside slows down.”</p>



<p>What’s more, says health psychologist Alison Holman of the University of California, Irvine, in that moment or moments of crisis, you do not think about the past or future. All that matters is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-living-distorts-time-sense">survival</a>.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks directly to this idea in his speech: “People in a war-torn space try not to plan for the future or think too much about what the world will be like tomorrow. What’s happening to you here and now is all that matters, just the people and things that will be with you tomorrow morning — tops. That’s if you survive and wake up.”</p>



<p>That narrow focus can wreak havoc on mental health. “[When] that present moment is so intense that it sears into your mind … it may set up the likelihood that you will have a hard time moving past it,” Holman says. “The past never passes.”</p>



<p>Such breakdowns in time can show up in language, particularly among those most severely affected by trauma. For instance, Habermas and his team compared the speech patterns of 14&nbsp;women diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a singular shocking event, such as physical or sexual abuse, and 14 women without such a diagnosis. The women with PTSD used more <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-45140-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immersive language</a>. They quoted people directly and spoke of the past as if it was ongoing, says Habermas, who reported the findings in 2014. “Instead of saying, ‘He hit me,’ they would say, ‘He hits me.’ ”</p>



<p>This immersive language dominates Tran’s narration. She is “carrying” her little sister. Her mother is “coming” back to the violent man. She is “walking many kilometers to school in the rain and then opening up my newspaper-wrapped wet and warm tomato sandwiches. They’re so wet, but I’m so hungry that I know I have to eat them otherwise I’ll never make the walk back.”</p>



<p>And always there, her mother’s voice: “Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think I will ever forget those words,” Tran says.</p>



<h4>Traumatized people can lose their life story</h4>



<p>Tran remembers her mother’s words exactly, but other details of the abuse she experienced as a child are fuzzier. That’s common among people who experience trauma. People with trauma “have both an excess and depletion of memory,” says cognitive neuroscientist Elisa Ciaramelli of the University of Bologna in Italy.</p>



<p>How <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624707/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory changes among trauma survivors</a> remains controversial, write the authors of a 2021 opinion piece in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. But mounting evidence suggests that people tend to remember stressful memories in detail. As the mind fixates on those traumatic memories, memories unrelated to the trauma seem to fade, while new memories fail to register.</p>



<p>For example, when asked to describe memories associated with a specific word, such as “beach,” people who do not have PTSD offer detailed reports, describing what they were wearing, what they said and who they were with, Ciaramelli says. People who have PTSD, on the other hand, typically provide general memories with little color.</p>



<p>Other memories can’t find a foothold. In one study, researchers asked 52 participants — 26 people with PTSD and 26 people who had experienced trauma but not developed PTSD — to keep a diary recording their memories over the course of a week. Participants also responded to questions about the memory, such as whether or not it related to their trauma, how central it was to their current life and how far away in time the memory felt.</p>



<p>Participants without PTSD recorded an average of 21.4 memories across the week while participants with PTSD recorded an average of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5528199/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 11 memories</a>, the team reported in 2017 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>. The PTSD participants had more trauma-related memories than the non-PTSD group.</p>



<p>Tran recognizes this paucity of detail in her own life story. “My memories are lightbulb memories,” she says. “They are always attached to significant events like trauma or happy times. I may have 57&nbsp;years of life, but you could truncate them into a chapter.”</p>



<p>Everyone’s memory has imprecision of course. That imprecision allows us to cut extraneous details and make sense of our story. The traumatized person’s relative lack of memories, though, both in clarity and quantity, means they struggle to construct a cohesive narrative of their past and to envision themselves moving forward.</p>



<p>“Ten years ago, people have found that the same brain regions that are activated and are necessary for remembering the past are also necessary to imagine the future,” Ciaramelli says. “We need memories to imagine the future.”</p>



<p>Camia’s work with refugees shows what can happen to the sense of self as people struggle and fail to reconcile a traumatic experience with the larger story of their life. Her central aim, which built on work with Habermas, was to see if the same autobiographical arguments people used to buffer against life’s everyday changes could help those facing traumatic disruptions. She and Rida Zafar, a psychology student at New York University Abu Dhabi, recruited 31 refugees living in Germany and asked them to narrate their life stories, plus fill out the life change and self-continuity surveys used in the 2015 study.</p>



<p>Among the 16 refugees who experienced relatively less change since arriving in Germany, such as fewer upheavals in relationships and fewer moves, more autobiographical reasoning did correlate with higher self-continuity, the team reported in 2021 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. Refugees who experienced high change also used autobiographical reasoning, but their sense of self-continuity remained low.</p>



<p>These individuals cannot settle their trauma, Camia explains, so their reckoning with the past leads not to resolution but <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.618343/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumination</a>. They are stuck.</p>



<h4>Therapy could restore the future self</h4>



<p>For most of her adult life, Tran grappled with that sense of stagnation. “My identity was rooted in the past, and I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “Time was this eternal loop. Every time a problem came up, it felt like a replication of a past problem. I couldn’t see that I could change anything.”</p>



<p>Over and over again, unable to envision a viable escape, Tran tried to kill herself.</p>



<p>Suicide attempts serve as the clearest signal that a person’s future has gone blank, says Sokol, the psychologist at Touro University. The thinking here is intuitive. “If you think you have a meaningful life into the future, you’re not going to kill yourself,” he says.</p>



<p>Conventional therapies for treating people struggling with suicidal thinking often fail to meet their needs because the therapies do not directly address <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397785/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people’s future self</a>, Sokol and his team wrote in 2021 in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy</em>. For instance, dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes focusing on the present to cope with stress and manage emotions. Narrative therapy likewise aims to help patients incorporate traumatic and other events into a continuous timeline, but focuses on linking past to present, not present to future.</p>



<p>So Sokol developed a therapy that incorporates elements of past- and present-oriented treatments but prioritizes future thinking. It’s known as continuous identity cognitive therapy. His goal is to help military veterans struggling with mental illness re-create the plot in the mental timeline of their lives, to answer those foundational questions: Who am I? Where do I go from here?</p>



<p>Sokol tested an initial version of the therapy in a four-week pilot study with 17 veterans. The program contains many work-arounds for participants struggling to access or make sense of their memories. The specific memory is less important than the larger story, or the broader values contained within that memory, Sokol says. “I have all sorts of techniques to help people tap into something that they find important, meaningful.”</p>



<p>In the first week, participants are asked to define their core values. The hope is that those values, rather than specific past events, will form the core of a person’s life story. To get to that core, participants review negative and positive experiences from their past and identify choices they made.</p>



<p>Many veterans struggle with what are called moral injuries — choices they made that don’t seem to align with who they wish to be, Sokol says. So veterans push those memories away. With the values approach, he hopes participants can start to see that they made the best choices they could under challenging circumstances. One way to access those values is to have participants identify people they admire, and the values those people embody. Participants can then use those people’s experiences to identify their own core values.</p>



<p>The focus of the second week shifts to the future. Participants assemble possible futures by reflecting on how life might play out if they work with, or against, their stated values. Participants also actively construct self-continuity. For instance, they write letters to themselves across different time points, such as from their present self to their future self or vice versa.</p>



<p>In week three, participants learn to differentiate between external life stories, the series of events outside their control, and internal life stories made up of choices in line with their stated values. By week four, participants should be able to visualize their future self overcoming an issue that their present self faces.</p>

<h3>Thinking of the future</h3>



<p>In a small pilot study with veterans, a new treatment for mental illness that focuses on future thinking, called continuous identity cognitive therapy, appeared to decrease levels of suicidal ideation and depression.</p>

<p>Tran came across Sokol’s research while embarking on her own journey to healing. That process began when Tran realized how her trauma was hurting the people she loved most. “I’m just causing my children and everybody near and dear trauma. I’m going to take [suicide] off the table,” she eventually realized. “This is not my pathway anymore. If it’s not my pathway, what am I going to do with the next 50 years of my life?”</p>



<p>Tran felt lost. So she dug into research on trauma survivors, eventually stumbling upon Sokol’s project. She was moved by the idea that participants did not have to reconstruct the past to build a new future. “This is true. My soul knows this to be true,” she remembers thinking.</p>



<p>Tran, who is also a trainer with DISCHARGED, a nonprofit organization that provides peer group support for people experiencing suicidal thoughts, and an occasional adviser to researchers writing about suicide, reached out to Sokol and offered to help him make the language used in his program more sensitive to people who have experienced trauma. For instance, she suggested changing references to “you” to “we” to give people a greater sense of belonging and agency. The two still work together.</p>



<p>Research on the therapy remains limited to Sokol’s lab, but initial results are promising. The pilot study showed that the program decreased previously reported levels of suicidal ideation and depression. Those levels stayed low one month after completion. Now Sokol has received a five-year, $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to scale up the program and eventually roll out a randomized controlled trial. In its newer iteration, the program will run for three months instead of one.</p>



<p>With input from Tran and veterans in the program, Sokol made another substantial modification to the pilot program. Participants will now identify how their own story intersects with the stories of other people in their lives. That addition makes sense to Tran, who has become engrossed in research showing the intergenerational nature of trauma. She now sees her life as part of a larger story with many characters, each on their own often troubled journey.</p>



<p>She says her story will always be truncated. But even without a clean narrative arc, she has managed to sever time’s eternal loop. “You can change your relationship with your past experiences in a way that makes living a future possible,” Tran says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-biomaterial-heals-heart-attack-damage">A new biomaterial heals heart attack damage in animals. Humans could be next</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new biomaterial delivered to the heart soon after a heart attack can heal damaged tissue from the inside out.</p>



<p>Heart attacks kill cardiac muscle tissue, scarring the heart and leaving permanent damage after just six hours. The damage prevents the heart from functioning properly. If there was a way to begin healing damaged tissue soon after a heart attack, doctors could prevent scar tissue from developing.</p>



<p>“In an ideal world, you treat a patient immediately when they’re having a heart attack to try to salvage some of the tissue and promote regeneration,” says Karen Christman, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego.</p>





<p>The pursuit of this ideal inspired Christman, along with a team of researchers, to develop the biomaterial. In rodents and pigs, it<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00964-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> appears to repair tissue damage and reduce inflammation directly after a heart attack</a>, Christman and colleagues report December 29 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p><a></a>“I think it has a lot of potential,” Vimala Bharadwaj, a biomedical scientist at Stanford University who was not involved in the research. The paper&nbsp; “is definitely good proof of concept for what they’re trying to do.”</p>



<p>Previously, researchers found that<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-fat-mend-bone-cartilage-muscle-and-even-heart"> stem cells derived from body fat can be used to heal bones, muscles and the heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/9/16</em>). Christman wanted to work with the extracellular matrix, the lattice of proteins that provide structural support to the cells in cardiac muscle tissue. Like stems cells, it has regenerative abilities but is much less expensive, she says.</p>



<p>In 2009, Christman’s team produced a hydrogel using particles from this matrix. Trials in rats and later in humans showed that the material bonded to damaged areas and promoted cell repair and growth. However, due to relatively large particles of the hydrogel, it could be delivered to the heart only via a needle.</p>



<p>“Poking the heart with a needle could set off an arrhythmia,” says Christman. To use this treatment, doctors would need to wait a few weeks until the heart is more stable and the chance of these irregular heartbeats decreases. And that would be too late to prevent scarring.</p>



<p>The team took the previously created hydrogel, sifted out the larger particles with a centrifuge so only nanoparticles remained, and added water to dilute the mixture. That created a material thin enough to deliver to heart blood vessels intravenously.</p>





<p>Based on the nanoparticles&#8217; size, the team expected the mixture would slip through any gaps in cardiac blood vessels caused by the heart attack and adhere to the surrounding tissue. Once there, it would create a protective barrier while the heart healed. </p>



<p>Instead, animal experiments showed that the extracellular matrix material bound to the leaky vessels, preventing some inflammatory cells from moving into the heart tissue in the first place and causing further damage. The material reduced inflammation in the heart and stimulated the healing process by encouraging cell growth, the team reports.</p>



<p>Further safety studies will be needed to get the biomaterial ready for clinical trials. The first trial in humans will most likely be for repairing cardiac tissue post–heart attack. “A lot of my motivation is moving things out of the lab, actually into the real world,” Christman says.</p>



<p>Another real-world application of the biomaterial could be treatment for leaky blood vessels in other hard-to-access organs, including in the brain after a traumatic injury, Christman notes.</p>



<p>While Bharadwaj finds that application potentially promising, she says tests are needed to see whether the biomaterial improves headaches and cognitive or memory deficits in the brain after a traumatic injury. That’s needed to gauge whether it really is an effective TBI treatment.</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission? We recently launched the </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em></p>



<p>Certain legitimate journal types are particularly susceptible to hijacking, including niche or trade journals published in English or local languages, print-only journals, and journals indexed in international databases like Web of Science or Scopus. Hijackers typically avoid journals from big,<s> </s>reputable publishers such as Springer, Wiley, and Elsevier. </p>



<p>As a result, multiple networks of hijacked journals created by different cybercriminals target the same legitimate journals, potentially causing the same legitimate journals to have multiple clone websites.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a> contains a few examples of journals that have been hijacked twice, such as&nbsp; the journal <em>Gorteria</em> (ISSN 0017-2294)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But hijackers have created at least five clone websites for <a href="http://thejossgroup.com/newsletters/">the <em>Seybold Report</em></a>, a trade publication focused on graphic arts technology. The <a href="https://seyboldjournal.com/">first clone</a> website was created in 2020 by an Indian network and continued to deceive scholars until 2021. The content of the hijacked journal ended up in Scopus, similar to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/12/meet-the-hijacked-journal-that-keeps-rising-from-the-ashes/">other</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/26/how-hijacked-journals-keep-fooling-one-of-the-worlds-leading-databases/">cases</a> of hijacked journals. That clone website has since been deactivated and Scopus has deleted the unauthorized content.</p>



<span id="more-126596"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3joqO2oAGS7k3YL_jj7NCuIP5XB-DsJ6Odi1mvFIiPBmkCvXj8XNs5fTvV_2AhDi62GYID0zQ7D0IisxyqYitcuSaig4N42ZT6f2LtisbWrLssjwTiyjqdrkZWxUNGL0ALWV4t6tT-KPeAKEnsJdrM0" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Unauthorized content from a hijacked journal Seybold in Scopus</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2022, at least four other websites cloning the <em>Seybold Report</em> were registered. It appears that at least two of these websites were created by the same fraudulent publishers, as their contact addresses are identical.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Date of registration</td><td>Editorial board</td><td>Contact email</td><td>Journal warning</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreport.net</td><td>03 March 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.org, seybold-report.com</td><td>info@seyboldreport.net</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.org to be fake</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreports.org</td><td>28 Apr 2022</td><td>Not available</td><td>editor@seyboldreport.org</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreport.org</td><td>5 May 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.net, seybold-report.com</td><td>editor@seyboldreport.org</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.net to be fake</td></tr><tr><td>seybold-report.com&nbsp;</td><td>23 Dec 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.org, seyboldreport.net</td><td>editor@seybold-report.com</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.org and seyboldreport.net to be fake</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Various clone websites of Seybold Report</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Three clone websites share identical editorial boards that include the names of prominent scholars without their permission. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/d/jonathan-dingel">Jonathan Dingel</a>, an associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is <a href="https://seyboldreport.net/Editorial%20Board.html">listed as</a> editor-in-chief of a hijacked <em>Seybold Report,</em> but confirmed that he has nothing to do with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, three of the newly created clones are accusing each other of being fake and claiming to be the original journal. It is unclear whether these three clones were created by two or three different networks of hijackers, or if this is just a marketing ploy of a single fraudulent publisher.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7VW8-1dP4Sjm6exEtPCZWdrhhdmR3K_7dQWCx6C1d6BIK1L2TE0l4E68QygtduSZCcX2iG3iylMTHSiuYsqP6gxfwiSPJpiWB_AA9H2QwStLKBLM95QjWTpaOeogxpTsAEYvEZRi391Fu_MPFk-IrZo" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The clone website seyboldreport.net alerts users that the website seyboldreport.org is fake</figcaption></figure>



<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">one of us tweeted</a> about the fraudsters accusing each other of being frauds, we found <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">&nbsp;</a>even more cloned versions.&nbsp;For those who know the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/MAHC.2019.2926975">history of the journal</a>, how the original journal looks (such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recent-issue-seybold-report-molly-joss">this example</a> from 2015), and&nbsp;its purpose as a trade publication instead of a scientific journal, then the fraud is pretty obvious. But the hijackers accusing each other of fraud is next-level deception.</p>

<p><strong>The chances of contacting</strong> <strong>extraterrestrial civilizations seem poor</strong> – <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chances-contacting-extraterrestrial-civilizations-seem-poor">Science News</a></em>, February 24, 1973</p>



<p>The possibility of life … on other planets has stimulated many people’s i­maginations…. In the Feb. 9 <em>Nature</em>, James&nbsp;C.&nbsp;G. Walker of Yale University studies the possible parameters of such a search and comes to some pessimistic conclusions.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Walker estimated it could take 1,400 to 14 million years to contact E.T. with the available technology. That’s way longer than researchers have spent listening for alien radio signals and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">scouring the sky with telescopes and satellites</a> (<em>SN: 11/21/20, p. 18</em>).</p>





<p>Despite the silence, scientists have sent their own messages into the void. In 1974, Earth sent a string of binary code from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Years later, arguably the most famous message — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/world-record">the Golden Record</a> — made its way to space aboard NASA spacecraft (<em>SN: 8/20/77, p. 124</em>).</p>



<p>If aliens ever reach out, they may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">send quantum dispatches</a>, scientists say (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p.&nbsp;5</em>). Even so, the aliens are likely so far from Earth that their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drake-equation-alien-extraterrestrial-civilizations">civilization will have collapsed</a> by the time we get the message (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 9</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gel-body-sugar-grow-electrodes-fish">A gel cocktail uses the body’s sugars to ‘grow’ electrodes in living fish</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, researchers have harnessed the body’s own chemistry to “grow” electrodes inside the tissues of living fish, blurring the boundary between biology and machines.</p>



<p>The technique uses the body’s sugars to turn an injected gel into a flexible electrode without damaging tissues, experiments show. Zebrafish with these <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electrodes grown in their brains, hearts and tail fins</a> showed no signs of ill effects, and ones tested in leeches successfully stimulated a nerve, researchers report in the Feb. 24 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Someday, these electrodes could be useful for applications ranging from studying how biological systems work to improving human-machine interfaces. They also could be used in “bioelectronic medicine,” such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">brain stimulation therapies for depression</a>, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>Soft electronics aim to bridge the gap between soft, curvy biology and electronic hardware. But these electronics typically still must carry certain parts that can be prone to cracks and other issues, and inserting these devices inevitably causes damage to tissues.</p>



<p>“All the devices we have made, even though we have made them flexible, to make them more soft, when we introduce them, there will still be a scar. It’s like sticking a knife into the organ,” says Magnus Berggren, a materials scientist at Linköping University in Sweden. That scarring and inflammation can degrade electrode performance over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous efforts to grow soft electronics inside tissues have drawbacks. One approach uses electrical or chemical signals to power the transformation from chemical soup to conducting electrodes, but these zaps also cause damage. A 2020 study got around this problem by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay4866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically modifying cells in worms to produce an engineered enzyme</a> that does the job, but the new method achieves its results without genetic alterations.</p>



<p>Berggren and colleagues’ electrodes instead exploit a natural energy source already present in the body: sugars. The gel cocktail contains molecules called oxidases that react with the sugars — glucose or lactate — to produce hydrogen peroxide. That then activates another ingredient in the cocktail, an enzyme called hydrogen peroxidase, which is the catalyst needed to transform the gel into a conducting electrode.</p>



<p>“The approach leverages elegant chemistry to overcome many of the technical challenges,” says biomedical engineer Christopher Bettinger of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To test the technique, the researchers injected the cocktail into the brains, hearts and tail fins of transparent zebrafish. The gel turns blue when it becomes conductive, giving a visual readout of its success.</p>





<p>“The beautiful thing is you can see it: The zebrafishes’ tail changes color, and we know that blue indicates a conducting polymer,” says materials scientist Xenofon Strakosas, also of Linköping University. “The first time I saw it, I thought ‘Wow, it’s really working!’”</p>



<p>The fish appeared to suffer no ill effects, and the researchers saw no evidence of tissue damage. In partially dissected leeches, the team showed that delivering a current to a nerve via a soft electrode could induce muscle contractions. Ultimately, devices like this could be paired with various wireless technologies in development.</p>



<p>Long-term implant performance remains to be determined, however. “The demonstrations are impressive,” Bettinger says. “What remains to be seen is the stability of the electrode.” Over time, substances in the body could react with the electrode materials, degrading it or even producing toxic substances.</p>



<p>The team still needs to refine how precisely the electrodes can stimulate nerves, says chemical engineer Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, who was not involved in the work. She and colleagues developed the way to “grow” electrical components using genetic modifications. Ensuring stimulation is concentrated where it’s needed for a treatment, while preventing the leakage of current to unwanted regions will be important, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, the relative abundance of different sugars in different tissues determines exactly where electrodes form. But in the future, a component of the main ingredient could be swapped out for elements that attach to specific bits of biology to make targeting much more precise, Berggren says. “We’re conducting experiments right now where we’re trying to bind these materials directly on individual cells.” Notes Strakosas: “There are some applications where precision is really important; that’s where we have to invest effort.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-star-formation-astronomy">The Milky Way may be spawning many more stars than astronomers had thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way is churning out far more stars than previously thought, according to a new estimate of its star formation rate.</p>



<p>Gamma rays from aluminum-26, a radioactive isotope that arises primarily from massive stars, reveal that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Milky Way converts four to eight solar masses of interstellar gas and dust into new stars each year</a>, researchers report in work submitted to arXiv.org on January 24. That range is two to four times the conventional estimate and corresponds to an annual birthrate in our galaxy of about 10 to 20 stars, because most stars are less massive than the sun.</p>





<p>At this rate, every million years — a blink of the eye in astronomical terms — our galaxy spawns 10 million to 20 million new stars. That’s enough to fill roughly 10,000 star clusters like the beautiful Pleiades cluster in the constellation Taurus. In contrast, many galaxies, including most of the ones that orbit the Milky Way, make no new stars at all.</p>



<p>“The star formation rate is very important to understand for galaxy evolution,” says Thomas Siegert, an astrophysicist at the University of Würzburg in Germany. The more stars a galaxy makes, the faster it enriches itself with oxygen, iron and the other elements that stars create. Those elements then alter star-making gas clouds and can change the relative number of large and small stars that the gas clouds form.</p>



<p>Siegert and his colleagues studied the observed intensity and spatial distribution of emission from aluminum-26 in our galaxy. A massive star creates this isotope during both life and death. During its life, the star blows the aluminum into space via a strong wind. If the star explodes when it dies, the resulting supernova forges more. The isotope, with a half-life of 700,000 years, decays and gives off gamma rays.</p>



<p>Like X-rays, and unlike visible light, gamma rays penetrate the dust that cloaks the youngest stars. “We’re looking through the entire galaxy,” Siegert says. “We’re not X-raying it; here we’re gamma-raying it.”</p>



<p>The more stars our galaxy spawns, the more gamma rays emerge. The best match with the observations, the researchers find, is a star formation rate of four to eight solar masses a year. That is much higher than <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/197/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the standard estimate for the Milky Way of about two solar masses a year</a>.</p>



<p>The revised rate is very realistic, says Pavel Kroupa, an astronomer at the University of Bonn in Germany who was not involved in the work. “I’m very impressed by the detailed modeling of how they account for the star formation process,” he says. “It’s a very beautiful work. I can see some ways of improving it, but this is really a major step in the absolutely correct direction.”</p>



<p>Siegert cautions that it is difficult to tell how far the gamma rays have traveled before reaching us. In particular, if some of the observed emission arises nearby — within just a few hundred light-years of us — then the galaxy has less aluminum-26 than the researchers have calculated, which means the star formation rate is on the lower side of the new estimate. Still, he says it’s unlikely to be as low as the standard two solar masses per year.</p>





<p>In any event, the Milky Way is the most vigorous star creator in a collection of more than 100 nearby galaxies called the Local Group. The largest Local Group galaxy, Andromeda, converts only a fraction of a solar mass of gas and dust into new stars a year. Among Local Group galaxies, the Milky Way ranks second in size, but its high star formation rate means that we definitely try a lot harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/standard-model-particle-physics">The standard model of particle physics passed one of its strictest tests yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>No one has ever probed a particle more stringently than this.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, scientists measured a magnetic property of the electron more carefully than ever before, making the most precise measurement of any property of an elementary particle, ever. Known as the electron magnetic moment, it’s a measure of the strength of the magnetic field carried by the particle.</p>



<p>That property is predicted by the standard model of particle physics, the theory that describes particles and forces on a subatomic level. In fact, it’s the most precise prediction made by that theory.</p>





<p>By comparing the new ultraprecise measurement and the prediction, scientists gave the theory one of its strictest tests yet. The new measurement <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.071801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agrees with the standard model’s prediction</a> to about 1 part in a trillion, or 0.1 billionths of a percent, physicists report in the February 17 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>When a theory makes a prediction at high precision, it’s like a physicist’s Bat Signal, calling out for researchers to test it. “It’s irresistible to some of us,” says physicist Gerald Gabrielse of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>To measure the magnetic moment, Gabrielse and colleagues studied a single electron for months on end, trapping it in a magnetic field and observing how it responded when tweaked with microwaves. The team determined the electron magnetic moment to 0.13 parts per trillion, or 0.000000000013 percent.</p>



<p>A measurement that exacting is a complicated task. “It’s so challenging that nobody except the Gabrielse team dares to do it,” says physicist Holger Müller of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>The new result is more than twice as precise as the previous measurement, which stood for over 14 years, and which was also made by Gabrielse’s team. Now the researchers have finally outdone themselves. “When I saw the [paper] I said, ‘Wow, they did it,’” says Stefano Laporta, a theoretical physicist affiliated with University of Padua in Italy, who works on calculating the electron magnetic moment according to the standard model.</p>



<p>The new test of the standard model would be even more impressive if it weren’t for a conundrum in another painstaking measurement. Two recent experiments, one led by physicist Saïda Guellati-Khélifa of Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris and the other by Müller, disagree on the value of a number called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/key-constants-new-measurement-casts-doubt-dark-photons">fine-structure constant</a>, which characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interactions (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). That number is an input to the standard model’s prediction of the electron magnetic moment. So the disagreement limits the new test’s precision. If that discrepancy were sorted out, the test would become 10 times as precise as it is now. <a></a></p>





<p>The stalwart standard model has stood up to a barrage of experimental tests for decades. But scientists don’t think it’s the be-all and end-all. That’s in part because it doesn’t explain observations such as the existence of dark matter, an invisible substance that exerts gravitational influence on the cosmos. And it doesn’t say why the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">universe contains more matter than antimatter</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). So physicists keep looking for cases where the standard model breaks down.</p>



<p>One of the most tantalizing hints of a failure of the standard model is the magnetic moment not of the electron, but of the muon, a heavy relative of the electron. In 2021, a measurement of this property hinted at a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">possible mismatch with standard model predictions</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Some people believe that this discrepancy could be the signature of new physics beyond the standard model,” says Guellati-Khélifa, who wrote a commentary on the new electron magnetic moment paper in <em>Physics </em>magazine. If so, any new physics affecting the muon could also affect the electron. So future measurements of the electron magnetic moment might also deviate from the prediction, finally revealing the standard model’s flaws.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-archery-europe-neandertal">Homo sapiens may have brought archery to Europe about 54,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Homo sapiens</em> who reached Europe around 54,000 years ago introduced bows and arrows to that continent, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Researchers examined tiny triangular stone points and other artifacts excavated at a rock-shelter in southern France called Grotte Mandrin. <em>H. sapiens</em> on the move probably <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought archery techniques from Africa to Europe</a>, archaeologist Laure Metz of Aix-Marseille University in France and colleagues report February 22 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Metz and colleagues demonstrate bow hunting [at Grotte Mandrin] as convincingly as possible without being caught bow-in-hand,” says archaeologist Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>No bows were found at the site. Wooden items such as bows preserve poorly. The oldest intact bows, found in northern European bogs, date to around 11,000 years ago, Metz says.</p>



<p>Previous stone and bone point discoveries suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bow-and-arrow hunting originated in Africa</a> between about 80,000 and 60,000 years ago. And previously recovered fossil teeth indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter"><em>H. sapiens</em> visited Grotte Mandrin as early as 56,800 years ago</a>, well before Neandertals’ demise around 40,000 years ago and much earlier than researchers had thought that &nbsp;<em>H. sapiens</em> first reached Europe (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve shown that the earliest known <em>Homo sapiens</em> to migrate into Neandertal territories had mastered the use of the bow,” Metz says.</p>



<p>No evidence suggests that Neandertals already present in Europe at that time launched arrows at prey. It’s also unclear whether archery provided any substantial hunting advantages to <em>H. sapiens</em> relative to spears that were thrust or thrown by Neandertals.</p>

<p>Among 852 stone artifacts excavated in a <em>H. sapiens</em> sediment layer at Grotte Mandrin dated to about 54,000 years ago, 196 triangular stone points displayed high-impact damage. Another 15 stone points showed signs of both high-impact damage and alterations caused by butchery activities, such as cutting.</p>



<p>Comparisons of those finds were made to damage on stone replicas of the artifacts that the researchers used as arrowheads shot from bows and as the tips of spears inserted in handheld throwing devices. Additional comparative evidence came from stone and bone arrowheads used by recent and present-day hunting groups.</p>





<p>Impact damage along the edges of stone points from the French site indicated that these implements had been attached at the bottom to shafts.</p>



<p>The smallest Grotte Mandrin points, many with a maximum width of no more than 10 millimeters, could have pierced animals’ hides only when shot from bows as the business ends of arrows, the researchers say. Experiments they conducted with replicas of the ancient stone points found that stone points less than 10 millimeters wide reach effective hunting speeds only when attached to arrow shafts propelled by a bow.</p>



<p>Larger stone points, some of them several times the size of the smaller points, could have been arrowheads or might have tipped spears that were thrown or thrust by hand or launched from handheld spear throwers, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>Lombard, the University of Johannesburg archaeologist, suspects that the first <em>H. sapiens</em> at the French rock-shelter hunted with bows and arrows as well as with spears, depending on where and what they were hunting. Earlier studies directed by Lombard indicated that sub-Saharan Africans similarly alternated between these two types of hunting weapons starting between about 70,000 and 58,000 years ago.</p>



<p><em>H. sapiens</em> newcomers to Europe may have learned from Neandertals that spear hunting in large groups takes precedence on frigid landscapes, where bow strings can easily snap and long-distance pursuit of prey is not energy efficient, Lombard says.</p>



<p>But learning about archery from <em>H. sapiens</em> may not have been in the cards for Neandertals. Based on prior analyses of brain impressions on the inside surfaces of fossil skulls, Lombard suspects that Neandertals’ brains did not enable the enhanced visual and spatial abilities that <em>H. sapiens</em> exploited to hunt with bows and arrows.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility, though other controversial evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">Neandertals behaved no differently from Stone Age <em>H. sapiens</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>).If Grotte Mandrin Neandertals never hunted with bows and arrows but still survived just fine alongside <em>H. sapiens</em> archers for roughly 14,000 years, reasons for Neandertals’ ultimate demise remain as mysterious as ever.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">The James Webb telescope found six galaxies that may be too hefty for their age</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope’s first peek at the distant universe unveiled galaxies that appear too big to exist.</p>



<p>Six galaxies that formed in the universe’s first 700 million years seem to be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05786-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 times more massive</a> than standard cosmological theories predict, astronomer Ivo Labbé and colleagues report February 22 in <em>Nature</em>. “Adding up the stars in those galaxies, it would exceed the total amount of mass available in the universe at that time,” says Labbé, of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. “So you know that something is afoot.”</p>





<p>The telescope, also called JWST, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">released its first view of the early cosmos</a> in July 2022 (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). Within days, Labbé and his colleagues had spotted about a dozen objects that looked particularly bright and red, a sign that they could be massive and far away.</p>



<p>“They stand out immediately, you see them as soon as you look at these images,” says astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Measuring the amount of light each object emits in various wavelengths can give astronomers an idea of how far away each galaxy is, and how many stars it must have to emit all that light. Six of the objects that Nelson, Labbé and colleagues identified look like their light comes from no later than about 700 million years after the Big Bang. Those galaxies appear to hold up to 10 billion times the mass of our sun in stars. One of them might contain the mass of 100 billion suns.</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t have had time to make things that have as many stars as the Milky Way that fast,” Nelson says. Our galaxy contains about 60 billion suns’ worth of stars — and it’s had more than 13 billion years to grow them. “It’s just crazy that these things seem to exist.”</p>



<p>In the standard theories of cosmology, matter in the universe clumped together slowly, with small structures gradually merging to form larger ones. “If there are all these massive galaxies at early times, that’s just not happening,” Nelson says.</p>



<p>One possible explanation is that there’s another, unknown way to form galaxies, Labbé says. “It seems like there’s a channel that’s a fast track, and the fast track creates monsters.”</p>



<p>But it could also be that some of these galaxies host supermassive black holes in their cores, says astronomer Emma Curtis-Lake of the University of Hertfordshire in England, who was not part of the new study. What looks like starlight could instead be light from the gas and dust those black holes are devouring. JWST has already seen a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate for an active supermassive black hole</a> even earlier in the universe’s history than these galaxies are, she says, so it’s not impossible.</p>





<p>Finding a lot of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">supermassive black holes at such an early era</a> would also be challenging to explain (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). But it wouldn’t require rewriting the standard model of cosmology the way extra-massive galaxies would.</p>



<p>“The formation and growth of black holes at these early times is really not well understood,” she says. “There’s not a tension with cosmology there, just new physics to be understood of how they can form and grow, and we just never had the data before.”</p>



<p>To know for sure what these distant objects are, Curtis-Lake says, astronomers need to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">confirm the galaxies’ distances and masses using spectra</a>, more precise measurements of the galaxies’ light across many wavelengths (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>).</p>



<p>JWST has taken spectra for a few of these galaxies already, and more should be coming, Labbé says. “With luck, a year from now, we’ll know a lot more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-sycamore-milestone">Google’s quantum computer reached an error-correcting milestone</a></h4>

              
                <p>To shrink error rates in quantum computers, sometimes more is better. More qubits, that is.</p>



<p>The quantum bits, or qubits, that make up a quantum computer are prone to mistakes that could render a calculation useless if not corrected. To reduce that error rate, scientists aim to build a computer that can correct its own errors. Such a machine would combine the powers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">multiple fallible qubits</a> into one improved qubit, called a “logical qubit,” that can be used to make calculations (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>). &nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists now have demonstrated a key milestone in quantum error correction. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05434-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scaling up the number of qubits in a logical qubit can make it less error-prone</a>, researchers at Google report February 22 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Future quantum computers could solve problems <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">impossible for even the most powerful traditional computers</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>). To build those mighty quantum machines, researchers agree that they’ll need to use error correction to dramatically shrink error rates. While scientists have previously demonstrated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computer-error-correction-multiple-qubits-detect-mistakes">they can detect</a> and correct simple errors in small-scale quantum computers, error correction is still in its early stages (<em>SN: 10/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>The new advance doesn’t mean researchers are ready to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, “however, it does demonstrate that it is indeed possible, that error correction fundamentally works,” physicist Julian Kelly of Google Quantum AI said in a news briefing February 21.</p>

<p>Logical qubits store information redundantly in multiple physical qubits. That redundancy allows a quantum computer to check if any mistakes have cropped up and fix them on the fly. Ideally, the larger the logical qubit, the smaller the error rate should be. But if the original qubits are too faulty, adding in more of them will cause more problems than it solves.</p>



<p>Using Google’s Sycamore quantum chip, the researchers studied two different sizes of logical qubits, one consisting of 17 qubits and the other of 49 qubits. After making steady improvements to the performance of the original physical qubits that make up the device, the researchers tallied up the errors that still slipped through. The larger logical qubit had a lower error rate, about 2.9 percent per round of error correction, compared to the smaller logical qubit’s rate of about 3.0 percent, the researchers found.</p>





<p>That small improvement suggests scientists are finally tiptoeing into the regime where error correction can begin to squelch errors by scaling up. “It’s a major goal to achieve,” says physicist Andreas Wallraff&nbsp;of ETH Zurich, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>However, the result is only on the cusp of showing that error correction improves as scientists scale up. A computer simulation of the quantum computer’s performance suggests that, if the logical qubit’s size were increased even more, its error rate would actually get worse. Additional improvement to the original faulty qubits will be needed to enable scientists to really capitalize on the benefits of error correction.</p>



<p>Still, milestones in quantum computation are so difficult to achieve that they’re treated like pole jumping, Wallraff says. You just aim to barely clear the bar.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">Chemical signals from fungi tell bark beetles which trees to infest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fungi may help some tree-killer beetles turn a tree’s natural defense system against itself.</p>



<p>The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (<em>Ips typographus</em>) has massacred millions of conifers in forests across Europe. Now, research suggests that fungi associated with these bark beetles are key players in the insect’s hostile takeovers. These fungi warp the chemical defenses of host trees <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to create an aroma that attracts beetles to burrow</a>, researchers report February 21 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<p>This fungi-made perfume might explain why bark beetles tend to swarm the same tree. As climate change makes Europe’s forests more vulnerable to insect invasions, understanding this relationship could help scientists develop new countermeasures to ward off beetle attacks.</p>





<p>Bark beetles are a type of insect found around the world that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bugged-forests-bad-climate">feed and breed inside trees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/10</em>). In recent years, several bark beetle species have aggressively attacked forests from North America to Australia, leaving ominous strands of dead trees in their wake.</p>



<p>But trees aren’t defenseless. Conifers — which include pine and fir trees — are veritable chemical weapons factories. The evergreen smell of Christmas trees and alpine forests comes from airborne varieties of these chemicals. But while they may smell delightful, these chemicals’ main purpose is to trap and poison invaders.</p>



<p>Or at least, that’s what they&#8217;re meant to do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Conifers are full of resin and other stuff that should do horrible things to insects,” says Jonathan Gershenzon, a chemical ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. “But bark beetles don’t seem to mind at all.”</p>



<p>This ability of bark beetles to overcome the powerful defense system of conifers has led some scientists to wonder if fungi might be helping. Fungi <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-carbon-storage-soil-earth-warm-climate">break down compounds in their environment</a> for food and protection (<em>SN: 11/30/21</em>). And some type of fungi — including some species in the genus <em>Grosmannia</em> — are always found in association with Eurasian spruce bark beetles.</p>

<p>Gershenzon and his colleagues compared the chemicals released by spruce bark infested with <em>Grosmannia </em>and other fungi to the chemical profile of uninfected trees. The presence of the fungi fundamentally changed the chemical profile of spruce trees, the team found. More than half the airborne chemicals — made by fungi breaking down monoterpenes and other chemicals that are likely part of the tree defense system — were unique to infected trees after 12 days.</p>



<p>This is surprising because researchers had previously assumed that invading fungi hardly changed the chemical profile of trees, says Jonathan Cale, a fungal ecologist at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada, who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>Later experiments revealed that bark beetles can detect many of these fungi-made chemicals. The team tested this by attaching tiny electrodes on bark beetles’ heads and detecting electrical activity when the chemicals wafted passed their antennae. What’s more, the smell of these chemicals combined with beetle pheromones led the insects to burrow at higher rates than the smell of pheromones alone.</p>



<p>The study suggests that these fungi-made chemicals can help beetles tell where to feed and breed, possibly by advertising that the fungi has taken down some of the tree’s defenses. The attractive nature of the chemicals could also explain the beetle’s swarming behavior, which drives the death of healthy adult trees.</p>



<p>But while the fungi aroma might doom trees, it could also lead to the beetles’ demise. Beetle traps in Europe currently use only beetle pheromones to attract their victims. Combining pheromones with fungi-derived chemicals might be the secret to entice more beetles into traps, making them more effective.</p>



<p>The results present “an exciting direction for developing new tools to manage destructive bark beetle outbreaks” for other beetle species as well, Cale says. In North America, mild winters and drought have put conifer forests at greater risk from mountain pine beetle (<em>Dendroctonus pendersoae</em>) attacks. Finding and using fungi-derived chemicals might be one way to fend off the worst of the bark beetle invasions in years to come.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-work-burnout-depression-wellness">Lots of people feel burned out. But what is burnout exactly?</a></h4>

              
                <p>When New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who garnered international praise for how she handled the pandemic in her country, recently announced her <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jacindaardernresignationspeech.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intention to resign</a>, here’s how she summed up her surprise decision: “I know what the job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.”</p>



<p>Social scientists and journalists worldwide largely interpreted Ardern’s words in her January 19 speech as a reference to burnout.</p>





<p>“She’s talking about an empty tank,” says Christina Maslach, a psychological researcher who has been interviewing and observing workers struggling with workplace-related distress for decades. In almost 50 years of interviews, says Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, “that phrase [has come] up again and again and again.”</p>



<p>Numerous studies and media reports suggest that burnout, already high before the pandemic, has since skyrocketed worldwide, particularly among workers in certain professions, such as health care, teaching and service. The pandemic makes clear that the jobs needed for a healthy, functioning society are burning people out, Maslach says.</p>



<p>But disagreement over how to define and measure burnout is pervasive, with some researchers even questioning if the syndrome is simply depression by another name. Such controversy has made it difficult to estimate the prevalence of burnout or identify how to best help those who are suffering.</p>



<p>Here are some key questions researchers are asking to get a handle on the problem.</p>



<h4>When did today’s understanding of burnout emerge?</h4>



<p>Some researchers argue that burnout is a strictly modern-day phenomenon, brought on by overwork and hustle culture. But others contend that burnout is merely the latest iteration of a long line of exhaustion disorders, starting with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/acedia-the-lost-name-for-the-emotion-were-all-feeling-right-now-144058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancient Greek concept of <em>acedia</em></a>. This condition, wrote 5th century monk and theologian John Cassian, is marked by “bodily listlessness and yawning hunger.”</p>



<p>The more contemporary notion of burnout originated in the 1970s. Herbert Freudenberger, the consulting psychologist for volunteers working with drug addicts at St. Mark’s Free Clinic in New York City, used the term to describe the volunteers’ gradual loss of motivation, emotional depletion and reduced commitment to the cause.</p>





<p>Roughly simultaneously, Maslach was interviewing social service workers in California and began observing similar characteristics. That prompted Maslach and her then–graduate student, Susan Jackson, now at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., to develop the first tool to measure burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The duo defined burnout as comprising of three components: exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy, or persistent feelings of low personal accomplishment.</p>



<p>Respondents rated statements on a scale from 0 (“never”) to 6 (“daily”). Sample statements read: “I feel emotionally drained from my work” for exhaustion; “I doubt the significance of my work” for cynicism; and “I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job” for inefficacy. High scores for exhaustion and cynicism, and low scores for inefficacy, indicated that a person was struggling with burnout.</p>



<p>Maslach’s scale turned burnout into a legitimate area of inquiry, says Renzo Bianchi, an occupational health psychologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “Before [the Maslach Burnout Inventory], burnout was pop psychology.”</p>



<h4>What is the best way to define burnout?</h4>



<p>Maslach’s inventory remains the most widely used tool to study burnout. But many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-sciences-definitions-terms-research-measurment">criticize that definition</a> of the syndrome (<em>SN: 10/26/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Conceptualizing burnout as a combination of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Burnout-Companion-To-Study-And-Practice-A-Critical-Analysis/Schaufeli-Enzmann/p/book/9780748406982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy is “arbitrary,”</a> wrote organizational psychologists Wilmar Schaufeli and Dirk Enzmann in their 1998 book, <em>The Burnout Companion to Study and Practice: A Critical Analysis</em>. “What would have happened if other items had been included? Most likely, other dimensions would have appeared.”</p>



<p>Moreover, those three components and what&#8217;s causing them are themselves poorly defined, says work and organizational psychologist Evangelia Demerouti of Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. For instance, numerous nonwork factors can trigger exhaustion, such as health problems and caregiving responsibilities.</p>



<p>Disagreements over what constitutes burnout, and how to measure the phenomenon, has led to a chaotic body of literature. A key point of contention is how to use Maslach’s inventory. Maslach never designated a cutoff point at which a worker tips from not burnt out to burnt out. Rather the inventory was designed as a tool to help researchers identify patterns of burnout within a given work environment or profession.</p>



<p>But in practice, Maslach has little control over how researchers use the inventory. A review of 182 studies on physician burnout in 45 countries reported in September 2018 in <em>JAMA </em>is illustrative. Almost 86 percent of studies in that review used a version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. But roughly a quarter of those studies used unofficial versions of Maslach’s scale, such as halving the number of statements or measuring exhaustion only. Those versions are clinically invalid, Maslach contends. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, most researchers using the inventory, or a modified version, did designate cutoff scores, though teams’ definitions for high, medium and low burnout showed little agreement. Consequently, estimates for the prevalence of physician burnout varied from 0 to 80.5 percent — figures that are impossible to interpret, the researchers note.</p>



<p>What’s more, across all the studies, the <em>JAMA</em> team identified <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2702871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">142 definitions of burnout</a>. And among the subset of studies not using a version of the inventory, the researchers identified 11 unique methods for measuring burnout. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those many concerns are prompting some researchers to call for a return to the drawing board on how to define and measure burnout. That process should start with qualitative interviews to see how people struggling at work speak about their own experiences, Demerouti says. “We don’t [have] a good conceptualization and diagnosis of burnout.… We need to start from scratch.”</p>



<h4>Do researchers agree on any features of burnout?</h4>



<p>Surprisingly, yes. Researchers concur that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702620979597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion is a core feature</a> of the syndrome, wrote Bianchi and his team in March 2021 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science.</em></p>



<p>Research in the past two decades &nbsp;is also converging on the idea that burnout appears to involve changes to cognition, such as problems with memory and concentration. Those cognitive problems can take the form of people becoming forgetful — missing a recurring meeting or struggling to perform routine tasks, for instance, says Charlie Renaud, an occupational health psychologist at the University of Rennes in France. Such struggles can carry over into people’s personal lives, causing leisure activities, such as reading and watching movies, to become laborious.</p>



<p>As these findings mount, some researchers have begun to incorporate questions on cognitive changes into their burnout scales, Renaud says.</p>

<h4>Is burnout a form of depression?</h4>



<p>At first glance, the two concepts appear contradictory. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">Depression</a> is typically seen as stemming from within the individual and burnout as stemming from societal forces, chiefly the workplace (<em>SN: 2/12/23</em>). &nbsp;But some researchers have begun to question if burnout exists as a standalone diagnosis. The concepts are not mutually exclusive, research shows. Chronic stress in one’s environment can trigger depression and certain temperaments can make one more prone to burnout.</p>



<p>For instance, scoring high for the personality trait <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178118310230?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuroticism</a> — characterized by irritability and a tendency to worry — better predicted a person’s likelihood of experiencing burnout than certain work-related factors, such as poor supervisor support and lack of rapport with colleagues, Bianchi and his team reported in 2018 in <em>Psychiatry Research.</em></p>



<p>Moreover, exhaustion occurred together with depression more frequently than with either cynicism or inefficacy, Bianchi and his team reported in the 2021 paper<em>.</em> If burnout is characterized by a suite of symptoms, then exhaustion and depression appear a more promising combination than the Maslach trifecta, the team reported.</p>



<p>“The real problem is that we want to believe that burnout is not a depressive condition, [or] as severe as a depressive condition,” Bianchi says. But that, he adds, simply isn’t true.</p>



<h4>Should people be able to get a diagnosis of “burnout”?</h4>



<p>Not everyone thinks that’s a good idea. “Burnout was never, ever thought of as a clinical diagnosis,” Maslach says.</p>



<p>Bianchi and his team disagree. The researchers have developed their own scale, the Occupational Depression Inventory, which assesses nine core symptoms associated with major depression, including cognitive impairment and suicidal thinking, through the lens of work. For instance, instead of rating a statement like “I feel like a failure,” participants rate the statement, “My experience at work made me feel like a failure.” <em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>If burnout is a form of depression, then it can be treated as such, Bianchi says. And, unlike burnout, treatments for depression, such as therapy and, in severe cases, medication, are already established. “Hopefully the interventions, the treatments, the forms of support that exist for depressed people can then be applied for occupational depression,” he says.</p>



<p>But treating the individual, while often a necessary first step, does nothing to alleviate the work-related stress that triggered the crisis, says occupational health psychologist Kirsi Ahola of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki. “[Imagine] the person is on sick leave, for example, for a few weeks and recuperates and rests … and he comes back to the exactly same situation where the demands are too high and no support and whatever. Then he or she starts burning out again.” That cycle is difficult to break.</p>



<p>Burnout is not included in the American Psychiatric Association’s current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The World Health Organization adopted Maslach’s conceptualization of burnout when they outlined the syndrome in their 2019 International Classification of Diseases. Burnout constitutes “an <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occupational phenomenon,” </a>not a medical condition, the agency noted. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>With the evidence so murky, is there any help for people struggling at work?</h4>



<p>Most researchers agree that interventions must target work-related distress at all levels, from the individual to the workplace to governing bodies.</p>



<p>Interventions at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid">the individual level</a> include therapy, exercise, developing hobbies outside of work and crafting one’s job to better fit one’s goals (<em>SN: 1/10/23</em>). Additionally, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-32813-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive training programs</a> that help restore memory, attention and other cognitive deficits have shown promise in alleviating the cognitive problems associated with burnout, Renaud and University of Rennes developmental psychologist Agnès Lacroix reported January 2 in the <em>International Journal of Stress Management. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the workplace level, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">simple fixes</a>, such as fewer video meetings and reducing distractions during the workday, can alleviate distress (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>). It’s time to chip away at all the little changes that have increased people’s workload over time, Maslach says. “Everybody adds stuff to people’s work. They never subtract.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, though, it may take systemic changes, such as more stringent labor laws, to combat burnout in countries like the United States, where sick leave is seldom guaranteed and few rules protect employees from overwork and job insecurity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But even without regulations forcing employers’ hands, governments and companies that prioritize healthy workplaces have a competitive advantage. “When people are feeling well and cope well and have energy, they are also better workers,” Ahola says. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">Fungi don’t turn humans into zombies. But The Last of Us gets some science right</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like so many others, I’ve been watching the HBO series <em>The Last of Us.</em> It’s a classic zombie apocalypse drama following Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they make their way across the former United States (now run by a fascist government called Fedra).</p>



<p>I’m a big fan of zombie and other post-apocalyptic fiction. And my husband had told me how good the storyline is in the video game that inspired the series, so I was prepared for interesting storytelling. What I didn’t expect was to be so intrigued by the science behind the sci-fi.</p>





<p>In the opening minutes of the series, two scientists on a fictional 1968 talk show discuss the microbes that give them pandemic nightmares. One says it’s fungi — not viruses or bacteria — that keep him awake. Especially worrisome, he says, are the fungi that control rather than kill their hosts. He gives the example of fungi that turns ants into living zombies, puppeteering the insects by flooding their brains with hallucinogens.</p>



<p>He goes on to warn that even though human body temperature keeps us fungus-free, that might not be true if the world got a little bit warmer. He predicts that as the thermostat climbs, a fungus that hijacks insects could mutate a gene allowing it to burrow into human brains and take control of our minds. Such a fungus could induce its human puppets to spread the fungus “by any means necessary,” he says. What’s worse, there are no preventatives, treatments or cures, nor any way to make them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a brief segment, but it had me hooked. It all sounded so chilling and … <em>plausible</em>. After all, fungi like ones that cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/nail-infections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nail infections</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeast infections</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ringworm</a> already infect people.</p>



<p>So I consulted some experts on fungal infections to find out whether this could actually happen.</p>



<p>I’ve got good news and bad news.</p>



<p>First, the bad news.</p>



<h4>Bad news: Climate change has already helped one fungus mutate to infect humans</h4>





<p>I wanted to know if warming has spurred any fungi to mutate and become infectious. So I called Arturo Casadevall. He has been thinking about fungi and heat for a long time. He’s proposed that the need to avoid fungal infections may have provided the evolutionary pressure that drove mammals and birds to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/just-warm-enough">evolve warm-bloodedness</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>).</p>



<p>Most fungal species simply can’t reproduce at human body temperature (37° Celsius, or 98.6° Fahrenheit). But as the world warms, “these strains either have to die or adapt,” says Casadevall, a microbiologist who specializes in fungal infections at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That raises the possibility that fungi that now infect insects or reptiles could evolve to grow at temperatures closer to human body temperature.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans&#8217; average body temperature has been falling</a> since the 19th century, at least in high-income countries, researchers reported in <em>eLife</em> in 2020. One study from the United Kingdom pegs average body temperature at 36.6° C (97.9° F). And some of us are even cooler.</p>



<p>Fungi’s possible adaptation to higher heat and humans’ cooling body temperature are on a collision course, Casadevall says.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="525" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1.jpg" alt="An illustration of Candida auris as purple oval bubbles floating on a dark blue background." class="wp-image-3122054" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-496x383.jpg 496w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-583x450.jpg 583w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-241x186.jpg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122054">Climate change helped the fungus <em>Candida auris </em>(illustrated) gain the ability to infect people.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122054">Stephanie Rossow/CDC</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>He and colleagues presented evidence of one such crash. Climate change may have allowed a deadly fungus called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans"><em>Candida auris</em> to acclimate to human body temperatures</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/19</em>). A version of the fungus that could infect humans independently emerged on three continents from 2012 to 2015. “It’s not like someone took a plane a spread it. These things came out of nowhere simultaneously,” Casadevall says.</p>



<p>Some people argue that the planet hasn’t warmed enough to make fungi a problem, he says. “But you have to think about all the really hot days [that come with climate change]. Every really hot day is a selection event,” in which many fungi will die. But some of those fungi will have mutations that help them handle the heat. Those will survive. Their offspring may be able to survive future even hotter heat waves until human body temperature is no challenge.</p>



<p>Fungi that infect people are usually not picky about their hosts, Casadevall says. They will grow in soil or — if given an opportunity — in people, pets or in other animals. The reason fungi don’t infect people more often is that “the world is much colder than we are, and they have no need of us,” he says.</p>



<p>When people do get infected, the immune system usually keeps the fungi in check. But fungal infections can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">cause serious illness</a> or be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">deadly, particularly to people with weakened immune systems</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21; SN: 1/10/23</em>).</p>



<p>The second episode of <em>The Last of Us</em> reveals that the zombie-creating fungi initially spread through people eating contaminated flour. Then, the infected people attack and bite others, spreading the fungus.</p>



<p>In real life, most human infections arise from breathing in spores. But Casadevall says it’s “not implausible” that people could get infected by eating spores or by being bitten.</p>



<h4>Also bad: Fungal genes can adapt to higher heat</h4>



<p>I also wondered exactly <em>how</em> a fungus could evolve in response to heat. Asiya Gusa, a fungal researcher at Duke University School of Medicine, has published one possibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, she and colleagues reported in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> on how one fungus mutated at elevated temperature to become harder to fight.</p>



<p><em>Cryptococcus deneoformans,</em> which already infects humans (though it’s no zombie-maker), <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2001451117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became resistant to some antifungal drugs</a> when grown at human body temperature. The resistance was born when mobile bits of DNA called transposons (often called jumping genes) hopped into a few genes needed for the antifungals to work.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study, Gusa and colleagues grew <em>C. deneoformans</em> at either 30° C or 37° C for 800 generations, long enough to detect multiple changes in their DNA. Fungi had no problem growing at the balmy 30° C (86° F), the temperature at which researchers typically grow fungi in the lab. But their growth slowed at the higher temperature, a sign that the fungi were under stress from the heat.</p>



<p>In <em>C. deneoformans</em>, that heat stress really got things jumping. One type of transposon accumulated a median of 12 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2209831120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra copies</a> of itself in fungi grown at body temperature. By contrast, fungi grown at 30° C tended to pick up a median of only one extra copy of the transposon. The team reported those results January 20 in <em>PNAS</em>. The researchers don’t yet know the effect the transposon hops might have on the fungi’s ability to infect people, cause disease or resist fungus-fighting drugs.</p>



<p>So yeah, the bad news is not great. Fungi are mutating in the heat and at least one species has gained the ability to infect people thanks to climate change. Other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">fungi that infect people are more widespread</a> than they were in the 1950s and 1960s, also thanks to a warming world (<em>SN: 1/4/23</em>).</p>



<p>But I promised good news. And here it is.</p>



<h4>Good news: Human brains may resist zombification</h4>



<p>It may not be our body temperature, but our brain chemistry, that protects us from being hijacked by zombifying fungi.</p>



<p>I consulted Charissa de Bekker and Jui-Yu Chou, two researchers who study the <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> fungi that are the model for the TV show’s fungal menace. These fungi infect ants, flooding the insects with a cocktail of chemicals that steer the ants to climb plants. Once in position, the ants chomp down and the chemicals keep the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">jaw muscles locked</a> in place (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike most fictional zombies, the ants are alive during this process. “A lot of people get the misconception that we work on undead ants,” says de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She’s glad to see the show “stick to the story of the host being very much alive while its behaviors change.” The fungi even help preserve the ant, keeping it alive even while feeding on it. But eventually the ant dies. Then a mushroom rises from the corpse, showering spores onto the ground where other ants may become infected.</p>



<p>Related species of <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> infect various species of ants and other insects. But each fungal species is very specific to the host it infects. That’s because the fungi had to individualize the chemicals they use to control the particular species they infect. The ability to manipulate behavior comes at the cost of not being able to infect multiple species.</p>

<p>A fungus that specializes in infecting ants probably can’t get past humans’ immune systems, says Chou, a fungal researcher at the National Changhua University of Education in Taiwan. “Think of a key that fits into a specific lock. It is only this unique combination that will trigger the lock to open,” he says.</p>



<p>Even if the fungi evolved to withstand human body temperature and immune system attacks, they probably couldn’t take control of our minds, de Bekker says. “Manipulation is like a whole different ballgame. You need a ton of additional tools to get there.” It took millions of years of coevolution for the fungi to master piloting ants, after all.</p>



<p>While fungi do make mind-altering chemicals that can affect human behavior (LSD and psilocybin, for instance), Casadevall agrees that fungi that mind control insects probably won’t turn humans into zombies. “It’s not one of my worries,” he says.</p>



<p>Infected ants don’t turn into vicious, biting zombies either, de Bekker says. “If anything, we actually see the healthy ants being aggressive toward infected individuals, once they figure out that they&#8217;re infected, to basically get rid of them.” That “social immunity” helps protect the rest of the nest from infection.</p>



<h4>Also good: Humans are innovative enough to develop treatments</h4>



<p>The fictional scientist&#8217;s assertion that we couldn’t prevent, treat or cure these fungal infections is also a stretch.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs exist and they cure many fungal infections, though some infections may persist.&nbsp;Some that spread to the brain may be particularly difficult to clear.Some fungi are also evolving resistance to the drugs. And a few <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00294-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fungal vaccines are in the works</a>, although they may not be ready for years.</p>



<p>The experts I talked to say they hope the show will bring attention to real fungal diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gusa was especially glad to see fungi in the limelight. And she shares my fondness for that retro series opening in which the scientist predicts climate change could spawn mind-controlling fungi bent on infecting every person on the planet.</p>



<p>“I was pretty much yelling at the TV when I watched the [show’s] intro,” in an excited kind of way, she says. “This is the foundation of a lot of my grant funding … the threat of thermal adaptation of fungi.… To see it played out on the screen was something kind of fun.”</p>

<p>A paper that caught flak for its claims that an ancient city in the Middle East was destroyed by an exploding celestial body – and the authors’ suggestion that the event could have inspired the Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah – now has an editor’s note acknowledging the journal is looking into concerns about its data and conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The note follows a litany&nbsp; of criticism on Twitter, PubPeer, and in a “Matters Arising” response, as well as an extensive correction published last year. It appeared just days after Retraction Watch asked the publisher for an update on the case.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>,” was published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title, in September 2021. It has been cited six times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/113737860#score">Altmetric shows</a> it has gotten more online attention than most other papers of a similar age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after the article’s publication, its claims attracted scrutiny on Twitter, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/01/criticism-engulfs-paper-claiming-an-asteroid-destroyed-biblical-sodom-and-gomorrah/">we reported at the time</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Boslough">Mark Boslough</a>, a <s>retired </s>physicist at the University of New Mexico and expert in planetary impacts and airbursts (when celestial bodies explode above the earth’s surface) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440097126856282113?s=20">kicked off the criticism</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MTB_Archaeology/status/1440473335687630865?s=20">other scientists</a> quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/petrabonegirl/status/1440833392006688768?s=20">joined in</a>. </p>

One of the authors, Philip J. Silvia of Trinity Southwest University in Albuquerque, N.M., told us at the time that “the accusation that the image was photoshopped is categorically false.” But another author later acknowledged in a blog post that a graphic artist “made minor, cosmetic corrections to five of 53 images.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trinity Southwest University <a href="https://trinitysouthwest.com/about-tsu/#mission">describes itself</a> as “a trans-denominational institution in the evangelical mainstream of the historic Christian Faith” that has “chosen to remain non-aligned” with respect to “traditional accreditation.” Its <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trinity+Southwest+University/@35.1656068,-106.5910497,21z/data=!3m1!5s0x8722744ee3b147c9:0x342e3a70ddff1067!4m5!3m4!1s0x87189fd9594699ad:0x4340490ded8f3dd3!8m2!3d35.1656276!4d-106.5909719">address</a> appears to be located in a strip mall between a cannabis dispensary and a bubble tea shop in Albuquerque.</p>



<p>In response to comments about the images on PubPeer, corresponding author Allen West, whose affiliation is listed as “Comet Research Group,” located in Prescott, Ariz., <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#18">posted original versions</a> of seven images in the paper alongside the altered versions to show what was changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#21">Silvia wrote</a> on PubPeer:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We maintain that we have correctly represented the key original data &#8212; nothing of importance to the conclusion was changed. We have asked Scientific Reports to weigh in, and now it is up to them to decide.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06266-9">correction</a> to the paper in February 2022 listed several dozen figures that had been altered, and published original versions of them. The erratum stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Some of the figure panels have been manipulated to remove the features irrelevant to the scientific content depicted in those (e.g. measuring tape, previous image labels, visible fingers etc.). The Authors recognise that this level of manipulation was inappropriate, and provide original images.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next month, the journal published a “Matters Arising” in response to the original paper, titled, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08216-x">No mineralogic or geochemical evidence of impact at Tall el-Hammam, a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversation continued on PubPeer, sometimes with West and Silvia replying to questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last&nbsp; September, Boslough collected four outstanding issues with the paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#74">in a PubPeer post</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; Among these, he wrote, was “an egregious misrepresentation of my own work” in the paper’s figure 53, a depiction of an airburst simulation Boslough had presented at a conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>West <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#82">responded in detail</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Some of the issues that you raise in your Comment are questions that are answered here. Others can be resolved with corrections in Bunch et al., and I have already asked Scientific Reports for guidance on how to proceed. We will consult with you once I hear from them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">West and his collaborators have previously published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/447256a">controversial claims</a> about other putative comet impacts, including one about 13,000 years ago that they say led to the extinction of wooly mammoths and the Clovis culture in North America. But, as Rex Dalton <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180">reported in 2011</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>West is Allen Whitt — who, in 2002, was fined by California and convicted for masquerading as a state-licensed geologist when he charged small-town officials fat fees for water studies. After completing probation in 2003 in San Bernardino County, he began work on the comet theory, legally adopting his new name in 2006 as he promoted it in a popular book. Only when questioned by this reporter last year did his co-authors learn his original identity and legal history. Since then, they have not disclosed it to the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to archives of <em>Scientific Reports</em>’ website, West had been a member of the journal’s editorial board as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306181639/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors#earthenvironment">March of 2020</a>, but was no longer listed on the site as of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210801042155/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">August 2021</a>. He has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Beginning soon after the Tall el-Hammam article’s publication, Boslough has been in contact with Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, about the issues he saw in the paper, his posts on PubPeer, and critical articles he was working on for the publication <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/12/sodom-meteor-strike-claims-should-be-taken-with-a-pillar-of-salt/"><em>Skeptical Inquirer</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boslough emailed Marszalek again in December, following West’s PubPeer comment about working with <em>Scientific Reports</em> on corrections to the article, and asked if the paper couldn’t at least be marked with an editor’s note while the journal considered what to do:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Forgive me for my increasing rate of messages asking for Bunch et al (2021) to either be retracted or corrected, but this is becoming urgent. It has been a year and a quarter since it has been published and there are still many instances of false claims and wrong data that have not yet been corrected. In some cases, the authors agree that the information is false (such as their incorrect labeling of my simulation in Figure 53, and the false claims about trees at Tunguska). Allen West acknowledged these problems three months ago and promised to work with you to correct them.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek responded the next day:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am incredibly sorry for the lack of responses from me. I am working on this, but my recent business travels have slowed me down. The urgency is not lost on me, but as you can imagine it takes time to piece together all of the information here, esp. given the rate at which the exchange progressed on PubPeer earlier this year going beyond what your early comments as well as authors replies to us may have covered (and diverging into directions that while important, are not something we can address editorially, as I explained in the past).</p>



<p>I hope you can bear with me for a while longer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this month, Boslough copied Retraction Watch on his latest email to Marszalek, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>​​As I&#8217;ve noted several times since we started corresponding in 2021, Scientific Reports needs to either retract or make several more immediate corrections to the paper by Bunch et al (2021). Most important to me is the removal from your journal of their Figure 53, which shows a photoshopped version of one of my airburst simulations with added labels that are wrong and a caption that misrepresents it and changes its meaning in an apparent attempt to use my model to support their hypothesis. I do not want their false claims to be misattributed to me… ​​Can you please put a statement of concern on this paper until it is retracted or until these and other corrections are made?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We also emailed Springer Nature’s press office to ask if correction was indeed underway, and on February 10 got the following response attributed to Marszalek:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation into this paper is still ongoing. The editors are looking into the concerns raised, which include but are not limited to those issues raised in the PubPeer comments. This process may take some time while we carefully consider available evidence and give all parties involved the chance to respond.</p>



<p>We will update our readers with further information as soon as we are able to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This editor’s note was posted on February 15:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that concerns raised about the data presented and the conclusions of this article are being considered by the Editors. A further editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what prompted the note’s publication, given the longstanding critiques of the paper. Marszalek responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When concerns are raised about papers we have published, we look into them carefully, following an established process. These issues are often complex and as a result, it can take time for editors and authors to fully investigate them.&nbsp; Given that it is taking significant time to unravel the concerns in this case, we felt it was in the best interests of the readership to add a note at this stage.&nbsp; For confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment further at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Responding to the editor’s note, Boslough told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is a positive development that is long overdue. Frankly, I think the paper is unsalvageable and no amount of correction would be sufficient to make it publishable. For example, data points in their map of debris directionality (Fig. 17) appear to be fabricated and the authors don&#8217;t seem to be capable of providing the raw data or methods so others can see how they arrived at their claimed wind vectors on which their conclusions are based. I hope this expression of concern leads to more scrutiny on the same group&#8217;s other papers with similarly troublesome claims based on data and methods that they have never revealed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stroke-recovery-new-treatment-implant-patient-paralysis">A new treatment could restore some mobility in people paralyzed by strokes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sitting in an exam room, surrounded by doctors and scientists, Heather Rendulic opened her left hand for the first time since suffering a series of strokes nine years earlier when she was in her early 20s.</p>



<p>“It was an amazing feeling for me to be able to do that again,” Rendulic says. “It’s not something I ever thought was possible.”</p>



<p>But immediately after a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02202-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surgically implanted device sent electrical pulses into her spinal cord</a>, Rendulic could not only open her hand but also showed other marked improvements in arm mobility, researchers report February 20 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. “We all started crying,” Marco Capogrosso, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a February 15 news conference. “We didn’t really expect this could work as fast as that.”</p>





<p>The approach is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">similar to that recently used for patients paralyzed by spinal cord injuries</a> (<em>SN: 08/03/22</em>). It represents a promising new technique for restoring voluntary movement to those left with upper-body paralysis following strokes, the team says.</p>



<p>A stroke occurs when blood supply to parts of the brain is cut off, often causing short-term or long-term issues with movement, speech and vision. Stroke is a leading, and often underappreciated, cause of paralysis; in the United States alone, 5 million people are living with some form of motor deficit due to stroke. While physical therapy can provide some improvements, no treatment exists to help these patients regain full control of their limbs — and their lives.</p>



<p>Strokes cause paralysis because the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged; the brain tries to tell the spinal cord to move certain muscles, but the message is muddled.</p>



<p>So, taking advantage of techniques already existing for spinal injections of anesthetics, the team invented an electrical device that can be placed along the spinal cord to stimulate the nerves there. The stimulation “does not hurt whatsoever,” Rendulic says. “It feels like a vibration.”</p>



<p>By aligning the electrodes on the device with sensory nerves, “we can enhance the activation of muscles that are weakened by the stroke,” Douglas Weber, an engineer and neuroscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said at the news conference. Pulses from these electrodes seek to amplify signals from the brain, stimulating sensory nerves that go on to activate muscles, restoring voluntary body control to patients.</p>



<p>Rendulic and the other patient in the study both showed improvement in mobility tasks, including drawing a spiral, opening a lock and gripping and lifting a soup can while the device was on. Treatment sessions of continuous electrical stimulation were held for four hours per day, five days a week, over 29 days, and the improvements persisted for as long as four weeks after treatment stopped. This makes the researchers optimistic that they can get even stronger results if the treatment were paired with intensive physical training, Elvira Pirondini, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said at the news conference.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After a series of strokes nine years ago, Heather Rendulic lost the use of her left arm and hand. Now, thanks to an implanted device that sends electrical pulses into spinal nerves, she has regained some function. Here, she feeds herself and sorts blocks while the device is on, but has trouble doing those tasks when the stimulation is turned off. The implant sends electrical pulses into spinal nerves, circumventing the damaged connection between the brain and the spinal cord. (Devices on her arm are just for monitoring.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>She and the rest of the team are actively testing the device with other patients, and also exploring if pairing it with physical training can improve outcomes. The researchers are hopeful that it will be widely accessible because the surgery to implant it is minimally invasive and routine, and the value of the procedure can be clearly demonstrated, which is important to convince insurance companies to cover it.</p>





<p>The treatment might not work well for patients with severe mobility impairment, says UCLA neurologist Bruce Dobkin, who was not involved with the study. But it could serve as a “new tool to try to maximize the recovery” of stroke patients with more moderate paralysis, in combination with other therapies.</p>



<p>For Rendulic, the proven potential of using spinal cord stimulation to treat paralysis caused by stroke gives her hope for the future. “I really hope and pray that this becomes widely available,” she says, “because I know it’s going to change so many lives.”</p>

<h4>Fungi Q&amp;A</h4>



<p><em>Three types of fungi — </em>Histoplasma<em>, </em>Coccidioides<em> and </em>Blastomyces <em>— that cause serious lung infections were thought to be confined to certain regions of the United States. But now they are widespread in the country, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">Where fungal lung infections have spread</a>” (</em>SN: 1/14/23, p. 32<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story prompted so many questions from readers about the symptoms, treatments and testing for these fungal infections that <strong>Saey</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">answered them in a follow-up article online</a>. An abridged version appears below.</p>





<p><strong>How do you get infected?</strong></p>



<p>People generally get infected by inhaling fungal spores. Human activities such as farming, gardening and construction can disturb the soil where these fungi live, stirring up spores. Bird droppings and bat guano can also be sources of <em>Histoplasma</em>. Sweeping dried droppings increases the risk that spores will get kicked into the air and inhaled.</p>



<p>When cleaning up bird and bat droppings, it’s best to first wet them with a hose. Wearing a mask can also help limit exposure.</p>



<p><strong>What are the symptoms and treatments?</strong></p>



<p>People with healthy immune systems may show no symptoms or may develop mild flulike symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, chills and body aches. Other symptoms may include chest pain or discomfort, weight loss, headache, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath or night sweats.</p>





<p>People with coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever — the disease caused by <em>Coccidioides</em> — may also get a rash on their legs or upper body.</p>



<p>Symptoms can take time to appear. Those of histoplasmosis, the disease caused by <em>Histoplasma</em>, can develop between three and 17 days after exposure. Valley fever symptoms can appear between one and three weeks after exposure. For blastomycosis, the disease caused by <em>Blastomyces</em>, symptom onset can take anywhere from three weeks to three months.</p>



<p>Mild cases of all three infections usually clear up on their own in a few weeks to a few months. But some people may have lingering symptoms, especially if the infection becomes severe. Some people may develop severe or chronic pneumonia. And in a small number of people, the infections may spread to other parts of the body. For instance, <em>Histoplasma</em> tends to spread to the liver, spleen, bone marrow, adrenal glands and intestines. <em>Blastomyces</em> and<em> Coccidioides</em> often target joints. All three fungi can spread to the brain, where they may cause abscesses or meningitis — an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>Doctors can order blood or urine tests, chest X-rays or CT scans to help diagnose fungal infections. In some cases, doctors may need to test a small amount of body tissue or fluid from the spine or lungs.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs and other medications can help treat infections and manage symptoms. If caught early, most people fully recover.</p>



<p><strong>Who’s at risk?</strong></p>



<p>Infections and severe disease from all three fungi occur more often in men than in women, but the reason is unclear. People who are pregnant, living with HIV/AIDS or have weakened immune systems for other reasons are at higher risk of severe disease. So are older people and those with diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-the-science-of-rocks-is-like-the-science-of-humans">How the science of rocks is like the science of humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>What field of science could be more solid than geology? Rocks are visible, tangible. You can bang on them with a hammer, drill them, compress them, zap them with X-rays, ultraviolet light and radar, analyze their chemistry, extract their secrets.</p>



<p>The study of human behavior, by contrast, is the story of science’s struggle to identify the ineffable. Researchers have taken wildly different approaches to trying to figure out how people think and behave, from Sigmund Freud’s notion of the Oedipus complex to making behavioral science more “scientific” through efforts such as the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> and fMRI brain scans. Human life is messy, and no hammer tap will reveal the brain’s workings.</p>





<p>This issue of <em>Science News</em> articulates that duality in two features. Our cover story reports on the geology and chemistry of Mars, with NASA’s Perseverance rover scouting the Red Planet for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-perseverance-rover-nasa-water-life">rocks that could reveal signs of past life</a>. In “Broken timelines,” social sciences writer Sujata Gupta investigates efforts to understand how life crises can cause some people to lose their sense of self and vision of the future. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3122086">Helping people restore that vision</a>, some researchers believe, could be a balm for PTSD and suicidal thinking.</p>



<p>As I read Gupta’s article, I could sense the scientists’ effort to quantify people’s experiences through definitions — self-continuity, autobiographical reasoning. These terms were new to me, and I found myself having to read closely to be sure I understood what the scientists meant. I took comfort in Gupta’s observation that philosophers have been wrestling with these questions for millennia. There are no easy answers.</p>



<p>When I turned to freelance writer Liz Kruesi’s account of the first two years of the Perseverance mission, I thought, “Ah, easy.” Find rocks, study rocks, confirm or reject hypotheses. NASA scientists directed the rover to the Jezero crater, the site of a dry lake bed that they presumed would be made of sedimentary rocks — the type of rock most likely to preserve evidence of ancient life. To their astonishment, the rover, affectionately known as Percy, instead found igneous rocks from past magmatic activity. The story was more complicated than most scientists thought.</p>



<p>Percy has since rolled on to a new location, the front of a dried-up delta, where it has found the sedimentary rocks the scientists were hoping for. The rover continues in its work as a robot geologist and astrobiologist, taking photos and collecting samples that are revealing the chemistry of the rocks. Bit by bit, that information will help scientists piece together the complex story of the planet’s history. Someday, they may even be able to answer the big question of whether life once thrived on Mars.</p>



<p>So maybe rocks and humans aren’t such different research subjects after all. Simple questions lead to complicated and contradictory data, with new discoveries challenging what we thought we knew to be true. As we learn, we rewrite the story of the past and get a clearer sense of what the future may hold. And so many questions remain to be answered.</p>
