              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/11/plos-launches-two-journals-to-address-critical-real-world-challenges/">PLOS launches two journals to address critical real-world challenges</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on Wednesday, November 12.<br><br>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced the launch of two journals, <em>PLOS Aging and</em> <em>Health </em>and <em>PLOS Ecosystems</em>. Both journals are grounded in our commitment to rigor and research integrity of the highest standard and our open science principles, which facilitates greater reproducibility, faster scientific progress, and broader access to knowledge. In addition, both journals are underpinned by our <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/flat-fee/">Flat Fee</a> model that is designed to shift the cost from researchers to an institutional annual fee, which enables institutions to provide unlimited publishing opportunities for their researchers across participating journals.</p>



<p><a>The new journals, including their scope, include:</a></p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/agingandhealth"><em>PLOS Aging and Heath</em></a><em>:</em> an open access journal that will publish boundary breaking work from&nbsp;researchers, clinicians, public health scientists, social scientists, and policymakers across the spectrum of aging research. The scope includes research that advances our understanding of aging, integrating biological, developmental, clinical, neurological, and functional dimensions. The journal will highlight factors such as disease processes, cognitive and mental health changes, geriatric care, lifestyle interventions, advances in technology, healthcare systems, social determinants, and policy approaches to understand and optimize health across the human lifespan. It will also address the societal, policy, and healthcare system transformations required to support healthy aging and quality of life on an individual level and across diverse and evolving populations.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As researchers, we tend to individually study relatively narrow areas, in terms of scope. Bringing together multidisciplinary, global researchers can help advance understanding of the implications of research findings, generating new ideas and innovations that stand to impact a greater number of people worldwide,&rdquo; said <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9244-9267">Jennifer A. Schrack</a>, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Aging and Health</em>. &ldquo;We are stronger together than independently, and our research needs to reflect that. The field of aging research is limited by journals that are siloed in terms of scope, for example, biology, clinical, cognitive, or policy-related only<em>. PLOS Aging and Health</em> presents the exciting opportunity to publish research across these boundaries to increase visibility of research findings and methods.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to be working alongside Jennifer, and the entire PLOS team, as we focus on studies from a human perspective where the translational aspects on biological mechanisms and clinical usefulness will be emphasized,&rdquo; said <a href="https://ki.se/en/people/sara-hagg">Sara H&auml;gg</a>, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Aging and Heath. &ldquo;</em>The aging field is still emerging and attracting many new researchers, and by imbedding open science principles in the research we publish, we hope to accelerate the findings in the aging research field and support the highest standard possible in research ethics.&rdquo;</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ecosystems"><em>PLOS Ecosystems</em></a>: a multidisciplinary, open access journal that brings together research relevant to addressing the challenges facing our terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems and nature&rsquo;s contributions to people.&nbsp;This selective, community-driven journal is a venue for the breadth of impactful and societally relevant research on the conservation, management, restoration, sustainability and use of ecosystems across scales. The scope of topics is therefore wide, including disciplines from both natural and social sciences, but also interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research involving policymakers, resource managers and practitioners. By connecting scientists from a wide breadth of disciplines, but also practitioners, and decision-makers, it will foster the exchange of knowledge, promote innovation, and strengthen the links between science, policy, and society to drive solutions for the biodiversity and environmental crises of our time.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am excited to lead this journal at this inflection point for our planet,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.idiv.de/staff/henrique-miguel-pereira/">Henrique Miguel Pereira</a>, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Ecosystems</em>. &ldquo;As ecosystems are transformed and biodiversity declines at an alarming pace, we are not only losing the results of millions of years of evolution but also missing vital opportunities to address interconnected global challenges &mdash; from climate change to sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and the creation of healthier and more livable cities.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Both of these titles give researchers a forum to directly address critical challenges facing our society today,&rdquo; said Lauren Coligan, Publisher, PLOS. &ldquo;We believe that by extending our suite of open science journals we can influence open science norms in these research communities in considered and appropriate ways while providing rapid access to research which can directly change the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American Medical Association will cease publication of its ethics journal at the end of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>AMA Journal of Ethics</em>, an open access, peer-reviewed journal was founded in 1999 under the name <em>Virtual Mentor</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The loss of the<em> AMA JoE</em> will be most acutely felt by medical students and trainees, since it had a unique production model that included them in the process,” said Matthew Wynia, a physician and bioethicist at the University of Colorado <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/invoking-therapeutic-privilege/2004-02">whose</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33554841/">work</a> has been featured in the journal and who previously led the AMA Institute for Ethics.</p>



<span id="more-133325"></span>



<p>The journal&nbsp; publishes monthly issues on a specific theme, such as private equity in health care, antimicrobial resistance, palliative surgery and more. The journal also covered ethics in publishing and research, including a 2015 article titled “<a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-publish-or-perish-promotes-inaccuracy-science-and-journalism/2015-12">How Publish or Perish Promotes Inaccuracy in Science—and Journalism</a>” written by Retraction Watch’s cofounder Ivan Oransky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors for theme issues were selected from a pool of medical students, resident physicians or fellows who brought forth an idea for an issue, and worked closely with the journal’s editorial staff to build it. “This was an absolutely unique experience, and it brought a lot of young people into serious engagement with the AMA for the first time,” Wynia told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s website will remain online with all content freely available, “in keeping with our guiding premise that ethics inquiry is a public good,” Audiey C. Kao, editor-in-chief of the <em>AMA Journal of Ethics </em>and vice president of the AMA’s Ethics Group<em> </em>for more than two decades, wrote <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/breaking-bad-news/2025-11">in a statement</a> on the journal’s website. “With humility, I am hopeful and confident that this archived journal content will stay evergreen for years to come.”</p>



<p>The AMA did not provide a reason for the decision to shutter the journal. The organization acknowledged our request for comment but told us it had nothing to add beyond the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal published 140 articles, reviews and editorials in 2024, and received <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/about">more than 3.1 million visits to its website that year</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2024-ama-annual-report.pdf">AMA’s 2024 annual report</a>, publishing revenue, which accounts for about 12 percent of the organization’s total, decreased by $2.1 million that year, largely because of declines in print advertising in its flagship journals, which include <em>JAMA</em>, <em>JAMA Network Open</em>, and other specialty journals. But <em>AMA Journal of Ethics </em>has always been an online-only, free publication without advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know why the AMA decided to eliminate the journal, but it was never a money maker — it had no ads, no subscription fees, and no publication fees — bottom line, no revenues,” Wynia said. “But that’s been true from the beginning.”</p>

                Ever had a day when work just clicks? That’s flow - the state where performance and focus reach their peak. But as Emily Cook from FOUND told WiNUK, most of us spend less than 5% of our working time there, meaning the potential for better focus and fulfilment is huge.

                <p>Due to political developments, the US have become a much less welcoming and hence dramatically less attractive place for academic conferences. This year, nobody from our research group was interested in attending our otherwise regular <a href="https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025">meeting of the Society for Neuroscience</a> (SfN). Thus, it will be only me who will attend and present our only poster:</p>

<p>On this poster, we describe how we discovered that an important site of plasticity in motor learning are motor neurons. The type of motor learning we study here is a form of operant self-learning where tethered flies (flying stationarily, fixed at a torque meter measuring the angular force the fly generates around its vertical body axis) receive heat-punishment for attempting to turn in a particular direction (i.e., either to the left or to the right). The motor neurons we have discovered express both the genes for aPKC and FoxP, conserved genes for motor learning among bilaterians. Knocking out any of these genes abolishes plasticity and learning. We also show preliminary evidence that the <em>foraging </em>PKG may also be involved in this type of learning. Pavlovian learning mutants show improved motor learning and overexpressing aPKC with two different methods also improves motor learning. Finally, we start exploring the role of dopamine and the ellipsoid-body ring neurons in this type of motor learning.</p>

<p>Usually, there are more than 30k attendees at this conference. Given the circumstances, I would not be surprised if this year&#8217;s attendance were less than 20k. We will see. Depending on future developments, this may be the last time anyone from our research group will be able to attend a meeting in the USA for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>On the other hand, all of our group (a total of now six people) will be attending the <a href="https://fensforum.org/">FENS meeting</a> next year in Barcelona.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/11/12/arxiv-labs-is-pausing-new-proposals/">Attention arXiv users: arXiv Labs is pausing new proposals</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arXiv’s framework for assessing and integrating community-built tools into the arXiv platform, is temporarily pausing new arXiv Labs proposals. This “hiatus” will not affect any current arXiv Labs, or arXiv Labs that have already been submitted through the arXiv Labs support portal and are awaiting approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is a community resource, and arXiv Labs has been our way of collaborating with researchers and developers working on the cutting edge of science who want to add free, useful tools to arXiv. arXiv Labs gives them the opportunity to experiment with new ideas and create features for arXiv that add value to arXiv content and benefit the scientific community. These tools, once approved, are integrated into the arXiv platform and appear on the bottom of each arXiv abstract page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While arXiv Labs are tools built by the community, the arXiv development team dedicates significant time to assessing, amending, and deploying each project. We are temporarily pausing new proposals to arXiv Labs because, at the moment, our development team has limited resources to dedicate to arXiv Labs. The arXiv dev team is focusing on our current top priority &#8211; modernizing arXiv’s tech and moving arXiv totally into the cloud for secure and sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the arXiv Labs portal is now closed to all new proposals, all current arXiv Labs will remain active during this temporary “hiatus” and arXiv Lab creators will be able to push updates to their active Labs projects. You can see a list of all our current and past community tools on our </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv Labs Showcase page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any proposal that was submitted through the arXiv Lab support portal and is currently in the submission pipeline will receive due consideration and will be added to the arXiv Labs tab if accepted. There will be an announcement shortly on these new Labs and updates that have been accepted and will appear on arXiv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a “goodbye” from arXiv Labs, just a “see you later”! arXiv Labs will reopen our proposal portal to new projects when we are able to dedicate the time and support arXiv Labs needs to be an efficient incubator for useful community tools.</span></p>

<p><em>The BMJ</em> has issued an expression of concern for a paper claiming stem cell therapy can reduce the risk of heart failure. The move comes after sleuths and scientists critiqued the “complete mismatch” between the study data and the article itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/06/sleuths-flag-complete-mismatch-in-data-of-bmj-stem-cell-study/">reported last week</a>, the October 29 paper included results of a phase III clinical trial in Shiraz, Iran. Critics quickly began pointing out discrepancies in the data on PubPeer, including psychologist Nick Brown, who pointed out a “curious repeating pattern of records in the dataset” every 101 records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382">expression of concern</a> published today, <em>The BMJ</em> acknowledged issues “apparent from the data that support the paper” including data irregularities, discrepancies in the age criteria and the ages of participants included in the study, and undeclared conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133319"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/24/improving-reproducibility-what-can-funders-do-guest-post-by-dorothy-bishop/">Dorothy Bishop</a>, professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, was the first to point out issues with the paper, specifically that the study claimed to have enrolled only patients under 65 years of age. However, in the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_PREVENT-TAHA8_study_Dataset_Prevention_of_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction-Induced_Heart_Failure_by_Intracoronary_Infusion_of_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells_A_Phase_III_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_b_/29375153/2?file=55664687">accompanying data</a>, 127 of the patients were older than 65 — a “complete mismatch,” she told us. She also noted the authors made the data available to the journal and reviewers only after the paper had undergone <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382/peer-review">two rounds of peer review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, Bishop pointed out potential conflicts of interest, noting author <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/mathuranthony.html">Anthony Mathur</a>, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London, is a <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10282577/officers">shareholder</a> and trustee of the Heart Cells Foundation, a charity that funds <a href="https://www.heartcellsfoundation.com/compassionate-centre/">a unit </a>for administering stem cell therapies to cardiac patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The editors judge that the trial may have breached accepted practices and that the results may not be reliable,” the notice states. <em>The BMJ</em> plans to investigate fully, the notice continues, and will consider an “auditable replacement dataset” the authors provided to the journal. Most of the authors, including corresponding author <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/armin-attar-26ba11173/?originalSubdomain=ir">Armin Attar</a>, are researchers at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p>



<p>After our article was published, sleuths <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C08779C45DB6E407DFAC85583BE9C4#1">continued to point out issues</a> with the paper. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Gideon+Meyerowitz-Katz">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia, noted “oddities” in the data, including that nearly half of recorded heart rates were divisible by five. He also pointed out an “unexpected” pattern in patient’s temperatures — of 311 recorded temperatures, 42 were exactly 36.2 degrees Celsius. </p>



<p>Retractions in <em>The BMJ </em>are rare. The journal issued its first retraction in 1989 and has retracted a <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?%3d1%26jou%3dBMJ%253a%2bBritish%2bMedical%2bJournal">total of just 12 articles</a>, according to the Retraction Watch Database.</p>

<p>The analysis behind this year’s Highly Cited Researchers list, <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/">released today</a> by indexing giant Clarivate, includes several tweaks aimed at reducing attempts to game the metric and excluding researchers who engage in questionable publication practices.</p>



<p>Those changes include removing highly cited papers from the calculations authored by researchers excluded from last year’s list for integrity issues. The company also applied specific removal criteria — including excessive self-citation rates, papers retracted for integrity concerns, and prolific publication rates — more comprehensively this year. In past years, the company had done so manually for particular geographic areas or disciplines.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re trying to make sure that the indicators are valid and reliable, which means we have to include these kinds of filters or screens and quantitative tests that indicate some kind of quality, qualitative character,” David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at the Institute for Scientific Information at Clarivate, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-133312"></span>



<p>The changes have also made it possible for mathematics to return as a category in the 2025 list. Clarivate stopped including the discipline in 2023 after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/24/math-has-publication-fraud-too/">the field’s relatively small number of papers</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/citation-cartels-help-some-mathematicians-and-their-universities-climb-rankings">evidence of citation manipulation</a>, led to the company to drop the discipline as a category.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What we saw over time was the dominance of a particular topic taking over all of mathematics, and that had all the markings of people gaming as well,” Pendlebury said. “That is why we decided to suppress the field of mathematics for two years and find a solution which allowed the truly influential people to resurface, so that they could be selected and highlighted. And that&#8217;s fortunately what we have this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate excludes retracted papers from its initial pool of data used to calculate the Highly Cited Researchers list. In 2022, the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/15/why-misconduct-could-keep-scientists-from-earning-highly-cited-researcher-designations-and-how-our-database-plays-a-part/">started using the Retraction Watch Database</a> for some of the qualitative components of its analysis, including checking the names on its preliminary list against the database for evidence of misconduct. </p>



<p>“The innovation of this year is that all these criteria are now more comprehensively and consistently applied across all researchers,” said Dmytro Filchenko, Clarivate’s senior director of research and analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those criteria include anomalous levels of self citation or group citation; authorship of papers retracted for integrity issues; community reports of breaches in research integrity; and prolific authorship, <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/evaluation-and-selection/">according to documentation</a> for the Highly Cited Researchers list. The company also excludes authors with an anomalous ratio of reviews to articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes led to 2,400 researchers being excluded this year because of integrity concerns, 432 of which were for hyper-prolific authorship. The total number excluded has increased over the years, from 500 in 2022 to 1,000 in 2023 and over 2,000 last year.</p>



<p>“These improvements led to the fact that more space for new researchers whose work may have been overshadowed previously is now available,” Filchenko said. “Usually our retention rate — so, meaning the highly cited researchers from the previous year who appear again in the new year — is around 70 percent. This year, it’s 60 percent.”</p>



<p>This year’s list includes 7,131 Highly Cited Researcher designations to 6,868 people, with some being recognized in more than one field. The United States is home to the largest share of the researchers, 2,670 or 37 percent. That marks a 1 percentage point increase from 2024 and follows several years of declines.</p>



<p>China has the second highest number of researchers, with 1,406 or nearly 20 percent of the total highly cited list.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The list for mathematics includes 65 researchers. As part of reintroducing math to the list, Clarivate consulted with mathematician Domingo Docampo of the University of Vigo in Spain. Docampo and colleagues <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00355/127806/Screening-articles-by-citation-reputation">developed an algorithm</a> independent of Clarivate’s methods to evaluate citations based on the quality of the citing reference. “We asked him to run his algorithm on the people who we nominated this year in mathematics,” Filchenko said. “Both algorithms were in agreement.”</p>



<p>As in years past, the list starts from the top 1 percent of papers in each field and publication year, and includes articles and reviews published in the last 11 years. In addition to removing retracted papers, Clarivate also excludes those with more than 30 authors or with group authorship. The company develops a preliminary list from the authors of those papers, applying the filters for research integrity concerns, publication practices, and so on, to arrive at the final list.</p>



<p>Just as authorship can be abused, so can citation practices.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s amazing for me to see over the years, over these decades, how important these measures have become,” Pendlebury said. He reflected how <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/blog/the-legacy-of-eugene-garfield-a-pioneer-of-information-science/">Eugene Garfield</a>, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information, warned against overreliance on metrics. “He actually asked <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/libr.1998.48.2.67">in one article</a>, ‘Is the tail now wagging the dog?’ So he was always concerned and always cognizant of how these data can be misused.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have had to deal with what is a rising tide of pollution in the literature, generally gaming of the publication citation metrics,” Pendlebury continued. “We have to deal and guard against gaming of these indicators, because we want them to be robust and reliable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve had to include all these screens and filters.”</p>

<p>Millions of researchers could be affected by a “dramatic distortion of citation counts” likely caused by flaws in how the academic publishing giant Springer Nature handles article metadata, according to a new preprint.</p>



<p>The bug means a large number of citations are automatically attributed to the first paper in a given journal volume, instead of to whichever paper in that volume they were intended for. The issue appears to affect many of the publisher’s online-only titles, such as <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Scientific Reports</em> and several BMC journals.</p>



<p>“It seems that millions of scientists lost a few citations, while tens of thousands, the authors of Article 1s, gained all these, leading to insane citation counts,”<a href="https://krivachy.xyz/"> Tamás Kriváchy</a> of the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, in Spain, told us. His findings<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01675"> appeared earlier this month</a> on arXiv.org. And those citation losses and gains are through no fault (or intention) of the authors themselves. In fact, one author we spoke with has tried, without success, to get mistaken citations removed from her paper.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133309"></span>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature questioned the new data and said the preprint’s conclusions “could be misleading.”</p>



<p>According to the analysis, the distorted statistics appear on the journals’ own websites and in free citation databases such as Crossref, OpenCitations and Google Scholar. The problem could make it harder for scientists to find out which studies cite which and could give some authors unfair advantages in winning grants, promotions and jobs, Kriváchy said.</p>



<p>Whether the effects carry over to the two major commercial citation databases, which the researcher could not access, is unclear. But one expert told us they might.</p>



<p>”My analyses confirm that the study&#8217;s main concern is valid: citation-linking errors appear to be significant, systemic, and spill over even into curated databases such as Scopus and Web of Science,” said<a href="https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/ri2/"> Lokman Meho</a>, a bibliometrician at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon.</p>



<p>“If such mistakes are high, the implications could be profound,” Meho added. “Inflated citation counts distort measures of scholarly influence, misrank universities, mislead funding decisions, and compromise evidence-based science policy. They also challenge one of the field&#8217;s core assumptions: that curated citation databases are insulated from the problems encountered in open systems such as Crossref or OpenCitations.”</p>



<p>The preprint highlights a paper designated as “Article number 1” in the 2018 volume of <em>Nature Communications</em>, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110140820/https:/www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w">Structural absorption by barbule microstructures of super black bird of paradise feathers</a>.” The work has garnered more than 7,000 citations, according to the journal’s website, and Crossref, OpenCitations and Semantic Scholar provide comparable numbers. Meanwhile, Google Scholar<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9304912792343911245&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en"> lists 584 citing papers</a> as of this writing, Clarivate’s Web of Science 582, and <a href="https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/85040590244?origin=resultslist#tab=citedBy">Scopus 1,323</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails we have seen, the corresponding author of that paper,<a href="https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/faculty/dakota-mccoy"> Dakota McCoy</a> of the University of Chicago, contacted <em>Nature Communications</em> in April of this year, stating her paper was “frequently cited spuriously.” An editorial assistant supervisor for the journal replied:&nbsp; “I am afraid that we are unable to determine any steps we are able to take to resolve the issue on our side as it looks as if no errors occurred on the original publication of the paper.” They speculated the issue may have come from the citing journal, was a citation error that kept getting propagated, or was somehow being influenced by AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a bizarre and annoying problem that we first noticed back in 2023 and haven&#8217;t been able to solve, despite emailing editors and Googling for hours. Even worse, the articles that are meant to receive those &gt;400 citations aren&#8217;t receiving them!” McCoy told us by email. “It is unfortunate because it makes it difficult to track the true impact of our paper.”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m so happy to see that this preprint may have identified the source issue,” she added.</p>



<p>McCoy’s coauthor <a href="https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty/richard-prum">Richard Prum</a>, an ornithologist at Yale University, told us: “Many of the articles in Google Scholar that are counted as citations of us actually make no mention whatsoever of any research related to us or our paper! So, the problem is compounding!!”</p>



<p>Meho said he had confirmed the problems in an analysis of Scopus data for Prum and McCoy’s article, as well as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-016-0009-6">three</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1387">other</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20314-w">papers</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> that also have more than 1,000 citations each, according to the database.</p>



<p>“When I extracted and examined the actual cited references in those citing papers, I found that fewer than 250 references in each case actually cited the target article. In other words, roughly three out of four citation links were erroneous, a discrepancy far too large to attribute to chance or isolated database glitches,” he told us. In at least one case, the errors did not seem to be explained by the bugs the preprint described, he said.</p>



<p>“The study also raises a larger question: Is this problem confined to Springer Nature, or is it an early warning of hidden structural vulnerabilities in how citation data are exchanged and standardized across all major publishers?” Meho said. “If millions of citation links can silently go astray in a system as central as Springer Nature&#8217;s, then research evaluation itself needs urgent scrutiny. The credibility of metrics, rankings, and even funding depends on the reliability of these invisible networks of data.”</p>



<p>According to Kriváchy, the problems appear to have originated with the advent of online-only journals several years ago. These publications typically reference articles using an article number instead of the page numbers traditional print journals use.</p>



<p>“Based on our analysis, the mis-citations happen primarily due to the above adaptation from a page-based numbering to an article number-based one; more specifically, from the improper technical handling of the change,” the preprint states. “The problem seems to stem from the absence of the Article Number in most formats of the article metadata obtained through the SpringerLink Application Programming Interface (API), or possibly from the handling of the fields in RIS file format provided by the publisher on Springer Nature Link websites.”</p>



<p>Springer Nature emphasized that, as a preprint, the new work “has not yet undergone peer review or independent validation.”</p>



<p>“Looking at the conclusions we suspect they could be misleading due to incomplete data,” a spokesperson said. “In the meantime, we are looking at all of the data ourselves as we are always open to feedback and to ensure that we continue to do the best for our authors.”</p>



<p>Kriváchy told us in addition to fixing the technical issues, the publisher “should put together a thorough report” addressing the cause of the problem as well as which journals have been affected and for how long.</p>



<p>Some of the damage won’t be fixable, however, said Alberto Baccini of the University of Siena, who studies publication metrics.</p>



<p>“The well-known Matthew Effect in bibliometrics indicates that highly cited papers become even more cited simply because they are perceived as important. Therefore, the initial metadata error has probably influenced researchers&#8217; citation behavior, leading them to cite these ‘false’ highly cited papers precisely because of their high citation count,” Baccini told us. “After the data is corrected, how many of the remaining citations were received solely thanks to this mechanism? This is an unfixable problem.”</p>



<p>“We are all aware of the pollution infecting contemporary science and the mechanisms that have corrupted citation counts such as citation mills,” he added. “I hope that this &#8216;genuine&#8217; error, originating from one of the major players in scientific publishing, will serve as a turning point. It should compel us to abandon our blind faith in quantitative metrics – a faith that has contributed so significantly to the corruption of contemporary science.”</p>

<p>How to render a publishing ban moot? Change your surname and just keep submitting.</p>



<p>That’s what happened in the case of Hashem Babaei, aka Hashem Gharababaei. In 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), a professional society based in the U.K., banned the mechanical engineering researcher from the University of Guilan from submitting his work to its journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over the next 10 years, (Ghara)Babaei managed to publish at least 10 articles in the society’s journals, simply using the abbreviated version of his name while continuing to use the same email address from his institution in Rasht, Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133305"></span>



<p>“This is a serious issue of academic misconduct,” said <a href="https://ebe.uct.ac.za/bisru/contacts/gerald-nurick">Gerald Nurick</a>, an emeritus professor and senior research scholar of engineering and the built environment at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gharababaei has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nurick, who recently brought the case to our attention, said he had hosted Gharababaei as a visiting student for a few months in 2008, but for health reasons could not supervise the work directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December of that year, Genevieve Langdon, a lab member who did work closely with Gharababaei, emailed the student a draft manuscript based on their work together. In her cover note, she stated the manuscript was not publishable in its current form because the data “does not fit with the past 20 years[’] worth of test data on steel.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I trust you understand this and will not publish this without my consent,” she wrote in the communication, recently shared with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Langdon, who no longer works in the field, heard little from Gharababaei until June 2010, when she and Nurick became aware of two manuscripts their former visiting student had submitted to IMechE journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of them, submitted to <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture</em>, contained text and a table “word for word identical to what I wrote in December 2008,” Langdon told Gharababaei in a letter dated June 15, 2010. “That alone is direct plagiarism,” she wrote. She was also “troubled to find that I am barely acknowledged for my important contributions to your experimental work” in his other published papers when she believed she should have been listed as a coauthor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second manuscript in question had been accepted for publication in <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science</em>. Trevor Cloete, another lab member who worked with Gharababaei, wrote to the journal’s editor on June 17, 2010, detailing his own unacknowledged contributions to the work and stating Gharababaei had published “an essentially similar paper” in another journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15397730903554633">paper</a>, which had appeared in the May 2010 issue of <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title, also included text from Langdon’s draft. Yet it only acknowledged her, Nurick and Cloete “for their help with the experiments and for machining the modified ballistic pendulum.” (The journal’s editor-in-chief has not responded to our request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month after that paper appeared, Nurick emailed Kruna Vukmirovic, managing editor of the two IMechE journals, with more details on the duplications between Gharababaei’s published paper and the manuscript accepted for publication. He also stated he had not given Gharababaei permission to publish photographs and data included in the other submission, which also included reproduction of Langdon’s written text without attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After investigating the matter, the journal editors found both manuscripts contained duplicated material and decided to pull them. Vukmirovic informed Nurick, Langdon and Cloete of the decision within a few weeks of the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vukmirovic also notified Gharababaei and his coauthors of the rejections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This level of duplication represents redundant publication,” Vukmirovic wrote. Gharababaei and his co-authors were put on notice that they “are now banned from submitting your future work to the IMechE Journals.”</p>



<p>Gharababaei offered to add Nurick, Langdon and Cloete as coauthors to his papers in 2010, but the group remained “incredibly angry,” Nurick told us. They ignored the emails because they “wanted nothing more to do with him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Nurick’s group didn’t hear anything further about Gharababaei until 2016, when the editor of <em>Thin Walled Structures</em>, an Elsevier title, asked Nurick to review a manuscript submitted by “Hashem Babaei” and two other co-authors. Upon examining the manuscript, Nurick realized Babaei was the same person as his former visiting student. The manuscript included references to the author’s previous work, published using the name “Gharababaei” until the ban and with the name “Babaei” after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2016, Nurick informed the editor of the name change and Babaei’s history with his group. Nevertheless, the manuscript was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263823116303354">published in the journal</a> in November 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digging deeper into the matter, Nurick also found Babaei had published papers in several IMechE journals, despite the ban. We have identified <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Babaei-publications-in-Institution-of-Mechanical-Engineers-journals.pdf">10 such papers</a> in three different journals and notified their top editors. John Chew, the editor-in-chief of IMechE’s <em>Journal of Engineering Science</em>, told us he referred the matter to the publisher’s integrity team for further investigation. The editors-in-chief of the other journals have not responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Retraction Watch Database lists one <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5558501">retraction</a> for “Hashem Gharababaei,” from a 2010 IEEE conference proceeding – one of 53 articles retracted from the conference with identical notices stating the contributions had “been found to be in violation of IEEE&#8217;s Publication Principles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Gharababaei lists a different university in Iran as an affiliation on the IEEE article, Nurick concluded it is “definitely” the same person. The topic of the paper had “no place” in the conference, which dealt with mechanical and electronics engineering, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nurick told us he would like to see all of Gharababaei’s work after 2010 with the name “Babaei” retracted. “He’s publishing in two names, and I think that’s wrong.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/11/10/thank-you-to-all-our-members-champions-and-all-stars/">Thank you to all our Members, Champions, and All Stars!</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to all our arXiv members! The arXiv membership pages have been updated to </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reflect our new membership tiers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to thank</span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all of our current members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are so thankful to all our member institutions &#8211; universities, libraries, and research labs &#8211; that generously give their support to arXiv through our annual membership program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv has a variety of funding streams to maintain our sustainability, and members are one of our most important &#8211; over 50% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from our members. arXiv provides a free service, but it’s not free to operate. We appreciate our members who give to arXiv year after year, despite the budget constraints that many in academia are facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is dedicated to making sure arXiv membership is flexible and affordable for all institutions who would like to support arXiv. arXiv has maintained its membership rates since 2024 and there are no new or higher fees for members this year. For institutions who are able to give more, arXiv introduced the “All Star” membership tier to a select group of members in 2025. arXiv All Star membership is a flexible membership tier &#8211; an opportunity for members to give a little more to arXiv when they are able. Because the All Star option was so popular in its initial launch, we’ve decided to officially keep it as a membership tier, available to any and all members. Thank you to all our</span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html#all-star"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new All Star members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; we appreciate your support!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to our new All Star members, Champion members have been supporting arXiv above and beyond for many years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champion members with arXiv are  institutions who lead the global research community in innovation, education, and promoting open science. </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html#champion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to all our new and old Champion members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their support and advocacy of equitable and open science!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your university interested in becoming an arXiv member? </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our membership page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more or email us at </span><a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">membership@arxiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No matter your budget, if you would like to support arXiv, we want to recognize you as a member &#8211; your support is so important to us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To all our members, whether Champion, All Star, Standard or Community &#8211; thank you for making open science and arXiv possible!</span></p>

                President Trump has argued the U.S. should test nuclear weapons because other countries are doing it. But scientific data suggest they’re not.

                Air pollution has long been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, but over the past decade, neuroscience has begun uncovering another, less visible consequence: its effect on the developing brain. Increasing evidence now suggests that maternal exposure to fine particulate matter during pregnancy, particularly PM2.5, may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Across  both human and animal studies, a consistent and biologically plausible...
