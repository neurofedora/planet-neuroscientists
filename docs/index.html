<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sampen-157x180-1.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="157" height="180" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sampen-157x180-1.png?resize=157%2C180&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128182" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hee-Jeong Im Sampen</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>&#8220;These findings are unjustified.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how a biologist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago described the conclusions of a federal investigation that found she had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/us-va-scientist-banned-from-agency-research-for-faking-data/">faked images and inflated sample sizes in published papers and a grant application</a>. The biologist, Hee-Jeong Im Sampen, has been banned from conducting VA research. </p>



<p>Sampen, also a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, said that &#8220;any errors that occurred involved discrete erroneously-placed figures or images&#8221; that &#8220;in no way undermine our basic conclusions and findings.&#8221;</p>



<p>Calling the episode a &#8220;long and hard battle for me,&#8221; Sampen sent us these comments:</p>



<span id="more-128207"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These findings are unjustified.  They impose responsibility <em>vicariously</em> for claimed misinformation in scientific figures.  In other words, conclusory charges of “misconduct” are repeatedly made based on my supervisory role.  In the committee’s view, the person who actually caused the misinformation (unintentionally) to be placed is irrelevant.  Tagging me as accountable for a lab member’s error, and calling it research misconduct, is so much easier.  Fundamental principles of what constitute &#8220;misconduct&#8221; have been ignored.</p>



<p>In addition, the entire investigation has been a travesty.  Witnesses with whom I was forbidden from communicating offered evidence against me in secret interviews.  At the same time, the investigation committee was given unfettered ability to meet with witnesses and prompt unfavorable testimony.  The fact that such conduct occurred speaks to the utterly decrepit institutional procedures in place that allowed it to happen.  No witness was ever subject to questioning <em>on my behalf</em>.  Nor were questions asked seeking to elicit answers favorable to me.  Favorable responses that, by chance, happened to be made were disregarded.  Similarly, the written statements I offered from former lab members and colleagues who know me best and who attested to my integrity, have been given no consideration whatever.</p>



<p>No evidence was provided under oath!  Fact issues thus abound throughout the proceedings.  Yet no impartial decision maker has ever evaluated the evidence to determine the actual facts.  Rather, the investigation committee made routine inferences against me on a wholesale basis and largely ignored my written responses.  The committee’s conclusions then were rubber stamped by VA administrators who raised no questions and heard no witnesses.  In fact, I requested but was denied a hearing on the allegations.  Likewise, my request simply to meet with VA administrators was denied.</p>



<p>Finally, I would add that the misconduct findings are made with respect to a tiny fraction of the huge volume of data generated by our lab.  (I have authored or co-authored nearly 200 publications over 25 years.)  I do not say that to justify any errors that may have occurred in our publications.  I regret and am embarrassed by each and every error.  But any errors that occurred involved discrete erroneously-placed figures or images.  They in no way undermine our basic conclusions and findings.  No allegation asserts otherwise, and our findings may be readily replicated.    </p>



<p>In other words, the scientific validity of my lab’s research and findings have never been questioned.  Unfortunately, the Federal Register report, while generous in the negative aspersions it casts, makes no mention of the important contributions our work has offered the scientific community – contributions that far overshadow the technical errors that were the subject of the investigation.</p>



<p>In short, the VA&#8217;s reported findings appear to serve some VA administrative purpose and led to my termination, but they lack validity from a legal, ethical, and practical scientific perspective. </p>

                <p><strong>In this short interview series, we will be shining a light on inspiring women working in neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. We explore  job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to read new interviews every month from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_2af6a8f3236043268e71d6684a6b14d9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_457,h_577,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Lucy Taylor, Masters student in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL." ></figure><p>This month we interviewed Lucy Taylor who is currently studying MSc Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL, evaluating the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in patients with brain injuries or disorders that affect their thinking, language or visual processing skills. Lucy previously studied BSc Nutrition and Medical Sciences at UCL for which she was awarded the nutrition prize for graduating top of her degree cohort.</p>
<h6><strong>Tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially.</strong>
<p>I have a BSc in Nutrition and Medical Sciences from UCL, and I am currently completing an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL. </p>

<p>I have always been interested in the biological aspects of human science, but in recent years the psychological and neuroscientific aspects have captured my interest. My interest in neuroscience was sparked by optional modules I took during my undergraduate degree. One lecture (on anosognosia and somatoparaphrenia poststroke) is particularly memorable, as it was delivered by an inspiring female Professor (Prof. Kat Fotopoulou). After the lecture I got in contact with her as I wanted to hear more about her career and the research she has done. As a result, we built rapport and I started interning in her psychology lab. I assisted in the running of a multisite clinical trial on metacognition and interoception in anorexia nervosa. During my time there I established that it was the intersection between neuroscience and psychology that intrigued me, and as such decided to pursue an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>

<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my degree so far. It has given me a comprehensive introduction to cognitive neuroscience through modules spanning neuroanatomy, brain processes, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, statistics and translational research. Throughout my degree the translational aspects of cognitive neuroscience have captured my interest in particular; as such, I got a role as a research assistant for the Neurotherapeutics research group, which involved assisting in the running of clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of a word retrieval app for proper name anomia in dementia patients and assisting a psychologist in delivering therapy to carers of stroke patients with aphasia. I’ve also chosen to undertake my thesis on a clinical population; I am working with the Neuroscience and Mental Health research group on a clinical trial aiming to gain understanding of the neural circuitry implicated in the therapeutic effect of CBT.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</strong></h6><p><p>As mentioned, I am currently involved in research with the Neuroscience and Mental Health research group for my thesis. I am really enjoying this as it is a topic I am genuinely really interested in and passionate about. However, it is the people that make it particularly enjoyable – it’s a pleasure to work alongside such an inspiring, diverse group of people. From the moment I joined they have been welcoming and supportive, and I’ve no doubt that the positive culture they’ve instilled is reflected in the quality of research they produce.</p>

</p><h6><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></h6><p><p>I would say the most challenging aspect of my studies currently is the need to learn a lot of new skills very quickly; my thesis requires collection and analysis of fMRI data, which is very new territory for me, and some days I can find it overwhelming. However, I have always enjoyed learning and specifically chose this project to push my boundaries, and I know it’ll be very rewarding when I complete it! Another challenge I’ve found daunting throughout the duration of my Masters is feeling very inexperienced compared to those in my research teams. However, when I’ve felt this way, I’ve tried to reframe the situation positively, and instead use their expertise to my advantage by being inquisitive and learning as much as I can from them.</p></p>

<h6><strong>What are you currently trying to improve?</strong></h6><p><p>As my studies are now focused on my thesis, I am currently trying to develop new skills such as how to use specific software for fMRI data analysis, as well as continuing to improve my critical thinking, literature searching and scientific writing skills. This year I’ve also made a conscious effort to improve my communication skills through taking up opportunities to present at national conferences; this is certainly outside of my comfort zone but I have already gained a lot of confidence from doing so!</p></p>

<h6><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></h6><p><p>In neuroscience, I find myself inspired by women at very different stages of their career. There are numerous world-leading Professors in the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, who have undoubtedly inspired me by showing what’s possible through hard work, dedication and passion. I am also inspired by a PhD student, Millie, that I am currently working alongside for my thesis. She is exceptionally knowledgeable and skilled, but very approachable and supportive – which are all attributes I find inspiring. Finally, I am inspired by my peers; I have a very strong and supportive group of 5 girls from my Masters – they are all exceptionally intelligent, ambitious, supportive and kind women, who I am inspired by and grateful for on a daily basis.</p></p>
<p><p>Outside of neuroscience, I am undoubtedly inspired by the women in my family. I am from a very female-dominant family, full of strong, caring and encouraging women – a reliable network that I am very fortunate to have!</p></p>

<h6><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></h6><p><p>My main goals are to have a career which I enjoy on a day-to-day basis, I find fulfilling and rewarding, has great progression opportunities and allows me to continually learn and expand my knowledge.  </p>

<p>I am currently looking to start my career in the pharmaceutical or healthcare industry in a business-to-business sales or consulting role. I am remaining open minded about doing a PhD or DClinPsy in the future - I am just ready for a break from academia at the moment!</p></p>

<h6><strong>What advice would you give to females at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</strong></h6><p><p>Neuroscience is highly complex. In the early stages, it certainly seems like the more you know, the more you realise you don’t know, which can be daunting. The key to embracing this is to not be afraid of asking questions, no matter how trivial you think they may be. You’re not expected to know everything; those with more experience just appreciate curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Also, grab as many opportunities as possible. Volunteer for neuro research studies and reach out to those whose work you are interested in to see if they can offer you any experience. You’ll be surprised at what you can find yourself simply from being proactive; I’ve found myself helping develop clinical trial protocols, running clinical trials, helping to write papers, receiving an offer to co-author a book and to present research at conferences, just from sending out some emails and having some conversations. Having this experience alongside my studies has been incredible – it has built my CV and helped me figure out where my interests lie within the discipline, which in turn has helped guide my next steps.</p></p>

<h6><strong>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</strong></h6><p><p>Whilst I think the industry is making steps in the right direction, I think there are still aspects of the field which need to be addressed. The cost of tuition remains a significant barrier to entry and there is underrepresentation of groups including women, BAME groups and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is critically important to address as science requires innovation, and innovation requires diversity - different individuals bring different perspectives, which is what progresses scientific research.</p></p>

Such stigma makes it difficult for people to reach out about their experience, even when they may want support. Further, many people who do not have lived experience, but who are concerned about someone who does, want to offer support but are unsure about how to navigate this. The application of a person-centered approach when discussing self-injury can be used to foster more appropriate discussions, which will leave individuals with lived experience feeling more understood and validated. </p><p>Starting a supportive dialogue with a loved one who self-injures can make a big difference in their journey to recovery.

                <p>Since its founding in 1991, arXiv has been growing exponentially &#8211; and in October, we hit a new milestone! arXiv has tracked the number of new submissions we receive every month from our very first submission in August 1991, and we share our monthly submission data on our <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">stats page</a> (which houses lots of interesting break downs of the data).</p>
<p>In the month of October of 2023, there were a total of 20,710 new submissions to arXiv, beating the previous monthly record from May 2023. This past May is when we first broke the 20,000 marker for number of submissions received in a single month. This brings arXiv&#8217;s overall total submission count, from August 1991 to today, to 2,358,545!</p>
<p>The three subjects with the most submissions in October 2023 were computer science, math, and physics &#8211; there were over 15,000 new submissions to arXiv in those subject areas alone.</p>
<p>For those that want to dive into the data, visit <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">https://arxiv.org/stats/main</a>. There you can find arXiv&#8217;s hourly usage rates, monthly submissions, monthly downloads, submissions by subject, and more.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the arXiv users who are taking their research, ideas, and hard work and sharing them openly on arXiv!</p>

It often first occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood—an exciting but often tumultuous time of role transitions and challenging new opportunities such as college and employment. An episode of psychosis can be frightening for those undergoing it, and for their loved ones, and navigating through evaluation, treatment, and recovery can be a stressful and isolating experience. It’s important to spread awareness that with the right support, those experiencing psychosis can take an active, informed role in their care and journey to recovery. </p><p>Learn more about the symptoms, stages, and treatments for psychosis in the infographic adapted from <em>The First Episode of Psychosis</em>, which supports young people and their families experiencing the initial episode of psychosis.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="650" height="973" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-First-Episode-of-Psychosis-infographic.jpg" /></figure></div><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/809413937/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/809413937/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f11%2fThe-First-Episode-of-Psychosis-OUPBlog-featured-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/809413937/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/11/understanding-depersonalization-and-derealization-disorder-infographic/">Understanding Depersonalization and Derealization Disorder [infographic]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/10/infrastructure-public-policy-and-the-anthropocene-podcast/">Infrastructure, public policy, and the Anthropocene [podcast]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/11/how-little-we-can-know-about-the-history-of-the-english-language/">How little we (can) know about the history of the English language</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/singh_soudamani.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="202" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/singh_soudamani.jpg?resize=150%2C202&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127422" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Soudamani Singh</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A researcher who sued the publisher PLOS to prevent it from posting an expression of concern for one of her papers has dropped her suit, and the publisher tells us it will add a correction to the article instead – but may “revisit this case” to deal with “unresolved issues.”</p>



<p>We’ve previously reported on the lawsuit <a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/singh-soudamani/">Soudamani Singh</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W. Va., <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/scientist-sues-publisher-to-block-expression-of-concern/">filed against PLOS</a> in April, as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/23/plos-and-scientist-appear-close-to-settling-lawsuit-over-expression-of-concern/">signs of a pending settlement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/S.D.W.Va_._3_23-cv-00317_7_0.pdf">order</a> filed November 2, Singh informed the court that she “voluntarily dismisses” the claims in her complaint, without the possibility of re-filing them, and the judge dismissed the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Singh-complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, Singh alleged that PLOS planned to place an expression of concern on one of her papers, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203552">Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the inhibition of Na-glutamine co-transporter B0AT1 in rabbit villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation</a>,” published in PLOS ONE in September 2018, after she and her co-authors had requested a correction of a duplicated image. The paper has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, but not since April 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128187"></span>



<p>A <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions/#comment-2111182">comment</a> left last June 14 on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions">one of our posts</a> had identified a duplicated image in the paper, but the corresponding author told us he and his coauthors had noticed the “accidental error” independently and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/07/med-school-vice-dean-says-hes-correcting-paper-amid-negative-misconduct-inquiry/">asked the journal for a correction</a>. PLOS spokesperson David Knutson previously told us the authors contacted the publisher on June 17.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh argued an expression of concern on the paper would imply “a certain level of intentional misconduct (i.e. plagiarism, falsifying data, etc.) or that something otherwise nefarious has occurred with an article,” and would be inappropriate.</p>



<p>PLOS’s <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/corrections-expressions-of-concern-and-retractions">guidelines</a> for publishing expressions of concern do not mention misconduct, but state they are “notices published at editors’ discretion to alert readers of serious concerns about published work or an article’s compliance with PLOS policies (e.g. Data Availability).”</p>



<p>Singh asked for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction to stop PLOS from publishing the expression of concern, as well as damages and legal fees. Her lawyer did not respond to our request for comment on the resolution of the case.</p>



<p>Knutson told us PLOS could not disclose terms of the settlement without Singh’s consent due to a confidentiality agreement. But he did tell us the publisher would add a correction to the article, “which achieves our editorial objective of providing key updates to the article’s readers.” He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We initially considered an Expression of Concern for this case due to unresolved concerns. After careful consideration we decided that there is sufficient support for the article’s results to allow us to publish a Correction at this time, even though some data concerns have not yet been resolved (as is described in the forthcoming Correction). It is unclear if the data concerns can be resolved and/or how long this would require; with this Correction decision, we prioritized timely resolution of the current case and transparent disclosure of the resolved and unresolved issues to readers. That said, we may revisit this case in the future depending on what comes of the pending data concern issue.</p>



<p>As a side note, PLOS has a policy and process in place by which our Publication Ethics team handles appeals of post-publication decisions. It is not necessary to involve legal representatives: authors’ appeals are considered as long as they are submitted in accordance with our policy, and filing a lawsuit only tends to delay case resolution and detract vital resources from other work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/25/judge-denies-motion-by-researcher-to-quash-diabetes-expressions-of-concern/">previous case</a>, diabetes researcher Mario Saad sued a journal publisher to block expressions of concern on his work, but a U.S. federal judge denied the request for a restraining order and injunction because, as one legal <a href="https://www.popehat.com/2015/02/26/dr-mario-j-a-saad-tries-and-fails-to-censor-american-diabetes-association/">commentator explained</a>, the First Amendment does not allow courts to prohibit speech ahead of time.&nbsp;Saad, who is now up to <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSaad%252c%2bMario%2bJose%2bAbdalla">19 retractions</a>, recently had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/27/history-repeats-itself-diabetes-researcher-gets-four-expressions-of-concern-in-journal-he-once-sued/">four more expressions of concern</a> from the same journal.</p>

<p>A research biologist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago faked images and inflated sample sizes in published papers and a grant application, the federal agency has determined.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://bme.uic.edu/profiles/hee-jeong-im-sampen/">Hee-Jeong Im Sampen</a>, also a research professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Illinois, Chicago, “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally, knowingly and/or recklessly falsifying/fabricating data” in three published papers, an unpublished manuscript, a poster presentation, and a grant application for VA funding, according to a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-24342/findings-of-research-misconduct">Federal Register notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampen, who publishes under the name Hee-Jeong Im, is corresponding author on all of the published papers the VA identified. The articles, which also list an affiliation with Rush University Medical Center, are:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Hee-Jeong+Im">PubPeer commenters</a> have pointed out questionable images in Sampen’s work as far back as 2015, but none of the papers in the VA’s findings seem to have attracted attention on the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampen did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but told us she would comment this coming Monday. [See an update <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/06/a-travesty-a-researcher-found-guilty-of-misconduct-by-federal-u-s-government-responds/">here</a>.] According to the VA’s announcement, she appealed the findings, but the VA’s Under Secretary for Health upheld them in an April decision. </p>



<p>As “corrective actions,” the VA has requested retractions of the three papers and permanently banned Sampen from conducting agency research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-jet-stream-jupiter-space">JWST spotted a new speedy jet stream in Jupiter’s atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>New beauty shots of Jupiter, captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, reveal a speedy jet stream encircling the equator at an altitude never imaged before.</p>



<p>Researchers have known about Jovian jet streams since Voyager spacecraft flew by in 1979. Those relatively stable winds occur near the planet’s main cloud decks, in the troposphere. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02099-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly spotted jet</a> lies 20 to 40 kilometers above, in the stratosphere, and moves at about 500 kilometers per hour, or roughly twice as fast as the jets below, astrophysicist Ricardo Hueso and colleagues report October 19 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“We were not expecting to find these strange motions in the equatorial atmosphere,” says Hueso, of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain. There is no theory that predicts a change in the winds at this altitude on Jupiter, he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear yet what causes the speedy jet. “If you have very intense motions, you need energy to produce those motions,” Hueso says. This energy could come from storms below the jet. It may also be linked to happenings higher in the troposphere, where scientists have observed a band where temperature and wind intensity oscillate over four or so years. Similar cycles over the equator also occur on Saturn and Earth.</p>



<p>Earlier observations of Jupiter hadn’t been able to image this part of the stratosphere. Its altitude lies below what ground-based telescopes on Earth glimpse and above what the Hubble Space Telescope captures. But using special infrared filters, JWST was able to peek into this mysterious region.</p>



<p>“Here they have this missing piece of the puzzle for the first time in this latitudinal range around the equator,” says Thibault Cavalié, a planetary scientist at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France.</p>



<p>The high-resolution images are “stunning,” says Liming Li, a planetary scientist at the University of Houston, also not involved with the study. The researchers used two snapshots of Jupiter taken 10 hours apart. Based on how atmospheric features shifted in that time, the team clocked the stream’s speed.</p>

<p>Future observations of this jet and others could help untangle the tricky physics occurring at planets’ equators, Hueso says. In swiftly turning planets, such as Earth and Jupiter, Coriolis forces steer atmospheric currents to their right in the northern hemisphere and to their left in the south. But at the equator, where there are no Coriolis forces, different factors are at play. With more investigation, researchers hope to refine the equations used to describe the atmosphere around the equator.</p>



<p>“We understand the physics of other latitudes because it’s the same physics that occurs in the atmosphere of the Earth,” Hueso says. But at the equator, “we don&#8217;t understand it on the Earth at the level that we would like, and we don&#8217;t understand it on Jupiter.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of February 2023, I discovered that the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems</em> (<em>SJIS</em>) had been hijacked. As editor-in-chief of the publication, I had been contacted by an author confused by receiving both an acceptance letter and a desk rejection for her manuscript. I had rejected the paper because it did not align with our editorial policy. Upon investigation, the acceptance letter turned out to have been issued by cybercriminals attempting to charge her for publication in what she thought was <em>SJIS</em> but was in fact a fraudulent website posing as the journal.</p>



<p>Journal hijacking is a growing problem and a threat to the entire scientific community. Hijacked journals are scam websites that impersonate legitimate journals and attempt to take over their brand. A list including hundreds of these fake sites can be found at the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>. By stealing the brand, web domain, or the serial number used to identify a publication, cybercriminals try to lure researchers into paying for publications. The problem is in part attributable to increased pressure on researchers to publish their work in journals indexed in Scopus, Elsevier’s abstract and citation database.</p>



<p>Researchers of all experience levels fall prey to such scams. This susceptibility often stems from the tendency to be off guard when communicating with seemingly authentic and trustworthy academic journals, particularly when links to these journals are found on otherwise credible bibliographical databases.</p>



<p>In the case that led to the discovery of the <em>SJIS </em>hijacking, the researcher who was swindled described the experience as harrowing, making her question whom she could trust. She also ran into trouble at her university, which required her to have two publications in Scopus-indexed journals to advance her career.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128175"></span>



<p>Her inquiry triggered a thorough investigation on my part. Over the subsequent weeks, I found that several authors had been scammed by the same criminals and that the scams followed the same pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source of the problems in all cases was Scopus, which linked to the fraudulent website (http://sjisscandinavian-iris.com/index.php/sjis) instead of the real one (<a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/sjis/">https://aisel.aisnet.org/sjis/</a>). Searching for indexed journals, victims were led straight to the fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fake website also appeared in online searches. Both Google and Bing included it among their top results.</p>



<p>Although it appears&nbsp; the cybercriminals could easily infiltrate Scopus and search engines, removing the link to the fraudulent website has been much more challenging. Scopus took more than two months to delete the link, and it still appears in online searches despite my having reported it to the tech companies as a phishing scam on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>The authors I talked to said they had been deceived into paying the scammers up to $375 for a worthless publication. They also reported emotional distress and fear of reputational damage from unwittingly publishing in a hijacked journal. In one case, a PhD student’s defense was delayed because a central paper was not published in <em>SJIS </em>as she had believed.</p>



<p>The cybercriminals have gone to great lengths to make the fraudulent website appear legitimate. Having downloaded <em>SJIS</em>’ entire open-access catalog, they have added their own fabricated articles to different issues. They have also engaged in Google Scholar search engine optimization to lead more unsuspecting researchers to their site. And they have fabricated articles by previous contributors to the journal that show up in searches. When researchers click on links to what they believe are legitimate <em>SJIS </em>articles, the fraudulent website gets more traffic. The harm to the reputations of these authors raises concerns for their long-term career prospects.</p>



<p>My experience, which I have also described in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/isj.12481">an article</a> in the <em>Information Systems Journal</em>, is that this type of cybercrime is difficult to stop. I have reported the journal hijacking to our professional association for scholars of information systems. In turn, the association has reported the crime to the domain registrar of the fraudulent website, resulting in the domain being transferred to an unknown registrar. Although we have reported the hijacking to various companies and authorities, including Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Internet Crime Complaint Center, and the hosting provider, the fake site remains operational.</p>



<p>Presently, no effective legal means exist for dealing with journal hijacking. I, for one, am open to unorthodox methods to shut down these operations, including hacking and disclosing the identities of the criminals. Until effective solutions to this growing problem emerge, education and awareness are vital. We are all potential victims of this scam.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jedi-rats-move-digital-object-using-brain">In a Jedi-like feat, rats can move a digital object using just their brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like tiny, hairy Yodas raising X-wings from a swamp, rats can lift digital cubes and drop them near a target. But these rats aren’t using the Force. Instead, they are using their imagination.</p>



<p>This<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh5206" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> telekinetic trick,</a> described in the Nov. 3 <em>Science</em>, provides hints about how brains imagine new scenarios and remember past ones.</p>



<p>“This is fantastic research,” says Mayank Mehta, a neurophysicist at UCLA. “It opens up a lot of exciting possibilities.” A deeper scientific understanding of the brain area involved in the feat could, for instance, help researchers diagnose and treat memory disorders, he says.</p>





<p>Neuroscientist Albert Lee and his colleagues study how brains can go back in time by revisiting memories and jump ahead to imagine future scenarios. Those processes, sometimes called “mental time travel,” are “part of what makes our inner mental lives quite rich and interesting,” says Lee, who did the new study while at Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va.</p>



<p>To dip into these complex questions, the researchers began with a simpler one: “Can you be in one place and think about another place?” says Lee, who is now an HHMI investigator at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “The rat isn’t doing anything fancier than that. We’re not asking them to recall their summer vacation.”</p>



<p>Neuroscientist and engineer Chongxi Lai, also now at Beth Israel Deaconess, Lee and colleagues trained rats to move on a spherical treadmill in the midst of a 3-D virtual world projected onto a surrounding screen. While the rats poked around their virtual world, electrodes recorded signals from nerve cells in the rats’ hippocampi, brain structures known to hold complex <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscientists-garner-nobel-discovering-brains-inner-gps">spatial information</a>, among other things (<em>SN: 10/6/14</em>). In this way, researchers matched patterns of brain activity with spots in the virtual world.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers wanted to know if the rats could imagine their way through the world. The animals were trained to mentally move a virtual cube to a twisty column, using only brain activity patterns in the hippocampus. If the rodents Jedied the cube correctly, they’d get a reward of water. In this experiment, the virtual reality world was controlled by the rats’ brains; the rats’ physical movements on the treadmill no longer mattered.</p>



<p>After some training, the furry apprentices mastered the task, their brain activity showed. By activating the right pattern of cells in their hippocampi, the rats could concentrate and hold the cube near the twisty column for several seconds. In another task, the rats mentally teleported through the virtual world to reach the twisty column.</p>

<p>The results are “strong evidence that rats can use imagination to perform novel, artificial tasks,” says neuroscientist Daoyun Ji of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who wasn’t involved in the new study. And it’s not just rats. “It is likely we humans imagine by activating hippocampal memories too,” he says.</p>



<p>The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure deep on each side of the brain, is very complex, and still quite mysterious, Mehta says. His work and others have shown that cells there are influenced by all sorts of things, beyond abstract spatial locations. “There is clearly a lot to be considered,” Mehta says.<br><br>Electrodes implanted in different parts of the human brain have allowed people to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paralyzed-people-implants-brain-computer-interface-tablets">control computers</a> and robotic limbs, for instance (<em>SN: 11/21/18</em>). Devices that incorporate neural signals from the hippocampus might one day allow more abstract jobs, Lee says. Compared with rats, he says, “humans can probably control their hippocampus for longer durations with a larger repertoire, and the concepts being encoded in the brain are probably much more complex.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>The publisher Sage has retracted 209 articles from an engineering journal after an investigation found “compromised peer review or 3rd party involvement,” according to a company spokesperson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions, all from the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/ijea/60/1_suppl"><em>International Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Education</em></a>, stem from an investigation that led Sage to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/15/journal-retracts-122-papers-at-once/">retract 122 papers</a> – as well as fire the editor-in-chief and purge the editorial board – in December 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, the company marked 318 additional papers “with more complex issues” with expressions of concern as it continued investigating. All of the papers retracted today previously had expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 209 articles were retracted with five different notices. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197934">Some articles</a> “contain indicators of third-party involvement” and the corresponding authors “were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation,” one read. </p>



<span id="more-128171"></span>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197937">Others</a> “had been accepted as a result of a peer-review process that did not meet the standards and expectations at Sage” and a post-publication peer review “highlighted fundamental concerns within the articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For another <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197938">batch</a> with compromised peer review, the corresponding authors asked Sage to retract their articles after the publisher contacted them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice for a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197948">fourth grouping</a> of articles stated that the corresponding authors did not respond to Sage’s attempts to contact them, and:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Due to concerns around unauthorised third party involvement, overall questions about the integrity of the research and authenticity of the author byline, Sage retracts these articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0020720920984005">An attribute studentized fuzzy interval-valued chart based on normalized transformation</a>,” had its own retraction <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197949">notice</a>, which stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-imaging-uncovers-fossils-artifacts">How neutron imaging uncovers hidden secrets of fossils and artifacts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shattered crocodile. Formally, <em>Confractosuchus</em>. It was discovered in Australia when a bulldozer clearing a boulder broke a stone into pieces. Exposed portions of the broken-up rock made clear that fossils were inside, but there was no immediate sign that this discovery would later reveal an unprecedented snapshot of life from the Cretaceous Period.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Matt White of the University of New England in Armidale, Australia, and colleagues arranged to have the fossil-laden rock scanned with X-ray computed tomography. Like a medical CT&nbsp;scan, the method takes multiple images of an object that can be assembled into a 3-D map of the interior. The team hoped to use the scans as guides to isolate individual bones in the fossil without removing them, then manipulate the 3-D images to virtually put the shattered croc back together.</p>





<p>But one section of the fossil puzzle gave them trouble. Iron-rich stone surrounding the bones made it difficult to get good X-ray images. So the researchers decided to try another approach.</p>



<p>They sent the mystery chunk to chemist Joseph Bevitt of the <a href="https://www.ansto.gov.au/facilities/australian-centre-for-neutron-scattering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering</a> in Sydney, who specializes in using subatomic neutron particles to image ancient objects. Along with the expected croc bones, Bevitt discovered one that looked like a dinosaur leg bone. It was in the portion of rock where the crocodile’s stomach cavity would have been.</p>



<p>“When I saw the neutron result and the little dino femur, I was shaking with shock,” Bevitt says, “both in awe and doubt with what we had seen.”</p>



<p>Years of analysis plus more X-ray and neutron scanning eventually confirmed that the remains of a previously unknown species of dinosaur, bitten into chunks and scored with tooth marks, were in the croc’s belly. The finding earned the shattered crocodile the second half of its name: <em>sauroktonos</em>, for lizard killer. White, Bevitt and colleagues published their discovery of both the newly identified species of crocodile and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crocodile-ancestor-ate-dinosaur-fossil-stomach">the never-before-seen dinosaur inside</a> last year <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X22000338?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in <em>Gondwana Research</em></a><em> </em>(<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 5</em>).</p>

<p>It’s a stunning discovery: <em>Confractosuchus sauroktonos</em>, the shattered crocodile lizard killer, and the remains of its last meal, its dinosaur victim, frozen in stone 100 million years ago. It’s a vignette that may never have come to light if not for neutron tomography. Although neutrons have been used for imaging in industrial and military applications since shortly after the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">neutron was discovered in 1932</a>, it’s only in the last few decades that these subatomic particles have begun to provide scientists with unprecedented views inside fossils and antiquities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Look, don’t touch</h4>



<p>There was a time when studying fossils and artifacts often meant damaging or destroying them. Mummified remains were dissected. Sealed containers were cracked open. Fossils were pried loose from rock. In some cases, fossil-containing samples were ground down, layer by layer, to create images of sequential portions in slices that revealed the fossilized structures inside.</p>



<p>Fortunately, X-rays offer nondestructive insights. As a high-energy form of electromagnetic radiation, or light, X-rays interact with the electric and magnetic fields associated with electrically charged particles. In a doctor’s office, when a technician shines a beam of X-rays at a broken leg, the light gets scattered or absorbed by the fields of the electrons around atoms in the leg. The denser a material is, the more electrons are packed in it, and the less effectively X-rays can pass through. That’s why higher-density portions of the body — like bones — stand out in X-ray images more than lower-density portions. Skin, muscle and other soft tissues are essentially invisible because X-rays pass straight through.</p>





<p>X-rays have provided views into the hidden interiors of artifacts since the radiation was discovered in 1895. But after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">computationally intensive X-ray CT was developed</a> in the 1970s, it became the standard approach to studying objects in paleontology and archaeology (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44</em>). X-ray CT scanning is now the modern-day alternative to the grinding that 19th century scientists often relied on. Recent examples include scans of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">mummified animals from ancient Egypt</a> (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p. 17</em>); newly uncovered inscriptions on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crusty-old-computer-new-imaging-techniques-reveal-construction-ancient-marvel">2,000-year-old Antikythera mechanism</a>, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator used to predict eclipses and other celestial events (<em>SN: 12/2/06, p. 357</em>); and a study of the brain cavity in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-fossil-suggests-primate-brain-areas-evolved-separately">20-million-year-old monkey skull</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/19, p. 11</em>). Many large museums and research institutions have their own X-ray CT scanners on hand that are essentially the same systems that doctors use.</p>



<p>For all that X-ray imaging has revealed about the past, though, it still has some drawbacks. X-rays can’t penetrate a particularly dense material, like lead or thick layers of other metals, to see an object hidden inside. On the flip side, an object made of low-density material, such as soft tissue, will be invisible to X-rays.</p>



<p>Neutrons can fill in the picture.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The difference is in the scattering</h4>



<p>Neutrons, as their name implies, are neutral. These subatomic particles have no electric charge, so neutron beams don’t notice the electrons in orbit around atoms. Instead, neutrons pass right by electrons and hit nuclei packed with protons and neutrons at the centers of atoms. Incoming neutrons can bounce off an atom’s nucleus or be absorbed into the atom. The interactions are more complicated than with X-rays and depend on how fast the neutrons are moving and on complex quantum mechanical interactions.</p>



<p>Neutrons suitable for tomography are produced with comparatively massive particle accelerators or as by-products from nuclear reactors. The neutrons are relatively slow moving, with energies one-hundred-millionth those of X-rays in CT scanners. These slow neutrons interact strongly with some low-density materials that X-rays pass through blithely, including lithium, boron and hydrogen.</p>



<p>“Water to neutrons is like lead for X-rays,” because of the hydrogen atoms, Bevitt says. Too much hydrogen-rich material can hide details from neutron beams. But in the same way that a metal hip joint stands out in a medical X-ray, hydrogen can also make some features visible in neutron images. Lead, iron and copper, on the other hand, are essentially transparent to low-energy neutrons.</p>

<p>Physicist Jacob LaManna of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., likes to demonstrate the comparative capabilities of neutron and X-ray imaging with a CT “still life” of Asiatic lilies tucked inside a hollow cask with thick lead walls. “The neutrons can go right through the lead, and then you can see basically all the water [in the] vascular structure of the flowers,” LaManna says. An X-ray scan would show nothing but the opaque outer surface of the cask.</p>



<p>The ability to glide through dense materials that block X-rays has made neutron imaging an important technology for industrial testing of automobiles and planes. The particles can reveal the flow of hydrogen-rich oil inside engine blocks or expose flaws in metal castings. Since the 1970s, U.S. national laboratories have relied on neutron imaging to develop and maintain the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpiles; the neutrons are powerful quality-control tools for mapping out the insides of dense bomb parts and for studying hydrogen-rich fusion explosives inside warhead components.</p>



<p>At NIST, LaManna leads the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/imaging-advanced-neutron-imaging-facility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neutron and X-ray Tomography, or NeXT, facility</a>, which can simultaneously run X-ray and neutron imaging. The dual views provide distinct yet complementary information about things that contain combinations of materials — like hydrogen fuel cells, building materials and soil samples — that would be difficult to study with only one or the other imaging approach.</p>



<p>Over the last couple decades, as word has spread about the capabilities, a growing number of paleontologists, archaeologists and anthropologists have added neutron imaging to their analytical toolboxes. Despite neutron imaging being around for a while, “we are really the new kids on the block,” Bevitt says.</p>



<p>In addition to revealing multiple dinosaur bones in the belly of a shattered crocodile, along with the femur that initially caught Bevitt’s eye, neutron computed tomography has allowed researchers to study <a href="https://www.mrforum.com/wp-content/uploads/open_access/9781644900574/39.pdf?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fabric swaddling cat mummies</a> without unwrapping them, find signs of recently applied glues holding together fraudulently assembled artifacts, and uncover <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most ancient vertebrate heart ever found</a>, in a 380-million-year-old fish.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rewards and risks</h4>



<p>Paleontologist James Clark places a pair of fossilized crocodile skulls on the table in his basement lab at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The 165-million-year-old fossils are dwarfed by a nearby modern alligator skull. While the alligator skull is about as long as my forearm, the fossilized croc skulls are only slightly bigger than my thumb tip.</p>



<p>The fragile skulls, which Clark collected in Mexico four decades ago, are embedded in hardened blobs of sediment with just a few bones and teeth peeking through. At first glance, the specimens resemble wads of chewed gum, but made of gritty, iron-rich mudstone. “If you try to X-ray that, you basically end up with … these bright sparkles from all the iron,” Clark says. The result is blurring and streaking that hide the skeletal structures.</p>



<p>Clark could have hired preparers to clean away the sediment surrounding the delicate bones. But it’s a slow and expensive process that can end up damaging the specimen, he says.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until 2019 that he finally got a good look at the hidden bones. After a seminar where he met Bevitt, Clark realized that neutron scanning could be the answer. The event led to an introduction to LaManna and the NIST facility 25 kilometers up the road in Maryland.</p>

<p>Because iron is essentially transparent to neutrons, LaManna says, “it’s much easier to basically isolate just the fossil portion of the object.” Images from the NIST neutron CT scans revealed the intricate details of the tiny bones. “You can then start playing digital jigsaw puzzles with the bone fragments to try to reconstruct the particular creature.”</p>



<p>While the material around a fossil or object may present a problem for X-rays, sometimes it’s the object itself that’s the issue. Tissues, fibers, wood and other low-density materials can be difficult to resolve with X-rays, and metals within an object can block other features from view. Both challenges plague researchers studying antiquities like the 3,000-year-old dagger-axes that I saw on display in the Smithsonian’s Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>These ceremonial weapons from China’s Shang dynasty are suspended in a vertical glass case, where I could get my nose just a few centimeters from the jade blades and turquoise-encrusted bronze handles. I found it was best to lean up close so that I could appreciate the intricate blue-green patterns of gemstones sunk into the metal.</p>

<p>Smithsonian art conservator Ariel O’Connor would love to know how the dagger-axes were put together. X-ray CT doesn’t work on the combination of stone, metal, fibers and other materials that may be within. Neutron imaging could help, but it comes with a risk. Neutron beams make things radioactive. It’s not always clear in advance how radioactive a sample will become, but materials often exceed the level of radioactivity that’s safe for humans to handle, or even view in a museum, for days to weeks after exposure to neutron beams.</p>



<p>“We could actually do calculations and determine what’s going to be the problematic element and how long would it be radioactive and how much,” LaManna says. “[But,] in the case of the jade, where it’s material basically just completely dug up from the ground, it can have all sorts of stuff in it that you might not necessarily expect.” That makes residual radioactivity difficult to predict.</p>



<p>So, O’Connor decided to do a test. She and colleagues made a crude replica of an ancient dagger-ax. They used jade from Wyoming in lieu of the ancient Chinese jade, stacks of brass from a repurposed door kickplate to simulate the bronze handle, and some silk thread similar to the type that holds some Shang dynasty dagger-axes together. Then <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaManna scanned the dagger with X-rays and neutrons</a> at NIST.</p>



<p>As expected, the brass was entirely opaque to the X-rays, hiding features of the replica’s construction. But the neutron beam revealed key details, including a view of the jade inserted inside the brass handle and even individual silk threads.</p>

<p>To test how neutron imaging might work on a dagger-axe, researchers made a replica from jade, stacks of brass plates and silk thread. In an X-ray of the replica (above), the shaft is obscured by brass, so the team used neutron scanning to image the portion outlined in yellow. That imaging (below) revealed details not visible in the X-ray scans.</p>

<p>As for residual radioactivity, the replica showed none of any significance nine days later. In general, Bevitt says, residual radiation dies down quickly. One fossil he studied remained radioactive for three months, due to the presence of radium, but most samples are safe to send back to labs and museums within a few weeks or less.</p>



<p>Still, with that uncertainty and questions about how chemically similar the replica is to the real dagger-axes, O’Connor is not yet ready to risk scanning the artifacts.</p>



<p>“As a conservator, I am entrusted with the preservation and safety of these remarkable 3,000-year-old objects to ensure they remain for future generations. If an analytical technique such as neutron imaging might answer our research questions but would alter the objects and prevent them from being accessible” due to induced radioactivity, O’Connor says, “we will look for other options.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opening a new window to the past</h4>



<p>Despite the increasing popularity of neutron tomography for studying fossils and antiquities, X-ray CT remains the go-to imaging choice for most researchers. In the 1990s, a few dozen scholarly papers on using neutrons to study the past were published annually; recently, it’s been hundreds per year. Publications related to imaging fossils and artifacts with X-ray CT, though, number in the thousands every year.</p>



<p>Most of the time, X-rays suffice, and the advantages are clear. They offer high resolution to uncover small details with no lingering radioactivity. X-ray CT machines are also widely available because they’ve been used in medical settings for over 50 years, and they’re small enough to fit in most labs and museum research spaces.</p>



<p>At the moment, there are <a href="https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/accelerators/Pages/Interactive-Map-of-NB-Instruments.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a few dozen neutron tomography facilities on the planet</a>. The particle accelerators and nuclear reactors that produce suitable neutrons are large, expensive and heavily regulated. Only a handful of the facilities worldwide are available to analyze fossils and antiquities, according to Burkhard Schillinger, a physicist at the Technical University Munich who runs the neutron imaging beamline there. He ticks off a few facilities in the United States, a half dozen in Europe and one in Australia.</p>



<p>Still, LaManna says the lack of access doesn’t seem to be the bottleneck in widespread adoption of the technique. Along with the concerns over lingering radioactivity, the novelty of the technology and general lack of awareness may stand in the way.</p>



<p>“I try to recruit as broad a range of users as I can” to submit fossils and antiquities for imaging at NIST, LaManna says. “It’s not like they’re getting pushed out of the way” to make space for more conventional neutron studies. “It’s just more of getting the correct people interested to then write proposals, come to us [and] work with us to get beam time.”</p>



<p>In the last decade, Australia-based Bevitt has spread the word on neutron tomography through lectures and outreach around the world. Most of the experts contacted for this story trace their initial interest in neutron imaging to Bevitt’s influence. Many researchers in his home country have already embraced the technology.</p>



<p>“Basically, in Australia, when a new dinosaur is discovered,” Bevitt says, “the first thing that happens is it comes to our lab.”</p>

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. </p><p>Learn more about the symptoms of DDD in the infographic adapted from the second edition of <em>Feeling Unreal</em> by Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="650" height="1625" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Feeling-Unreal-infographic-.jpg" /></figure></div><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/806553335/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/806553335/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f11%2fFeeling-Unreal-OUPBlog-featured-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/806553335/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/10/infrastructure-public-policy-and-the-anthropocene-podcast/">Infrastructure, public policy, and the Anthropocene [podcast]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/10/when-fame-is-not-enough-margaret-walker-and-the-twentieth-century-south/">When fame is not enough: Margaret Walker and the twentieth-century South</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/10/science-in-the-time-of-war-voices-from-ukraine/">Science in the time of war: voices from Ukraine</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>The director of one the nation’s premier cancer centers has been suspended amid concerns over several of his papers – but he tells Retraction Watch it is unrelated to comments about that work on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email Wednesday to employees at New York University’s medical center – and a subsequent message to staff at the institution’s Perlmutter Cancer Center – explained that Benjamin Neel, the former director of the center, had been suspended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter, signed by Steven Abramson, a rheumatologist and executive vice president at NYU Langone Health, did not state the reason for the move:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128165"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dear Perlmutter Cancer Center Staff,</p>



<p>I’m writing to inform you that, effective immediately, Benjamin Neel, MD, PhD, has been suspended from his role as director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center.</p>



<p>Jeffrey S. Weber, MD, PhD, deputy director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center and Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Professor of Oncology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, will serve as interim director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center.</p>



<p>Thank you to Dr. Weber for stepping into this interim role.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Several of Neel’s papers have been the subject of <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=benjamin+neel">scrutiny on PubPeer</a> dating back more than eight years. Commenters have pointed out issues with figures in the articles, complaints to which Neel frequently responded. None of the articles has yet been retracted.  </p>



<p>Neel told us that the suspension has nothing to do with PubPeer but that he could not comment further.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-formed-moon-earth-mantle">Rock from the impact that formed the moon may linger in Earth’s mantle</a></h4>

              
                <p>About 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-sized object smashed into the young Earth, spraying debris that coalesced to form the moon, many scientists think. Some remnants of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06589-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that object, called Theia, exist today</a> as large amounts of dense material sitting atop Earth’s core, researchers propose November 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>In recent years, geophysicists have discovered continent-sized zones of rock at the base of Earth’s mantle where seismic waves travel abnormally slowly, suggesting the rock there is denser than the rest of the mantle rock. One of these blobs, known as large low-velocity provinces, lies beneath Africa. The other lies half a world away beneath the Pacific Ocean, says Qian Yuan, a planetary geodynamicist at Caltech.</p>





<p>Some researchers have suggested these masses are the remnants of tectonic plates that were shoved beneath others and then sunk down to the boundary between Earth’s outer core and the overlying mantle. But Yuan and his colleagues offer a different origin story.</p>



<p>The moon is only about 2 percent the mass of Earth, which leaves a substantial amount of Theia unaccounted for. So, using supercomputer simulations, the researchers tracked the fallout from a smashup between the nascent Earth and another object about 10 percent as massive.</p>



<p>In the simulations, each body before the collision had a dense iron core swaddled by a mantle of lighter rocks. Each object was digitally subdivided into particles about 10 kilometers across, so that the postimpact fragments could be tracked, says study coauthor Vincent Eke, a computational physicist at Durham University in England. In all, the team’s simulations tracked about 100 million particles, he notes.</p>



<p>The simulations suggest that a large part of Theia’s core — equivalent to about 3 percent of Earth’s mass today — was left on our planet. Soon after the collision, that dense molten material would have sunk to join Earth’s core. Meanwhile, a large volume of Theia’s mantle, up to 5 percent of Earth’s mass, was embedded in the uppermost 1,400 kilometers or so of Earth’s mantle, the study finds.</p>

<p>Moon rocks suggest that Theia’s mantle contained higher proportions of iron oxide minerals. That means it was probably a few percent denser than Earth’s mantle, Yuan says. Over the few tens of millions of years that followed the collision, that denser-than-average material slowly sank to accumulate and form the large low-velocity provinces, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Although many researchers have suggested that these low-velocity provinces are the remnants of tectonic plates, others have proposed that they’re high-density remnants of Earth’s original magma ocean that sank to the lowermost levels of Earth’s mantle. Attributing them to material left in the wake of the collision between Theia and the nascent Earth “is a new idea, I think,” says Paul Tackley, a geodynamicist at ETH Zurich who was not part of the new study.</p>



<p>Whether or not a run-in with Theia is what created the low-velocity provinces, it’s at least plausible that they’ve lasted the nearly 4.5 billion years since the moon’s formation, Tackley says. If the materials in those zones are dense enough to resist mixing with the overlying mantle as it slowly flows across them, he says, “they can survive over geological time.”</p>



<p>Known as the “giant impact hypothesis,” a collision between Earth and a protoplanet remains the leading theory of how the moon formed. Previously, researchers have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moons-origins-revealed-rocks-chemistry">such a collision</a> would help explain the slight chemical differences between moon rocks and Earth’s (<em>SN: 6/5/14</em>). And scientists recently proposed that a collision between the nascent Earth and Theia, besides creating our planet’s moon, also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-planet-collision-earth-plate-tectonics">may have jump-started plate tectonics</a> (<em>SN: 3/15/23</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/faking-death-female-frogs-mate-male">Faking death lets some female frogs slip the mating grip of a male</a></h4>

              
                <p>Grab fast and hang on for hours. A fierce grip is all the courtship finesse a male frog needs in species that reproduce in frenzied mobs.</p>



<p>Female European common frogs, however, have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.230742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least three moves that give them a chance</a> of escaping overbearing male grasps, say evolutionary behavioral ecologist Carolin Dittrich and curator of herpetology Mark-Oliver Rödel of the Berlin Natural History Museum. The pair describe those tactics October 11 in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>.</p>





<p>With hundreds of Europe’s <em>Rana temporaria</em> frogs gathering at a natural pool, “it can look quite like a mess,” says Dittrich, now at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. And dangerous. Females can drown.</p>



<p>Two, three or more males can clamp onto the same female, creating a tight tangle of frogs called a mating ball. Frogs don’t do internal fertilization, so males hold tight and squirm for a good position for releasing sperm onto eggs put into the water by females. Males of this species typically hold their collective grip on a female for several hours, Dittrich says, but “we know from the literature it can last up to two days.”</p>



<p>Dittrich started wondering about female defenses during an “Oh no!” moment when reviewing video she had captured of European common frogs mating in a lab setup. She had wanted to see if the males show any size preference in the females they target. (Sizewise “not choosy at all,” she reports now. “They grab what they can.”) In the mating videos, however, Dittrich noticed something more interesting.</p>



<p>During filming, she had left the room so her presence wouldn’t somehow disturb the frogs. Afterward, working her way through analyzing all the videos, she was startled. “There can’t be a dead female in this box!” Dittrich remembers thinking. Surely, she would have noticed.</p>



<p>The male in that video had clasped a large female, clearly alive, who then apparently died in his embrace. Her legs stretched out in dead-frog abandon. He let go and pursued the other female in the box. After about two minutes, however, the “dead” female revived and started moving again. Dittrich now proposes that looking dead — or the term she prefers, “tonic immobility” — could let a female escape a male’s grasp.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As seen in this lab tub setup, suddenly looking dead can free a female frog from a male’s intense embrace in the just-grab-her mass mating frenzies among European common frogs (<em>Rana temporaria</em>).  </figcaption></figure>



<p>Intentionally playing dead would be hard to prove, and even to observe, in frogs’ competitive scrambles, says wildlife ecologist Brandon Güell of Florida International University in Miami. When female frogs go limp, “sometimes that’s the first step of drowning and dying because they’re probably exhausted — or they’re playing dead.”</p>



<p>A limp female eventually reviving could be easily overlooked in the chaos, he says. He may have caught a glimpse in his own field work in Costa Rica. In a wild mating scramble of Central American milk frogs (<em>Trachycephalus</em> “<em>vermiculatus</em>”), a female just <a href="https://journals.ku.edu/reptilesandamphibians/article/view/18452/17486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped moving while still alive</a>, he and a colleague reported earlier this year in <em>Reptiles &amp; Amphibians</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Dittrich’s videos of her lab test, she saw 54 occasions of a male grabbing a female, but 25 times his grip was broken. Going limp was not the only move that looked to Dittrich like female resistance. Females often combined several of moves in what look like struggles to escape.</p>



<p>The most common possible resistance to a male’s grab was what Dittrich calls rotation. Females clutched by a male in the study started rotating around the long axis of their body, depending on the angle, somewhere between a log roll and a frog ballerina twirl. Males would move their legs to counteract the spin but on occasion lost their grip.</p>





<p>Females also grunted, in what could sound like a male’s “release call,” Dittrich says. The term comes from males making the noise when, in mating chaos, a guy finds himself mistakenly embraced by another male. He grunts and often gets released. Females in Dittrich’s test on occasion grunted while in mating balls, perhaps a form of male impersonation.</p>



<p>Güell also has heard females make guylike sounds when grabbed. They were Costa Rica’s gliding tree frogs (<em>Agalychnis spurrelli</em>), tiny and green with orange flanks and big red eyes. They gather by the hundreds or thousands in trees above pools of water, but drowning isn’t the big peril. Males struggling for position can cause the whole writhing tangle to tumble into the pool below, where hungry “caimans are just sitting there and waiting,” he says.</p>

<p>The female’s “Let go!” could turn out to be common among frogs that mate in grabfests, Güell says. Dogma had been that only male frogs did much vocal communication, but he has seen that attitude change in recent years after discoveries of species with female calling. “I do think that it is not commonly described; it&#8217;s not commonly heard; it&#8217;s not commonly recorded … and published,” he says.</p>



<p>Dittrich notes that female resistance of any kind has not gotten much mention in the modern literature on her frogs. She found one 20th century paper, but otherwise had to go back to the 18th century for discussion of female resistance to male power among European common frogs.</p>

<p>A paper touted as “the first systematic review and meta-analysis” of research on the effects of homeopathy for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been retracted more than a year after critics first contacted the journal with concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-022-02127-3">Is homeopathy effective for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder? A meta-analysis</a>,” appeared in <em>Pediatric Research</em>, a Springer Nature title, last June. It has not been cited in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, but Altmetric, which quantifies the online attention papers receive, <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/129733871#score">ranks</a> the paper in the top 5% of all articles ever tracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41390-022-02127-3/MediaObjects/41390_2022_2127_MOESM1_ESM.pdf">original paper</a> concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Individualized homeopathy showed a clinically relevant and statistically robust effect in the treatment of ADHD.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-022-02127-3">retraction notice</a>, dated September 20, detailed four “concerns regarding the analysis of the articles included in the meta-analysis,” and concluded:</p>



<span id="more-128154"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Based on the above deficiencies following thorough review, the Editor-in-Chief has substantial concerns regarding the validity of the results presented in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://www.charite.de/en/service/person_detail/person/address_detail/priv_doz_dr_med_michael_teut/">Michael Teut</a> of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin in Germany told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Homeopathy is a very controversial subject, so critics have looked closely at the work. Unfortunately, a transcription error was made in the data extraction, which is relevant to the overall result. From this, one can justify a retraction of the work. Ultimately, it is good that the error was made transparent; the scientific community worked here. However, we authors would have preferred a correction in the form of an amendment, which we asked the journal to publish. Three further points of criticism are, in our view, contentious and less relevant. The journal communicated professionally.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The last author, Harald Walach, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWalach%252c%2bHarald">lost two papers</a> – as well as a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/07/university-terminates-affiliation-with-researcher-who-had-paper-on-covid-19-vaccines-retracted-as-mask-study-comes-under-scrutiny/">university affiliation</a> – in 2021. One paper, which claimed that children’s masks trap too much carbon dioxide, was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/01/one-would-not-want-to-tarnish-another-journal-why-a-republished-covid-19-masks-study-doesnt-say-it-was-retracted/">republished</a> in another journal after its <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/16/jama-journal-retracts-paper-on-masks-for-children/">retraction from <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em></a><em>.</em> The other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/02/journal-retracts-paper-claiming-two-deaths-from-covid-19-vaccination-for-every-three-prevented-cases/">claimed that COVID-19 vaccines caused two deaths for every three deaths they prevented</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teut and Walach both agreed with the retraction, according to the notice, but the first author did not.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Soon after the meta-analysis of homeopathy for ADHD was published, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzard_Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a>, a retired researcher who won the <a href="https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/2015-john-maddox-prize/">2015 John Maddox Prize</a> “for his long commitment to applying scientific methodologies in research into complementary and alternative medicines,” published a <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2022/06/individualized-homeopathy-as-a-treatment-for-adhd-a-new-systematic-review/">critique</a> of the article on his blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ernst and two collaborators also sent a letter to the journal in which they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We conclude that the positive result obtained by the authors is due to a combination of the inclusion of biased trials unsuitable to build evidence together with some major misreporting of study outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June of this year, the journal informed Ernst and his co-authors that it would not publish their critique, “because the priority given to it was not sufficient to justify publication,” according to their <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2023/07/our-struggle-to-publish-criticism-of-a-questionable-homeopathy-paper/">blog post</a> about the matter. In their reply, also included in the post, they called for the journal to retract the paper, and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In our comment we point out that the authors made a lot of errors – to say it mildly. They deny the doubtful quality of the studies they included in their meta-analysis, they did not stick to their own exclusion criteria, the data the authors report do not resemble the findings of the studies they were allegedly taken from, the one study setting the results is a mere pilot study.</p>



<p>The reason you give for our letter not being published is that it was not given enough priority to justify publication. We would like to know: Which issues can conceivably receive higher priority than the fact that a paper in your journal is downright wrong and misleading?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ernst told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I do support the retraction but feel that it could have come quicker. I also think that the retraction notice of the journal might have made it clearer how the authors responded. Lastly, I would have hoped that the journal apologizes for the evidently negligent peer review of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Springer Nature why the issues called out in the retraction notice were not identified during peer review, but a spokesperson declined to comment on that question for “confidentiality reasons.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We commenced an internal investigation, with the support of the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group, after concerns were raised by several readers about the published paper. This investigation identified substantial concerns regarding the validity of the results presented in the article and once we had completed our investigation and considered all options, we concluded that retracting the paper was the appropriate course of action to take. Full details of the reasons for this retraction can be found in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-022-02127-3">retraction notice</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-island-sea-level-rise-mangroves-thrive">On some Australian islands, sea level rise may be helping mangroves thrive</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some mangrove forests off Australia have flourished in the last several decades, a new study reports. And, counterintuitively, rising sea levels may be responsible.</p>



<p>Off Australia’s northern coast, the skeletal remains of ancient coral reefs form the bedrock of numerous wooded islands. These low-lying tropical oases are home to diverse animals and plants, including mangrove forests that pepper their coasts and serve as vital habitat and carbon storers. A recent survey of one cluster of those islands — the first in 50 years — shows that swelling seas might have led <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.1183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a massive mangrove expansion</a>, researchers report November 1 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>





<p>In other parts of the world, rising seas <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-level-rise-mangrove-forests">have put mangroves at risk</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). But at the Howick Islands in the Great Barrier Reef, the story is different because of its unique geologic history.</p>



<p>“We usually are focusing on areas of mangrove loss,” says Temilola Fatoyinbo, a forest ecologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who was not involved with the study. “So it&#8217;s always encouraging to see areas where there&#8217;s mangrove gain.”</p>



<p>Mangroves — groupings of different plants that have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">adapted to thrive along coastlines</a> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">soak up carbon dioxide</a> and store it as “blue carbon,” a term for carbon that is sequestered in marine environments (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>; <em>SN: 11/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of interest in using mangrove blue carbon to mitigate climate change,” says Kerrylee Rogers, an environmental scientist at the University of Wollongong in Australia. “But there remains a lot of questions around their capacity to adapt to sea level rise.”</p>



<p>In 2021, a team led by Wollongong environmental scientist Sarah Hamylton visited the Howick Islands to see how the mangroves there are coping with sea level rise. Hamylton flew a drone over the mangroves to capture aerial imagery, while others walked through the brine to assess the plant diversity and measure individual trees. Using the measured widths and heights of several mangroves, the team extrapolated tree widths for the rest of the forest from the drone’s height data to estimate the total mangrove biomass.</p>



<p>The islands host nearly 54,000 metric tons of mangroves, the team estimates, which is roughly 10,000 more metric tons than was there in 1973. The forest’s reach has also expanded on many islands. While about 25 hectares of every 100 on Newton Island were covered by mangroves in 1973, for example, the forest now blankets close to 40 hectares out of 100.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/103123_di_mangroves_inline-675x450.jpg" alt="A photo of several mangroves growing in the foreground while white ships are visible in the background." class="wp-image-3132821" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/103123_di_mangroves_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/103123_di_mangroves_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/103123_di_mangroves_inline-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/103123_di_mangroves_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132821">Mangrove cover on Bewick Island (pictured) has grown by 50 percent since 1973. Researchers attribute this expansion to rising sea levels, which opens new habitat for the coast-loving plants.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132821">Oxana Repina</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Howick Islands are uniquely suited to supporting mangroves as the ocean rises. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, around 12,000 years ago, water levels rose around northern Australia, and coral reefs grew upward to fill the space that had opened for them. When sea levels fell thousands of years later, the exposed reefs eroded into sediment. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jacky-austermann-climate-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">sea levels now rising again</a>, the researchers suspect the mixture of saltwater and sediment makes a perfect home for the salt-tolerant mangroves (<em>SN: 9/29/22</em>).</p>



<p>“As sea level came back down, it wasn&#8217;t suitable mangrove habitat,” Rogers says. With those parts of the island now submerged, “it now is suitable again, and it&#8217;s largely because it was set up for those conditions [2,000] to 4,000 years ago.”</p>



<p>The new findings highlight the need for mangrove research on a local scale, Rogers says. “In a global model, this would get lost.” Fatoyinbo agrees. “Studies on the local scale are really useful,” she says, “to better understand big patterns.”</p>





<p>Rogers and Hamylton are now working on a bigger effort to study mangroves around Australia. “If we&#8217;re going to invest in mangroves … to provide us blue carbon and to protect shorelines, we need to understand how dynamic they are,” Rogers says. “And then get some more understanding of how they&#8217;re going to adapt to sea level in the future.”</p>

<p>Didier Raoult, the French infectious disease scientist who came to prominence for promoting <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/12/elsevier-investigating-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-paper/">hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment</a>, has lost two papers for ethics concerns after other scientists flagged issues with hundreds of publications from the institute he formerly led.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both papers, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44597-3">Increased Gut Redox and Depletion of Anaerobic and Methanogenic Prokaryotes in Severe Acute Malnutrition</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44593-7">Gut Microbiota Alteration is Characterized by a Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria Bloom in Kwashiorkor and a Bacteroidetes Paucity in Marasmus</a>,&#8221; appeared in <em>Scientific Reports</em> in 2016 and 2019, respectively. They have been cited approximately 160 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices, published Monday, were nearly identical. They stated:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128159"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Editors have retracted this Article.</p>



<p>After publication of this paper concerns about ethical oversight of this study were brought to the attention of the Editors. The Authors were not able to provide documentation of appropriate approval from an ethics committee in either Niger or Senegal, where the participants in this study were based.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Raoult disagreed with both retractions, according to the notices. He did not immediately respond to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PubPeer users, including sleuth Elisabeth Bik, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FA42441DB58E9592CB5EA2A3305DD6">posted</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3A0F44F60F15344867667C92287BDA">comments</a> in March 2021 calling out issues with the ethics approvals in the studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik, who has <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/08/31/concerns-about-marseilles-ihumi-amu-papers-part-2/">identified ethical concerns</a> with many of Raoult’s papers, and received <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-rally-around-misconduct-consultant-facing-legal-threat-after-challenging">harassment and legal threats</a> as a result, posted a thread on X (formerly Twitter):</p>

<p>The two retracted papers were also among hundreds from Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection (IHU-MI) in Marseille, France, that critics<a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4"> flagged</a> as being conducted under the same ethics approval number, “even though the subjects, samples, and countries of investigation were different.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The critics indicated that they had contacted <em>Scientific Reports</em> about their concerns, as well as about a dozen others in the journal, in the summer of 2022, and did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, the publisher PLOS <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/plos-flags-nearly-50-papers-by-controversial-french-covid-researcher-for-ethics-concerns/">marked nearly 50 papers</a> by Raoult with expressions of concern while it continued to investigate the ethics approval information. At the time, PLOS said it expected to take at least another year to complete the investigation. </p>



<p>Last year, Raoult retired as director of IHU-MI, which he had overseen since 2011, following an inspection by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/actualites/inspection-a-lihu-mediterranee-infection-et-a-lap-hm-lansm-saisit-a-nouveau-la-justice-et-engage-des-poursuites-administratives">that found</a> “serious shortcomings and non-compliances with the regulations for research involving the human person.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossil-species-lamprey-flesh-eaters">Newfound fossil species of lamprey were flesh eaters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Found in roughly 160-million-year-old rocks in North China, the Yanliao Biota is a diverse array of beautifully preserved fossils, including dinosaurs, pterosaurs and even early mammals. But it isn’t all fur and feathers. Paleontologists have now unearthed fossils of two surprisingly large ancient lamprey species, swimming menaces that latched onto and bored holes into their unsuspecting neighbors.</p>



<p>Modern parasitic lampreys’ funnel-shaped, toothy mouths tend to be adapted to consume blood or flesh. Based on the arrangement of teeth and other feeding apparatuses in the fossils, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42251-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly discovered species probably weren’t bloodsuckers — they were flesh eaters</a>, the team reports October 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>The fossils are the oldest lamprey specimens to clearly indicate a preference in feeding mode, say paleontologist Feixang Wu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues. In fact, the tooth arrangement of both ancient species strongly resembles that of a modern species of Southern Hemisphere flesh-eating lamprey.</p>



<p><em>Yanliaomyzon occisor</em> — “occisor” is Latin for “killer” — was the bigger of the two, about 64 centimeters long, the length of a small dog. The species name for its smaller cousin, <em>Y. ingensdentes</em>, comes from the Latin for “large teeth.” Modern adult lampreys range in length from about 15 to 120 centimeters.</p>

<p>Lampreys, a lineage of jawless vertebrates, have been around for 360 million years. But they rarely fossilize well, leaving large gaps in their evolutionary record and uncertainty about their ecology and when their feeding styles evolved.</p>



<p>The earliest lampreys weren’t such fierce predators: They were only a few centimeters long and lacked the powerful teeth of later species. They also didn&#8217;t have modern lampreys&#8217; distinct life cycle, which consists of a larval filter-feeding stage, a juvenile parasitic stage and an adult spawning stage.</p>



<p>The newfound fossils suggest that by this time in the Jurassic Period, lampreys had become fierce predators, acquiring larger body sizes and complex feeding structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/how-to-choose-a-lab">How to Choose a Lab</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>In this new series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. To kick off, Rachel McKeown shares her tips on something just as important as the application itself, but not always given the consideration it deserves: how to choose a lab. Hint: it's about more than just the science!</strong></p>

<p>When you reach the end of the undergraduate road, it can be difficult to know where to look next. This is especially true if you’re considering a PhD. Your mind is flooded with burning questions that can all seem very overwhelming. Finding and choosing a PhD is an exercise in research, resilience and reflection, in many ways preparation for the real thing. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>With so much variety in available opportunities, what should you have at the forefront of their mind during these early days? You’re about to embark on a big personal challenge, so make sure it is in an environment that nurtures you. If you had to run a marathon, you wouldn’t want to do it in a blazing desert after all. Here’s a few things to bear in mind that may save you a lot of trouble down the line. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_0cad37eedaa7466dbba40cda4492b283~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_838,h_629,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rachel on the Franze lab retreat in Suffolk, 2023. A PhD is not spent entirely in the lab!" ></figure><p><u>The big question</u></p>

<p>One day you’ll hold in your hands a thesis, the result of years of dedication to one very specific scientific discipline. If you’re about to throw yourself fully into a research question, you’d better make it a good one. </p>

<p>Cast your mind back through your academic career to date. Which topics sparked your curiosity the most? This will help you hone your search from the beginning. Already have your heart set on a specific research focus? Find a group that will feed your curiosity and drive it further. Still a little open-ended? The internet is your ally here, with resources galore for you to explore. Don’t be afraid to reach out to make enquiries or ask questions – you never know where that could lead. Survey the landscape of advertised PhD positions, some of which come with a funding package to sweeten the deal. Try joining Twitter (now X), which boasts a thriving international scientific scene where PIs are keen to share any openings - it is essentially a friendlier academic LinkedIn.     </p>

<p>I fell upon the field of neural development and mechanics almost by chance as an undergraduate student in Natural Sciences browsing final year project options. My choice led me down a one-way path as I became drawn to the major implications of this field – had no one really thought that much about how the brain <em>feels </em>before? The field is flourishing with open questions, new findings and revolutionary concepts, and I have the best seat in the house to watch it all unfold.</p>

<p><u>Supervisors: stereotypes and their exceptions</u></p>

<p>Arguably even more important than the details of the project is who you put your trust in to serve as your mentor. As a rule of thumb, supervisors can be thought of as sitting somewhere along a spectrum of career levels. </p>

<p>On one end, you have PIs who are just stepping onto the ladder, recruiting PhD students for the first time. Their labs are often small, and the relative lack of experience, stability and funding that unfortunately comes tied in with this career stage can seem daunting, but they offer an unmatched level of personal mentorship. They’ll be quick to reply to messages and relatively easy to pin down for meetings, but still in the phase of establishing themselves in their institute and wider academic sphere. </p>

<p>At the top of the ladder are those for whom getting a student through their PhD is second nature, potentially a source of comfort at times when you’re in doubt about your own progress. The price often paid for the seniority and expertise is you will be constantly      vying for attention. Your messages can become buried in their ever-overflowing inbox and precious slots in their diary can be snapped up by the competition before you know it. They’ll have swapped the lab bench for the office by now, but with bigger labs often come experienced postdocs and other PhD students with the technical know-how to help you out. </p>

<p>Not every PI will fit these stereotypes, but considering the kind of supervisor that best suits your academic style often pays off. Are you the type always searching for a guiding hand and second opinion, or more independent, preferring only the necessary amount of oversight?</p>

<p>I first met my supervisor, Professor Kristian Franze, during my undergraduate project interview. No other interview that week featured nearly as much enthusiasm and genuine scientific curiosity. With his esteemed reputation, great respect for student wellbeing and a sense of fun that often puts us students to shame, I had the sense I’d be in very capable hands. Although now as a Max Planck Director his schedule is pretty packed, our meetings are bursts of productive discussion that give me clear direction and focus. For the less niche experimental issues, I’m lucky to have a second experienced supervisor, Professor Clare Baker, always on hand when I need to voice some thoughts and need a pick-me-up. A little luxurious, I know, but I fully appreciate the benefits of the co-supervision setup.</p>

<p><u>More than colleagues</u></p>

<p>On a day-to-day basis it won’t be your PI you’ll be interacting with as much as your lab comrades. These can include senior technicians, lab managers, postdocs and, of course, other PhD students. Some may be energetic and bursting with personality, while others may pass their days fully absorbed in their tasks (and whatever is coming through their earphones). The sense of community in a thriving lab group can be a source of great comfort at testing times when sometimes all you need is comfort and solidarity. </p>

<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_602c9bda9bdd476b989031991289af54~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_674,h_506,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Toastie Thursday, Rachel's favourite Franze lab tradition." ></figure><p>Traditions start to appear in the flow of the working week, with patterns emerging among independent routines that converge at particular times. For me, lab meetings are at 10AM on Mondays. Department seminars are on Friday mornings. My highlight (and I’m sure everyone else’s too) is what has become known as Toastie Thursday. With each of us contributing an ingredient, at lunchtime an assembly line begins operation as bread is sliced and buttered, cheese and chutneys are spread and sandwiches are sent to the beloved toastie machine to return as a delicious lunchtime luxury. </p>

<p>Friendships forged at the benchtop extend not just to your working hours – we transform our communal kitchen into a pseudo-cinema, fight fiends and foes in Dungeons and Dragons and indulge in a few well-earned pints every now and then. </p>

<p>Before applying to a lab, make sure you get the inside scoop on the lab culture (and supervision style of the PI) by speaking to those who’d know best: lab members themselves. This will give you an honest indication of what lies in store. There’s often huge variation in lab social dynamics, and while you don’t need to be best buddies with all your colleagues, they are often more than mere shared offices and workspaces. The right social backdrop to your PhD will really help you to thrive.</p>

<p>Timeslots to play with the more popular bits of lab kit can be limited and occasionally lead to some unsocial work hours, but, ultimately, it’s a small price to pay for what has come to feel like a tight-knit family. When the going gets tough, someone always has my back. I hope they all know just how much their support means to me. </p>

<p><u>Location, location, location</u></p>

<p>Don’t forget about what lies outside of the lab. Aside from the science itself, you’ll be choosing somewhere to call home for the next few years. Consider what you value most. Are you a party animal craving the hustle and bustle of the metropolitan scene, or do you prefer a more laid-back, peaceful lifestyle? Picture where that place is on a map alongside where family members and loved ones live. Does the idea of changing cities, countries or even continents fill you with excitement or dread? Think about the living arrangements – affordability, the commute to the lab and whether you prefer to live alone, with a partner or friends will all need to be factored in. </p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_87ac474365074fe0bc1515e89ade6704~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_755,h_566,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="St John’s May Ball, 2022. Don't forget to consider the life you will have outside the lab!" ></figure><p>For me, Cambridge still held a firm grip on my heart. The compact layout, stunning architecture and incredible student community offers no better backdrop to my postgraduate years. By train I can easily reach London and with a few extra hours I can be in the tiny Welsh village I grew up in, surrounded by my family. Here I can get almost anywhere I need to by bike, know the best coffee hideouts and engage in bespoke extra-curricular opportunities: I’m currently President of Bluesci, the university science magazine and communication platform.</p>

<p><u>Look before you leap</u></p>

<p>I don’t mean to burst your bubble, but PhDs are difficult. Without a doubt, there’ll be times when you question whether you made the right decision. Mine certainly hasn’t been perfect, and yours won’t be either. But a word of advice in science and in life more generally: stop seeking perfection. It doesn’t exist and it never will. Have I faced my fair share of difficulties? Absolutely. Have I sometimes thought I made the wrong call? Definitely. Do I have any regrets? None in the slightest. </p>

<p>Take your time. Look for the positives and negatives of each path. Eventually, you’ll take the first step on the long road to “Dr”. You’ll never be able to say where the other paths would have led, but you can at least look back and say you looked before you leapt, you thought carefully and you made an informed choice. All of that thought and consideration will pay off. Trust me, I’ve been there. You never know, someone might even suggest you write a blog about it one day…   </p><hr><p>This article was written by Rachel McKeown and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p>When I began my graduate work almost 15 years ago, retractions of papers in academic journals were rare, reserved mainly for clear misconduct or serious errors. Today, rarity has given way to routine, with retractions coming more often and increasingly in bulk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage is not immune to large-scale retractions, nor are we passive observers of their growth. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/21/sage-retracting-three-dozen-articles-for-compromised-peer-review/"><em>Retraction Watch </em>wrote</a>, we were “one of the first publishers to recognize large-scale peer review manipulation and begin retracting papers in bulk nine years ago.” Recently, we issued some major retractions; just in the last few months, we put out 37 from <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers </em>and 21 from <em>Concurrent Engineering. </em>And there are more to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we don’t celebrate this type of action, the news is not all bad. The high numbers of retractions at times reflect a problem of industrialized cheating, but also, as in our case, a belief that rigorous scholarship – robustly reviewed by researchers who are experts in their fields – can and should improve the world. Sage was founded on this principle, and it guides everything we do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We take our role of vigorously correcting the academic record very seriously because we believe in the scholarly process. We also know that every part of the process is managed by humans with biases (conscious or unconscious), agendas, heavy workloads, and – at times – dubious incentives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As research integrity manager at Sage, I work to safeguard the credibility of the research published in more than 60,000 articles every year across more than 1,100 journals. In my role, I see a lot of unethical practices: <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/">peer review rings</a>, where researchers unfairly influence the review process; paper mills that produce mass-fabricated research papers, and the brazen trend of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">selling authorship</a> or entire papers on private or public forums. When it comes to preventing and correcting this type of action,&nbsp; much goes on behind the scenes.</p>



<span id="more-128147"></span>



<p><strong>What goes into a bulk retraction?</strong></p>



<p>Behind every set of bulk retractions are teams of trained individuals using specialized tools, carefully going through several steps of a standardized process in line with industry best practice, often in concert with multiple parties representing various institutions.</p>



<p>My team at Sage comprises specialists who can recognize and resolve ethical breaches to help ensure that the articles published in our journals are based on sound, rigorously reviewed science. A large part of this lies in the unglamorous work of prevention – guidance and policies that aim to make publication impermeable to large-scale unethical activities. This means keeping authors and editors abreast of best practices and training editors and journal managers on research integrity matters such as paper mills or political pressure on research.</p>



<p>Of course, enforcing these policies and practices to perfection is possible. But just as there are those who are using all the tools at their disposal to game the system, we’re using everything at our disposal to uncover questionable practices. We use a number of tools to spot common breaches of publishing ethics, and we’re constantly fine-tuning our methods to stay current with evolving trends in this field. For example, one of these tools scrutinizes submissions and reviews for signs of suspicious activity. Clues often come in the form of non-institutional email addresses or peculiar IP addresses used during manuscript submission. We’ve also recently joined <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/stm-integrity-hub-launches-new-research-integrity-tool/">a pilot program as part of the STM Integrity Hub</a>, a cross-publisher initiative, which detects unusual activity and misconduct across publishers such as duplicate submissions across journals and publishers – a tactic  often employed by paper mills.  </p>



<p>When misconduct isn’t caught before publication, my team commits considerable time and resources to thoroughly – sometimes painstakingly – investigate so that we can make the best decisions following industry standards from organizations such as the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> (COPE). This process is not always linear or straightforward but there are steps common to most incidents.</p>



<p>We begin by determining the the scope of the issue by listing affected submissions and published articles. This can be a challenge, as sometimes the list spans multiple journals. We then brief the editor(s) and if there are irregularities in peer review or acceptance processes, we work with them to understand what may have happened. We scrutinize the data from each submission, looking for any patterns that are suggestive of third-party interference, a common source or telltale paper mill tactics. We also examine the entire journal for explanations behind this unusual activity and look for indications of genuine errors before assuming wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Next, we contact the authors about our findings and give them a chance to respond. If authors can’t be verified or remain unreachable, we proceed without their involvement. (In many cases it becomes very clear when a third party has tampered with our process, but there are times when it’s less clear-cut.</p>



<p>We make the decision to retract with the editor based on<a href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines"> COPE’s retraction guidance</a>. For example, if there is clear evidence of an experimental error, data fabrication, or a compromised peer review process (e.g., a peer review ring), we will retract. Finally, when notices are ready we allow authors the opportunity to note whether they agree or disagree with our decision, for fairness and transparency.</p>



<p>Throughout every step of the process, we ask ourselves: Is a completely new review warranted? Is this a valid concern that impacts the publication? Is this an honest error, or is it a pattern of behavior?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it might appear that we’re dragging our feet before making a final decision, sifting through all the information to answer these questions can take a long time. But we strive to be as transparent as possible along the way. For example, when we do find sufficient indications of error or unethical practices, we are not afraid to issue Expressions of Concern to let the public know that an investigation is warranted. When our investigation is complete, we issue retractions or corrections as soon as possible when warranted or, in other cases, publicly state that we no longer see issues with the papers.</p>



<p>Still, with this level of attention given to each case, we can’t approach all cases as quickly as we would like, and we prioritize areas that affect people, policy, and the future of research.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why do we do it?</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes the process of a bulk retraction is initiated when a specialist or an industry “sleuth”&nbsp; notices a dubious pattern, such as&nbsp; image manipulation, and comes to us with a list of problematic articles with evidence to indicate why we should take action. But this type of ‘package-wrapping-and-leaving on the doorstep’ is rare.</p>



<p>Instead, most of the time, a bulk retraction occurs when we notice something off with just one paper – a request to change the author list after acceptance, a peer reviewer contacts us to let us know that a paper was published despite their seeing a need for substantial revisions, etc. In those cases, we start with the dubious paper and keep pulling the string for as long as necessary. We could easily stop at the first article and move on and save hours of staff time without anyone noticing (at least in the short term). But doing so would mean that we are evading one of our central responsibilities as an academic publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an independent company, we don’t have to bend to the views of shareholders. This gives us the freedom to prioritize academic integrity, make improvements, and shake things up if needed. Sometimes, this means making tough and even unpopular decisions to upload scholarly standards. For instance, my team and I have had to end publishing partnerships with highly regarded scholars when we discovered their unscrupulous behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This independence extends to our editors. We uphold <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/editorial-independence-at-sage">editorial independence</a> enthusiastically and unapologetically. While we offer help, training, and advice, it’s the editors who have the final say over article selection and peer review, as long as they are academically rigorous and work in accordance with best practice, including guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-publication, editors maintain authority over decisions to publish expressions of concern or other similar notes as well as retractions, again, as long as they are in accordance with COPE. We often help guide them through this process, and in the vast majority of ethics cases, are confident in the decisions they make. From time to time, when the editor is not willing to take action or is implicated in the unethical behavior, we believe it is our duty to step in. And we do. Finding the balance between accommodating editor wishes and gatekeeping is not easy, but we prioritize maintaining the integrity of the scholarly record as we navigate that balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I often compare our role to the news media; when research is published in our journals, it goes “on the record.” Once on the record, it changes the direction of future research for years to come and impacts policy and patient protocols, so “bad” science can lead to bad research, bad policy, and bad protocol. It can also foster increased mistrust in science and so, by continuously correcting the scholarly record, we also help to maintain trust in honest research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my experience, retractions also signal trust to our community of researchers and editors – they can feel confident that their rigorous research, which they have spent weeks, months, or more carefully conducting, writing, and/or reviewing, is in good company. As no publisher is immune to rising misconduct or paper mills, those that aren’t increasing their number of retractions to reflect that might not be vigilant enough. A clear message that we hear <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001572">time and time again</a> and was a major theme at this year’s STM conference is that we should be cleaning up the record and retracting more articles, more quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Making Integrity Integral</strong></p>



<p>But let’s keep in mind, the vast majority of scholarly research is conducted, reviewed, accepted, and published in good faith. And when retractions do occur, especially one-off retractions, they are often the result of error or oversight rather than something more nefarious – a teachable moment and a learning experience for researcher and editor alike.</p>



<p>I see the rise in bulk retractions as a hopeful sign for the future of scholarship. It means that we aren’t content to sweep bad published research under the rug. And, I can say with confidence, that with each new bulk retraction, we are refining, and sometimes redefining, our processes and practices to improve the system before tomorrow’s research is submitted to our journals.</p>



<p>While our processes and rigor are our own, we’re not unique; our colleagues at other reputable academic publishers are also acting to protect the integrity of the research enterprise. I’ve found that working with other publishers and bodies in the industry, such as the <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/stm-integrity-hub/">STM Integrity Hub</a>, to regularly share new concerns and best practices is the best way to stop unethical research behavior before it gets accepted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My interest in research integrity comes from a deeply personal place of needing to be part of an ethical research ecosystem that does not infringe on the rights of others. With my work, I hope to instill in others a similar way of working so that students graduating today, 15 years from now, and beyond, publish the research that will improve the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-tissue-fuel-marathon-runner">Brain tissue may be fuel for marathon runners</a></h4>

              
                <p>In endurance athletes, some brain power may come from an unexpected source.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.10.561303v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marathon runners appear to rely on myelin</a>, the fatty tissue bundled around nerve fibers, for energy during a race, scientists report October 10 in a paper posted at bioRxiv.org. In the day or two following a marathon, this tissue seems to dwindle drastically, brain scans of runners reveal. Two weeks after the race, the brain fat bounces back to nearly prerace levels. The find suggests that the athletes burn so much energy running that they need to tap into a new fuel supply to keep the brain operating smoothly.</p>





<p>“This is definitely an intriguing observation,” says Mustapha Bouhrara, a neuroimaging scientist at the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore. “It is quite plausible that myelin lipids are used as fuel in extended exercise.”</p>



<p>If what the study authors are seeing is real, he says, the work could have therapeutic implications. Understanding how runners’ myelin recovers so rapidly might offer clues for developing potential treatments — like for people who’ve lost myelin due to aging or neurodegenerative disease.</p>



<p>Much of the human brain contains myelin, tissue that sheathes nerve fibers and acts as an insulator, like rubber coating an electrical wire. That insulation lets electrical messages zip from nerve cell to nerve cell, allowing high-speed communication that’s crucial for brain function.</p>



<p>The fatty tissue seems to be a straightforward material with a straightforward job, but there’s likely more to it than that, says Klaus-Armin Nave, a neurobiologist at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen, Germany. “For the longest time, it was thought that myelin sheathes were assembled, inert structures of insulation that don’t change much after they’re made,” he says.</p>



<p>Today, there’s evidence that myelin is a dynamic structure, growing and shrinking in size and abundance depending on cellular conditions. The idea is called myelin plasticity. “It’s hotly researched,” Nave says.</p>



<p>Fatty molecules and other myelin sheath components regularly turn over, breaking down the insulating material and building it back up again, he says. In mice, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.24.481621v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain cells can tap into these in-flux fats when sugar</a> — the brain’s typical energy source — is scarce, Nave’s team’s experiments have suggested.</p>



<p>Carlos Matute, a neurobiologist at the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience and the University of the Basque Country in Leioa, Spain, wondered if these fats could also sustain the brains of endurance athletes. He’s a marathon runner and had been curious how people’s brains continued working after strenuous exercise drained energy reserves in the body.</p>



<p>Using an MRI, his team scanned the brains of four marathon runners in the days before and after the race, and two of the runners two weeks later. A day or two after the race, the team saw a reduction in the amount of myelin in the brain. That suggested the myelin wrapped around nerve fibers had thinned, Matute says. &nbsp;After two weeks, much of the myelin had returned, thickening again around neural fibers.</p>

<p>That’s a rapid decline followed by a rapid recovery, says Bouhrara, a drastic result that gives him pause. Matute and colleagues used water trapped between layers of myelin as a proxy for myelin content. More of this water indicates more myelin. But you can’t rule out the effects of dehydration, Bouhrara says. If runners are dehydrated after their race, their brain tissues may just be dried out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>It’s a point Matute has heard before, when presenting his data to colleagues. “In our opinion, this is not the case.” His team scanned the runners days after their race, so they had time to rehydrate, he says. What’s more, the runners’ brain volumes stayed nearly the same before and after the marathon. Dehydrated brains would probably be smaller, Matute says. “We saw that there is no shrinkage of the brain at all.”</p>



<p>Now, his team is following the thread of their findings; they want to see if the runners’ myelin dip alters brain function, and how long it takes to recover completely.</p>



<p>Matute points out that his results don’t mean running is bad for the brain. “Not at all,” he says. It’s possible that using and replenishing energy reserves is beneficial  because it exercises the brain’s metabolic machinery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salt-sweat-desert-plant-hydrated">Salty sweat helps one desert plant stay hydrated</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sweat keeps some animals cool in scorching heat. Salty secretions also serve one desert shrub a refreshing sip of water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Athel tamarisk <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313134120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uses a special selection of salts excreted from its leaves to pull water from the air</a>, researchers report October 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. This study provides new insights into the clever chemical strategies that plants have evolved to survive in harsh environments.</p>



<p>The Athel tamarisk (<em>Tamarix aphylla</em>) thrives in the arid, salt-rich soils of coastal flats across the Middle East. That’s because the tamarisk is a halophyte, a type of plant that secretes excess salt in concentrated droplets from glands in its leaves. The moisture from these briny excretions dissipates in the heat of the day, leaving the tamarisk encrusted in white crystals that shake off in the wind.</p>





<p>While driving through the hot, humid deserts of the United Arab Emirates, materials scientist Marieh Al-Handawi of New York University Abu Dhabi noticed water condensing on these crystals. There are lots of plants with leaf structures adapted to attract liquid water from fog. But Al-Handawi, who looks to nature for strategies to tackle water scarcity, suspected that the chemical composition of the excreted salts might have something to do with the dew.</p>



<p>To investigate, Al-Handawi and her team recorded time-lapse videos of Athel tamarisk plants in their natural habitat. These recordings showed that salt crystals that form from daytime excretions swell with water at night. Back in the lab, the researchers found that at 35° Celsius and 80 percent relative humidity, a naturally encrusted branch collected 15 milligrams of water on its leaves after two hours, while a washed branch yielded only about one-tenth as much.</p>



<p>“This result was conclusive to us,” Al-Handawi says, “because it proved salts are the main contributor to the water harvesting, and it&#8217;s not the surface of the plant.” What’s more, the researchers observed dew form on the crystals down to just 50 percent relative humidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the scientists scrutinized the mineral makeup of the tamarisk’s saline sprinkles, they found more than 10 different types of salt all crystallized together. These crystals are made mostly of sodium chloride and gypsum. Yet the researchers also spotted traces of a secret ingredient: lithium sulfate. This mineral is exceptionally good at taking in water and at much lower humidity than either sodium chloride or gypsum. While sodium chloride and gypsum bring in the largest volumes of water, the addition of lithium sulfate to the mineral mélange, the researchers say, helps explain how the tamarisk collects water even at low humidity.</p>



<p>“This paper provides a new level of detailed understanding of how some desert plants can both excrete salt and use it to take up water from the air into leaves,” says plant physiologist and ecologist Lawren Sack of UCLA, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>He is excited to see the chemical complexity of the salts involved. Desert plants have evolved intricate chemical strategies to squeeze every last drop of water from the environment, he says, and most of those systems await discovery.</p>



<p>Al-Handawi agrees, noting that the salt recipe may differ across regions and seasons. It makes her hopeful, she says, that there are other exciting water-harvesting materials waiting to be found in the desert.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/phd-life-with-adhd-the-highs-and-lows">PhD life with ADHD: the highs and lows</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>It's ADHD Awareness Month. As Katherine Mortimer - a PhD student with ADHD - says, ADHD can be both a challenge and a superpower but the important thing is identifying these and working with them. She shares her experience and advice with us here.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_407d9729fac041788c41ff82d404378c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Kelly Sikkema via Unsplash" ></figure><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as made clear by the name, is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by inattentive and hyperactive personality traits. But it is often more complex than that for individuals with ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19, in the second year of my undergraduate degree. In school I was often labelled a daydreamer - my overactive imagination was blamed for this - but for as long as I can remember I have struggled to stay focused and to escape the chaotic world inside my head.</p>

<p>When starting my PhD, I didn’t fully anticipate how my ADHD and a PhD lifestyle might clash. PhDs rely on self-motivation, attention to detail and can be emotionally challenging. I noticed that I was struggling to stay on task, keep on top of my work, pay attention in meetings, and ultimately it became difficult to deal with the emotional lows that can coincide with the PhD experience. But now going into my second year, I have uncovered ways to harmonise my ADHD with my PhD. I have learnt useful techniques that I will carry through for the next couple years of my PhD and most likely for the rest of my life. </p>
<h4>Emotional regulation and rejection sensitivity </h4><p>As a neuroscientist, I have found comfort in trying to understand the neurological underpinnings of my ADHD, but it also makes my behaviour feel far out of my control. Some symptoms of ADHD, such as impulsiveness and the inability to focus and feel motivated, have been attributed to functional deficits in areas of the brain which are heavily populated by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11060940"  >,<u>dopaminergic neurons</u></a>. Low dopamine activity may also explain the more emotional symptoms of ADHD, such as rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD) and emotional dysregulation, where the highs are very high, and the lows are very low.</p>
<blockquote>This field is full of rejections. There are the obvious ones...but there are a lot of less overt moments, too</blockquote><p>Unfortunately for those who experience RSD and are pursuing a PhD (or any route in academia), this field is full of rejections. There are the obvious ones, like when journals reject your paper or when you attempt an experiment for the 50th time only for it to not work (again). No one likes being rejected, but for individuals with RSD it can be harrowing, causing a complete decline in mood which may be viewed as ‘irrational’ by others. There are a lot of less overt moments, too, though, that can be deeply affective but subtle, and interactions with your supervisor can play a major role in perceived rejection. Maybe a meeting with them didn’t go as well as planned, or they shot down an idea you had for your project. Supervisors are your main point of call; they are vital to the success of your PhD and they are completely unique to the PhD experience. What other job has a mentor or boss that gives you so much 1-to-1 attention? Because of this, perceived rejection can be found in even the smallest interactions with them. One technique I try to apply to limit RSD in this context is to not put too much pressure on these interactions. A weekly meeting is not the be all and end all, and will not alter your supervisor's opinion of you if you feel you’ve come up short on successful results or meaningful outcomes. In general terms, there will be bad lab days, but there will also be good lab days and the more you accept this part of the journey, the more likely you are to learn from your rejections and turn them into growth.  </p>
<h4>Executive dysfunction and attention span</h4><p>Let’s talk about executive dysfunction. Right off the bat, it sounds like a bunch of cognitive jargon, but executive function comes down to seemingly very basic parts of our working lives such as completing a task from beginning to end, remembering to go to meetings,  or completing tasks with a deadline. Executive dysfunction is struggling with all of the above. It is largely attributed to the inattentive side of ADHD and it makes perfect sense if you view it in terms of attention. If you do not pay attention to something, it is harder to commit it to memory. Struggling with executive dysfunction can often fuel rejection sensitivity and lead to feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment. For example, when your supervisor asks you if you made any progress on the part of your project, they advised you to try but you have no recollection of this.</p><blockquote>Working from home days are so important for my mental wellbeing and allow me to work more efficiently in the lab on the days I am in</blockquote><p>A potentially obvious way to deal with this is to write things down! And I don’t mean leaving yourself cryptic messages on random notepads and having to ask yourself “What does 'just eyeballs’ mean??’ (this is a real message I left myself amid a bunch of doodles). Writing up meeting notes immediately after they have occurred is a good way to combat this, but also make notes during the meeting. Leave comments in full sentences on half-written areas of your thesis to remind yourself of your thought process at the time, or even use your lab book to write full-on diary entries retelling your day in the lab if that helps. </p>

<p>Burnout and feeling overwhelmed can worsen executive dysfunction and are all too common among PhD students. Please remember that it is completely reasonable to take breaks. Use your lunch breaks to detach yourself from what you’re doing, catch up with lab mates and destress. Having a work from home day each week is also a great way to get yourself out of the lab and limit your burnout. Save some reading or data analysis for this time! I’ve found this to be so important for my mental wellbeing and it allows me to work more efficiently in the lab on the days I am in. </p>
<blockquote>My ADHD is not just a hindrance, it is also all the parts of myself that make me perfectly suited for a PhD</blockquote>
<h4>Superpower</h4><p>When I spoke to my mum (who also has ADHD) about writing this article, she noted how negative I was being, describing ADHD as a huge obstacle to me obtaining my PhD. However, she reminded me that my ADHD is not just a hindrance, it is also all the parts of myself that make me perfectly suited for a PhD. It’s the persistent intellectual curiosity, the need to always understand why, chronic problem-solving, ability to hyperfocus, and the creativity and resourcefulness that allows me to think outside the box and explore a huge range of research related to my project. We are often taught to view our neurodivergence as a superpower, and to this I say, why not? If a part of our ADHD makes us enthralled by a particular area of research and constantly seeking answers to a research question, then surely we are the ideal PhD candidates. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Katherine Mortimer and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Harpreet Singh will talk about the paper entitled &quot;Exploring Computer Science Students’ Perception of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Descriptive and Correlation Study&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>ChatGPT is an emerging tool that can be employed in many activities including in
learning/teaching in universities. Like many other tools, it has its benefits and its
drawbacks. If used properly, it can improve learning, and if used irresponsibly, it can
have a negative impact on learning. The aim of this research is to study how ChatGPT can
be used in academia to improve teaching/learning activities. In this paper, we study
students’ opinions about how the tool can be used positively in learning activities. A
survey is conducted among 430 students of an MSc degree in computer science at the
University of Hertfordshire, UK, and their opinions about the tool are studied. The survey
tries to capture different aspects in which the tool can be employed in academia and the
ways in which it can harm or help students in learning activities. The findings suggest
that many students are familiar with the tool but do not regularly use it for academic
purposes. Moreover, students are skeptical of its positive impacts on learning and think
that universities should provide more vivid guidelines and better education on how and
where the tool can be used for learning activities. The students’ feedback responses are
analyzed and discussed and the authors’ opinions regarding the subject are presented. This
study shows that ChatGPT can be helpful in learning/teaching activities, but better
guidelines should be provided for the students in using the tool.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-survival-fog-seaweed">Fake fog, ‘re-skinning’ and ‘sea-weeding’ could help coral reefs survive</a></h4>

              
                <p>Erinn Muller should have reason to despair. The marine biologist studies coral health in Florida, a state whose reefs have been devastated by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">extreme heat</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/increasing-number-hurricane-rapidly-intensify">increasingly ferocious hurricanes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-coral-disease-ravaging-caribbean-reefs">deadly infectious diseases</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>; <em>SN: 9/13/23; SN: 7/9/19</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve lost 98 percent of our living coral cover,” says Muller, of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla. While among the hardest hit, Florida isn’t alone. From Australia’s Great Barrier Reef to the Caribbean, coral reefs globally are in trouble.</p>





<p>But innovative efforts to protect and restore coral reefs buoy Muller’s hopes. She just has to visit Mote’s Caribbean king crab nursery, a project of reef restoration expert Jason Spadaro. There, tiny specks of crustaceans will grow into salad-loving foragers. Once they are set loose on nearby reefs, <em>Maguimithrax spinosissimus</em> <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)31674-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat away suffocating seaweed</a>.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m optimistic because there is really truly so much work being done” to restore coral reefs, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tali-vardi-ph-d-921698155/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tali Vardi</a>, a marine biologist and executive director of the Coral Restoration Consortium, a global community of scientists, managers and restoration experts dedicated to helping coral reefs. While safeguarding the future of coral reefs ultimately depends on halting climate change, “we&#8217;re trying to maintain pockets of biodiversity” that can serve as a springboard for the long-term recovery of reefs.</p>



<p>Given how diverse coral reefs are, Vardi says, researchers need a diversity of solutions to match. “There’s no silver bullet here.”</p>



<p>Around the globe, coral biologists are trying everything from low-tech seaweed removal to high-tech artificial fog production to protect corals. Here’s a closer look at three projects that researchers are developing to help save coral reefs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sea-weeding, literally</h4>



<p>In Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, it’s not crabs doing the weeding. It’s volunteers with Earthwatch Institute — an international environmental organization — snorkeling and diving underwater to pluck macroalgae, the weed of the sea. The volunteers’ goal is to free parts of the reef from a seaweed scourge to see if that leads to a resurgence in coral.</p>



<p>“There’s been this issue with increases in macroalgae versus corals for a long time,” says David Bourne. “If something’s out of whack” with the reef ecosystem, “the corals lose out and the macroalgae take over.”</p>



<p>Though they seem like a cross between plants and rocks, the hard corals that form reefs are actually giant colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps. The polyps secrete a hard skeleton made of calcium carbonate, and skeleton by skeleton, they build an undersea city. Tiny photosynthetic algae partners living inside the polyps give the corals their brilliant colors and generate energy for their hosts.</p>



<p>Seaweed, however, takes up space and soaks up light that could otherwise be used by corals. If corals decline in number due to stressors like heat or disease, seaweed can quickly proliferate and take their place.</p>



<p>Bourne, a marine biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, wanted to know if the seaweed-removal program being run by Earthwatch was effective. From 2018 to 2021, volunteers pruned seaweed from 24 sections of the reef — each 5 meters by 5 meters — several times per year, while leaving other seaweed-laden areas alone. In total, they removed a whopping 2,148 kilograms of seaweed.</p>



<p>At the start, the tended plots had enough corals to cover only about 34 square meters. Removing <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.14502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macroalgae from those plots</a> led to a total gain of nearly 203 square meters of coral cover, enough to blanket a tennis court, Bourne’s team reported September 13 in the <em>Journal of Applied Ecology</em>. This change wasn’t seen in the plots left unpruned.</p>

These photos show the same part of the reef in May 2019 and May 2023.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132517">Hillary Smith</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s not surprising that we saw some recovery,” Bourne says. “What was surprising was the amount of recovery and how quickly it happened.” Sea-weeding is a straightforward way to skew the reef’s competitive balance and help corals thrive, he says.</p>



<p>Bourne hopes the simplicity of the approach will help it spread. “The advantage of sea-weeding is it’s really low tech; anybody can do it,” he says. Plus, seaweed tends to be an issue on reefs that are close to shore and known to local communities, “so there’s active groups that are interested in helping.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">‘Re-skinning’ a coral skeleton</h4>



<p>Though it may sound macabre, the calcium carbonate skeletons of dead reefs can serve as vital scaffolding for new corals to flourish. “Re-skinning” a dead reef takes advantage of coral microfragments, small bits of coral polyps. Growing microfragments in the lab and then transplanting them onto reef skeletons can, in a way, bring a dead ecosystem back to life.</p>



<p>David Vaughan discovered the restorative potential of coral microfragments through what he calls a “eureka mistake.” Vaughan, formerly executive director of Mote and now head of the nonprofit <a href="https://plantamillioncorals.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant A Million Corals</a> in Summerland Key, Fla., accidentally broke off shards of a branching coral while moving it to a new tank. Some coral polyps remained on the bottom of the tank. Vaughan assumed the tiny animals wouldn’t survive. But when he checked on them about two weeks later, he saw instead that they had quickly grown and multiplied.</p>



<p>Large corals grow slowly, Muller says, because they have to put a lot of energy into creating more of their calcium carbonate skeleton. If you instead affix multiple microfragments, consisting of a thin skeletal layer with a small bit of live coral tissue on top, near each other on a hard surface, <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1313/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they grow rapidly and fuse together</a>. Mote scientists “hacked the biology of a lot of these slow-growing species to encourage them to put a lot of their resources into creating tissue faster,” Muller says.</p>

<p>A 2018 study found that microfragments of the mountainous star coral (<em>Orbicella faveolata</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857418303094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew 10 times as much tissue</a> over a 31-month period as the normal, larger fragments that were previously used for reef restoration. For every square centimeter of coral that was planted at the beginning of the experiment, microfragments grew an average of 3.38 square centimeters of new tissue, while larger fragments grew only 0.35 square centimeters. Ocean plantings of coral microfragments have since withstood disease, bleaching and hurricanes, and grown large enough to reproduce within several years.</p>



<p>“Spawning after five years,” Spadaro says, “was definitely a game changer in terms of restoration.” Re-skinning with microfragments can give you functional reef ecosystems in a fraction of the time as previous methods. Mote scientists have since shared their knowledge with others working to restore corals around the world, such as in Hawaii and the Caribbean.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Making shade</h4>



<p>Bleaching is the dramatic outcome of great hardship; pushed to the brink by extreme stress, a strained coral <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">belches out its symbiotic photosynthetic algae</a>, turning stark white and losing its primary food source. Excessive heat is the most common culprit, but it’s not the only one.</p>



<p>Excess light can lead to bleaching, too, says Peter Butcherine, a biologist at Southern Cross University in Coffs Harbour, Australia. Too much light during photosynthesis, performed by the corals’ algae partners, leads to an abundance of toxic oxygen-containing molecules that are highly reactive and can cause cell death. Protecting corals from too much sun exposure can help prevent bleaching, but “you can&#8217;t roll out thousands of square meters of shade cloth” to shield an area the size of the Great Barrier Reef, Butcherine says.</p>



<p>Instead, Butcherine and others have turned to a more ephemeral approach: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.919382/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating fog</a>. “It&#8217;s essentially a sea mist,” Butcherine says. Though misting the entire Great Barrier Reef isn’t feasible, marine fog could be used to protect sensitive parts of the reef during the time of day when sunlight is at its harshest.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Too much sunlight can lead to coral bleaching, much like excessive heat can. By creating artificial marine fog using arrays of misters mounted to ships, like what’s seen in this video, researchers hope to shield reefs such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef from harmful rays.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Butcherine and colleagues showed that <a></a><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1162896/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shading corals for just four hours a day can delay bleaching</a> even when water temperatures are high, such that corals could withstand three extra weeks of bleaching-level heat. The results of that laboratory study were published in the Sept. 20 <em>Frontiers in Marine Science</em>. This delay could help corals hold on to their algal partners until the environment around them cools.</p>



<p>Because it’s still being developed, marine fogging is quite expensive; it requires large arrays of misters mounted to ships. But Butcherine is excited by the potential of using solar power, including sun-powered drones mounted with misters, to implement the technique at a wider scale, and even at other reefs around the world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I&#8217;m optimistic that we can make a difference,” Butcherine says.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Amidst the COVID-19 calamity, one can argue that science is one of the few aspects of the human response that has worked relatively well. However, despite the many advances in preventing and treating COVID-19, there have also been missteps as the world has scrambled to respond to a deadly new pathogen. It has been humbling for the U.S. to lead large high-income countries in per capita deaths from COVID-19 even with its wealth and scientific expertise. We are all too aware of the needless illnesses and deaths that have resulted from misguided political leadership, inadequate preparation, delayed responses, fragile supply chains, health disparities, and vaccine hesitancy. But we will not dwell on these issues here. Rather, we would like to review the COVID-19 pandemic through the prism of the 3R’s of research integrity: rigor, reproducibility, and responsibility. These form the fundamental pillars of the foundation of science. It is appropriate that we devote more attention to the foibles than to the successes so that we can learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities. What could have been done better? What needs to improve?</p>



<span id="more-128137"></span>



<p>Has COVID research been rigorous and reproducible?&nbsp; Certainly, much of the work that brought us vaccines and new therapies has been. But unfortunately, other instances have fallen far short of rigor. Perhaps the most prominent example early in the pandemic related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases, were suggested as possible therapies for SARS in 2003, but were not formally studied in a clinical setting. Shortly after the COVID pandemic began to take off in China, rumors of a possible benefit of these agents began to appear in social media. On February 19, 2020, a letter was published in an obscure Asian journal, which mentioned a press briefing reporting that chloroquine improved clinical outcomes compared to control treatment in more than 100 patients with COVID-19 in China. No data were provided however, and the paper initially attracted little notice. However, on March 4, an article from a prominent research group in France led by Dr. Didier Raoult appeared in the <em>International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents</em>, reviewing the <em>in vitro </em>antiviral activity of chloroquine against coronaviruses and referring to the reportedly favorable experience in China.</p>



<p>On March 13, two cryptocurrency investors, Greg Rigano and James Todaro, posted a non-peer-reviewed paper online, touting chloroquine as “an effective treatment for COVID-19.” The authors claimed some prestigious institutional affiliations, which were subsequently disavowed, but nevertheless their paper was tweeted by Elon Musk to over 40 million followers, and one of the authors was interviewed by Tucker Carlson of Fox News, who publicized the claims to millions of viewers. On March 16, a preprint from Dr. Raoult and his group reported the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in 26 patients, who were compared with 16 controls receiving standard care. Viral clearance as measured by PCR was reported to be more rapid in recipients of hydroxychloroquine and much more rapid in those who also received azithromycin. The paper was accepted for publication soon afterward.</p>



<p>Red flags about this paper were raised almost immediately, but not before hydroxychloroquine was being touted by President Donald Trump as a “game changer” that would be fast-tracked by the FDA for approval. On March 28, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19. Among the concerns regarding the French study were the small sample size, the lack of randomization (which resulted in poorly matched study and control groups), the use of different diagnostic assays, and the failure to account for six patients who had been initially enrolled in the study. It was also noted that the Editor-in-Chief of the journal publishing the article was one of the authors, and the review process took less than 24 hours. The same research group subsequently published a paper reporting that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 92% effective in more than 1,000 patients with early COVID-19. However, the follow-up study did not include a control group. Dr. Raoult was quoted as saying that randomized controlled trials are unnecessary and unethical in deadly infectious diseases and appeal only to statisticians “<em>who have never seen a patient</em>.” Meanwhile, he initiated a lawsuit against Dr. Elisabeth Bik, one of the scientists who had criticized his original paper on hydroxychloroquine.</p>



<p>We now know from numerous subsequent clinical studies involving thousands of patients that hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, is <em>not</em> beneficial for patients at any stage of COVID-19, nor for the prevention of infection, and may even be associated with a higher risk of death. With very few exceptions, the results are highly consistent. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization was withdrawn on June 15, 2020. Yet hydroxychloroquine has been given to countless patients on the basis of non-rigorous science and continues to be given in some settings to this day.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">As if to prove the adage that <em>history repeats itself—the first time as tragedy, the second as farce</em>, no sooner had enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine begun to wane, when a new unproven treatment began to gain rapidly in popularity—ivermectin. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone used to treat parasitic infections in humans and other animals. Early in the pandemic, Australian scientists reported that ivermectin could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It was quickly pointed out that the concentration of ivermectin required to inhibit viral replication greatly exceeded concentrations achievable from normal human dosing of the drug, but unfortunately this warning was unheeded.</p>



<p>Soon there were reports that ivermectin could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or reduce disease progression in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. A systematic review found that most clinical studies of ivermectin failed to meet predefined eligibility criteria and suffered from imprecision and a high risk of bias. The authors of the review concluded that it is uncertain whether ivermectin is beneficial in COVID-19. But this message was drowned out by ringing endorsements from groups like “America’s Frontline Doctors,” a group of physicians closely aligned with right-wing political organizations, which had originally advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID. A related group calling themselves the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, or FLCCC, led by a critical care physician in Wisconsin named Pierre Kory, lent their voices to these efforts. Dr. Kory was quoted as saying, “<em>My dream is that every household has ivermectin in their cupboard. And you take it upon development of the first symptom of anything approximating a viral symptom. . . Even if it’s not COVID, it’s safe to take it and it’s probably effective against that virus</em>.”</p>



<p>During that latter part of the summer of 2020, an explosive rise in ivermectin prescriptions was observed in the US. High doses of ivermectin can produce a variety of adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, respiratory failure, and coma. Poison centers found themselves swamped with calls about ivermectin overdoses. The FDA even issued a warning not to take ivermectin for COVID, noting that some people were even taking ivermectin preparations intended for the deworming of horses. Off-label ivermectin use continued to be popular on social media even though careful reviewers found serious flaws in the purported evidence for its benefits in COVID. An independent analysis<em> </em>failed to find a single clinical trial demonstrating a benefit from ivermectin in COVID that did not contain “<em>either obvious signs of fabrication or errors so critical that they invalidated the study</em>,” including the same patient data being used to represent multiple subjects, non-random patient selection, numbers unlikely to occur naturally, incorrectly calculated percentages, and an inability of local health organizations to corroborate that the studies took place.”</p>



<p>Were these aberrations? Extreme cases perhaps, but systematic analyses suggests that deficiencies in the rigor of COVID-related research have been commonplace. A study of 686 COVID-19 clinical research articles found shorter time to publication and lower methodological quality than for other articles in the same journals. This suggests a lowering of the usual standards for publication in the time of plague.</p>



<p>Another issue that cannot be ignored is the important role of social media in disseminating and amplifying misinformation. A commentary has discussed an urgent need for improved understanding and stewardship of global collective behavior, cautioning that it has become easy to connect and share information through social media, but “<em>in contexts where decisions depend upon accurate information, such processes can undermine collective intelligence and promote dangerous behavior</em>.” A lack of trust in government institutions is undermining public health efforts. A country-level analysis demonstrates an inverse correlation between confidence in institutions and COVID burden. As the epidemiologist Jay Kaufman observed, “<em>Science alone can’t heal a sick society. . . Science is a social process. . . To restore faith in science, there must be faith in social institutions</em>.” Our social divisions are literally killing us.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">more than 350 articles relating to COVID-19</a> have been retracted at the time of this writing. This is a modest number in view of the nearly 400,000 articles published on COVID, but it is nevertheless instructive to look at a few of the most high-profile retractions. Two of the retracted articles were published in the most prestigious and selective clinical journals in the world, the <em>Lancet</em> and the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The <em>Lancet</em> paper, published in May 2020, purported to describe a multinational registry analysis of 96,032 patients hospitalized with COVID and found that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were associated with decreased in-hospital survival. The <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> paper, published the following month, purported to analyze 8,910 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and found no association between the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and in-hospital mortality. Note that both of these findings have been subsequently confirmed by other legitimate studies, so what is in dispute is not the bottom-line findings of these articles. The problem is that the data were made up out of thin air. The retracted articles claimed to draw from an enormous registry including patients from 671 hospitals on six continents. One would expect such a monumental effort to involve hundreds if not thousands of contributors. However, suspicions quickly arose when no one could identify even a single hospital that had contributed to this registry, and major discrepancies were noted between the number of reported cases for some regions and data from independent sources.</p>



<p>Although both papers were retracted within weeks of publication, significant damage was done. Clinical trials had been suspended and international guidelines had been revised on the basis of the published findings. Editors and reviewers were apparently seduced by the reputation of the first author (a respected Harvard Professor) and the power of big data. The pressures of the pandemic may have allowed the papers to slip through the peer review process with less than the usual scrutiny. Dr. Sapan Desai, the founder of Surgisphere, the company that claimed to have assembled the registry, turned out to be a surgeon with multiple prior malpractice claims and little experience in data analytics. An investigation of his company identified just a handful of employees, several of whom had no background in science or data analysis, and the company was occupying rented office space. Dr. Amit Patel, a co-author on the studies, turned out to be Dr. Desai’s brother-in-law. The first author Dr. Mandeep Mehra admitted to not having seen any primary data. Although Dr. Desai has not admitted any wrongdoing, the Surgisphere papers are now believed to have been a hoax based on fabricated data. The editor-in-chief of the <em>Lancet </em>concluded that the study was a “<em>monumental fraud.</em>”&nbsp; Nevertheless, the papers have continued to be cited despite their retraction; each has been cited more than 700 times, and many of the citing articles appear to be unaware that the papers have been retracted.</p>



<p>Further evidence of peer review failure can be seen in two retracted articles by a psychologist named Harald Walach. Walach published articles claiming that COVID vaccines were responsible for two deaths for every three infections prevented and that face mask use results in hypercapnia in children. Although the papers were strongly criticized for their nonsensical findings and quickly retracted by the journals <em>Vaccines</em> and <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>, they were widely circulated and continue to be cited by anti-vaccine and anti-face mask advocates.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Serious questions regarding scientific responsibility have arisen during the pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 was initially assumed to have arisen as a zoonotic pathogen making a species jump from bats to humans, possibly via an intermediate host, subsequent attention was focused on the possibility of transmission from a lab leak involving scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus research is performed. Speculations were made about whether so-called “Gain-of-Function” research to identify viral adaptations that facilitate human infection might have inadvertently led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. At this time, the weight of scientific evidence favors a natural origin. Nevertheless, the lack of transparency on the part of the Chinese government and the politicization of the issue have raised uncomfortable questions about whether scientists are adequately considering and mitigating the public health risks of research with dangerous pathogens. As Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO has noted, “<em>Lab accidents happen</em>,” and it is incumbent upon scientists to be cognizant of these hazards and to take every possible precaution to minimize the risk to the public.<strong> </strong>In his classic description of the Black Death in London, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, Daniel Defoe wrote “<em>It mattered not from whence it came</em>.” But the origin of the pandemic does matter. Whether by zoonotic spillover or lab accident, we need to understand how the pandemic began in order to take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening again.</p>



<p>Although we have focused on some examples in which science fell short of its ideals during the COVID pandemic, overall, the scientific community acquitted itself well. We have already mentioned the remarkable success of vaccine development efforts. Scientists threw themselves wholeheartedly into COVID research, putting their other interests on hold. Collaborative and team science allowed the rapid execution of multinational trials, and data sharing, open access and preprint servers facilitated the timely dissemination of information. Critical knowledge regarding pre-symptomatic spread and superspreading, non-pharmaceutical interventions, diagnostic testing, distinction between protective and detrimental immune responses, ventilatory management, thromboembolic complications, and viral variants was quickly and widely shared, allowing substantial improvements in clinical outcomes as the pandemic proceeded.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, both the strengths and weaknesses of the contemporary scientific enterprise have been on ample display. Scientists produced a massive number of publications, but wading through this literature to find the truth has not been easy. As Robert Peter Gale wryly observed, the pandemic would be quickly ended if SARS-CoV-2 could be conquered by publications, guidelines, and interminable meetings alone. Due to the urgency of the pandemic, scientific standards were sometimes compromised. Limitations of randomized clinical trials as an exclusive source of knowledge to guide clinical decision-making were exposed. Important questions were raised about the potential dangers of scientific research on pathogenic microbes, while the origins of the pandemic have remained uncertain.</p>



<p>Vigorous debate is often regarded as a sign of a healthy scientific enterprise. However, open bickering among scientists about public health policies instead contributed to increasing societal polarization and undermining of public trust in science during the pandemic. Peter Sandman, an expert on risk communication, identified many mistakes made by officials in their messaging to the public, including a failure to communicate uncertainty and acknowledge error. Resistance to lockdowns and mandates were frequently met by backlash and hostility to public health officials. Unfortunately, the loss of credibility and public resistance to expert guidance have proven persistent, even as pandemic waves have receded.</p>



<p>Social media has posed a formidable challenge by creating alternative sources of information and disinformation that compete with science in influencing policy-making and public opinion. This represents a serious threat that society has scarcely begun to address. With science as just one among many potential sources of information, the imperative of making science as rigorous, as reproducible, and as responsible as possible becomes clear. Otherwise, why should anyone believe scientists rather than other sources claiming to represent the truth?  For science to retain its influence in society, efforts to make it more rigorous, reproducible, and responsible must be a ceaseless undertaking. Only scientists can carry the torch and continue to perform the high-quality research that will lead to better prevention and treatment, not only of COVID, but of future threats as well. </p>



<p>As Albert Camus observed in <em>The Plague, </em>“<em>What’s natural is the microbe. All the rest—health, integrity, purity—is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter</em>.” We can and must learn from our experience because it is a certainty that COVID will not be the last pandemic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-mirrors-magellan-largest-telescope">How giant mirrors are made for what will be the world’s largest telescope</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>TUCSON</strong> — Hot and dry air, perfused with a scent reminiscent of a warmed hair straightener, stuffed a hangar-sized room beneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. The space, part of the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, was dominated by a gyrating, carousel-sized furnace, fire truck red and shaped like a flying saucer. The swirling cocoon of a colossal light collector.</p>



<p>“It’s making 4.9 revolutions per minute,” says astronomer Buell Januzzi of the University of Arizona, raising his voice over the lab’s droning ventilation system. About half past noon on October 7, after about a week of gradual warming, the temperature inside the rotating machine had finally peaked at 1165° Celsius.</p>





<p>In the heart of that inferno, nearly 17,500 kilograms of borosilicate glass — roughly four semitruck loads — had melted into a crystal clear fluid. If all goes to plan, the molten material will anneal to form the body of an enormous mirror — one as tall as a two-story house, if stood on edge. The mirror is the last of seven needed to capture light for what will be the world’s most powerful optical instrument, <a href="https://giantmagellan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Giant Magellan Telescope</a>.</p>



<p>Slated to start operating in the late 2020s, the telescope, developed by an international consortium of research institutions, will repose on a mountaintop in Chile’s Atacama Desert, beneath some of the clearest night skies on Earth. There, within a yet-to-be-built, 22-story enclosure, the seven primary mirrors will be united in a flowerlike formation, Januzzi explains. “We’ve got six petals, and one in the middle.”</p>



<p>Together, the mirrors will function as a single unit, about as wide as an adult blue whale is long, that reflects light into the telescope’s secondary mirrors and, ultimately, its scientific instruments. This shiny expanse will provide the new telescope with an image resolution at least four times that of today’s most advanced space telescopes.</p>



<p>And unlike the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-distant-galaxies-surprises-space">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, best suited for measuring infrared light emitted by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-planet-trappist-1b-no-atmosphere">hot celestial bodies</a>, the Giant Magellan Telescope will excel at capturing optical and near-infrared wavelengths of light emitted by cooler, Earthlike worlds (<em>SN: 8/20/23;</em> <em>SN: 3/27/23</em>). That’s light that could potentially carry signatures of alien life.</p>



<p>“It’s going to give us the opportunity to find potentially habitable planets,” says astrobiologist Antígona Segura of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City.</p>



<p>Current instruments may be able to measure a particular exoplanet’s mass, says Segura, who isn’t involved with the telescope’s construction. And sometimes, researchers may even be able to detect certain molecules in a large exoplanet’s atmosphere when it passes in front of its star. This new telescope, however, will be able to directly measure a smaller planet’s atmosphere, without relying on a starlight backdrop, and detect much more of what floats within.<br><br>The telescope&#8217;s name originates with Ferdinand Magellan, leader of the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Some astronomers have called for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-renaming-magellanic-clouds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renaming the galaxies known as the Magellanic Clouds</a>, due partly to the explorer’s brutal actions toward Indigenous people (<em>SN: 9/26/23</em>). But according to a spokesperson from the consortium constructing the telescope, no decisions have yet been made to change the telescope’s name.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the marathon that is the casting of the mirrors continues. It took about eight years to fabricate JWST’s segmented, 6.5-meter-wide mirror. Casting the Giant Magellan Telescope’s primary mirrors — each nearly 8.5 meters wide — has been ongoing for roughly 18 years.</p>



<p>Starting with a glass-loaded furnace, it takes about a week to bring the enclosed material to peak temperature, causing it to melt and flow into a mold comprised of hexagonal columns. After three more months of cooling and annealing, the glass mirror resembles two pancakes sandwiching a honeycomb. The 80-percent-hollow structure is light enough to float on oil, but stiff enough to resist bending in the wind.</p>



<p>The mirror then undergoes two years of polishing, yielding a surface so smooth that if it were expanded to the size of North America, the tallest imperfection would be half as tall as a golf tee.</p>



<p>Finally, a 100-nanometer-thick coat of aluminum — excellent for reflecting visible light — is applied to the clear glass surface. It’s this last step that will enable the telescope to possibly capture glimpses of alien worlds, in wavelengths of light that our puny, human eyes can recognize.</p>
