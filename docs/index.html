                A midair blowout on a Boeing 737 Max 9 showed seatbelts matter, but infants under two still aren’t required to have their own seats. Experts say changing the rules would make flying safer for children—but would result in more deaths.

                <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_ba1f89b81c2042cbb20586cddcc08c8f~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_638,h_798,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>Hello, readers! As we wave goodbye to 2023, let’s take a moment to reflect on the incredible year that we’ve had at Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK). From engaging events, to insightful social media posts, enlightening blogs and informative newsletters, it’s been a year of growth, learning, and connection. Here are some of our highlights:</p>

<p><strong>Growing volunteer team</strong></p>
<p>This year we recruited over 20 new people to join the WiNUK volunteer team, and many new guest blog writers too.</p>

<p>After many virtual-only group meetings, we saw our first in-person volunteer meet-ups this year – including at Cambridge’s Zoology Museum, the British Neuroscience Association Festival, and New Scientist Live. I can’t wait to meet more of you this year as we develop our first in-person WiNUK events.</p>

<p>You can view our current and alumni volunteer members over on <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/team" target="_blank" ><u>Our Team page</u></a>. Keep in touch with us on social media for upcoming role openings in the team!</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/undefined"></figure>

<p>Despite being titled Women in Neuroscience UK (in relation to where our organisation has been established), we have successfully engaged volunteers, followers and event participants, globally! It’s been amazing to see you signing up for our events from 38 different countries, and to see our worldwide following on social media grow too. Regardless of our name, we want WiNUK to be a community open to people everywhere and it’s fantastic to see you taking up our opportunities!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Six educational events</strong></p>
<p>This year we aimed to deliver monthly events during term time, with our annual record of six virtual events and 555 audience sign-ups.</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_198a2939165b4ff2b57b1c64e00ade1c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_647,h_808,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>It was great to start the year with conversations on managing stress, self-care and mental health in academia. Read more about our February event,<a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/minds-matter-rethinking-mental-health-in-academia" target="_blank" ><u> ‘Minds Matter: Let’s Talk About Mental Health’</u></a>, in our blog by Lauren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In March we learned about ‘Opportunities in Dementia Research’ from representatives of ISTAART, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the UK Dementia Research Institute. This event garnered our most global audience to date, with registrants from 25 countries.</p>

<p>Our event on ‘Alternate Careers in Neuroscience’ in April, featuring a science illustrator, neuroscience communicator for children, and dementia conference organiser, was the most popular of our events this year, with 161 registrants.</p>

<p>In May we focused on stroke, and were proud to put together an event covering the experiences of a stroke survivor, innovative stroke research, as well as valuable information from Stroke Association.</p>

<p>After the summer break, our team got back to developing virtual events, with the next focusing on ‘Inclusion and Belonging: Addressing Neurodiversity’ in November. It was a fantastically balanced event between lived experience of PhD researchers with ADHD and novel research from leading neurodiversity scientists.</p>

<p>Our final event of 2023 was ‘Decoding the Application Process’. The team are very proud of our new Events Team volunteers who hosted this one excellently, fielding fantastic questions from the audience to our panel of experts across academic career stages, as well as industry.</p>

<p>We’re still working on detailed evaluation of the feedback and impact of our 2023 events to include in WiNUK’s Annual Impact Report- keep your eyes peeled for this!</p>
<p>For any events you missed from 2023, head to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xZxubRWEr3MT0zI6ip_Bw" target="_blank" ><u>YouTube channel</u></a> to catch up.</p>

<p><strong>Social media community growth</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_b226b7f736b54ebe945f7026384dee36~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_582,h_727,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>This year our social media really took off, with 132 new posts to our Instagram, X and LinkedIn, and each of these are now at almost 1000 followers. You appreciated our virtual events being recorded to catch up with on our YouTube channel too.</p>

<p>You enjoyed our social media ‘how to’ guides on scientific papers and CVs, as well as our advice on fostering inclusive working environments, specifically on neurodiversity and gender equity.</p>

<p>Our most popular content, across all engagement metrics, included statistics on the decline in female scientists with increasing career stage seniority. I am, personally, so proud that WiNUK are initiating conversations on this important topic, to inspire better structures for support of women in neuroscience across all career stages.</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_0c5ec40ad58243e48dd24eb874606854~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_585,h_731,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>One of WiNUK’s highlights of 2023 was my takeover of the UKDRI Twitter, now X, on behalf of WiNUK for International Women’s Day in February. This was a fantastic opportunity to highlight female role models in dementia research, but also the sex and gender inequalities in dementia care, treatment and research. Our collaboration was hugely successful, uniting charities, universities and researchers in these conversations. And you don’t just have to take my word for it- on my takeover day, the engagement on UKDRI account hugely increased to 7x their average retweets and 24x their average number of replies! Thank you to the UKDRI Communications Team for trusting us with this collaboration and for continuing to support our mission.</p>

<p>In September we launched our new social media series, ‘Present your Lab Technique’, where neuroscientists opened the door to the ‘behind the scenes’ of their research, through infographics, videos and live Q&As. These monthly features have been a great source of inspiration for aspiring scientists at high school level up to experienced researchers, and we’re excited to see this project continue in 2024.</p>

<p>Do go and follow @WomeninNeuroUK on social media if you haven’t already! We’ll soon be relaunching our TikTok so keep your eyes peeled for that too!</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/undefined"></figure>

<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>That’s a wrap for WiNUK in 2023, but we’re just getting started…</p>

<p>This year, our content has been designed to connect you with a welcoming community, but also to educate you in several ways. Not only in the typical sense, with speakers and our graphics often sharing knowledge on neuroscientific content, but also educating on the challenges for women with neurological conditions and sharing our recommendations for inclusive scientific workplaces, to reduce the difficult career experiences of female neuroscientists. I hope that women and girls have found WiNUK platforms to be a safe haven of support this year, where your voices have been heard and amplified. I sincerely thank our speakers and our volunteers this year for your willingness to share your thoughts and experiences to help our audience of mixed genders to all strive for better conditions for women in science.</p>

<p>Join us in 2024 for more inspiring neuroscience and careers advice, networking connections, and advocacy for inclusive science communities for all. </p>

<p>This will be a big year for WiNUK, with our first in-person event and physical merchandise coming very soon – this is all still confidential but will be hot news soon, so stay tuned to our social media and mailing list! </p>

<p>To all our WiNUK supporters, I wish you a happy and healthy 2024, filled with successes in your science, career and personal life. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fiber-inspired-polar-bears-traps-heat">A fiber inspired by polar bears traps heat as well as down feathers do</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Arctic’s extreme cold is no match for a polar bear’s super-insulating fur. Humans could one day benefit from a similar material, thanks to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj8013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new fiber</a> that mimics the bears’ porous hairs. A sweater knit from the fiber is about one-fifth the thickness of a down coat but similarly warm, researchers report in the Dec. 22 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Like polar bear hair, the fiber’s core is filled with thousands of pores — tiny pockets of air that help prevent heat loss — and surrounded by a flexible, waterproof sheath. But unlike hair, which is made of keratin, the core is built from a synthetic material called an aerogel.</p>



<p>Aerogels are ultralight, porous gels that are excellent insulators. NASA uses them to insulate rocket parts, and they can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-insulation-material-weightless-durable-extreme-heat">withstand extreme heat </a>(<em>SN: 2/14/19</em>). However, aerogels tend to be fragile, hindering their use in textiles.</p>

<p>To create a more robust aerogel, materials scientist Hao Bai and colleagues spun and froze a thread of aerogel made from chitosan, a polymer found in the exoskeletons of shellfish. Freeze-drying the string and coating it in a pliable plastic called thermoplastic polyurethane added strength. The resulting fiber can hold up to 500 grams, about the weight of three billiard balls. And it can be knit, dyed and washed. The fiber’s texture falls between plastic and cotton, says Bai, of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.</p>



<p>“I think it can be a product for [the] general public in the near future, in addition to specialized groups” such as the military or space agencies, Bai says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-urban-complex-ecuador-amazon-laser">An ancient, massive urban complex has been found in the Ecuadorian Amazon</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have uncovered the Amazon’s earliest and largest example of farm-based citylike settlements high in the foothills of the Ecuadorian Andes.</p>



<p>The thousands of mounds, plazas, terraces, roads and agricultural fields — <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi6317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed for the first time</a> in their fullest extent by airborne laser scans — necessitate a rethinking of just how complex ancient civilizations of the Amazon may have been, researchers report in the Jan. 12 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Over the last decade or so, the use of light detection and ranging, or lidar, in archaeology has led to significant discoveries in tropical climates, where ancient settlements <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-maya-politics-power-neighborhoods-lidar%20">often lay obscured beneath dense jungle</a> (<em>SN: 12/4/23</em>). In 2018, researchers released scans of remnants of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">Mayan settlements in Guatemala</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-americas-olmec-maya-star-calendar">Olmec ruins in Mexico</a> in 2021 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia">Casarabe sites</a> in the Bolivian Amazon in 2022, all which have been revealed to be metropolitan-like settlements filled with complex infrastructure (<em>SN: 9/27/18; SN: 1/6/23; SN: 5/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a gold rush scenario, especially for the Americas and the Amazon,” says Christopher Fisher, an archaeologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who has scanned sites throughout the Americas but was not involved in the new research. “Scientists are demonstrating conclusively that there were a lot more people in these areas, and that they significantly modified the landscape,” he says. “This is a paradigm shift in our thinking about how extensively people occupied these areas.”</p>

Rostain</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For decades, archaeologists have visited the Upano Valley, a fertile basin at the foot of a massive volcano in the eastern foothills of the Andes, to excavate hundreds of human-made mounds left by pre-Hispanic peoples. But, until 2015, Upano had not yet been systematically imaged like other, similarly sized Mesoamerican settlements to the north.</p>



<p>Then, the Ecuadorian government scanned a 600-square-kilometer swathe of the valley. Based on his own expeditions in the valley over many years, archaeologist Stéphen Rostain of CNRS in Paris expected to see extensive infrastructure in the scans. But he was still surprised by the scale of what once existed when he and colleagues analyzed the lidar data.</p>



<p>Beneath the tree canopy was a massive network of roughly 6,000 mounds — once homes and community spaces — clustered into 15 settlements and connected by an intricate road system. The lidar data also revealed that the open spaces between settlements were in fact agricultural fields that had been drained to grow crops such as maize, beans, sweet potatoes and yucca. Within the settlements, the researchers found tiered gardens that would have kept some food closer at hand.</p>



<p>Put together, the results show that the valley wasn’t simply a series of small villages linked by roads, but “an entirely human-engineered landscape” built by skilled urban planners, Rostain says. Dating from several sites suggests the area was inhabited for roughly 2,000 years beginning around 500 B.C. by at least five different cultural groups. A next step will be to calculate how many people might have lived there.</p>



<p>“This landscape scale we&#8217;re able to document via airborne lidar really helps us understand what the variety of urbanism was in the past,” says Anna Cohen, an anthropological archaeologist at Utah State University in Logan who was not involved in the work. In particular, “it shows that you need to look at these green spaces in addition to the buildings.”</p>



<p>Beyond what the work says about the landscape, Fisher says, it’s also revealing a lot about the people who lived there. After Europeans’ conquest in predominately the 1500s, many Indigenous populations were almost wiped out by disease. “We see the Amazon today as a pristine tropical forest, but in reality, it&#8217;s an abandoned garden,” he says. “And this is the first time we&#8217;ve been able to see these people since they were victims of this incredible mortality event.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/numbats-overheat-climate-change-marsupials">Numbats are built to hold heat, making climate change extra risky for the marsupials</a></h4>

              
                <p>Numbats are curious creatures. The only marsupials that are active solely during the day, when they scratch at soil and rotting logs for termites, these squirrel-sized animals are built to hoard body heat. But that same energy-saving trait may put the already endangered animals at risk as the climate warms, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Already, even brief sun exposure on days over 23° Celsius (73° Fahrenheit) can severely <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.246301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limit the time the Australian marsupials can spend foraging</a>, researchers report January 11 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. Numbats might rapidly overheat in the sun, even at relatively reasonable temperatures, the team finds.</p>



<p>“Climate change means that numbat habitats are becoming hotter and drier, with more extreme heat-wave events,” says Christine Cooper, an environmental physiologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. She and her colleague — Philip Withers at the University of Western Australia, also in Perth — wanted to know how higher temperatures might impact the animals, and what that might mean for the numbats’ future conservation.</p>



<p>Numbats (<a><em>Myrmecobius fasciatus</em>) </a>once ranged across much of the southern half of Australia, but wild individuals are now limited to a handful of small populations in the western part of the country. Habitat loss coupled with introduced cats and red foxes continue to imperil the marsupials, and the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/14222/21949380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">species is now considered endangered</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>



<p>Add in climate change, and the animals may be increasingly caught between a rock and a hot place: They exclusively eat termites and can forage only during the day when their prey is active. Termites make for a low-cal diet, so the marsupials are adapted to maximize heat gain to save energy they’ll need in cooler temperatures, Cooper says.</p>



<p>To measure in detail how numbats’ bodies heat up in varied environmental conditions, the researchers slowly drove around two nature reserves near Perth, recording numbats’ surface temperature using a thermal imaging camera fitted with a telephoto lens. Over 2020 and 2021, the team recorded numbats with the thermal camera on 50 occasions. Of those numbat sightings, 62 percent were spotted in the sunshine. The recordings showed that the surface temperature of some body regions of a numbat can increase to 35° C or more, suggesting the animals rapidly heat up in the sun.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A video from a thermal imaging camera (temperature scale on the right) shows a numbat walking into a warmer area from a cooler area. The surface temperature of some parts of a numbat’s body can increase to 35° Celsius or more, suggesting the animals rapidly heat up in the sun. The finding suggests that, as the climate warms, numbats may need to keep their termite foraging forays short to avoid overheating.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Using environmental and body temperature data from the thermal images, the researchers then calculated how much, and how fast, a numbat might heat up. When temperatures exceed 23⁰ C, numbats may brave the sun in only short stints, maybe about 10 minutes, before reaching a core body temperature of 40⁰ C, the maximum body temperature ever recorded for an active numbat, Cooper says.</p>



<p>Ducking into the shade when the heat gets too intense isn’t a perfect solution, the team found.</p>



<p>Based on the team’s calculations, only about 18 percent of the heat numbats absorbed came directly from the sun itself. Heat from the hot air and radiating from the ground also warmed the animals. In increasingly hot conditions caused by climate change, even the shade might become too hot for numbats to properly function and might make it difficult for them to hunt their termite prey, though it is not clear how much these animals, compared with others, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-species-will-or-wont-manage-warming-world">can adapt to rising temperatures</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/14</em>).</p>



<p>Numbats might be able to shift their foraging to earlier and later in the day. But “if temperatures become too extreme, numbats might not have sufficient time to forage during daylight, and it is unlikely that they can survive when foraging at night,” Cooper says. Once night falls, the termites retreat deeper underground and out of reach, and the numbats face additional exposure to native and non-native predators alike.</p>



<p>A key next step would be to see how a loss of termite hunting ability from extreme heat impacts numbats’ survival or reproduction, says Eric Riddell, a global change biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In doing so, “we can actually draw more direct associations between how hot the animal gets and its ability to survive.”</p>

<p>Neri Oxman’s problems may be getting worse.</p>



<p>The researcher, who has become embroiled in plagiarism accusations following her billionaire husband’s push to depose the president of Harvard for plagiarizing in her thesis, appears to have lifted about 100 words in her thesis from an article that has been plagiarized before.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-ackman-wife-neri-oxman-mit-dissertation-plagiarism-2024-1"><em>Business Insider</em> reported</a> that Oxman “plagiarized multiple paragraphs of her 2010 doctoral dissertation…including at least one passage directly lifted from other writers without citation.” Oxman, who earned her PhD at MIT and was later a professor there until 2020, has since <a href="https://twitter.com/NeriOxman/status/1742993073078947843">acknowledged some citation errors</a>.</p>



<p>The new allegation is that Oxman’s thesis also lifted about 100 words from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220301141411/https:/physicsworld.com/a/physics-technology-and-the-olympics/">2000 article</a> in <em>Physics World</em> without quoting or citing the piece. (See a comparison <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-11-at-10.37.07%E2%80%AFAM.png">here</a> using the Vroniplag similarity detector set at a minimum of six consecutive words of overlap. The 2000 article text is on the left, and part of the thesis is on the right.) That article was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/28/this-is-frankly-insulting-an-author-plagiarized-by-a-journal-editor-speaks/">plagiarized in 2005</a> by a then-leading sports medicine expert, Paul McCrory, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/concussion-kingpin-resigns-global-post-over-plagiarism-scandal">resigned from a key post in 2022</a> following revelations of that and other pilfering. McCrory has now had more than <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMcCrory%252c%2bPaul">ten papers retracted</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/steve-haake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Haake</a>, a sports engineer who wrote the 2000 <em>Physics World</em> article, was alerted to the overlap, and who in turn alerted us to it told Retraction Watch that Oxman: </p>

<p>The overlap was also <a href="https://twitter.com/literalbanana/status/1743845961116582370">noted by an X user on January 6</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/12/philosophers-meet-the-plagiarism-police-michael-dougherty/">Michael Dougherty</a>, who has documented plagiarism throughout the philosophy literature and has written an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Correcting-Scholarly-Record-Research-Integrity/dp/3319994344">academic book</a> on the subject, said the identified text seems to be “one more [example] where quotation marks and a precise footnote attribution to Haake’s words are warranted,” noting “Oxman <a href="https://twitter.com/NeriOxman/status/1742993073078947843">has pledged</a> to correct the failures of attribution in her dissertation.”</p>



<p>He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Without basic punctuation and source attribution, readers cannot know whose voice is truly speaking in the text, and genuine authors are left uncredited. I don’t see any reference to Haake in the dissertation.</p>

<p>Sleuth Nick Brown, who was involved in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/02/was-leading-sports-medicine-researchers-plagiarism-an-isolated-and-unfortunate-incident/">determining the extent</a> of McCrory’s plagiarism, told Retraction Watch he did not “think this is remotely as bad as what we saw from Paul McCrory. It probably didn&#8217;t save her much time compared to writing her own three or four sentences from scratch.”</p>



<p>Brown continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Of course, in an ideal world the right amount of text for anyone to be recycling from other authors (or, in most cases, themselves) without attribution is zero, but this kind of thing seems to be so common that if we set out to retract a PhD every time it happened we would never finish. A correction and 15 minutes of awkwardness are probably appropriate consequences, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator. I do think it&#8217;s pretty amazing that two prominent cases of plagiarism link into the same piece from a non-academic publication!&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-fossilized-skin-life-adapt-land">The oldest known fossilized skin shows how life adapted to land</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dark sliver of rock pulled from an Oklahoma limestone quarry is the world’s oldest fossil cast of skin ever found.</p>



<p>The fossil <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01663-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is nearly 290 million years old</a>, and once dressed an early member of the amniotes, a clade of four-legged vertebrates that evolved from amphibians and includes all reptiles, birds and mammals, researchers report January 11 in <em>Current Biology</em>. It’s 21 million years older than the only other reported fossilized skin from the Paleozoic Era, spanning 541 million to 252 million years ago, during which animals moved onshore and diversified.</p>



<p>“This is definitively the oldest [known] piece of mummified skin,” says paleontologist Ethan Mooney of the University of Toronto Mississauga. It fits “into a broader story of how the first animals left the water and went onto land.”</p>



<p>Fossil collectors Bill and Julie May found the cast, along with exquisitely preserved skin impressions, at an Oklahoma quarry in an ancient limestone cave system known as Richards Spur.</p>



<p>There, a special concoction of cave conditions contributed to the fossils’ superb preservation. Corpses were buried in fine sediments, which excluded oxygen and slowed decay, and were exposed to groundwater rich in iron, an element that helps preserve tissues. Also, the site was an ancient oil seep. Petroleum and tar permeated the remains, sealing them off from decaying conditions while also staining them black.</p>

<p>The skin samples all possess nonoverlapping scales, though the scale sizes, distributions and abundances vary. The specimens probably come from different places on the amniote body, Mooney’s team suggests, and possibly different animals too.</p>



<p>Cast cross sections revealed a thickened outer skin layer, or epidermis. The development of a robust epidermis would have protected the early amniotes from the elements while also helping it retain water.</p>



<p>That surficial innovation eventually led to bird feathers and mammalian hair follicles. Tough and bumpy amniote skin, Mooney says, was “the first stage.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-traced-galaxy-merge">The strongest known fast radio burst has been traced to a 7-galaxy pileup</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NEW ORLEANS</strong> — A mind-bogglingly strong spurt of electromagnetic energy has for the first time been traced back to a cluster of seven merging galaxies. The finding could bolster the hypothesis that such mysterious flareups, known as fast radio bursts, originate from bizarre, highly magnetized dead stars called magnetars.</p>



<p>Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are fleeting explosive events: They last fractions of a second but release as much energy as the sun does in a month. It remains unclear what causes these strange spectacles, first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">discovered in 2007</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>).</p>



<p>“We think they’re caused by some kind of very compact object, like a magnetar,” Alexa Gordon, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said January 9 during a news conference at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting. Researchers previously spotted a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">magnetar in our galaxy producing an FRB</a>, though nobody has shown that all such bursts can be attributed to magnetars (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>Using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, Gordon and her colleagues took a closer look at where FRB 20220610A, the most powerful and distant FRB discovered to date, came from. The team was surprised to find a collection of seven galaxies located 11 billion light-years from Earth, all crammed inside a region the size of the Milky Way.</p>



<p>“We expected some kind of monolithic spiral galaxy,” says Northwestern astronomer Wen-fai Fong. “It was kind of a jarring image.”</p>



<p>FRBs have been traced back to all sorts of environments, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gotcha-fast-radio-bursts-home-nabbed">lone galaxies</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">globular clusters</a> (<em>SN: 1/4/17; SN: 2/23/22</em>). But this was the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first seen emerging from a seven-galaxy pileup</a>, the team reported at the news conference and in a paper posted in November at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Such chaotic environments can lead to galaxies swapping gas, dust and other material, triggering the birth of new stars. If a massive star formed under these conditions, its death could have left behind a magnetar, potentially explaining the FRB. The team hopes to use the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the seven-galaxy system in detail to look for evidence of a magnetar.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-herders-dna-europeans-genetic-multiple-sclerosis">How ancient herders rewrote northern Europeans’ genetic story</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient herders, who rode horses and drove ox-drawn carts west out of their grassy homelands in southwest Asia, erased a DNA divide between far-flung farmers and hunter-gatherers-fishers around 5,000 years ago.</p>



<p>The molecular legacy of these ancient herders, known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">Yamnaya people</a>, reshaped Eurasians’ genetic profile, impacting everything from their descendants’ height to their susceptibility to some diseases (<em>SN: 3/3/23</em>). For instance, it left people today with predominantly northern European ancestry especially prone to developing multiple sclerosis. An international team of researchers describes these results, based on analyses of DNA from more than 1,600 ancient individuals, as well as new hints about the origins of the Yamnaya in four papers published January 10 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06865-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA evidence</a> fleshes out what’s known about the extent of Yamnaya people’s genetic reach. It reveals that the Yamnaya mated with members of a distinctive eastern European culture — named the Globular Amphora Culture for its large, globe-shaped vessels — before expanding into northern Europe, say evolutionary biologist Morten Allentoft, of Curtin University in Perth, Australia, and colleagues. That hybrid population adapted rapidly to its new surroundings and formed a dominant culture that archaeologists call <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">the Corded Ware Culture</a>, Allentoft’s group hypothesizes (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>).</p>



<p>These genetic discoveries align with previous archaeological evidence, says archaeologist Volker Heyd of the University of Helsinki, who did not participate in the new research. Corded Ware Culture artifacts also display stylistic contributions from non-Yamnaya people who came from northern, forested parts of western Asia, Heyd notes.</p>



<p>To conduct their analysis, Allentoft and colleagues combined newly extracted DNA from the bones and teeth of 317 Europeans and western Asians with previous genetic data from more than 1,300 ancient Europeans. Most sampled individuals lived between 11,000 and 3,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Although much remains unknown about Yamnaya ancestry, the new DNA evidence traces a large portion of these herders’ genetic origins to hunter-gatherers who lived near what’s now western Russia’s Don River. Remains of those hunter-gatherers excavated at an ancient graveyard in Russia called Golubaya Krinitsa date to around 7,300 years ago, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Archaeological finds place the origin of Yamnaya culture at around 5,400 to 5,300 years ago, so evidence of their genetic ancestry emerging two millennia earlier “is quite a surprise,” Heyd says. He suspects that hunter-gatherers whose more than 7,000-year-old remains and artifacts have been found across a big chunk of southwestern Asia, not just at the Russian graveyard, contributed to Yamnaya genetic origins.</p>



<p>The ancient advance of herders into Europe produced a serious genetic downside. Yamnaya people endowed northern Europeans today with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06618-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a heightened genetic risk for multiple sclerosis</a>, or MS, a disease in which the body’s immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, say University of Cambridge computational biologist William Barrie and colleagues.</p>



<p>MS affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-virus-vaccines-treatments">Precisely how genes, environmental factors and viruses produce MS is unknown</a> (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). MS rates reach as high as 303 per 100,000 individuals among northwestern Europeans, including Scandinavians, about twice the rates documented for most southern Europeans.</p>



<p>Barrie’s group compared ancient Eurasians’ DNA to modern DNA already collected from around 410,000 white British individuals. The researchers calculated that specific gene changes previously linked to a risk for developing MS emerged around 5,000 years ago among Yamnaya herders. Yamnaya migrations brought those gene variants to northern Europe where they continue to cluster at a high rate.</p>



<p>“Our analyses indicate that MS gene variants helped people survive in the past,” Barrie said at an online news conference held by the researchers in Copenhagen on January 9. Gene changes linked to MS boosted Yamnaya herders’ immune defenses against diseases transmitted from their horses, cattle, sheep and goats, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>Modern, sanitized environments have altered immune systems in ways that have increased MS risks for those who inherit these once advantageous genes for herders, they speculate. “This is the first evidence of this [evolutionary process] in an autoimmune disorder,” Barrie said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06705-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other inherited disease risks also emerged</a> from the new analyses of ancient DNA. For instance, present-day eastern Europeans — who display considerable ancestry from ancient hunter-gatherers in that region — inherited elevated levels of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-variant-linked-alzheimers-disease-triple-threat">a risk gene for Alzheimer’s disease, <em>APOE4</em></a>, from those groups, Barrie’s team finds (<em>SN: 9/22/17</em>). Past benefits of this gene variant are unclear.</p>



<p>In a separate analysis, University of Copenhagen geneticist Evan Irving-Pease and colleagues uncovered an association between Yamnaya ancestry and taller adult heights and lighter skin tones in ancient and modern northern Europeans relative to their southern counterparts.</p>



<p>In another surprise, tall, light-skinned <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06862-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamnaya people or their direct descendants served as the ancestors of modern Danes</a> after reaching what’s now Denmark around 4,850 years ago, Allentoft and colleagues report in a separate paper. Yamnaya descendants replaced farmers who had settled in the region after displacing native hunter-gatherer groups about 1,000 years earlier, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Danish archaeologists often assume that present-day Danes have descended from hunter-gatherers who occupied what’s now Denmark 14,000 to 15,000 years ago as the last Ice Age waned, Allentoft’s group says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-ape-extinct-earlier-than-thought">Earth’s largest ape went extinct 100,000 years earlier than once thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s largest ape vanished from Earth more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06900-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 years earlier than once thought</a>, pushed to extinction as the environment around it shifted, researchers report January 10 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The new extinction date comes from new analyses of fossils of <em>Gigantopithecus blacki</em>, as well as on the sediments of about a dozen caves in southern China where the ape once dwelled. Instead of dying out around 100,000 years ago, the ape was driven to extinction between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago, the team found.</p>



<p>The fate of <em>G. blacki</em>, twice the size of the largest modern apes and resembling a super-sized version of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tooth-fossil-shows-gigantopithecus-close-ties-modern-orangutans">its close cousin, the orangutan</a>, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vanished-giants">long been a mystery</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/19; SN: 6/24/44</em>). For about 2 million years, <em>G. blacki</em> inhabited a mosaic landscape of forests and grasses in what’s now southern China. It left behind only scattered remnants: thousands of teeth and four jawbones, unearthed in cave sediments in the region.</p>



<p>To establish a chronology for the ape’s extinction, paleoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues assembled an array of different dating techniques to determine the ape’s habits, diet and environment. In the teeth, they looked for data on the ape’s diet, measuring isotopes of carbon and oxygen as well as examining the teeth for tiny evidence of wear and tear — which can reveal not only diet, but also give hints of repeated behaviors and stress. The team also analyzed the cave sediments bearing the fossils, hunting for fossil pollen and conducting luminescence dating on radioactive elements within the sediments.</p>



<p>The team’s reconstruction revealed that around 700,000 to 600,000 years ago, southern China shifted from its forested landscape to a more seasonally-driven environment. Some apes, including the orangutans, were able to adapt to these changes. But <em>G. blacki</em> was unable to change rapidly enough, and its numbers slowly dwindled before going extinct, the team suggests.</p>



<p>The assembled evidence tells a convincing story that “the demise of <em>Gigantopithecus</em> coincided in southern China with a decrease of forest cover and expansion of savanna-like environments,” says Hervé Bocherens, a biogeologist at the University of Tuebingen in Germany. Still, he says, documenting the extinction of this species from the fossil record is tricky — and it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that pockets of <em>G. blacki</em> may have lingered in still-undiscovered caves for longer.</p>



<p>Understanding the fate of this ape, the researchers say, helps reveal how modern environmental pressures might push orangutans, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-alert-red-apes-dna-shows-big-losses-borneo-orangutans">now on the brink of extinction</a> as their habitat shrinks, over the edge (<em>SN: 1/25/06</em>).</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal has retracted seven articles by a prolific data fabricator – three and a half years after the publisher said it would retract 10 of his papers, and five months after the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) threatened the journal with sanctions for the delay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/23/an-elsevier-journal-said-it-would-retract-10-papers-two-years-ago-it-still-hasnt/">previously reported</a>, the <em>Journal of the Neurological Sciences</em> had decided by June 2020 to retract 10 articles by Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, who are currently in positions four and six on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> of retractions. But the papers remained intact until December 2023, when seven were retracted. The remaining three are still unmarked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have no idea why it took so long,” said Andrew Grey, of the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, who with colleagues Alison Avenell and Mark Bolland has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/09/analysis-casts-doubt-on-bone-researchers-body-of-work/">scrutinized</a> the work of Sato and Iwamoto. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">group’s efforts</a> have led to more than 100 retractions, but publishers <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2023.2295996">have yet to assess</a> a significant number of papers about which they have raised concerns. </p>



<span id="more-128539"></span>



<p>“We very much doubt that any action at all would have been forthcoming if we had not raised concerns, then followed up on multiple occasions, despite Elsevier having considerable knowledge of the Sato/Iwamoto integrity concerns,” Grey told Retraction Watch. “The involvement of COPE was probably pivotal in pushing the publisher to act, but, again, had we not repeatedly enquired of COPE as to what was happening, it is likely that nothing would have transpired.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Grey and his colleagues first contacted the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em> about concerns with two of Sato’s papers in 2017. They flagged eight others in the next two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal editor didn’t engage with the issue, the Elsevier journal manager responded occasionally but unhelpfully, the Elsevier integrity staff ignored requests for updates,” Grey said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, after years of inaction, Grey requested help from COPE. Soon after COPE got involved, the Elsevier director of publishing services said the journal editor and society affiliated with the journal had decided to retract the problematic articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given that we have made extensive efforts to find and contact all authors, we plan to now proceed with these retractions, unless COPE has serious concerns about this approach,” the Elsevier representative wrote in June 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When nothing had happened after two years, Grey and his colleagues followed up with COPE. The organization conducted another review, and in July 2023 sent <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Journal-of-Neurological-Sciences_COPE-review-July-2023.docx.pdf">a letter</a> to Elsevier research integrity staff noting the publisher had not responded to “repeated communications” or retracted the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter, signed by Iratxe Puebla, Facilitation and Integrity Officer, stated COPE was considering sanctions for the journal for “refus[ing] or fail[ing] to engage with COPE to remediate ethical issues.” It continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A group of three Trustees has reviewed the case and concluded that there is a clear breakdown in process speed and transparency at the journal level and/or publisher to journal communication. This is of particular concern in this case given that the articles report research involving humans and thus have implications for human health, in such situations the relevant COPE flowcharts would typically suggest an interim Expression of Concern to alert readers to the concerns about the publications. Consequently, the Trustee Board considers that the journal’s initial response, and the lack of follow-up response or steps to correct the record, are inconsistent with the standards that we expect from COPE members.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Puebla asked the journal to improve its processes, including those for investigating concerns about articles, communicating with the readers who raised the concerns, responding to COPE’s requests for information, and issuing retractions. Regarding the Sato papers the journal still hadn’t retracted, she wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We understand that the follow up on matters related to the accuracy or integrity of published work can take time, however, the journal indicated that a decision had been reached to retract the articles three years ago. We view the time elapsed as protracted and in breach of expectations per the Retraction guidelines. We request that you proceed with the publication of the retractions &#8211; or an appropriate public notification on the articles &#8211; without further delay.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>COPE gave the journal six months to make changes and report back on its progress, with a deadline of Jan. 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that point, the organization would “evaluate whether you have taken adequate steps to address our concerns about compliance with expectations of COPE members or, on the other hand, whether any further follow-up or further sanctions are required,” the letter stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on COPE’s <a href="https://publicationethics.org/files/u7140/COPE_Sanctions_Process_Flowchart_May2019.pdf">process for sanctions</a>, the letter to Elsevier seems to fall under the first category of actions: “Private, written notification to both journal and publisher that the member has failed to comply with COPE principles,” with opportunity to improve. Subsequently, members could be placed on probation, then have their membership revoked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Puebla has not responded to our request for comment on the letter and whether COPE was still considering sanctions for the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John D. England, the editor in chief of the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em>, has not responded to our request for comment. An Elsevier spokesperson sent us the following comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are continuing to investigate the papers published in the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em> and have reached out to the institutions where the research took place for additional information. We will continue to publish corrections to the record where appropriate and according to COPE guidelines and our own policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Grey told Retraction Watch that one of the Elsevier staffers to whom the letter was addressed, Mihail Grecea, a senior expert in publishing ethics, contacted him in November with the news that seven of the papers would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following articles were retracted in early December:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(03)00101-1/fulltext">Coagulation–fibrinolysis abnormalities in patients receiving antiparkinsonian agents</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(02)00210-1/fulltext">Hyperhomocysteinemia in Japanese patients with convalescent stage ischemic stroke: Effect of combined therapy with folic acid and mecobalamine</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(00)00458-5/fulltext">Risk factors for hip fracture among elderly patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(00)00298-7/fulltext">Influence of immobilization upon calcium metabolism in the week following hemiplegic stroke</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(98)00041-0/fulltext">Influence of immobilization on bone mass and bone metabolism in hemiplegic elderly patients with a long-standing stroke</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(04)00165-0/fulltext">Risk factors for hip fracture among elderly patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(04)00499-X/fulltext">Amelioration by mecobalamin of subclinical carpal tunnel syndrome involving unaffected limbs in stroke patients</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The papers have been cited more than 300 times collectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with two dozen citations since Elsevier told Grey and COPE it would retract them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their retraction notices are nearly identical, and copy the “concerns” COPE summarized in a table appended to its letter. One <a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(23)02284-0/fulltext">notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief due to concerns about the integrity of the research reported. Numerous concerns have been raised and verified regarding this article, including uncertain funding, implausible recruitment, implausible laboratory testing, overlapping and duplicate data with other publications, impossible data, and implausible investigator workload.</p>



<p>The Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in this article and decided to retract it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Grecea’s email “implied that there was not enough grounds for retracting” the remaining three papers, Grey said, although a university investigation recommended retracting <a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(98)00233-0/fulltext">one of them</a> for authorship misconduct. The <a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(99)00037-4/fulltext">other</a> <a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(99)00047-7/fulltext">two</a> articles shared coauthors, including the senior author, with the paper for which the university found authorship misconduct, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thus, it appears that Elsevier/JNS is reneging on its earlier undertaking to retract all 10 publications by the Sato/Iwamoto group,” Grey said. As he wrote in a reply to Grecea:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>More broadly, 119 of Dr Sato’s publications have now been retracted. Why should readers have any confidence that any of his remaining publications are reliable? In the absence of robust evidence of reliability, they should all be retracted.</p>

<p>A researcher in Turkey has lost seven papers about Islamic practices that he managed to publish in journals typically dedicated to childhood diseases.</p>



<p>Hüseyin Çaksen, of Necmettin Erbakan University, published the articles in the <em>Journal of Pediatric Neurology</em>, the <em>Journal of Child Science</em>, and the <em>Journal of Pediatric Epilepsy</em>, all Thieme titles. Feyza Çaksen is co-author of two.</p>



<p>The seven papers are:</p>



<span id="more-128535"></span>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0043-1774711">The Importance of Religion, Spirituality, and Spiritual Care in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis</a>,” published on May 22, 2023 in <em>Journal of Pediatric Neurology</em></li>

</ul>



<p>All of the notices simply say the paper “has been retracted as it is lacking scientific base.” How that was missed in peer review is unclear.</p>



<p>The move came a day after Urartu Şeker, an academic in Ankara, Turkey, tweeted about some of the work:</p>

<p>Neither Çaksen nor S. Burak Açıkel, the editor in chief of the journal, has responded to multiple requests for comment over the past several days.</p>



<p>Update, 1/13/23, 1400 UTC: Two other papers by Çaksen were also retracted:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-paleontology-central-park">The real culprit in a 19th century dinosaur whodunit is finally revealed</a></h4>

              
                <p>A sledgehammer dealt the final blow to New York City’s dream of a paleontology museum.</p>



<p>On May 3, 1871, workers broke into the workshop of famed British artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins. Inside, they came upon a plaster skeleton of a towering duck-billed dinosaur — modeled after the first dinosaur fossil unearthed in New Jersey 13 years earlier — alongside a statue of the beast as it would have appeared in life.</p>



<p>These were the first 3-D renderings of any North American dinosaur, a testament to the continent’s geologic past that scientists were only just beginning to understand. But the public would never see the skeleton or the statute.</p>



<p>The workers wrecked the workshop. Plans and drawings were torn to pieces. Sledgehammers shattered the dinosaurs.</p>



<p>In the more than 150 years since, this vandalism has remained one of the most infamous events in paleontology. The story passed down through the years is that the workshop was destroyed on the orders of New York political boss William Tweed in a malicious act of political and religious vengeance.</p>



<p>Tweed viewed dinosaurs as “inconsistent with the doctrines of received religion,” a paleontologist noted later in 1940. The destruction is cited as one of the early battles between a traditional Christian worldview and a growing scientific understanding of Earth’s deep past.</p>



<p>The loss of Hawkins’ dinosaurs has “always been a shock to the paleontological community,” says Vicky Coules, an art historian at the University of Bristol in England. It’s been thought that Tweed “was basically against the whole concept of dinosaurs,” she says.</p>



<p>But the story might be due for a rewrite. Recent historical sleuthing by Coules and her Ph.D. adviser Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol, suggests that the demise of Hawkins’ dinosaurs was not religiously motivated, or even ordered by Tweed.</p>



<p>Instead, the story that paleontologists tell about this affair may say more about the history of anti-evolution sentiment during the 20th century than in the 1800s.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who was Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins?</h4>



<p>Today, dinosaurs are everywhere, the most iconic creatures of the prehistoric past. Their place in the public imagination is in no small part due to Hawkins.</p>



<p>Hawkins dedicated his career to depicting the natural world, even helping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/darwins-evolution">Charles Darwin</a> illustrate the 1839 book <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em> (<em>SN: 1/16/09</em>). In 1854, Hawkins’ most famous artwork went on display when the Crystal Palace reopened in London. Thousands flocked to this showcase of (sometimes looted) wonders from across the British Empire. A natural history section featured life-size statues of dinosaurs made by Hawkins.</p>



<p>This was several years before Darwin published his theory of evolution and only about a decade after the term “dinosaur” had entered the lexicon. For many people, seeing Hawkins’ statues was the first time they had come face-to-face with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smithsonian-deep-time-exhibit-dinosaurs-fossil-hall">the concept of deep time</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>).</p>



<p>Displaying dinosaurs in the flesh was “enormously innovative,” Benton says. “No one had attempted anything like this before.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="514" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline1.jpg?resize=680%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="A photograph of dinosaur statues made by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins that are in a London Park" class="wp-image-3134789" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline1.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline1.jpg?resize=507%2C383&amp;ssl=1 507w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline1.jpg?resize=595%2C450&amp;ssl=1 595w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline1.jpg?resize=246%2C186&amp;ssl=1 246w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134789">Some of Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins’ Crystal Palace dinosaur statues are still on display in London.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134789">Ian Wright/Wikimedia Commons (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-SA 2.0 DEED</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The exhibit made Hawkins the de facto expert on depicting prehistoric life, and in 1868, the Board of Commissioners of Central Park — the group in charge of developing New York’s new green space — asked Hawkins to build similar statues. They were to be the centerpiece for the park’s planned Paleozoic Museum, dedicated to American paleontology.</p>



<p>At this time, most of the major dinosaur discoveries were happening in Europe or its colonies. American scientists had yet to dig into the ample bone grounds of western North America, and most of the continent’s major paleontological finds — including <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trex-lips-modern-lizards-dinosaur">Tyrannosaurs rex</a> </em>— were still at least a decade away (<em>SN: 3/30/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a small number of fossils were starting to come out of the East Coast, including a dinosaur with a flat, beaklike snout named <em>Hadrosaurus </em>found in New Jersey. The Paleozoic Museum, the Central Park commission thought, would give Americans a chance to prove that they too had a prehistory worth remembering. Hawkins’ Crystal Palace statutes “hit [the public] between the eyes,” Benton says. Now, “New York wanted that.”</p>



<p>Hawkins accepted the job. He would dedicate the next few years to a museum that would never open its doors. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The story that paleontologists tell</h4>



<p>In the 1860s, New York was a city on the rise. One of the men riding that high was William Tweed, a state senator who dominated the city’s political scene. Tweed stripped power from all who opposed him. In May 1870, for instance, he dissolved Central Park’s board of commissioners and created a new group filled with his cronies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By year’s end, the new commissioners canceled the Paleozoic Museum and moved to discontinue their relationship with Hawkins — without paying him.</p>



<p>The museum’s demise had been simmering in the background for months. Already, Hawkins’ workshop had been relocated from a government building to a shed in the park. The move made room for the growing collection of the upcoming American Museum of Natural History, which, unlike the publicly funded Paleozoic Museum, had the private financial backing of New York’s wealthiest citizens, including the banker J.P. Morgan.</p>



<p>Plans for the two museums coexisted for a while. But eventually, the park commissioners decided that a museum dedicated solely to paleontology and funded by the public was just too big a burden to take on. It didn’t help that at least one member of the park commission was also on the committee for the American Museum of Natural History.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="459" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline2.jpg?resize=680%2C459&#038;ssl=1" alt="A black-and-white sketch of what the inside of the Paleozoic Museum might have looked like" class="wp-image-3134790" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline2.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline2.jpg?resize=567%2C383&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline2.jpg?resize=667%2C450&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline2.jpg?resize=276%2C186&amp;ssl=1 276w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134790">Before being nixed, the Paleozoic Museum in Central Park was intended to be a showcase of North America’s prehistoric past (as seen in this sketch of what the museum might have looked like).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134790">Public domain</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In March 1871, the <em>New York Times </em>— which frequently ran stories critical of Tweed — reported on the loss of the Paleozoic Museum, which Hawkins had lamented at a public meeting.</p>



<p>Two months later, the artist’s dino models lay in pieces.</p>



<p>“Hawkins was distraught,” Coules says. The destruction sent ripples through the scientific community, eventually becoming one of the foundational stories in the history of American paleontology, she says.</p>



<p>And the villain in the story: Tweed.</p>



<p>The <em>Times </em>article allegedly sent Tweed into a rage, and he ordered one of his cronies to descend “upon the Paleozoic Museum with vengeance in his soul,” paleontologists later wrote.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just the bad press that supposedly angered Tweed. “There was always a rumor that there was some sort of creationist angle to it,” says paleontologist Carl Mehling of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>



<p>This version of the story, which paleontologists have repeated since at least the 1940s, rests on Tweed and his men referring to Hawkins’ dinosaurs as “pre-Adamite” animals and an incident in which one of Tweed’s followers told Hawkins he should focus on living animals. The argument fits into a common perception that emerged during the mid-20th century that religion and prehistory were often at odds in the late 19th century.</p>



<p>This is where the Central Park story begins to unravel.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rethinking the Central Park dinosaur scandal</h4>



<p>Last year while Coules was working on her Ph.D., she read up on Hawkins and things weren’t adding up.</p>



<p>For one, the timing of events didn’t make sense. Why would Tweed wait two months after the <em>Times</em> article to retaliate against Hawkins? When Coules dug up the newspaper story, she found it on Page 5, with no mention of Tweed in the article.</p>



<p>“My first question was, why on Earth would you be upset about that?” Coules recalls.</p>



<p>Tweed had bigger things to worry about. At the time, he had been accused of everything from bribery to money laundering. (Tweed was eventually arrested in late 1871 and died in prison several years later.) So it seemed odd that Tweed, who was fighting for his political life, would take such offense to a story buried so deep in the paper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="441" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline3.jpg?resize=680%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="A black-and-white photo of Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins next to a black-and-white photo of William Tweed" class="wp-image-3134791" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline3.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline3.jpg?resize=591%2C383&amp;ssl=1 591w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/120523_fk_dinosaur-mystery_inline3.jpg?resize=287%2C186&amp;ssl=1 287w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134791">In the 19th century, the artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins (left) was a well-known paleoartist while William Tweed (right) was infamous in New York City’s political scene.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134791">From left: Wikimedia Commons; Mathew Brady/National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Coules started to suspect another culprit: Henry Hilton. Tweed appointed Hilton, a top lawyer to New York’s wealthiest men, to the new board in charge of Central Park in 1870. Hilton took to the role immediately, regularly visiting the park to search for areas of improvement.</p>



<p>Some of these “improvements” were head-scratchers. Hilton had workers paint a bronze statue of the biblical Eve entirely white, permanently damaging the metal. His penchant for destructive whitewashing — he ordered a similar treatment for a whale skeleton destined for a museum — became a joke in the press.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day while going through her notes at a café, Coules came across park commission meeting minutes from the day before the models were destroyed. In that meeting, the committee resolved to remove Hawkins’ workshop “under the direction of the Treasurer” — Henry Hilton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was like, wow! Look at this!” Coules says. Hawkins himself blamed Hilton for the vandalism. Coules found <em>New York Times </em>articles from the period in which Hawkins implicated Hilton. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But why did Hilton want the dinosaurs destroyed? Coules’ research didn’t pick up any hint that religion was a major motivation. Rather, she argues, Hilton “had a strange relationship with artifacts,” as demonstrated by his whitewashing habits.</p>



<p>Hilton would also go on to harbor other destructive tendencies — swindling a wealthy widow out of her fortune and running her late husband’s business into the ground.</p>



<p>Hilton had “quite strange ideas [that managed] basically to piss off everybody,” says Coules, who <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016787823000366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published her findings</a> with Benton last year in the <em>Proceedings of the Geologist’s Association</em>.</p>



<p>That Hilton’s “strange ideas” would be behind the Hawkins incident makes sense to Ellinor Mitchel, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London and coauthor of a book on Hawkins’ Crystal Palace dinosaurs. “I think that’s the way of much of history, that it turns it’s sort of out human strengths and weaknesses that pivot the direction of things,” she says. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone is so sure. “It seemed quite convincing to me that Hilton played an important role,” says Lukas Rieppel, a science historian at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and author of a book on dinosaurs during America’s Gilded Age. But “it’s very hard for historians to know the private motivations of people who died over 100 years ago.”</p>



<p>Still, Coules’ work convincingly shows religion wasn’t a motivating factor.</p>



<p>For one thing, “pre-Adamite” was simply a way to refer to deep time, Benton says. So even if Tweed and Hilton did refer to Hawkins’ models in this way, it would have been more descriptive than derisive. What’s more, natural history — including paleontology — was seen as a respectable, middle-class occupation in the 19th century. “Natural history was seen as an expression of piety,” Rieppel says. “So a way that one could express one’s devotion to God [was] by learning about God’s works in the natural world.”</p>



<p>In fact, the idea that the world was ancient was widely accepted at the time, Benton adds. A more inflexible view of creationism, in which evolution is false and the world is only a few thousand years old, really started to gain steam only in the 20th century, he says.</p>



<p>Religion’s supposed role in the Hawkins’ saga may have been introduced by paleontologists writing about this incident in the mid-20th century, who may have been projecting their experiences with creationist movements into the past, Rieppel says. From there, the story stuck.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hawkins’ lasting influence</h4>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignright">

Coules and M.J. Benton/<em>Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The loss of the Paleozoic Museum might have been for the best. It would have been “obsolete almost immediately and I fear almost comical,” Mehling says — soon overshadowed by bigger discoveries from the American West.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that Hawkins’ models didn’t have value, Mehling says. Dinosaur statues may now be the stuff of tacky roadside attractions and miniature golf courses. But in the 19th century, Hawkins’ statues were key to opening the public’s imagination to an ancient world that was quite different from the present.</p>



<p>Hawkins’ display was so awe-inspiring that in 1905, when the American Museum of Natural History unveiled its 20-meter-long <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brontosaurus-deserves-its-name-after-all">Brontosaurus</a></em>, it displayed the skeleton upright (<em>SN: 4/7/15</em>).</p>



<p>And Hawkins’ work continues to influence how people think of dinosaurs. While doing research for the Paleozoic Museum, Hawkins strung together the fossil pieces of <em>Hadrosaurus</em> into a standing skeleton and displayed it in Philadelphia. Before this, fossils had only ever been displayed flat on a table or kept in drawers. Visitors flocked to see the strung-together skeleton, overwhelming staff at the institution where it was housed.</p>



<p>The tradition stuck. And today, most museums display their fossils using Hawkins’ method.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poison-dart-frog-toxin-skin-protein">Here’s how poison dart frogs safely hoard toxins in their skin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Toxins found in the skin of poison dart frogs may hitch a ride there via molecular taxicabs.</p>



<p>As a group, poison dart frogs (<em>Dendrobatidae</em>) host an assortment of more than 500 poisonous compounds called alkaloids that the amphibians acquire from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skin-chemistry-poison-frogs-upgrade-toxins-prey">steady diet of insects</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/03</em>). But how these toxins, which help to fend off predators, make it from a frog’s intestines to its skin has been a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, scientists have <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinpointed a protein</a> that can give at least some poisons a ride. The protein, dubbed alkaloid binding globulin, or ABG, might pick up alkaloids from a frog’s blood or intestines and transport the toxins to the skin as a chemical defense, researchers report December 19 in <em>eLife</em>. The newly identified protein shares similarities with other proteins that transport hormones in mammals. Such a resemblance might help scientists develop comparable proteins that could, for example, soak up toxins to treat human overdoses.</p>



<p>It’s the first time researchers have identified a protein that transports poisons around dart frogs’ bodies, says Roberto Márquez, an evolutionary geneticist and herpetologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Researchers have long thought that there must be a big metabolic component to how “poison frogs exist just as a ball of toxins,” Márquez says. Proteins capable of binding to alkaloids were primary suspects, he says, because that would allow you to get toxins from your diet, “move them to your skin and not die trying.”</p>



<p>Biologist Aurora Alvarez-Buylla of Stanford University and colleagues managed to find one such alkaloid binding protein by going fishing with molecular bait. In lab dishes, the team mixed a chemical lure similar to a well-studied poison frog alkaloid called pumiliotoxin with the liquid portion of blood from Diablito poison dart frogs (<em>Oophaga sylvatica</em>). ABG emerged as the most common frog protein attached to the bait. The researchers also identified similar proteins from two other species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In test tubes, the newfound protein showed an affinity for pumiliotoxin, soaking up much of the available alkaloid. Genetic analyses of wild Diablito frogs collected in Ecuador suggest that ABG is made in frog livers. Additional experiments using fluorescent markers to locate the protein in tissues suggest that ABG then makes its way from the liver to the intestines and skin.</p>



<p>But ABG is a “biochemically promiscuous” protein, Alvarez-Buylla says. In the lab, it also bound other poison dart frog toxins like epibatidine and decahydroquinoline. That’s surprising, she says, given that some proteins tend to be specific about the kinds of small molecules that they attach to. And there are still hundreds more toxins that the team didn’t test, so “there’s definitely more to explore there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Márquez agrees. It’s certainly an open question just how many toxins ABG can pick up, he says, and whether it’s common across the entire poison dart frog family tree.</p>



<p>Also unknown is how the protein accomplishes its job. Perhaps ABG has a precise mechanism for when it picks up and releases poisonous compounds, Márquez says, “or maybe the frogs resist them anyway and this is just like the little cart that transports stuff around.” With one case “very beautifully figured out,” he’s excited to understand how poison dart frogs handle all their myriad toxins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two journals of a leading microbiology society have retracted six articles by Didier Raoult after a university investigation found breaches of research ethics in his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A seventh article by authors affiliated with the research institute Raoult formerly led was also retracted for ethical issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Raoult, who has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01430-z">filed a criminal complaint</a> against a scientist who found issues in his publications, called the retractions “just another form of science censorship” based on “complete ignorance” of France’s research ethics laws.</p>



<span id="more-128531"></span>



<p>The American Society for Microbiology, which publishes the journals in which the articles appeared, marked most of the papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/08/didier-raoult-papers-earn-expressions-of-concern-as-criminal-investigation-gets-underway/">with expressions of concern</a> in September 2022. The notices stated that the articles were “being reviewed as part of a ‘scientific misconduct investigation’ by the University of Aix Marseille.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That investigation has apparently concluded, as each retraction notice mentions its findings with similar wording. The <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01508-23">notice</a> for one paper stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the publication of the Expression of Concern at https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00782-22, the University of Aix Marseille conducted an ethical assessment of this letter to the editor, for which the majority of the authors were also affiliated with IHU Méditerranée Infection. The ethics committee, comprising independent and international members, specifically evaluated participant recruitment for the study, sample collection, and whether the authors had appropriate ethical approvals from the Institutional Review Board.</p>



<p>According to the investigation report, the sentence in the letter reading “This study was performed after ethical approval by the local ethics committee (accession number 10–002, 2010)” is incorrect. Furthermore, this kind of study conducted for research purposes falls “under the French law on the protection of research participants, therefore, it should have been submitted to CPP (Committees of the Protection of Persons). Formally, this paper could not be deemed in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki and the French Law and regulations.”</p>



<p>In light of the severity of the research ethics breach indicated by these findings and in accordance with COPE guidelines, this article is being retracted by ASM and AAC.</p>

<p>These are the seven retracted papers, which have collectively been cited more than 150 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>The editors in chief of both journals that retracted papers told Retraction Watch they had no comment beyond the published notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik, who was one of the people who uncovered issues in Raoult’s work (and whom he sued), wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter):&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Other researchers flagged four of the now-retracted papers in <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">an analysis</a> that found issues with the ethics approvals of 456 studies published by researchers affiliated with the IHU Méditerranée Infection, including “248 [that] were conducted with the same ethics approval number, even though the subjects, samples, and countries of investigation were different.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raoult retired as director of IHU-MI in 2022 after overseeing it since 2011. His retirement followed an inspection by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/actualites/inspection-a-lihu-mediterranee-infection-et-a-lap-hm-lansm-saisit-a-nouveau-la-justice-et-engage-des-poursuites-administratives">that found</a> “serious shortcomings and non-compliances with the regulations for research involving the human person.”</p>



<p>The retractions from the American Society for Microbiology are the latest in a string of publisher’s actions on Raoult’s articles. In October, <em>Scientific Reports</em> retracted two papers because the authors “were not able to provide documentation of appropriate approval from an ethics committee.” The publisher PLOS has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/plos-flags-nearly-50-papers-by-controversial-french-covid-researcher-for-ethics-concerns/?relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0&amp;relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=128159&amp;relatedposts_position=0">marked nearly 50</a> of Raoult’s articles with expressions of concern related to ethics, and Elsevier is <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/01/elsevier-investigating-articles-linked-to-controversial-french-researcher/">investigating an unspecified number of papers</a> that appeared in <em>New Microbes and New Infections</em> and its other journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment, Raoult said he had been “harassed following incredulity on government and scientific press on covid 19.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retractions are based on very primitive analysis of gels that we demonstrated are wrong, the failure to send the original western blor [sic] of a 23 year old paper and a complete ignorance of the ethic laws of France</p>



<p>This in [sic] insane and in contrast with most justice process this is not a balanced analysis</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-sound-water-poured">Here’s the science behind the burbling sound of water being poured</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ah, the refreshing sound of a cool drink of water being poured. You might feel thirsty just thinking about it. Or, if you’re a scientist, you might feel curious.</p>



<p>Mechanical engineer Mouad Boudina and colleagues wanted to understand how the pouring conditions affected the volume of that enticing sound. The key, the researchers found, was how much the incoming stream of water rippled as it fell.</p>



<p>As a column of water falls, an effect called the Rayleigh-Plateau instability causes the smooth stream to form lumps and bumps before eventually breaking up into droplets. Those ripples impact the surface of the liquid, forming air bubbles that vibrate and produce sound.</p>



<p>In laboratory experiments, water poured from a tube close to the surface of a water vessel was inaudible, as the stream hadn’t fallen far enough to form ripples. For water poured from a greater height, the streams became bumpy, and&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.8.L122002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sound was louder</a>, Boudina, of Seoul National University in South Korea, and colleagues report in the December&nbsp;<em>Physical Review Fluids</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The width of the stream of water mattered, too.&nbsp;Thinner jets were louder than thicker jets poured from the same height. That’s because, as they fall, thin streams become wiggly more quickly, as compared to thicker ones.</p>



<p>Once the pouring height was large enough that the streams broke up into individual droplets, what mattered was the size of the drops. That means thicker jets, which pinch off into bigger drops, were louder than thinner ones.</p>

<p>New editorial policies at an MDPI title accused of publishing “sadistic, cruel, and unnecessary” animal studies are missing the mark, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a U.S-based advocacy group.</p>



<p>The group is waging a campaign against MDPI’s <em>Nutrients</em>, which it says is “<a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/more-1100-physicians-health-care-professionals-and-scientists-boycott-medical">publishing egregious animal experiments that could have been ethically conducted in humans</a>.” The journal’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/instructions#ethics">guidelines</a> require the “replacement of animals by alternatives wherever possible,” as a PCRM <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/17/when-journals-dont-meet-their-ethical-guidelines-will-anyone-hold-them-accountable/">guest post</a> for Retraction Watch pointed out last year.</p>



<p>A former reviewer for the journal, and one of the more than 1,100 signatories of a recent PCRM <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/d8tw9jwrqd/letter-to-nutrients-and-mdpi-refrain-from-publishing-in-journals">boycott letter</a>, said she resigned from the post after realizing <em>Nutrients</em> published research that was “<a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/more-1100-physicians-health-care-professionals-and-scientists-boycott-medical">sadistic, cruel, and unnecessary</a>,” according to a press release from November.</p>



<p>Email correspondence made public here for the first time shows<em> Nutrients</em> continues to reject the group’s concerns. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Email-response-from-Nutrients.pdf">one message</a> from 2022, it told PCRM that 21 papers flagged as problematic “contained ethics statements that are in accordance with the journal policies.” </p>



<span id="more-128527"></span>



<p>After PCRM complained in December 2022 to the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE), a nonprofit providing guidance to editors and publishers, an MDPI research integrity manager <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Email-between-COPE-and-MDPI-RE-PCRM-complaint-to-COPE.pdf">explained that</a> “we are reliant on the decisions made by appropriate institutional ethics committees and institutional review boards in this matter, and we consider at this stage the investigation concluded.”</p>



<p>But he added that “as a result of this complaint, Nutrients has strengthened its processing procedures by implementing extra checks, facilitating increased editorial board participation, separated decision steps, and editorial board training to proactively identify these issues.”</p>



<p>These changes included:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<ul>
<li>Strengthened pre-screening check made by the editorial office, through a system integrated into our submission processing platform, to individually identify manuscripts involving animal research, and ensure relevant ethical approval and methodological information is provided as per our policy before further processing can take place.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a mandatory academic editor pre-check decision before acceptance to peer-review for manuscripts involving animal research.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a requirement for an academic editor with expertise in animal research to be invited to supervise peer-review on these manuscripts and make the final acceptance decision.</li>
</ul>



<p>Training for the Journal editorial board members is an ongoing process. So far it has included conversations between trained in-house editorial staff and the editorial board about this issue, as well as constant reminders and sharing of information about the journals animal research policies and their responsibilities, as members of the editorial board in this regard. The journal has also placed increased emphasis on this within the information packet that all editorial board members receive. And finally, editorial staff have initiated discussion with senior editorial board members about the necessity for recruiting more members with specific expertise in this area to strengthen the current coverage for this subject.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>COPE <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Report-McCarthy.pdf">found no fault</a> with how the journal handled PCRM’s concerns, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We appreciate that this may not satisfy the presenter’s concerns regarding the specific articles, their design and research justification, but it is beyond the remit of the Facilitation and Integrity subcommittee to comment on the scholarly content of publications. </p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Janine McCarthy, science policy program manager at PCRM, said the new editorial policies have fallen short.</p>



<p>“None of the checks that they implemented really take a look and say, does this actually meet <em>Nutrients</em>’ guidelines to use replacements [to animals] when available?” McCarthy told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They should be responsible for the types of papers that they publish, and they should be doing an additional check to make sure that the papers that they&#8217;re publishing in their journal actually adhere to their guidelines,” she said. “It&#8217;s not hard. It didn&#8217;t take us very long to find alternatives that were available for all these studies that they&#8217;re publishing.”</p>



<p><em>Nutrients</em>, an open-access journal, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/apc">charges authors</a> 2,900 Swiss francs (about US$3,400) to get published. According to PCRM, the payments&nbsp; come out to more than US$16 million annually. The group has found animal studies make up about a fifth of <em>Nutrients’</em> publications, netting MDPI more than US$3 million in author fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such study that PCRM has flagged looked at saffron’s potential effect on depression. Here is how McCarthy described the research in a Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/17/when-journals-dont-meet-their-ethical-guidelines-will-anyone-hold-them-accountable/">guest post</a> from March:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manufacturer of a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/904">saffron-based nutrition supplement</a> explored the spice’s purported mood-boosting properties. But rather than administering the supplement to volunteers and tracking their depressive symptoms with validated instruments, as other researchers have done, the manufacturer force-fed it to mice via gavage and dropped the animals in water tanks to conduct forced swim tests as a measure of their mood. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>“It seems to us that there is an incentive to just publish research no matter the quality,” said McCarthy, adding that the new policies appear to have had little effect on what appears in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We haven&#8217;t noticed any difference,” she said.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/1/20">December editorial</a>, <em>Nutrients</em>’ two editors-in-chief defended themselves against the criticism, writing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>.. we all agree that animal experimentation should never be the preferred method of testing.</p>



<p>Nor should it be regarded as a failsafe way of demonstrating drug safety and efficacy in and of itself. However, there may be instances where animal experimentation offers the only viable means of securing therapeutic benefits that will help alleviate forms of human suffering that are currently unaddressed.</p>



<p>We would like to call on all institutions that carry out such tests to do everything in their power to adopt the necessary measures and controls so as to obviate the need for animal experimentation in the first place. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The editors and the journal in general are trying to wash their hands clean, saying that they don&#8217;t participate in animal research as a journal,” McCarthy said. “And be that as it may, they still should be responsible for the types of papers and research that they publish.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Giulia Stefenelli, chair of MDPI’s scientific board, reiterated that <em>Nutrients</em> had investigated the articles flagged by PCRM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On our side, we consider this matter closed and we will not comment on this further,” she told Retraction Watch, speaking on behalf of MDPI’s management team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stefenelli also listed the editorial changes <em>Nutrients</em> had put in place, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On top of this, the journal Nutrients is in the process of further strengthening the procedure requiring for [sic] authors to submit a ARRIVE checklist (ARRIVE Compliance Guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org/sites/arrive/files/documents/ARRIVE%20Compliance%20Questionnaire.pdf) at submission stage, and for authors to justify the use of animals in the study within the submission cover letter, which will be reviewed by the Academic Editor during the pre-check phase.</p>

                <p>At the end of last month's episode I announced that it was the last regular episode of <em><a href= "https://brainsciencepodcast.com">Brain Science</a></em>. It has been 17 years since episode 1 was released on December 15, 2023 and I am extremely grateful to everyone who has listened and supported the show over all these years. I am also grateful that others have taken up the challenge of sharing neuroscience via podcasting.</p> <p>The main reason I have chosen to bring the show to an end is that I want to have the time and energy to immerse myself into my new life in New Zealand. I moved here from the US in August 2023.</p> <p>The main purpose of this post is to emphasize that <em><a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com">Brain Science</a></em> will still be available to new listeners so I hope you will continue to share it with others. All episodes released after 2016 will remaining FREE along with the annual review episodes going back to 2007.</p> <p><a href= "https://my.libsyn.com/auth/login/show_id/18369">MyLibsyn Premium</a> will continue to provide unlimited access to the entire catalogue and episode transcripts. The income from Premium subscribers will allow me to continue to pay for web hosting and the other expenses of keeping the show available.</p> <p>If you aren't already subscribed, please sign up for the free <a href= "https://aw165c37.aweb.page/p/bf3db6a3-fd83-4cd1-9e6c-f7686d67f700"> Brain Science Newsletter</a> so I can send you future updates.</p> <p>Thank you so much for your support! I would love to hear from you at brainsciencepodcast@gmail.com.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannabis-high-thc-teen-mental-health">The teen brain is especially susceptible to the harms of THC</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask thousands of teens whether frequent use of certain substances brings a high risk of harm, and they mostly nail it: a majority say yes for cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine and heroin. But there’s one substance that many skip over — cannabis.</p>



<p>Only 35 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt39443/2021NSDUHFFRRev010323.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceive a “great risk of harm” from smoking marijuana</a> once or twice a week, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</p>



<p>It’s a sentiment that some of their parents may share. Parents often don’t understand that the products used today “are not what they knew when they were in high school,” says Kelly Young-Wolff, a licensed clinical psychologist and research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research in Oakland. If their children are using cannabis, parents may think, “‘it’s not that bad, at least they’re not using this other drug that’s worse.’”</p>



<p>But the cannabis products available now are leaps and bounds more potent — which may increase the risks for addiction and psychosis — than in the past. Marijuana plants have been bred to contain more delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive chemical. In 1995, the total percent of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987131/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC by weight of marijuana plant material was around 4 percent</a>; now <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.13886" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana with a THC potency of 20 percent or more</a> is available. Trouncing that are concentrated cannabis products, including wax, budder and shatter, which can have a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460323000126?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC potency as high as 95 percent</a>.</p>



<p>Cannabis is legal for adults to use recreationally in 24 states and Washington, D.C., and is allowed for medical use in 38 states and D.C. The widespread availability of cannabis “promotes the idea that it’s safe,” says pediatrician Beth Ebel of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children’s Hospital. But that “is an incorrect assumption.” THC can impact brain chemistry “in a way that wasn’t intended,” Ebel says. “Some of the worst effects can have lifelong health consequences, especially for a young person.”</p>



<p>Concentrated cannabis products can be so extremely potent, and so different from what’s been known as cannabis, that “we need to start calling them something else,” says neuroscientist Yasmin Hurd of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “These are new drugs.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How does THC affect the adolescent brain?</h4>



<p>As is true for other drugs, adolescence is an especially risky time to use cannabis. “The adolescent brain is still developing into early adulthood,” Hurd says. During this period, connections within adolescents’ brains are forming, getting reinforced or being pruned. “Your brain is trying to figure out, ‘what is important that I need to learn, and what is important that I need to retain,’” Ebel says, and this process is “negatively affected by THC.”</p>



<p>THC binds to one of the main receptors, called CB1, of the endocannabinoid system. This complex system influences many functions in the body. In the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877694/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain, the endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in the organ’s development</a> and helps to <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21111138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulate anxiety, pain, memory, the motivation of behaviors</a> and more.</p>



<p>The endocannabinoid system also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2017143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributes to structural changes that occur as developing teen brains mature</a>. But THC can interfere with the system’s signaling during this key time and leave an imprint on the brain’s structure.</p>



<p>Studies in animals have found that exposure to THC in adolescence can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315006435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce CB1 receptors in the brain</a> and lead to long-lasting problems with memory and learning. One of the areas the psychoactive chemical alters is the prefrontal cortex, which matures during adolescence and is integral to problem-solving and emotional regulation. In adolescent rats injected with THC, nerve cell protrusions that connect with other nerve cells were prematurely cut back, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6430678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupting the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex</a>, Hurd and colleagues reported in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em> in 2019.</p>



<p>There’s also evidence in people that THC changes teens’ brains. Researchers analyzed close to 1,600 magnetic resonance images of the brains of nearly 800 adolescents, taken at 14 and 19 years of age, on average. There was an <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2781289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">association between cannabis use over the five years and an accelerated thinning</a> of the prefrontal cortex, the researchers reported in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em> in 2021. Cortical thinning is expected in adolescence and is likely tied to the pruning of underused connections. But accelerated thinning means that process isn’t following the normal developmental plan. The researchers hypothesize that the accelerated thinning might be connected to the premature loss of nerve cell protrusions that was described in the rat study.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Marijuana use is linked to mental health harms</h4>



<p>Using cannabis puts teens’ mental health at risk. That’s true even for someone using cannabis recreationally. Adolescents ages 12 to 17 whose cannabis use did not meet the threshold for a substance use disorder were about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely to develop depression or have suicidal ideation</a> as those who didn’t use cannabis, according to a study of more than 68,000 adolescents published in May in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>The risks increase for those with cannabis use disorder, which is diagnosed when someone’s use interferes with daily life, but they aren’t able to stop using, among other symptoms. The <em>JAMA Network Open</em> study reported that adolescents with cannabis use disorder were 2.5 and 3 times as likely to have depression or suicidal ideation, respectively, as those who didn’t use cannabis.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cannabis and mental health</h3>



<p>Adolescents who met the diagnosis for cannabis use disorder or who used the drug recreationally had a higher prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation than those who didn&#8217;t use cannabis.</p>

<p>Beginning cannabis use as a teen is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677076/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to lead to dependence</a> than starting as an adult, just like alcohol, cocaine and nicotine. Compared with young adults, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2777817" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adolescents are more susceptible to dependence within a year</a> of taking up marijuana. Eleven percent of those ages 12 to 17 progressed to cannabis use disorder by 12 months, but only 6 percent of those ages 18 to 25 did, researchers reported in 2021 in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>. After three years, the prevalence was 20 percent of adolescents versus 11 percent of young adults.</p>



<p>Yet many teens are turning to marijuana as a coping mechanism. A study of what motivated high school seniors to use cannabis found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasons related to coping — such as to escape problems, relieve tension or deal with anger</a> — approximately doubled in prevalence during the last four decades, researchers reported in 2019 the <em>Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</em>. For a project on how cannabis legalization for adults in California has impacted adolescent health, Young-Wolff has talked to clinicians who care for adolescents. They’ve told her that many of their patients who use cannabis are doing so to self-medicate, to try to relieve symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Ebel has seen this too. But as the drug wears off, users are more anxious than they were before, she says. “It drives a cycle that drives increased use.”</p>



<p>When marijuana is a part of a teen’s everyday life, it can change their future trajectory. A study of young people in Australia and New Zealand compared the frequency of cannabis use before the age of 17 with how participants had fared by age 30. Those who used cannabis daily were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036614703074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to become dependent on cannabis, use other drugs and attempt suicide</a>, and less likely to finish high school, compared with teens who had never used, researchers reported in 2014 in the <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>Cannabis addiction is also tied to the development of the psychiatric disorder schizophrenia. A study of nearly 7 million Danish people ages 16 to 49 found an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/association-between-cannabis-use-disorder-and-schizophrenia-stronger-in-young-males-than-in-females/E1F8F0E09C6541CB8529A326C3641A68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">association between cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia</a>, researchers reported in May in <em>Psychological Medicine</em>. The association was stronger for males overall and especially at the ages of 16 to 25 years old. The researchers estimate that in 2021, without cannabis use disorder, around 15 percent of cases of schizophrenia in males and 4 percent in females would not have occurred.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The risks of using concentrated cannabis products</h4>



<p>Although smoking the marijuana plant is still the most common way teens use cannabis, vaping cannabis concentrates is on the rise. A study of high school seniors reported that from 2015 to 2018, among past-year cannabis users, smoking decreased from 95 percent to 90 percent, while <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2763823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaping increased from 26 percent to 34 percent</a>. Daily use was also more common among those who vaped, at 29 percent, verses those who smoked, at 18 percent, researchers reported in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>There is early evidence that high-potency products are associated with an increased risk of psychosis, a symptom of schizophrenia. In a study of adults, daily use of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-potency cannabis products led to nearly five times the risk of psychosis</a> compared with people who didn’t use cannabis, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>. For the purposes of the study, high potency was defined as having 10 percent THC or higher.</p>



<p>There are also reports of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rise in cannabis hyperemesis syndrome</a>, a complication of high potency cannabis use that leads to abdominal pain, nausea and repeated vomiting. A Canadian study found that emergency department visits for the syndrome increased 13-fold from 2014 to 2021.</p>



<p>Ebel says concentrated cannabis products are largely unstudied and “pose new and alarming health risks.” Hurd says that because we don’t know the full impact on health from high potency products, users are essentially the test subjects.</p>



<p>So as with other substances, public health officials recommend that <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/talk-they-hear-you/parent-resources/why-you-should-talk-your-child" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents talk with their kids about the risks</a> of cannabis use. Especially with indications that teens are turning to cannabis to self-medicate, “if you notice a change in your child’s behavior, try to find out what’s going on,” Young-Wolff says. It’s also important for parents to consider the messages they send about marijuana, she says. The clinicians Young-Wolff has talked to have noticed that parents are using cannabis more and that they’ve become more permissive about teen cannabis use. “That can really make it hard to get this message to the kids to not use,” she says.</p>



<p>So, for adults who are taking part in the new legality of marijuana: “If you are going to use cannabis,” Young-Wolff says, “don’t use in front of your children.”</p>

<p>Scopus has completed its reevaluation of MDPI’s journal <em>Sustainability</em> and will continue to index the title, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/7352">according to the publisher</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mdpi-journal-undergoing-reevaluation-at-scopus-indexing-on-hold/">previously reported</a>, Scopus, a product of Elsevier, had paused indexing articles from <em>Sustainability</em> at the end of October while reevaluating whether to include the journal. Removal from the index can lead to a decline in submissions because universities and funders use Scopus to create journal “whitelists.”</p>



<p>The reevaluation process concluded January 4, according to Stefan Tochev, CEO of MDPI.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128517"></span>



<p>“Following this evaluation, it has been determined that <em>Sustainability</em> meets Scopus&#8217;s content selection standards,” Tochev said.&nbsp; The content that was not indexed during the reevaluation will be added to Scopus within the next 4 weeks.</p>



<p>We asked Elsevier for comment on Scopus’ decision, and a spokesperson responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The review was done according to the regular Scopus quality criteria and the decision was made to continue coverage by Scopus. Details about the journal review are confidential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we have noted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.khrono.no/stryker-et-av-verdens-storste-fra-listen-over-godkjente-tidsskrifter/689264">Norway removed</a> Sustainability from its list of journals that researchers get credit for publishing in, and <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/sustainability-level-0-2023">Finland followed suit</a> at the beginning of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>…<br></em>The <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100240100#tabs=2">number of articles</a> from Sustainability indexed in Scopus has increased nearly every year since 2009, its first year of coverage, when 78 articles were indexed. In 2022, the journal published over 17,000 articles. Scopus indexed about 13,500 in 2023, before the pause.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-primate-fossil-teeth-fruit-diet">Ancient primates’ unchipped teeth hint that they ate mostly fruit</a></h4>

              
                <p>Soft fruits may have been the main dish on some ancient primate menus.</p>



<p>An analysis of hundreds of fossilized primate teeth from the Fayum Depression, a desert basin in Egypt, shows <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.24884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just a handful were fractured</a>, researchers report December 13 in the <em>American Journal of Biological Anthropology</em>. So few chipped teeth suggests the animals more often feasted on easy-to-chew foods like fruits rather than hard objects like seeds or nuts that might inflict tooth damage.</p>



<p>The more than 400 analyzed teeth belonged to five primate genera — including <em>Propliopithecus, Apidium </em>and <em>Aegyptopithecus</em> — and are around 29 million to 35 million years old. Fossils that old date to a time when the last common ancestor of apes, including humans, and African and Asian monkeys still existed, says Ian Towle, a dental anthropologist at Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana in Burgos, Spain.</p>



<p>By examining dental damage from millions of years ago that might have been caused by food, “it gives insight into our own evolution, our own dietary changes through time,” he says.</p>



<p>While at the University of Otago in New Zealand, Towle and colleagues counted fractures that could be seen with the naked eye, noting each fracture’s severity and position on the tooth. Just 21 teeth, about 5 percent, were chipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s right at the low end of what we see in living primates,” for which 4 to 40 percent of teeth show food damage, Towle says. Species like the sooty mangabey, a forest-dwelling monkey, that regularly eat hard food might have fractures on as many as half of their teeth. For species like chimpanzees that consume mostly soft food such as insects as well as fruit, less than 10 percent may be chipped.</p>



<p>What’s more, two <em>Propliopithecus</em> individuals had cavities, the researchers found. The presence of tooth decay suggests that the soft food of choice may have been sweet fruits. Primate diets might not have diversified to include nuts and seeds until later.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="287" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/122123_eg_primate-sweet-tooth_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="three separate images, including one x-ray, show cavities on fossilized primate teeth" class="wp-image-3134740" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/122123_eg_primate-sweet-tooth_inline.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/122123_eg_primate-sweet-tooth_inline.jpg?resize=330%2C139&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134740">Teeth from two <em>Propliopithecus chirobates</em> individuals had cavities (shown with white arrows), a sign the animals ate sweet fruit as part of their diet.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134740">I. Towle <em>et al</em>/<em>American Journal of Biological Anthropology </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That some individuals had cavities fits with other studies suggesting that fruit was part of diets early on in monkey and ape evolutionary history, says dental anthropologist Debra Guatelli-Steinberg of the Ohio State University in Columbus. But, she notes, whether teeth have chips or not doesn’t always perfectly match <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248420300038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what primates eat</a>, so it’s hard to say how much of the diet was soft food.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is some murkiness over what the species analyzed in the new study ate. Previous work <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248423000660?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzing tooth shape and wear</a> has suggested that <em>Apidium </em>and <em>Aegyptopithecus</em> ate hard items instead of soft ones, Towle says. Tooth shape can differentiate between leaf- and fruit-based diets, and microscopic damage can show only what an animal ate in its last few weeks or months of life. Chipping, on the other hand, can last years or decades before it’s visibly worn away, providing a longer dietary record.</p>



<p>“At the moment, we really don’t know why [different methods] are coming up with different results,” Towle says, but using multiple techniques to piece things together is key. It’s possible that ancient primates ate fruit and their teeth — seemingly well-suited for chowing down on nuts or seeds — served an unknown purpose. Or choppers of old may have had features that made them less likely to chip.</p>



<p>“It’s definitely something that’s going to be interesting for researchers to look into,” Towle says, “to see why there is this potential disparity.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/total-solar-eclipse-sun-science-viewing-2024">Why the 2024 total solar eclipse will be such a big deal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Solar eclipses are dramatic events as a rule. But the total eclipse coming on April 8 is going to ratchet up the experience.</p>



<p>Compared with the last total eclipse that crossed the United States, in 2017, this year’s total eclipse will last longer, the sky will fall darker, and the sun itself will put on a much livelier show. And millions more people will be able to step outside their front doors to see one of the most astounding astronomical events of their lives.</p>



<p>It will also be the last major eclipse to cross North America for 20 years. All of that means that it’s an especially rare opportunity for casual observers and scientists alike. Here are a few things to know about this spectacular event.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why will this eclipse last longer and feature a more active sun?</h4>



<p>The moon will be at a point in its orbit that’s comparatively close to Earth in April, making the moon appear particularly large. As a result, for anyone fortunate enough to make it to the path of totality — where the moon completely blocks out the sun’s disk — it will be an especially dark eclipse that will last for nearly 4½ minutes. That’s almost two minutes longer than the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-knowledge">Great American Eclipse</a> of 2017 (<em>SN: 8/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, the sun will be close to solar maximum in 2024. That’s the peak of its roughly 11-year activity cycle. As a result, lots of bright, petal-like streamers of plasma will extend from the solar corona, the sun’s outer atmosphere. The increase in solar activity also ups the chances of a coronal mass ejection, a large puff of hot gas trapped in a loop of magnetic field that’s blasted away from the sun’s surface.</p>



<p>A longer time to observe the eclipse and a more active sun will make it both a better show and a boon for scientists who have more telescopes, sensors and satellites available to study the sun than ever before. Even viewers without other equipment should be able to see the streamers and a coronal mass ejection, if it occurs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s different about this eclipse’s path?</h4>



<p>“There&#8217;s nearly 32 million people [who will be] inside the path [of totality],” says cartographer Michael Zeiler. That’s about 2½ times as many as during the 2017 eclipse. And “the major East Coast metros from Baltimore to Boston are all about 200 miles from the path of totality.”</p>



<p>That means that the path of totality is going be very accessible to the bulk of the U.S. population, says Zeiler, founder of GreatAmericanEclipse.com. The eclipse will be visible to some degree in every U.S. state as well as portions of northwestern Mexico and southeastern Canada.</p>

<p>The 2024 eclipse path will also be particularly helpful for researchers who use radar to study charged particles high in the atmosphere. Unlike the last two North American eclipses, says space scientist Bharat Kunduri of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, this year’s path passes within the observing range of three radars in the worldwide Super Dual Auroral Radar Network.</p>



<p>Those radars monitor a gaslike plasma of positively charged atoms and negatively charged electrons in the Earth’s atmosphere, created when the sun’s rays kick electrons off atoms. The plasma makes up the ionosphere, which can act like a mirror for radio signals and bounce signals from terrestrial transmitters back down to receivers, instead of letting the signals head out to space. That extends the range that transmitters can reach. The ionosphere also modifies the transmission of signals down to Earth from GPS satellites. Taking that effect into account is crucial for ensuring that GPS systems are accurate.</p>



<p>During a solar eclipse, as at nighttime, all the radiation from the sun goes away, and the atmosphere becomes a little less dense and less ionized. “And radio waves can behave differently,” Kunduri says. Using the instruments in the radar network during an eclipse can help scientists better understand how the sun generates the ionosphere and how the plasma layer affects transmissions from satellites and radios.</p>



<p>An eclipse “gives you an excellent opportunity to study what happens when there is a sudden change in the upper atmosphere,” he says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s unique about this chance to spot a coronal mass ejection?</h4>



<p>Because of the sun’s elevated activity this time, the chances are unusually high that terrestrial eclipse observers and space satellites could have the opportunity to simultaneously study a coronal mass ejection. Both the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter</a> and <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Parker Solar Probe</a> will be looking at the sun from the side while the eclipse is happening.</p>



<p>That means that ground-based observers would be able to watch a coronal mass ejection traveling out from the sun, while the satellites would see the event head on, if they happen to lie in the path on an ejection, and could take samples as the solar material goes blasting past. It’s the only time in the lifetimes of the two satellites that the arrangement will coincide with an eclipse at solar maximum.</p>



<p>“If we would be so lucky to have one,” says astrophysicist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and it’s “propagating toward the spacecraft … it will be fascinating to see it during a total solar eclipse.”</p>



<p>Scientists want to know more about coronal mass ejections because the solar eruptions, when aimed at Earth, can disrupt communications and power grids, and potentially threaten satellites or astronauts in orbit around Earth.</p>



<p>In addition to observing any ejection, the satellites’ observations could help confirm the source of particularly speedy solar winds, which seem to be accelerated by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">kinks that develop in magnetic fields</a> near the surface of the sun (<em>SN: 7/7/23</em>).</p>



<p>Insights into the solar wind, in turn, help explain how coronal mass ejections can affect Earth. That’s because the ejections, Raouafi says, pile up material in the solar wind, which “will affect the arrival time of these events to earth. So, knowing the conditions of the solar wind before the [ejections] is extremely important to predict when they are arriving or how important they will be.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are some of the ways that scientists plan to study this eclipse?</h4>



<p>Several experiments planned for 2024 are repeats from past eclipses. Some feature updated instrumentation. Others will benefit from observations gathered while the sun is near its solar maximum, allowing for comparisons to the more quiescent phase that the sun was in during the 2017 eclipse. All the 2024 experiments should enjoy the improvement in data quality and quantity that comes with the longer viewing time.</p>



<p>Take the WB-57F jet planes that carried instruments to observe the 2017 eclipse while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-2017-solar-eclipse-results">flying along its path</a> of totality (<em>SN 5/29/18</em>). They will be in the air again in April, says physicist Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “It’s a big improvement because we’re flying new instruments [that provide] better information. The fact that it’s solar maximum will give us a lot more things to look at.”</p>



<p>Improved cameras and spectrometers, for example, will offer detailed views of the corona close to the sun’s surface. “This eclipse is also twice as long as the last one. On the ground, it&#8217;s 4.5 minutes,” Caspi says, “In the air, we&#8217;re going to get 6.5 minutes per airplane.”</p>



<p>If all goes well, he says, they could also discover some asteroids thought to exist within the orbit of Mercury, which are difficult to detect without the moon blocking the sun’s glare.</p>

<p>Astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu is leading a team that will fly updated cameras and spectrometers on the jets as well. She’s also setting up ground-based observations at sites in Mexico, Texas and Arkansas.</p>



<p>Habbal is even planning to send a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/clouds-for-your-eclipse-nasa-experiment-will-fly-kite-to-rise-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spectrometer four kilometers aloft on a kite</a> from a location near Kerrville, Texas, to get above any clouds that might block the view. The spectrometer collects light from the sun to determine the composition of material in the corona. “There are changes in the corona that occur on time scales of seconds to minutes to hours,” she says. “So the longer duration [of the eclipse] also enables us to capture [more] time variable events and their impact on the corona and solar wind.”</p>



<p>Other repeat experiments include weather balloons that will <a href="https://eclipse.montana.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure waves of pressure</a> in the atmosphere that ripple away from the passing shadow of the eclipse. And a newly redesigned spectrometer will <a href="https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=fts-2021-FTh2G.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ride aboard a Gulfstream jet</a> chasing the eclipse over Texas.</p>



<p>There’s also a number of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/citizen-scientists-2024-solar-eclipse">new or improved ways that amateurs can contribute to the effort</a>, including helping make an eclipse megamovie by taking pictures of the event (<em>SN: 10/18/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An astronomical event to remember</h4>



<p>Once this year’s eclipse wraps up, that will be it for North America for a while. In 2033, Alaska will get an exclusive show in the western part of the state — which might partly make up for it having the worst seat in the house, as far as U.S. states go, this time around. (Only a sliver of the state will be within range to see a portion of the sun covered up.) After that, there will be an eclipse primarily over Canada in 2044, and another that will cross the United States and eastern South America in 2045.</p>



<p>While the astronomical event on April 8 will be both livelier and longer than many eclipses, Habbal says that it doesn’t diminish the importance of studying other eclipses. “Every total solar eclipse yields new discoveries.”</p>



<p>If you’re one of the lucky tens of millions of people who will have a chance to enjoy totality in person, or among of the hundreds of millions within range of the partial eclipse, this is an astronomical event you won’t want to miss.</p>

<p>When Jure Mur, a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, realized the replication of a published study he was working on as a “sanity check” wasn’t producing matching results, his first reaction was “annoyance,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He assumed the mistake was his own, and he’d have to thoroughly check his work to find it. “Only after double- and triple-checking my code did I start suspecting an error in the original paper,” Mur told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur emailed the authors of the article several times, but they never responded to him, he said. He next contacted the editors of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em>, which had published the original paper, “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00048-8/">Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort</a>,” in April 2023. </p>



<span id="more-128509"></span>



<p>In months of back-and-forth correspondence, seen by Retraction Watch, Mur explained the discrepancies he’d found, then submitted a comment article the editors declined to publish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was retracted in December, but only after Mur pushed the editors to consider the implications of the authors’ response to his comment, which confirmed his findings and contradicted their original paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The end result is positive for the scientific community,” Mur said. But because the editors seemed to address the issue he raised only after he and his colleagues submitted a comment article, and “either did not read or did not understand the response to our comment,” he said the experience “made me doubt the integrity of the editorial process at the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the high praise the article received when it was first published, the analysis should be corrected and republished, not just retracted, said <a href="https://wagner.nyu.edu/community/faculty/jan-blustein">Jan Blustein</a>, a professor at New York University who studies hearing loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was declared to be the final word, and it’s apparently not,” she said. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>Lancet Public Health</em> article made international headlines when it appeared, from <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50515650229&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=eQPpZIlK4WeBZ4IzoWqEng"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a><em> </em>to <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50511418435&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=V03Qt0bPVGUkM04wL4uOGQ">CNN</a> (also in <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50513504364&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=j_VvpNmtQJp0HPhB_LlPCQ">Spanish</a>) to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11970303/Hearing-aids-lower-risk-dementia-Lancet-study-suggests.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>. (CNN has added an update about the retraction to their story and removed references to the study.) It has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In people with hearing loss,” the authors wrote, “hearing aid use is associated with a risk of dementia of a similar level to that of people without hearing loss.” They proposed “up to 8% of dementia cases could be prevented with proper hearing loss management.”</p>



<p>In a simultaneously published <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00058-0/fulltext">editorial</a>–now also <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00302-X/fulltext">retracted</a>–other researchers wrote that with the addition of the article’s data, “the evidence that hearing aids can be a powerful tool to reduce the risk of dementia in people with hearing loss is as good as possible without randomised controlled trials.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur and his colleagues intended to build on the article with a related analysis on the same UK Biobank data. But when he couldn’t replicate the main findings, Mur scrutinized the paper more deeply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mid-May, Mur emailed the corresponding author, <a href="https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhudongshan/en/index.htm">Dongshan Zhu</a> of Shandong University in Jinan, China. He wrote that he “had some questions regarding your analysis” and asked whether he should direct them to Zhu or the first author of the paper. Mur followed up several times, but Zhu never responded, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur also emailed the editors of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em> in late May, asking if they would share any other authors’ email addresses they had. He explained that he’d been having trouble replicating some of the findings in the paper, and the corresponding author hadn’t responded to his emails. One of the editors supplied the email address for another author, Chengchao Zhou, also affiliated with Shandong University. Mur’s emails to Zhou went unanswered as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the editors’ suggestion, Mur sent another email to Zhu and Zhou in June asking if they would share their code, and copied the editors. After again getting no response, Mur sent the editors a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1_discrepancy_doc.docx.pdf">document</a> detailing the discrepancies between his replication attempt and the results in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most notably, he found that hearing aid use did not correspond to a lower rate of dementia for people with hearing loss, as the authors reported. He found the opposite: among people with hearing loss, the dementia rate was higher for those using hearing aids. In his email to the editors, Mur wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Without comparing the code to clean and analyse the data, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about what is going on. But I think it&#8217;s worth trying to resolve it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, Audrey Ceschia, editor in chief of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em>, responded. She wrote that the journal had been “notified of an error in the paper” and was currently working with the authors on a correction that “might also help resolving some of the discrepancies you’ve noticed.” She said she would share the correction when it was ready, and also suggested Mur could submit his findings to the journal’s correspondence section. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mur and a few colleagues submitted a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2_comment_article.docx.pdf">comment article</a> to the journal in October, formally explaining the differences in their findings and the published paper, with a link to a repository of their code. In mid-November Ceschia sent Mur the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.1_author_response.pdf">authors’ response</a> (with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.2_author_code.pdf">code</a> they provided), but wrote that the journal had “decided not to publish the exchange of letters.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ response noted they had “found some discrepancies between coding schemes” and described a new analysis they’d run on the data. They reported on “the relationship between self-reported hearing loss, hearing aid use and risk of dementia,” as they had in their original paper, as well as an additional analysis on people who had severe hearing loss as measured with a hearing test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In supplementary material, the authors presented results in line with what Mur and his colleagues found, but contradicting their originally published work:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using self-reported hearing loss (no severity information), we found that in people with hearing loss, both using and not using [hearing aids] was linked to an increased risk of all-cause dementia, with HR (95% CI) of (1.47, 1.33-1.63) and (1.17, 1.09-1.25) respectively, i.e., using [hearing aids] had even higher risk of dementia</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mur responded to the journal editors, pointing out that this result “is exactly what we found, reported, and submitted as a comment to the Lancet Public Health and is contrary to the findings published by Jiang et al. (2023). Only in some of the supplementary analyses that were not part of that original published paper, do the authors find a confirmation of their original claim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In my understanding of scientific integrity, it should now be the authors to retract the article based on these new analyses, or at least publish a major correction which includes a reinterpretation of findings in light of the extended analyses. Since they apparently do not intend to do so, we would now expect the publisher to take action and at least publish our comment (if you don’t plan on retracting the paper either). Please also note that the manuscript is a comment, not a correspondence piece. You may recall that we tried to have a correspondence with the authors and only decided to write a comment after multiple attempts were not successful..</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next day, Anika Knuppel, senior editor at the journal, responded that the editors were “looking into this.” A few weeks later, in early December, Ceschia wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please accept our profound thanks for prompting us to investigate the reliability of the paper by Fan Jiang et al. To summarise an extensive series of exchanges with the authors, they have now explained that they have discovered analytical errors in their work that render their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We have taken the decision to retract their paper and will publish the retraction notice next week. We are very grateful to you for bringing your concerns to us directly and we are pleased to be able to correct the scientific record in a timely manner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 12, <em>The Lancet Public Health </em>editors published the following <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(22)00314-0/fulltext">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On Nov 27, 2023, we have been informed by the authors of the paper—Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort—published on April 13, 2023,1 that an error was introduced in the output format setting of their SAS codes (data for people with hearing loss using hearing aids and with hearing loss without using hearing aids were switched), leading to errors in their analysis which render their findings and conclusions false and misleading. These errors were identified by the authors following an exchange with scientists seeking to reproduce the authors&#8217; findings. We are therefore retracting this Article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Zhu why he and his colleagues had not requested a retraction once their reanalysis found different results than their original paper. He responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thanks for your attention to our research.</p>



<p>If the output formats were not mis-defined, using self-reported hearing loss, people with hearing loss using HA had 34% higher risk of dementia, and people with hearing loss not using HA had 7% higher risk dementia [sic].</p>



<p>We believe there are two prominent bias [sic] when self-reported hearing loss was used, i.e., self-reported bias, and hearing loss severity bias.</p>



<p>In the next step, we will try to control for self-report bias and severity bias to see the effect of wearing hearing aids after bias control on reducing the risk of dementia, especially in people with severe hearing loss.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we reached out to Ceschia and Knuppel, we heard back from a spokesperson for <em>The Lancet</em>. Regarding the authors’ response to Mur and colleagues’ comment, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While acknowledging “some discrepancies between coding systems”, they argued that “The overall message of the study did not change.” In good faith, we accepted the authors’ explanation, and decided not to publish the exchange. In retrospect, we should have followed up the admitted discrepancies more assiduously and worked with the authors and Dr Mur to settle any outstanding uncertainties. Dr Mur rightly challenged our decision in an email on November 16. We immediately recognised the seriousness of his concerns and wrote again to the authors on November 22 asking them to further clarify their analyses, based on Dr Mur’s evidence and our own by now heightened unease. On November 24, the authors reported major errors in their paper, which rendered their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We moved quickly to retract the paper on December 12, 2023.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When the paper first appeared, it seemed to confirm a widely held belief – that hearing loss is associated with developing dementia, and using hearing aids can help to reduce risk – about which the scientific evidence has been mixed, Blustein, the hearing loss researcher, told Retraction Watch. In <a href="https://www.sac-oac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hearing-loss-and-dementia-Blustein-Weinstein-Chodosh.pdf">her view</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2808841">public health messaging</a> and media coverage of the question has been “misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings were picked up quickly and disseminated among the community of people following the question of hearing loss and dementia, she said. “I don’t think people are necessarily aware of retractions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analysis should be corrected, and if <em>The Lancet Public Health </em>were to receive a new version, they should publish it, Blustein said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK Biobank dataset “is a very valuable data source,” she said. The dataset’s large size, long followup period, and information about potentially confounding factors made the article an important piece of evidence. “To throw away data because somebody miscoded it is a mistake.”</p>



<p>Blustein also felt that the retraction notice was unclear about what readers should take away from the study, and the lack of clarity was “another reason why the record is incomplete” without a replacement analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the retraction notice was “technically correct,” Mur said, it did “obfuscate the fact that it was primarily my colleagues and I &#8211; not the journal or the authors of the original paper &#8211; who identified a problem and invested plenty of time and effort to have it rectified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To other researchers trying to correct the record, he advised:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Be prepared for an uphill battle. In our case, the editors were always courteous and quick to respond to our emails but notifying them of the discrepancies and detailing them in a short report was not sufficient. We still had to write and submit a paper before any substantial action by the journal was evident.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But putting forth the effort was important, he said, “simply because we knew the results were erroneous.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The study had been mentioned in several media articles, featured in an editorial by the journal, and hailed by some in the field as the most definitive evidence on the topic one can get without performing a clinical trial. You can&#8217;t let that stand if you know it to be false.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-salt-carved-terrains-glacier-features">Salt may have carved out Mercury’s terrains, including glacierlike features</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mercury’s surface might not be quite so terra firma, at least on geologic timescales.</p>



<p>The closest planet to the sun is a world sculpted by volatiles — ephemeral compounds that can freeze, flow or float into space over time, analogous to water on Earth. Salt, the primary volatile on Mercury, appears to have reshuffled the planet’s landscape over billions of years and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acf219?fbclid=IwAR0zG0pk6PwJCsm1sBxHLF7QPK83CoMMa5rmjDScoDrajnNFY6P9xRVw-tI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might even flow — very slowly — in glacier</a><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acf219?fbclid=IwAR0zG0pk6PwJCsm1sBxHLF7QPK83CoMMa5rmjDScoDrajnNFY6P9xRVw-tI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like landforms</a>, researchers report in the November <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>. The volatile could possibly even form habitable niches deep underground, the authors speculate.</p>



<p>Scientists have long suspected that many of Mercury’s signature terrains have been shaped by volcanic debris from deep within the planet. Instead, “volatile-driven resurfacing on Mercury has been one of the major engines in the evolution of the landscape,” says Alexis Rodriguez, a space research scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.</p>



<p>Until relatively recently, researchers thought Mercury couldn’t even harbor such salts. The planet sits so close to the sun that scientists assumed the compounds would either be baked off or stripped away by the solar wind. But when NASA’s Messenger spacecraft circled the planet in the early 2010s, the probe detected <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/messages-mercury-0">unmistakable signs of volatiles</a> (<em>SN: 6/17/11</em>).</p>



<p>The sun-scorched world has done more than cling to them, the new study proposes. It has stockpiled them in abundance throughout Mercury’s crust, possibly in a planetwide cache. Those volatiles might in turn be responsible for carving two common geologic features: chaotic terrains and glacierlike flows.</p>



<p>Mercury’s surface is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-stunning-landscape-mapped">jumble of hills, plateaus and grooves</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/16</em>). Previous theories suggested that long-ago volcanic outbursts were primarily responsible for the chaotic terrain. But that doesn’t jibe with where the terrains are found, say Rodriguez and colleagues.</p>



<p>If volcanic outbursts had formed the messy landscape, they would have preferentially erased certain preexisting geologic features, such as smaller impact craters, over others. But there are plenty of chaotic terrains that harbor ghosts of craters big and small that collapsed long ago, the researchers point out. They think the crater-preserving chaotic terrains formed another way: from volatiles in the ground leaking into space, such that the land loses structural integrity and collapses like a Jenga tower. The team previously proposed this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59885-5" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59885-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happened elsewhere on the planet</a>. </p>

<p>In the new study, a close analysis of features at the planet’s north pole suggests similar sculpting done by salts. And there’s possibly even more evidence for volatile sculpting in the basins of &nbsp;asteroid craters — formations that look like “glaciers” made of salt. The structures appear as oozing blobs in photos from the Messenger probe and probably formed over the eons after asteroids hit the planet’s surface and exposed buried volatiles, the team proposes. The heat of the impact — reaching several hundred degrees Celsius — mobilizes the underlying volatiles in the crust to trudge towards lower ground and pool like thick syrup, Rodriguez explains.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stunning-images-reveal-glacial-landscapes-under-oceans">Earth’s glaciers</a>, these slow-moving land masses <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stunning-images-reveal-glacial-landscapes-under-oceans">carve up the land </a>wherever they flow, the researchers say (<em>SN: 5/12/17</em>). Divots tens of meters deep pockmark their surface, indicating that the salt glaciers are losing volatiles into Mercury’s tenuous atmosphere. After a billion years, the formations might disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the ubiquity of surface volatiles (and their geologic effects) suggests there’s a lot more lurking underground. Rodriguez and colleagues estimate that a volatile-rich layer in the planet’s crust can run up to several kilometers deep. That’s thick enough to fashion pockets of habitability to potentially shelter hardy critters from the extreme temperatures on Mercury’s surface, the team argues.</p>



<p>Whether life could survive there in theory or not, the mere presence of glaciers on Mercury is in itself surprising. If Mercury’s geologic features do, in fact, count as glaciers, that means they’re common throughout our solar system, from the sun’s closest neighbor to the farthest dwarf, Pluto.</p>



<p>However, other scientists say the “glacier” label is moot. The “glaciers” could contain more rocky material than volatiles, says Sean Solomon, a retired planetary scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., and the principal investigator of the Messenger mission. So perhaps the landforms are more like landslides lubricated by volatiles. Still, he says, the study’s argument for how the structures formed is plausible.</p>



<p>The new ideas are radical, notes David Rothery, a planetary scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England. “But it all fits the pattern: Mercury is surprisingly rich in volatiles, and we have yet to understand the limits of what the volatiles are able to do to Mercury&#8217;s landscape.” A revisit with more advanced instruments than Messenger’s is very much in order, Rothery says.</p>



<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">BepiColombo</a>, a joint endeavor between the European and Japanese space agencies, is on the way <em>(SN: 1/15/21</em>)<em>.</em> Launched in 2018, the spacecraft will enter Mercury’s orbit in December 2025. “BepiColombo, as well as answering some of those questions, is going to give us some more surprises,” says Rothery, who is involved with the mission. “I&#8217;d be very surprised if we are not surprised.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-fruit-display-collapse">Here’s how much fruit you can take from a display before it collapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you take more than 10 percent of the fruit in a stacked produce display — watch out.</p>



<p>The iconic sloped produce displays in grocery stores can cause chaos when they collapse. But the question of how much fruit can be removed before the structure comes tumbling down is surprisingly complicated. A new study, published in the December <em>Physical Review E</em>, finally <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.064904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides an answer</a>.</p>



<p>Fruit display collapses are a good system for studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-avalanches">the dynamics that produce avalanches</a> and landslides because they’re relatively simple, says physicist Eduardo Rojas of the University of Antofagasta in Chile (<em>SN: 1/4/16</em>). All the objects are arranged in a nonrandom, crystallike form and are roughly the same size and shape — unlike the earth of a mountainside, for instance. This makes it easier to examine the impact of removing one object on the overall structure.</p>



<p>Using computer simulations, Rojas and colleagues modeled fruit stacked at many different angles to identify when a collapse would never happen and when one would happen instantly. In between those extremes, the team&nbsp;simulated what would happen to the integrity of the display when more and more fruit was removed.</p>



<p>About 10 percent of the fruit in a given display can be removed before triggering an avalanche, the simulations suggest. If 29 shoppers grabbed an apple from a stack of 300, the next shopper might want to put on a hard hat before plucking one for themselves.</p>



<p>“Their&nbsp;simulations certainly seem to have some of the hallmarks of our everyday&nbsp;experience,” says Arshad Kudrolli, a physicist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It is a nice approach&nbsp;and can be generalized easily.”</p>



<p>Rojas and colleagues next hope to simulate angled stacks of objects of different sizes that are randomly arranged, like piles of rocks that could lead to dangerous rockslides.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-fossils-oldest-machinery-photosynthesis-thylakoids">Bacteria fossils hold the oldest signs of machinery needed for photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient tiny fossils from Australia may carry evidence of great power: the ability to make oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>



<p>The fossilized bacteria, dating from 1.73 billion to 1.78 billion years ago, are chock-full of structures that resemble those where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place in most modern cyanobacteria and in plants. Called thylakoid membranes, the structures are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06896-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest ever found</a>, researchers report January 3 in <em>Nature</em>. The finding pushes back the evidence of thylakoids in cyanobacteria by 1.2 billion years.</p>



<p>Cyanobacteria’s invention of photosynthesis is responsible for the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. &#8220;So they&#8217;re a big deal,” says Woodward Fischer, a geobiologist at Caltech who was not involved finding the thylakoid membranes. And “this is the kind of information that I thought we were not going to be able to pull out of fossils,” he says.</p>



<p>Most fossils preserve mineralized tissues such as bone or shells, but bacteria don’t contain such mineral structures. These fossils are “just compressions of carbon” squished into mud, Fischer says. To find the bacteria preserved is impressive enough, but the new fossils reveal complex structures inside the microscopic bacteria. “It suggests this kind of future where we might be able to pull more information, more cell biology and morphological detail out of these minuscule fossils,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers already had indirect evidence from genetics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-got-first-whiff-oxygen-32-billion-years-ago">chemical studies</a> that cyanobacteria had developed thylakoids by the time these fossilized bacteria lived, says Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England <em>(SN: 9/8/15)</em>. Still, exactly when the structures evolved is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origin-photosynthesis-may-go-further-back-estimates-50-years-ago">hotly debated</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/17</em>). So it’s exciting to see fossil evidence of such old thylakoids, says Sanchez-Baracaldo, who was not involved in the work. “Any evidence that you have from that time period is important because the fossil record is really very sparse.”</p>



<p>Some researchers think that thylakoids may have evolved before the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-might-not-have-needed-major-event-become-oxygen-rich">Great Oxidation Event</a> around 2.4 billion years ago (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). Prior to that event, there were whiffs of oxygen here and there in the atmosphere, but it took the concentrated action of photosynthetic bacteria to send Earth’s oxygen levels skyrocketing. Stacks of thylakoids within cyanobacteria may have multiplied the bacteria’s oxygen production.</p>



<p>During the period when the now-fossilized cyanobacteria lived, oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere had plummeted again to a fraction of today’s levels, Sanchez-Baracaldo says. The fossils hint that there may have been small pockets where oxygen was abundant and could have fostered the evolution of the ancestors of plants and animals.</p>



<p>Many rocks that might harbor such fossils have been compressed and “cooked” destroying delicate intracellular structures like thylakoids, says Emmanuelle Javaux, an astrobiologist at the University of Liège in Belgium.</p>



<p>“We didn&#8217;t know that they could be preserved in such old microfossils,” she says. But she has no doubt that the dark lines stacked through tiny sausage-shaped cells represent thylakoids. “It cannot be something else, actually. This arrangement is very unique to cyanobacteria with thylakoids,” she says.</p>

<p>Javaux and colleagues found the oldest thylakoid-like structures in microfossils in shale from Australia. The structures were also present in about 1 billion-year-old fossils from Canada, but not in 1 billion-year-old ones from Congo. The rocks from Congo experienced slightly higher temperatures than the others, which may have destroyed fossil evidence of thylakoids. Or maybe those fossils are cyanobacteria that never evolved the structures or are another type of microbe entirely.</p>



<p>The researchers can’t tell from the fossils whether the Australian and Canadian cyanobacteria are direct ancestors of living species, Javaux says, but they are almost certainly cousins. The team hopes to investigate even older rocks from before the Great Oxidation Event for even more ancient evidence of thylakoids.</p>
