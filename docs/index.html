                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;A mechanism for ATP homeostasis based on activity-dependent synthesis and release of neurotransmitter&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has long been recognised that many neurotransmitters bear a close relationship, for
their synthesis or degradation, to compounds of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle, the central
pathway for the production of the energy intermediary adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How
neurons maintain an almost constant level of ATP in their cytosol, in spite of varying
workloads, is still an outstanding question. Taking the relationship between glutamate
(Glu) and alpha-ketoglutarate as an example, a simple metabolic model was built of a Glu-
releasing axon terminal. The model included the interconversion between Glu and alpha-
ketoglutarate, the accumulation of Glu in synaptic vesicles, and the recycling of Glu
through an activity-induced supply of its precursor glutamine by the perisynaptic
astrocyte. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, the model was reduced to two differential
equations of the cytosolic concentration of Glu and ATP. This model showed remarkable
characteristics: at steady state, irrespective of the workload, the ATP level measured 1.5
mM, and only 4.7 % of the ATP was spent on Glu release and recycling. The speed of ATP
homeostasis was determined by the (absolute) amount of ATP the axon spent on vesicular Glu
accumulation. Overall, homeostasis came at little cost as it prevented futile ATP
production when the workload decreased. These analytical and numerical results indicate
that neurotransmitter release may confer to neurons a metabolic advantage in the form of a
more accurate ATP homeostasis.</p>

<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em>, a Springer Nature journal, has retracted more than 200 papers since the start of September, and continues issuing retraction notices en masse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-024-07444-x">notices</a>, which have similar wording, the retractions come after the publisher identified problems with the articles including compromised peer review, inappropriate or irrelevant references, and nonsensical phrases, suggesting blind use of AI or machine-translation software.</p>



<p>“These investigations are based on intelligence from past work alongside whistleblower information,” Chris Graf, director of research integrity at Springer Nature in Oxford, UK, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. But Graf declined to share the specifics of the inquiry: “We need to keep details of these investigations confidential to ensure that we do not inform the efforts of individuals who may engage in unethical activities.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130209"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03621-0/index.html">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse, France, first highlighted issues with the journal in a February <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1754785367046180952">post on X</a>. Cabanac <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02134-0">has created software</a> that spots odd language in academic papers he dubbed “<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/tainted-kids-other-odd-phrases-cropping-up-in-autism-studies/">tortured phrases</a>,” which seem to be the result of attempts to circumvent plagiarism checks. </p>



<p>His <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> had flagged nearly 50 articles in <em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em> riddled with tortured phrases, mostly published in 2023. “I suspect papermill submissions + compromised peer review,” <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1754785367046180952">he wrote on X</a> at the time, referring to shady services that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">sell authorship slots and citations on papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2F80E74D4042BDCD3537D12BDD421E">posted his concerns</a> about the papers, along with their tortured phrases, on PubPeer. In his post, he called on the publisher to retract or correct the papers that are not reliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics </em>has three editors-in-chief, with some recent turnover. Xuelin Yang of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined the journal</a> in January. Daoxin Dai of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, had <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/19116278">stepped down</a> in November 2023 after taking the post in April 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Yang nor Dai replied to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salah Obayya, director of the Center for Photonics and Smart Materials at the Zewail City of Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt, is one of the journal’s other editors-in-chief. He <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined in June 2023</a>, taking over from Trevor Benson of the University of Nottingham, UK, whose tenure ended in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26613404">thank-you note</a> from Benson on the journal website reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have served in the Editor in Chief role since mid-2005, during which time metrics confirm that the journal has grown significantly in size, stature, and reputation. Although I officially retired in July 2000, I have kept research active in seeing PhDs and projects through to completion, and with a small emeritus Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust. As this activity is winding down, I feel the time is right for someone new to help drive the journal forward. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Obayya nor Benson responded to requests for comment. We also didn’t hear back from Marian Marciniak, the journal’s third editor-in-chief, who is based at the National Institute of Telecommunications Department of Transmission and Optical Technology in Warsaw, Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graf added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Alongside this work and with the Editors-in-Chief, we have been strengthening the processes for all guest-edited issues at the journal such that no unsolicited proposals are considered, an editorial board member or one of the Editors-in-Chief must be part of the Guest Editor team, and new research integrity tools have been added to the front end of our submission process. All editorial board members have also undertaken extensive research integrity training.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this month, Springer Nature began an initial public offering (IPO), noting in its prospectus that increase in undeclared use of AI in the publication process and infiltration by paper mills is a significant threat to the publishing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher noted that earlier this year it identified “a significant number” of papers published by its journals originated from paper mills, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The paper mills used guest-edited collections and fake peer reviews to evade quality control. While a large proportion of the papers and collections were brought to our attention by a third-party individual, some had already been flagged or identified through other means, and were already being investigated by our dedicated internal research integrity group. These investigations continue and could result in many retractions, which could negatively impact our reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another Springer Nature journal that seems to be retracting papers en masse is <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. The journal was one of 17 that this year <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">lost its Journal Impact Factor</a> — which is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/whats-wrong-with-the-jif-in-five-graphs">used to evaluate researchers and their work</a> — due to suspected citation manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its IPO prospectus, Springer Nature had noted that if journals are excluded from Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports database, “this could have a material detrimental effect on the results of our operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July, a spokesperson for Clarivate, the firm that publishes Journal Impact Factors, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">told <em>Retraction Watch</em></a> the journals were suppressed from their report for having&nbsp; “anomalous citation behavior, including where there is evidence of excessive journal self-citation and/or citation stacking (which involves two or more journals). We do not presume a motive or accuse these journals of wrongdoing.”</p>



<p>As <em>Retraction Watch</em> has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">previously reported</a>, Cabanac and fellow sleuth <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a> — software engineer at Yandex, an IT company based in Moscow, Russia — have previously flagged around 1,850 papers published by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>for suspicious citations, tortured phrases, and undeclared use of AI in papers. By our count, the journal has so far retracted 225 papers as part of this batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research">search for</a><em> Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>on PubPeer yields some of the flagged and retracted studies.</p>



<p>One 2023 article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35102-y">retracted</a> by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> on 25 September, was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-26647-5">titled</a>: “Association of the corona virus (Covid-19) epidemic with environmental risk factors.” This study has so far been cited two times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4C3BF43A3E49E979B8F8D340993961">PubPeer thread</a> about this study, its corresponding author, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Majid-Farhadi-6">Majid Farhadi</a> of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran, wrote: “We do not insist on using invalid articles and we ask you to agree to the correction. We are prepared to remove invalid articles.”</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-16530-6">2021 study</a>, titled, “The modulatory potential of herbal antioxidants against oxidative stress and heavy metal pollution: plants against environmental oxidative stress,” was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35004-z">pulled</a> on 17 September. This study has been cited 32 times so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But none of the study authors agreed with the study’s retraction. “Following the notification from the journal, we conducted a thorough review of our paper and found the sentences to be coherent and the phrases to adhere to standard conventions,” wrote corresponding author Zahra Ebrahimi of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran, on a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DAAF3DF3A2B5D0D5FC2D332A641024">PubPeer thread about the study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebrahimi added on PubPeer:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It’s important to note that English is not the native language for any of the authors, and while we made efforts to refine the clarity of our text using tools like Grammarly before submission, we acknowledge that it may not mirror the fluency of native English speakers. Furthermore, [at] the paper&#8217;s revision stage, in response to the journal&#8217;s request for language editing to ensure text clarity and fluency, we engaged the services of NedMedica, viz., known as Article X as well, a language editing service by Brieflands company to ensure the high quality of the paper… </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ebrahimi disagrees that the study’s peer review process was compromised, noting:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Reviewers made a total of 23 comments on our initial paper and requested improvements even in the smallest details. Upon reviewing the extensive comments provided, it is evident that the review process followed the standard procedures. It is important to note that we were kept blind to the peer review process, and thus, we remain unaware of the identities of the reviewers involved. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that none of the editorial board members are based in Iran, and we have had no prior personal or professional relationships with them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She does, however, acknowledge some errors and oversights in the study’s references but remains convinced that the article’s validity remains intact. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>…it is important to highlight that the main issue in the article lies in the placement of the references rather than the validity of the references themselves. This discrepancy stemmed from the technical challenges with reference management software. We want to assure you that the references provided are capable of supporting all the claims made in the manuscript, provided they are cited in the correct locations. The scientific validity of the article remains intact. We had prepared a correction to the latest version of the manuscript we had, wherein we will indicate the appropriate placement for citing each manuscript. Ensuring the references are placed in their correct locations, removing the Vickers citation, and adding four references that were previously omitted due to technical issues, we have ensured that all claims made in the manuscript are adequately supported.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pesticide_action_network_north_america_logo.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="200" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pesticide_action_network_north_america_logo.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-128265" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pesticide_action_network_north_america_logo.jpeg 200w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pesticide_action_network_north_america_logo-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>A public health journal has retracted an article on unintentional pesticide poisonings a year after the authors enlisted a lawyer’s help to fight the decision. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/15/authors-hire-lawyer-as-journal-plans-to-retract-their-article-on-pesticide-poisoning/">we reported</a> <em>BMC Public Health</em> had decided to retract the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” which appeared in December 2020. The article has been cited nearly 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including more than 100 since the journal told the authors it would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors listed affiliations with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations opposed to pesticides. In their review, they declared unintentional pesticide poisoning “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice cites a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">letter to the editor</a> from employees of pesticide manufacturer Bayer, and the trade organization CropLife International, which criticized the analysis. The authors stood by their findings in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">response</a>, stating the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”</p>



<span id="more-130206"></span>



<p>The authors tried to overturn the journal’s decision. In July 2023, a lawyer representing them sent the editors a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate,” as we previously reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, a journal editor wrote to the authors:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am sorry to inform you that we will be proceeding with the retraction of your article as we have lost confidence in the conclusions presented based on the original concerns raised in the <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">Matters Arising article</a> by Dunn et al. and on the assessment and advice received from our Editorial Board Members.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reply-BMC-PH-2024-09-23.pdf">rebuttal</a>, the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The envisaged retraction of our paper would be an unacceptable outcome of an unacceptable process. We have explained in detail in our rebuttals that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than annual prevalences and therefore no overestimation has taken place for this reason. We have repeatedly shown that even if the criticism were correct, it would have a negligible impact on the results of our study. A retraction would therefore be contrary to the journal&#8217;s own policy, which states that retractions are not appropriate when there is inconclusive evidence to support a retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-20318-x">notice</a>, published Wednesday, states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations by a reader and by Dunn et al. [<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">1</a>]. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable. The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented.</p>



<p>All authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides citing the source of the “concerns” and registering the authors’ disagreement, the notice matches the one the journal editor proposed to the authors last May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the publisher what held up the publication of the retraction. Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, said in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While we endeavour to complete our investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, there are a number of reasons why these processes can, on occasion, take longer than expected.</p>



<p>In this instance, after readers raised concerns in January 2023, we launched an investigation into the paper in line with COPE guidelines, with support from the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group. This process included a post-publication review by several experts in the subject matter of the paper, and extensive communication with the authors. After careful consideration of both the post-publication reviews and the authors’ responses, we concluded that the most appropriate action to take was retraction of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another group of authors has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">complained</a> about the journal’s process for retractions.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="112" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130183"/></a></figure></div>


<p>In January 2022, <em>The Oncologist</em> switched publishers from Wiley to Oxford University Press.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/26/homeopathy-for-cancer-paper-extensively-corrected-after-watchdog-agency-requested-retraction/">issued an extensive correction</a> for one of its most popular articles, a 2020 paper that describes results of a clinical trial the authors claimed found a homeopathic intervention improved quality of life and survival for people with advanced lung cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/onco.13548">article page</a> that remains on Wiley’s website, however, does not reflect the recent correction.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130182"></span>



<p>We asked Wiley whether the publisher would update the page. A spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When a journal moves from one publisher to another, as in this case, it receives a new DOI and a new digital footprint. As a result, our current policy is to keep backfiles online for such journals, and to rely on the current publisher to carry any post-publication amendments.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher is “planning to review this process” in light of new guidelines from the National Information Standards Organisation regarding <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-45-2024-crec">Communication of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern</a>, the spokesperson said. (Disclosure: Our Ivan Oransky was on the working group for those guidelines.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the abstract of the guidelines states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is crucial that researchers who discover a publication be able to identify the editorial status of the published item. It is therefore necessary that the identification of retracted items, removed content, and EoCs be effectively communicated to human researchers and that these same features be evident to machine-reading and other automated processes, as well as to other interested parties in the scholarly information workflow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 10/15/24, 1500 UTC: We note that while the journal has a new DOI, the original article’s DOI is unchanged. The subsequent correction was published using the journal’s new DOI. </p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This month, we interviewed Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Queen Mary University of London. Jessica discusses the journey of her career thus far, including moving to a new place, navigating finding a job, balancing motherhood, and the tips she has for students and early career researchers. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve been interested in issues around mental health for as long as I can remember. Why people think, feel, and act the way they do is something I find innately interesting. However, I wasn’t always very clear about my career path, and in the US we don’t specialise at university until comparatively later, so I took several kinds of classes in subjects like History, Archaeology and English Literature, which I loved. I ended up majoring in Human Biology, which was an interdisciplinary major that combined biological, behavioural, social, and cultural perspectives to study human health and disease.</span></span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Through my coursework I learned about public health school and realised this was a great fit for me, as I was interested in mental health at a population level. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I ended up getting my PhD in Epidemiology, which was a bit unexpected as I really </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">did not</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> enjoy my statistics course during university. Once I learned that I could use statistics to answer questions I was really interested in, such as why certain people were more likely to suffer with certain diseases, or why some people’s health worsened whilst others improved, I started to really love it. My focus for my PhD was Psychiatric Epidemiology, and I was super lucky to work with some amazing scientists who taught me a lot and were also really lovely people, which is so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After I finished my PhD I moved to London with my partner, which was good timing in some ways, but not great timing in others because I was visibly pregnant at that point. So, I went to a few job interviews but I could tell people were looking at me and thinking, “um, what are you doing here?”. But it worked out well in the end, as by the time I had my daughter and was ready to go back to work, a postdoc position opened up with the E-Risk study. E-Risk is based at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, and involves a twin study of over 2000 monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Twin studies are really cool because they leverage the “natural experiment” of twinship to help disentangle genetic and environmental effects (because identical twins share 100% of their DNA and fraternal twins share 50%, but importantly both sets of twins share the same, or a very similar, environment). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As part of the E-Risk study, we looked at the course of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to young adulthood, and found some really interesting results, especially about individuals that were meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD in young adulthood. Surprisingly, we found that a large proportion of people, who met all the symptoms and impairment criteria for ADHD at age 18, hadn’t done so when parents and teachers reported on their ADHD symptoms in childhood. This was really surprising because, by definition in the DSM (the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), ADHD often emerges  prior to age 12.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One interesting thing, about those who tended not to meet ADHD criteria until young adulthood, was that they were more likely to be women. Trying to understand this finding steered me towards my current research, which is focused on looking at ADHD, over the life course, among girls and women. I am currently funded by a New Investigator Research Grant from the UK Medical Research Council to examine these questions, including childhood and adolescent factors that may lead to late diagnosis, how ADHD symptoms change across puberty, as well as whether ADHD symptoms fluctuate across the menstrual cycle amongst women with ADHD. More information about my current research can be found at </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.adhdlifelab.com/" target="_blank">our team’s website</a></span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have an amazing team of early career researchers in my lab and working with them is a real highlight of my job. I also have fantastic co-workers at QMUL who are so thoughtful, supportive and fun; they improve my research as well as my mood on an everyday basis. </span></span></p>

I find it challenging to switch back and forth between all these different tasks. It’s easy to spend all your time on short-term tasks and not focus on the deeper thinking that goes into writing and research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ooof, time management is eternally something I am trying to get better at. I am not naturally a super organised person, so I try to borrow various strategies from my more organised friends and colleagues, like tracking my time to see how long various tasks take. But I’m far from having discovered the secret to being good at this! </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was really lucky to have had amazing female mentors during my PhD and postdoc, like Professor Karestan Koenen at the Harvard School of Public Health and Professor Louise Arseneault at the IoPPN at King’s College London. I am also very inspired by my female colleagues at work, several of whom also have young children, and we are always sharing the joys and the challenges of being working mothers. I also had a working mother, and I have very distinct memories of watching her go off to work when I was a kid, and I think having this in the back of my mind helped me make this choice for myself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One study I am working on now looks at how ADHD symptoms and impairment may change for women across the menstrual cycle. The effects of hormones on the brain and on women’s mental health are often overlooked, and this is perhaps especially true for women with neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD and autism. Over the next few years, I would like to continue to focus on these questions, including a research focus on perimenopause and menopause among neurodiverse women. Perimenopause and menopause is a very under-researched phase of life for women; many women with ADHD, who I have worked and spoken to, pointed to this time period as one they were really concerned about and wanted to have more research on. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers and to women wanting to pursue a research career investigating ADHD? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think there is so much interesting work to be done in many areas, and of course, especially ADHD. As far as advice, I would say that there are ups and downs in research, and periods of time where things are going well and you’re publishing, getting grants etc, and then lulls where it feels like things are going really slowly and nothing is working out. Sometimes you just have to ride the wave for a bit (either way), know that things will change and try not to have your self-concept be too influenced by these phases. And of course, academia is not the only way to do research, and not the only way to do neuroscience, so I would also encourage people to think outside the box as well as other ways they can engage with neuroscience, via working for funders, industry, charities, the government etc. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s important for students/early career researchers to have mentors they can see themselves in - people who may have had similar experiences or faced similar challenges. Given the overall under-representation of women and people of colour in higher levels of academia, this is something that needs to be improved. </span></span></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="198" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130180"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naohiro Kameta</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A nanotube researcher in Japan has earned 13 retractions, with more to come, after an extensive investigation by the country’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) revealed widespread misconduct in his work. </p>



<p>AIST’s investigation found Naohiro Kameta, senior principal researcher at the Nanomaterials Research Institute located in AIST’s Ibaraki campus, fabricated and falsified dozens of studies. He was apparently dismissed from his role following the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institute first learned of the problems in Kameta’s work in November 2022, according to a translated version of the <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">investigation report</a>. Initially, they looked into five papers, but eventually expanded their scrutiny to 61 articles on which Kameta was the lead or responsible author.</p>



<span id="more-130178"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">The investigation</a>, which wrapped up in December 2023, found Kameta had “independently committed research misconduct” by fabricating and falsifying data in 42 papers published between 2005 and 2022. According to the findings, Kameta cut out parts of electron micrographs to portray them as different structures. He also falsified scale bars of diagrams to be longer or shorter – <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10847-024-01257-x">in one instance</a> making the scale almost 10 times larger than the true size of the material shown. The report added Kameta’s research notes were incomplete and many of the samples he should have preserved were discarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta received about $230,000 (more than ¥33 million) in grant funding for research topics broadly related to the misconduct, of which approximately $35,000 was directly spent on the work described in the papers AIST found to have fake data, according to the investigation report. The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science <a href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-kousei/sochi/2024-4-8.html">has ordered the research funds be returned</a>, and stated they will not provide funding to Kameta for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investigators at AIST collected responses to a questionnaire sent to more than 20 other individuals who had co-authored papers with Kameta. According to their responses, many of them had trusted Kameta’s expertise and didn’t critically review the data or images presented in the final publications. In some cases, co-authors admitted they didn’t check the papers before submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19 papers AIST reviewed that didn’t appear to have evidence of research misconduct, the investigation found data discrepancies in 14 that did not significantly affect the conclusions of the papers. Those issues may have arisen because of “carelessness,” according to the investigators, who recommended Kameta request corrections for these articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institution also identified Toshimi Shimizu and Mitsutoshi Masuda, colleagues of Kameta at AIST, as authors responsible for the content of the papers, but found they were not involved in any misconduct. Shimizu’s staff page <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/tshmz-shimizu/Home-e.html">remains active</a> on the AIST website, although his institutional email bounced back when we attempted to contact him. Masuda is listed as a <a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/ischem/en/organization/index.html">deputy director</a> of sustainable chemistry at the institute. He did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several journals have already begun retracting Kameta’s work, and more are expected to follow. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Naohiro-Misconduct-Papers.xlsx">By our count</a>, out of the 42 papers identified as problematic, 13 have so far been retracted. Fourteen of the remaining, unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. A representative of the publisher said they were aware of the issues and would be pursuing retractions of the papers. Five other unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the American Chemical Society. The publisher has not responded to requests for comment. </p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">the institution released a statement regarding Kameta’s case, announcing that </a>“one employee found to have been involved in research misconduct will be dismissed.” Another employee not involved in misconduct, but responsible for the papers, would be suspended from work for a month, according to the statement. AIST’s press office would not confirm whether the dismissed employee was Kameta, but the investigators identified Kameta as the only individual responsible for the misconduct. Kameta no longer has a staff profile on the institution’s website and his email bounced back when we attempted to contact him.</p>

<p>Year after year, a husband-and-wife team at a university in Iran has been publishing studies involving research on cell lines ostensibly purchased from <a href="https://en.pasteur.ac.ir/">the Pasteur Institute of Iran</a>, in Tehran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the couple may never have been in possession of the cells. In correspondence obtained by Retraction Watch, the Pasteur Institute told their employer, Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, only three of the many cell lines described in their publications had been available at the national cell bank over the past decade.</p>



<p>A university official confirmed the two researchers – <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=wo3tSNQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Fraidoon Kavoosi</a>, an associate professor in <a href="https://medicine.jums.ac.ir/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AD%DB%8C">the department of anatomical science</a>, and his wife <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2gu1bA0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Masumeh Sanaei</a>, an assistant professor in the same department – were under investigation.</p>

<p>Amir Abdoli, vice president of research and technology at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There were some ambiguities regarding the availability&nbsp;of cell lines in the&nbsp;Pasteur Institute of Iran as well as the place of [the couple’s] works, as their works have not been performed in the laboratories of&nbsp;Jahrom University of Medical Sciences. We asked the authors to respond several times, but we didn&#8217;t receive a reasonable answer. Hence, we had to send the documents and evidence to the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research for future investigation and decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not yet contacted the journals because we are waiting for the ethics committee&#8217;s decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Abdoli added that following a vote by the Basic Science Research Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, the school had stopped accepting new research proposals from the two professors.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In theory, it’s possible that researchers claiming to have obtained cell lines from a repository that doesn’t stock them may still have worked with those cell lines, according to Jennifer Byrne, <a href="https://biobank.health.nsw.gov.au/about-the-biobank/meet-the-team/">director of biobanking with NSW Health Pathology</a>, in Australia, and a professor of molecular oncology at the University of Sydney:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For example, they could have obtained them from someone else who they assumed had obtained them from the claimed repository, but didn’t. The claimed resource could reflect people wanting to signal that they obtained cell lines from a known repository, as this is best practice, or a trust signal, when in fact, many researchers pass cell lines between each other as this is quicker, cheaper and more convenient. That said, claiming to use cell lines from a repository that doesn’t stock them could be considered a yellow flag, as this is a misleading claim, although a claim that could have been made in good faith.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.34995">a study</a> published earlier this year, Byrne and her colleagues found hundreds of papers consistently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/11/misspelled-cell-lines-take-on-new-lives-and-why-thats-bad-for-the-scientific-literature/">misspelled the names of cell lines</a> the authors said they used in their work – <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/hundreds-cancer-papers-mention-cell-lines-don-t-seem-exist">possibly a sign of paper mill involvement</a>. The Iranian case is different, as the cell lines described in the couple’s articles seem to be real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know how often people might claim to have obtained cell lines that do exist from places that don’t stock these cell lines, as we focussed on non-verifiable cell lines in our study,” Byrne told us.</p>



<p>Kavoosi did not respond to emails requesting comment. We were unable to find contact information for Sanaei.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Since 2014, the couple has coauthored dozens of studies, according to their Google Scholar profiles. Many have appeared in Iran-based journals, such as the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijom/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>International Journal of Preventive Medicine</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/adbm/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>Advanced Biomedical Research</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/rips/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences</em></a>, all published by Wolters Kluwer, as well as the <a href="https://journal.waocp.org/?_action=article&amp;au=260344&amp;_au=Kavoosi,%20Fraidoon"><em>Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of their work has focused on assessing effects of established or potential drugs on human cancer cells. The suspect articles all state the cells were obtained from the Pasteur Institute of Iran.</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-1-page-1.jpg">letter</a> from Jahrom’s president to the Pasteur Institute dated Oct. 31, 2023, suggests the the research duo’s institution had grown suspicious of their work.</p>



<p>According to a machine translation of the letter, Mohammad Rahmanian inquired about a long list of cell lines he said were unavailable from Pasteur’s website but were needed by his school for research. He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-1-page-2.jpg">listed</a> the names of 70 cell lines he was looking to purchase in an attached spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We spot-checked the cell lines in the spreadsheet and found they appeared to correspond to cells Kavoosi, Sanaei and their coauthors stated they had purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Iran.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-2.jpg">reply</a> to Jahrom dated April 16, 2024, Delaram Doroud, deputy director of research, technology and education at the Pasteur Institute of Iran, made reference to a subsequent letter and a phone call from Jahrom University and explained that, in the past 10 years, only three of the 70 cell lines had been available from the institute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We sought comment from the Pasteur Institute of Iran, including Doroud, and the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research, but have not heard back.</p>

<p>A psychiatry researcher who <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/ethics/fda-describes-objectionable-conditions-at-new-york-state-psychiatric-institute/">received a warning letter</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year committed research misconduct, another federal watchdog found.</p>



<p>Bret Rutherford, formerly a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, “engaged in research misconduct by recklessly falsely reporting that all human research subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for late-life depression studies,” according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-rutherford-bret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">case summary</a>&nbsp;from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) published today.</p>



<p>As&nbsp;<em>The Transmitter</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/ethics/exclusive-shake-up-at-top-psychiatric-institute-following-suicide-in-clinical-trial/">previously reported</a>, a suicide that occurred during one of Rutherford’s trials in 2021 was followed by a suspension of his research a few months later. The U.S. Office of Human Research Protections subsequently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/health/columbia-drug-trials-suicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted</a>&nbsp;all federally funded research involving human participants at the institute in June 2023 and launched a review of its research practices.</p>



<span id="more-130163"></span>



<p>The ORI’s findings detail how in five published papers, Rutherford reported that 45 research participants were eligible for clinical studies, when in fact they were taking antidepressants or other medications that should have excluded them from participation. Rutherford also included 15 participants who took medications during a 28-day washout period before the trial when they were not supposed to be taking the medications, and he reported full washout periods for 8 participants who underwent shorter periods.</p>



<p>The false reporting affected “the reported clinical research methods and results” of the five articles, the ORI’s finding stated. Three of the articles have been retracted, and the other two have been corrected.&nbsp;<em>The Transmitter</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/retraction/flawed-protocol-for-levodopa-clinical-trial-brings-retractions/">previously reported</a>&nbsp;on the corrections and two of the retractions, which reference protocol violations in a clinical trial of whether levodopa, a drug for Parkinson’s disease, could help older adults with depression.</p>



<p>The third retraction, of a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00860-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;about a levodopa trial published in&nbsp;<em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em>, appeared in March.

                <p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></em><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Gender is a self-described characteristic, whilst sex is biologically determined. The term ‘women’ can refer to either or both definitions, and this may vary according to the study cited. At Women in Neuroscience UK, we tackle both sexism and gender biases in neuroscience, by covering topics of sex/gender discrimination in neuroscience workplaces and sex differences in neurological conditions. Our current activities primarily support female-identifying neuroscientists but we actively encourage people of all gender identities to our community. We believe everyone can benefit from learning and peer support towards more diverse and inclusive neuroscience.</span></span></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite growing movements toward equality, women continue to face barriers in society and in neuroscience spaces. From skewed representation to unequal pay, this piece aims to expose injustices facing women in neuroscience and calls for action towards a fairer, more inclusive future.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in senior roles</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are awarded over half of bachelor’s and master’s degrees in neuroscience worldwide. At the postdoctoral level, there is an equal split between men and women (Euraxess, 2018). Yet, women are not fairly represented at senior career stages; for example, less than 14% of tenured neuroscience faculty in the US are female (Sibener et al., 2022) and men account for around 75% of professors in Europe (Gibney, 2022).</span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_d7da42db74b14c49a07c7bbf6426cc59~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_988,h_679,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Figure 1. Proportion (%) of men and women in a typical academic career, students and academic staff, EU-28, 1999-2016 |Source: She Figures 2018 and 2015 (Euraxess 2019)."></figure>
<p>While men and women may possess identical educational backgrounds, statistically, men are more likely to progress in their career paths more quickly, leading to a disproportional underrepresentation of women in senior roles. Some contributing factors include unconscious gender biases, sexual harassment and the pressure to take on home duties. Women are more likely than men to take on primary carer roles for children and the elderly (including people with dementia), resulting in less time to invest in their careers (Sharma et al., 2016). Furthermore, women who have children are less likely to be promoted compared to men who have children (NCT, 2022). </p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_08c57ca2dcb140d583ee52eb7ecdf4ab~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_918,h_690,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p>Furthermore, male academics tend to receive greater recognition from their university, be more respected by their students, and obtain administrative assistance more easily (Greene et al., 2010). In other words, the underrepresentation of women is not a matter of competence or aptitude, but rather a number of barriers that reduce the likelihood of women being promoted or hired for higher-earning positions – this phenomenon is referred to as the ‘<span style="color: #BF7DA7;">glass ceiling</span>’.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><em><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Reasons for underrepresentation of women in senior roles:</span></span></strong></em></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sexism in the workplace and its broad detriments</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The </span></span><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">authority gap</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> impacts women across workplaces, due to harmful and ongoing sexist stereotypes and biases. Women are more likely to be interrupted, talked over, and not taken seriously by their male co-workers. Attempts by women to overcome these barriers, by being confident or assertive, can instead be viewed as aggressive and abrasive (Doyle-Morris, 2021). </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_32641de1d81c47cfb97fd7b369ebaf0f~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_986,h_661,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are nearly three times more likely than men to be sexually harassed at work (Kearl, Johns, &amp; Raj, 2019), and 1 in 7 of these women opt to change jobs (Kearl, Johns, &amp; Raj, 2019). According to a study, approximately 78% of female STEM undergraduate students have experienced some form of sexual harassment in the previous year (Leaper &amp; Starr, 2018). As a consequence, women may feel uncomfortable in their work or study environment and be discouraged from investing time and effort in their careers. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: hiring</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Male faculty members tend to hire 10-40% fewer women than female faculty members (Sheltzer &amp; Smith, 2014). This can, in part, be attributed to conscious and unconscious gender bias, as well as the prospect of maternity leave, which discourages men from hiring young, and/or newlywed, women or cause them to lose their jobs (Topping, 2015). The percentage of women hired decreases further if the male faculty is high achieving (Sheltzer &amp; Smith, 2014). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Female academics also tend to be allocated more teaching and service roles (Greene et al., 2010), which was considered to be one of the departmental obstacles to recruiting and hiring women faculty.</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With reduced employment opportunities and visibility in the field, women face greater barriers to progressing their careers, becoming high achievers and reaching their full potential. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: grant funding</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are clear disparities in the allocation of grant funding. In dementia research, for example, women make up 60% of researchers in the UK but are only awarded 37% of grants (Alzheimer’s Research UK, 2022). This could result in female researchers struggling to afford high cost experiments and high-impact factor journals to publish their work, leading them to opt for lower-visibility outlets and resulting in the underrepresentation of women authors in high-impact journals. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in journals</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A 2022 study (Son &amp; Bell, 2022) looked at 119,592 manuscript submissions by scientists before, and during, the pandemic. The study concluded that women contribute fewer manuscripts than men for all world regions, for both the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods, although there is a slow increase. Before the lockdown in 2020, female authors made up 16.5% of submitted manuscripts. During the pandemic, the rate of increase slowed, but we still saw a 2.3% rise (to 18.8%) in the number of manuscripts submitted by female scientists. However, in most countries, except for China, South Korea, and Taiwan, the number of female first authors has seen a decline in recent years (Son &amp; Bell, 2022). Fewer women in senior roles and leading research projects, along with gender biases in grant funding and article reviewing may contribute to fewer female first and last authors.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In addition, female scientists are significantly less likely to be cited, particularly in articles published by high-impact journals, and they are more likely to report that their contributions were underestimated by the team (Ross et al., 2022).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Imposter syndrome in an environment that was not built for women</span></span></strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_dc0b20a5c55242eea53aa99c488cd729~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_756,h_850,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lack of self-confidence can be detrimental to women’s career advancement in several ways. Compared to men, female applicants are less inclined to apply for positions when they do not meet all of the criteria because of self-doubt (Mohr, 2014). This lack of confidence also contributes to the pay gap, with women being less likely to ask for a raise, often due to fear of backlash from not conforming to society’s stereotype. Lack of self-confidence is also thought to contribute to underrepresentation in high-profile journals. A survey, completed by over 4,800 scientists, found that only 37% of women reported submitting papers to Nature, Science, and PNAS, compared with almost 49% of men (Chawla, 2023). It was concluded that women tended to only submit their best work to high-profile journals, whereas men were more likely to submit papers of lower quality or novelty. In addition, men were more likely to cite their own work than women who, in contrast, tend to underrate their contributions to academic papers (Chawla, 2023).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, a meta-analysis of clinical journal articles concluded that papers with a male first or last author were more likely to present their own  findings in a positive light within titles and abstracts, relative to articles with female first and last authors. This was particularly prominent in journals with a higher impact rating. Presenting research findings more positively was also correlated with a greater number of article citations (Lerchenmueller, Sorenson &amp; Jena, 2019).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Many women report feeling intimidated (Clarke, 2022) entering male-dominated spaces due to the aforementioned factors, such as sexual harassment and discrimination, reducing chances of speaking out and/or seeking support in cases of workplace harassment. When an individual feels doubtful and like they don’t belong in a space, this is often described as ‘imposter syndrome’,</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> &quot;The frequent feeling of not deserving one&apos;s success, and of being a failure despite a sustained record of achievements&quot;, as per Cambridge Dictionary. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A recent meta-analysis, combining data from over 42,000 participants and 108 studies, found that women consistently scored higher than men in measures of impostor syndrome. This sex disparity did not reduce over time, despite gradual increases in female representation at more senior career stages and some positive advancements in societal views.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Altogether, this increases the likelihood of women leaving neuroscience workspaces in a vicious cycle.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lack of recognition</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women often do not receive the recognition and visibility they deserve. Less than 6% of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureates are women, despite making up a substantial fraction (33%) of researchers worldwide (UNESCO, 2021) and having made groundbreaking discoveries. There have even been instances of female researchers who have had their research plagiarised, and as a result, received no credit for it. One great example is </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://sruk.org.uk/lack-of-sleep-alcoholic-fermentation-and-other-untold-discoveries-by-maria-manasseina/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Manasseina</a></span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, a pioneer neuroscientist, specialising in the impacts of prolonged sleep deprivation. Prior to that, she worked in a lab at the Polytechnic University of Vienna where she investigated the role of yeast in alcoholic fermentation. 25 years later, the male scientist, Eduard Buchner, published a very similar paper to hers replicating the same results, without crediting her work. In 1907, Buchner won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Manasseina’s name was obliterated (WINEU, 2017). </span></span></p>

<p><u><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Impacts of underrepresentation of women in senior neuroscience roles:</span></span></strong></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: salary</span></span></strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_e04f6fae88f140e990e63967cdabf36b~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_974,h_802,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the UK achieving a high parity score of 0.789, according to the World Economic Forum (Pal, Piaget and Zahidi, 2024), a clear pay gap remains. On average, female full-time workers are paid 10.7% less than their male counterparts. and it is estimated that the gender pay gap will not close until 2051 (Fawcett Society, 2023). The pay gap also extends to race, with black women earning almost 25% less than white women, which is a result of systemic racism. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One factor that contributes to the overall gender pay gap is the underrepresentation of women in senior roles, however there also lies pay disparities between men and women doing the same jobs. In the medical field, for example, the mean annual income for a male GP between 2016 and 2017 was £93,760, while female GPs of the same level were paid just £75,671, which is a 19% difference (Russel, 2020). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Of women who, despite societal pressures, pursue a raise, approximately 15% are successful, relative to 20% of their male counterparts (Artz, Goodall &amp; Oswald, 2018). Pay gaps have the potential to significantly impact mental health during the cost of living crisis, especially in the case of single mothers. A study by the charity Mind estimates that 74% of women in England and Wales feel that their mental health has suffered from the rising cost of living (Nicholls, 2023; Rosseninsky, 2024).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in clinical trials</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Historically, the female body has been grossly understudied. Back in ancient Greece, physicians believed uteruses were able to ‘wander’ around the body and cause a wide range of neurological symptoms such as anxiety, headaches, and tremors – they named this condition hysteria (Tasca et al., 2012). This was used by clinicians as an excuse to dismiss symptoms of female patients and, therefore, prioritise men’s health. Nowadays, while we have an increasing understanding of female anatomy, we still see sex and gender discrepancies in women’s health, treatment and ongoing research.  </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_56e901e0dd9b47edb868212019494552~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_768,h_589,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">From 1977 to 1993, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guideline was in effect, prohibiting most women of childbearing age from taking part in clinical trials. This guideline followed the thalidomide scandal, to protect women from possible side effects and to prevent birth defects in their children (NIH, 2020). However, this meant many medications and treatments were released to the public without undergoing clinical testing on women, resulting in unfavourable side effects and outcomes for women. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Currently, clinical trials supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate the inclusion of female participants, but privately funded trials have no such requirements. Additionally, NIH funding trends reveal a greater financial commitment to conditions predominantly impacting males (Mirin, 2021).  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In clinical and preclinical trials today, women often continue to make up less than half of participants. In dementia research, women constitute 58% of participants, despite making up 64% of dementia patients (Pinho-Gomes et al., 2022). Furthermore, only 1 in 6 of the rodents featured in pre-clinical research are female (Brookshire, 2019). Female mice have been thought to display greater variability than male mice due to hormonal fluctuations as per their oestrous cycle. Some scientists claim that female mice require more funds and labour to mitigate the effects caused by the oestrous cycle, which has proven to be a major impediment to the inclusion of female subjects in research.  However, more recent research seems to suggest that male rodents are just as variable as their female counterparts (Kaluve, Le &amp; Graham, 2022). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The historic, and to an extent continued, exclusion or underrepresentation of women in animal and human clinical trials, and the lack of sex-specific analysis, is of great concern. With less data on treatment impacts on women, we have poorer evidence-based healthcare for women and greater risks of poorly understood adverse effects for women from treatments.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Two-thirds of people with dementia are female, but due to a lack of research, we don’t know why this is and whether there are sex-specific disease pathways (Alzheimer’s Research UK, 2022). With limited research, women’s health is so poorly understood that doctors more frequently misdiagnose their female patients: women are 50% more likely than men to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack (BHF, 2016) and 33% after a stroke (Newman-Toker et al., 2014), both of which can be life-threatening. Women also report waiting longer than 10 months after their first GP visit to receive a brain tumour diagnosis, when early diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good prognosis (Dusenbery, 2018). On the other hand, women are more likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders such as depression (Sundbom et al., 2017). They are overprescribed antidepressants, despite having identical depression symptom scores as their male counterparts, which results in unwanted mild to severe side effects for women (Leonard &amp; Biggers, 2021). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, women are at a much higher risk of overdosing on prescribed drugs due to incorrect dosage, stemming from lack of research and female underrepresentation in clinical trials. Moreover, over 90% of human trials do not report sex-specific outcomes and side effects, which could be key to improving understanding and treatment of womens’ health (Martinkova et al., 2021). Each year, it is estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 people die as a result of diagnostic errors in the US alone (Dusenbery, 2018). This is a major issue that must be addressed to prevent further unnecessary deaths in the future. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Final thoughts</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The world of neuroscience is often more difficult for women, especially when dealing with neurological conditions, as individuals or as carers, but also as neuroscience researchers. For most of history, science has been done by men for men, while women have been perceived as the secondary sex. Consequently, women are expected to work harder and confront deeply ingrained societal constructs to climb the career ladder. In spite of all that, neuroscience is slowly evolving and becoming more inclusive towards women. Women now have platforms, like WiNUK, to voice their concerns as well as to share their stories and inspire other fellow scientists, and we hope that things will only get better for researchers, their environments, and their work. It is fantastic to see grant funds being developed to support sex-stratified neuroscience research, for example: </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.alz.org/research/for_researchers/grants/types-of-grants/aarg-d" target="_blank">AARG-D Research Grant| Alzheimer&apos;s Association</a></span></span></u><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">.</span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> With specific funding pots, the increasing interest in women’s health, and efforts like WiNUK working towards closing the gender gap in neuroscience senior career positions, we hope to see a future of neuroscience free from sexism.</span></span></p>
