              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-animal-collaboration-dolphins-brazil">Here are 3 people-animal collaborations besides dolphins and Brazilians</a></h4>

              
                <p>We’ve all heard that dogs are a man’s best friend, but our canine companions don’t make up the entirety of humankind’s friend circle. Humans have cooperated with wild animals throughout our evolutionary history, forming reciprocally beneficial relationships known to biologists as mutualisms.</p>



<p>One particularly piscine partnership that made headlines recently can be found in Brazil, where fishers catch nets full of fish with the aid of the local bottlenosed dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus gephyreus</em>). </p>



<p>This team-up started over a century ago, probably when fishers first noticed that the presence of dolphins was a clue that fish were hiding in the murky water, says Mauricio Cantor, a behavioral ecologist at Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport.</p>





<p>“The dolphins are really good at detecting fish and herding them toward the coast,” he says, “and the fishers are really good at trapping the fish with their net.” Once the fish are mostly secured in the net, the dolphins are sure to snag a few for themselves.</p>



<p>In a study published January 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Cantor and colleagues used long-term data to show that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207739120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dolphins and fishers respond to cues from the other</a>, and without experienced partners who know the right dance steps, the routine falls apart. “This is a really remarkable and impressive study,” says Pat Shipman, an anthropologist at Penn State University who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>This fishing partnership is an important part of the cultural identity of both the fishers and the dolphins, but Cantor and his colleagues’ work shows that <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice is in decline</a>. And among human-animal partnerships, it’s not alone. “Most of the historical cases are declining or already gone,” Cantor says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given their rarity and charm, let’s take a look at some of the other known examples of human-animal cooperation.</p>



<h4>People used to team up with orcas to hunt whales in southeastern Australia</h4>



<p>The bottlenosed isn’t the only dolphin that humans have formed beneficial arrangements with. In the 1800s, several hunters began working with a pod of orcas (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) to catch large whales. At Twofold Bay in southeastern Australia, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279302786992694#:~:text=These%20sources%20indicate%20that%20cooperative,beyond%20the%20acquisition%20of%20food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some orcas would find and harass a whale to tire it out, while others swam to alert whaling crews</a> (made up of Aboriginal Australians and Scottish immigrants) that they’d found prey.</p>





<p>Once the whalers arrived and harpooned the whale, they let the orcas eat the tongue — a delicacy in the killer whale culinary world — before taking the rest for themselves.</p>



<p>While the dolphins and fishers in Brazil were chasing the same prey — schools of migratory mullet (<em>Mugil liza</em>) — the orcas and whalers were mostly after different things. The key similarity, Cantor says, is that there’s enough prey for everyone, so that no competition arises to spoil the partnership.</p>



<p>This relationship ultimately ended when some settlers killed two orcas, which drove the cooperative pod away from the bay, seemingly never to hunt with humans again.</p>



<h4>These birds guide people to honey in Africa</h4>



<p>Sometimes, a name says it all. Such is the case for the greater honeyguide (<em>Indicator indicator</em>), which has been labeled in both English and Latin based on its most famous trait. These birds live in sub-Saharan Africa, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-birds-communicate-collaborate">cooperate with local honey hunters</a> to gain access to succulent beeswax (<em>SN: 7/21/16</em>).</p>



<p>Birds, like humans, don’t like to be stung by bees, so a honeyguide that’s hankering for beeswax will chirp at a person to signal that they should follow. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(22)01398-7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeyguide then leads the hunters to a bee nest</a> and lets them do the dirty work of harvesting it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1440" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline.jpg" alt="A greater honeyguide, a small bird with a tan body, dark brown wings and head, and a red beak, looks to the right" class="wp-image-3121599" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-1380x776.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121599">In search of beeswax, the greater honeyguide (<em>Indicator indicator</em>) helps humans in Africa locate bee nests full of honey.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121599">Michael Heyns/Wikimedia Commons (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-BY-SA-4.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like with orcas, honeyguides and humans are after different parts of the prize: Humans want the honey, while the birds want the wax. Honeyguides are so helpful for finding bee nests that the Borana people of East Africa blow a special whistle called a “fuulido<em>”</em> to summon them when it’s time for a honey hunt.</p>



<p>Similar to the dolphins in Brazil, the relationship with honeyguides is an important part of many African cultures. Legend even has it that a scorned honeyguide, if denied beeswax on prior hunts, will lead the hunters not to delicious honey but instead into the jaws of a dangerous predator, like a lion.</p>



<h4>Wolves and people were once on the same side when hunting big game</h4>



<p>To see the most extreme outcome of human-animal partnership, take a look at 39 percent of the country’s beds, couches and backyards. That’s about how many households in the United States own a dog. But it turns out a canine doesn’t have to be domesticated to get along with humans; Indigenous stories from peoples in North America describe cooperating with gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) to hunt big game like elk and mammoths.</p>



<p>The wolves would run down the prey until it tired, and humans would make the kill once they caught up. Because these prey items were so massive (like the large schools of mullet), it didn’t matter that <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-ethnobiology/volume-35/issue-2/etbi-35-02-262-285.1/Relationships-Between-Indigenous-American-Peoples-and-Wolves-1--Wolves/10.2993/etbi-35-02-262-285.1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans and wolves were after the same thing</a> — there was plenty to go around.</p>



<p>Though this furry friendship doesn’t exist anymore, wolves are still important in many Indigenous cultures. Some even still continue the practice of leaving some meat for the wolves after a hunt.</p>



<p>Though human-animal partnerships are rare and on the decline, they “give us an illustration of how positive our human interactions can be with nature,” Cantor says.</p>



<p>For Shipman, the urge to engage with other animals is a defining trait of humanity. “It’s in some ways as fundamental to humans,” she says, “as being bipedal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2021/">PLOS Price Transparency Update 2021</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework 2021</h2>



<p><br>We encourage researchers to give transparent insight into their work for the benefit of community understanding and assessment and we want to give you the same insight into ours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the ways we do this is through the Plan S <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a>. PLOS has participated in the framework since its pilot phase in 2020<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and we&rsquo;re pleased to once again <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our reporting</a> here to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities and operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency data 2021</strong></p>



<p>Publishers completing the framework divide their Article Processing Charge (APC), per journal, into eight different services (you can find a description of these services in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>). Data for the framework is reported at the end of the following year meaning the data in the table below reflects our publication fee breakdown for the year 2021 based on the APC for a Research Article in each journal. You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BqQr6mGb8jedOX_ozavNT6IrfcWND1Kn/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t PLOS moving beyond the APC?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! We recognize APCs are an imperfect solution for truly equitable Open Access opportunities and we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to establish new models of Open Access support. Each of our journals offers APC-alternative models that can significantly reduce or entirely eliminate APCs for authors. In time, we believe we can entirely eliminate APCs &mdash; but there is more work ahead of us yet. By the close of 2021, PLOS had signed partnerships with 93 institutions and we&rsquo;re continuing to make this a priority. To give you a peek at our most recent data, those <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">partnerships nearly doubled in 2022</a> to include 181 institutions across 26 countries. We hope future iterations of the framework will enable us to represent this data alongside APCs. In the meantime, keep an eye on our blog for more announcements and updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>PLOS Computational Biology</td><td>PLOS Genetics</td><td>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</td><td>PLOS Pathogens</td><td>PLOS Biology</td><td>PLOS Medicine</td><td>PLOS ONE</td></tr><tr><td>2021 APC price</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,420</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for journal and community development</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>24%</td><td>23%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price from submission to first decision</td><td>12%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>26%</td><td>24%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for peer review management</td><td>13%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>14%</td><td>20%</td><td>17%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services from acceptance to publication</td><td>21%</td><td>19%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>9%</td><td>11%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services after publication</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td><td>6%</td><td>8%</td><td>3%</td><td>4%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for platform development</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td><td>8%</td><td>2%</td><td>7%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for sales &amp; marketing to customers or of articles</td><td>18%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>15%</td><td>13%</td><td>15%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for author and customer support</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>10%</td><td>2%</td><td>3%</td><td>8%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Differences in journal editorial structures and services drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated to each category. For PLOS, this difference is most apparent in&nbsp; <em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine,</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> which rely on in-house editorial teams. More detail on the operational differences of PLOS&rsquo; editorial models can be found in our original<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/"> transparency post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also remember 2021 as the year <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">PLOS launched new journals</a><em>. </em>Publication fee breakdown for those journals will be provided in the following year&rsquo;s report to reflect their first full year of publishing activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Comparisons to our 2020 data</strong></p>



<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve made adjustments to more accurately distribute costs previously reported in the &lsquo;Platform development&rsquo; category. Maintaining digital services that support peer review and article assessment, as well as marketing have been allocated accordingly. (The &ldquo;Platform Development&rdquo; category was introduced to the framework last year.) We&rsquo;ve also reported upper and lower bounds of institutional membership costs for our Community Action Publishing (CAP) model<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>. CAP is a collective-action model for <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine </em>which equitably distributes the cost of highly selective publishing based on <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">several factors</a> to institutional members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there is also a natural fluctuation in the allocation of costs over time to provide further resources to specific areas of journal development. For <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> for example, our shift to CAP required slightly higher spend to set up &lsquo;sales and marketing&rsquo; infrastructure that will enable us to expand institutional partnerships that eliminate author fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>As a nonprofit organization, our organizational activities are developed with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of researchers and reinvesting in the scholarly community in ways that support and further our <a href="https://plos.org/about/">mission</a>.</p>



<p>Many of those activities go beyond the breakdown you see here. Our highly regarded publishing ethics team works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by connecting authors to publication opportunities and career-building tools like our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Centers</a>, and through dedicated media promotion of their published articles. Staff across the organization are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science practices</a> at scale, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with organizations</a> around the world to better understand researchers&rsquo; needs in order to make participation in the research ecosystem more transparent, efficient, and fair across all demographics, geographies, and disciplines.</p>



<p>For more information about our finances, PLOS provides an annual update on our <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">financial overview page</a>. We&rsquo;ve also shared our pricing information for our emerging business models in our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/">FAQs</a>. And of course, we&rsquo;ll always share updates on our work and important milestones like this one through our blogs network.</p>

<p>A new look at these bulges on the <em>Mimosa pudica</em> plant has revealed more details of how a leaf manages its unusually fast folding, says biomechanist David Sleboda of the University of California, Irvine. “I think that these particular organs are really cool because their motion is reversible,” he says. “[W]hen people see plant motion that is reversible, it feels much more similar to animal motion.”</p>





<p>Scientists have already worked out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.12.013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic chemistry that drives a little mimosa motor</a>, or pulvinus, he and colleagues write in a paper slated for the Feb. 6<em>&nbsp;Current Biology</em>. When a deer hoof or something else scary jostles a leaf, potassium and some other ions shift from one part of a pulvinus toward another. Water follows the swoosh of ions. Cells that lose water deflate and sag while those on the other side bloat. Distortions in multiple pulvini make the halves of a feathery leaf fold toward each other, like an invisible hand gently closing a book.</p>

<p>Instead of studying chemistry, Sleboda and colleagues looked at microscopic structural details in pulvinus cells that help create such useful distortions, he reported January 7 at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, Texas. One feature that makes plant-muscle cells bloat more efficiently is reinforcement with microscopic fibrils. They work like corsets, keeping cells from bulging out in all directions. Instead, the corset directs much of the swelling along the axis that will fold up the leaf halves.</p>



<p>Also, pulvinus cells that need to bulge fast have what look like wrinkles of easily expandable tissue for inrushing water, plus special highly porous zones called pit fields. The pits look as if water could sluice through easily in a tickled-leaf emergency. Cell arrangement itself looks specialized for expanding and shrinking. A pulvinus cross section reveals a pattern “like the bellows of a concertina,” Sleboda said.</p>

<p>The widespread <em>M. pudica</em>, or sensitive plant, is one of the better-known leaf flexors. Yet clusters of other plants in the same family, the legumes, also move their leaves, says botanist Thainara Policarpo Mendes of Universidade Estadual Paulista in Botucatu, Brazil. Some relatives close fast like <em>M. pudica</em>, but many are slower. What she also thinks about, though, is why leaves close at all. People have proposed a variety of advantages: discouraging animals from grazing on a plant that suddenly looks more sticklike, or even helping a plant lose less heat on very cold nights. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleboda too can reel off proposed hypotheses but remains skeptical of all of them. “There’s not a ton of research,” he says. That, however, is fine with him. “My favorite thing about sensitive plants’ leaf closing,” he says, “is that we don’t know why they do it.”</p>

<p><strong>Early man in America takes a step backward</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/early-man-america-takes-step-backward"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 27, 1973 </p>



<p>“Early Americans lived among and hunted mammoth, camel, extinct horse and bison as far back as 15,000&nbsp;years. Now there is mounting evidence for a second breakthrough that will push the history of man in America back to 30,000 years — and possibly further.”</p>



<h4>Update<a id="_msocom_1"></a></h4>



<p>The question of when humans first set foot in the Americas is still hotly debated. Recent fossil and archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants arrived tens of thousands of years ago. For instance, humanlike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">footprints in New Mexico date to about 20,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). And stone tools found in a cave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">hint that humans resided in Mexico roughly 30,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Some archaeologists argue that stones caked with mastodon bone residue that were found in California were tools used by humans or their close relatives around 130,000&nbsp;years ago, although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stones-mastodon-bones-debate-america-first-settlers">that claim remains controversial</a> (<em>SN Online: 12/4/20</em>). Pinning down the timeline of human settlement could reveal how people spread across North and South America.</p>

<p>Two Korean journals last month pulled papers by a prominent cardiologist at Yonsei University, Professor <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/person/6227">Hui-Nam Pak</a>, with one retraction notice citing “issues related to scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had raised <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/28550DDA06A74EF90C14099CDAC67C">several concerns</a> about data integrity, “mixed-up” data and “statistical nonsense” in “<a href="https://eymj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=406858&amp;code=0069YMJ&amp;vmode=FULL">eNOS3 Genetic Polymorphism Is Related to Post-Ablation Early Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation</a>,” which was published in 2015 in <em>Yonsei Medical Journal</em>. The journal retracted the paper on January 19, noting that “we have recently become aware of a number of issues related to scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>The article was coauthored by <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/patrick-t-ellinor">Patrick Ellinor</a>, acting chief of cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, and has been cited six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126499"></span>



<p>The other paper, “Serological Predictors for the Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation After Electrical Cardioversion,” was pulled after a reader tipped the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> off that the authors had published a largely identical paper in a European counterpart.</p>



<p>“We received information from the reader that this article has been published in duplicate . . . in <em>EP Europace</em>. With regard to this, the corresponding author fully accepted responsibility of duplicate publication and requested” a retraction, the journal wrote in a January 11 <a href="https://e-kcj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=752659&amp;code=0054KCJ&amp;vmode=FULL">notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article was published in 2010. Commenters on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/84DB8965E87DECBF05682EB8A5A5F0">flagged</a> the duplicate publication last year, noting that the two papers overlapped “significantly” in most sections. For example, the wording of the introduction in the articles is largely identical, and the conclusions have only minor changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In emails seen by Retraction Watch, a graduate of Yonsei University College of Medicine and former trainee under Pak alerted <em>EP</em> <em>Europace </em>to the redundant publication in August 2022 and the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> in November 2022. The person, whose name we are withholding because they fear retaliation, received replies from both publications saying they were investigating the issue.</p>



<p><a href="https://yigh.yuhs.ac/yigh/about/faculties.do?mode=view&amp;articleNo=122">Hui-Nam Pak</a>, the corresponding author on all of the papers, did not respond to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/10/youve-been-duped-results-so-nice-the-journals-published-them-twice/">not the first time</a> his work has been retracted. In 2016, the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> pulled a paper he coauthored, “Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Lead Extraction by Conventional Traction and Counter-Traction Technique”, which it had published twice “<a href="https://e-kcj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=520277&amp;code=0054KCJ&amp;vmode=FULL">due to the editorial error occurred in our journal</a>.”</p>

                <p>Ice cubes float in water because they’re less dense than the liquid. But a newfound type of ice has a density <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq2105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly equal to what’s in your water glass</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 3 <em>Science</em>. If you could plop this ice in your cup without it melting immediately, it would bob around, neither floating nor sinking.</p>



<p>The new ice is a special type called an amorphous ice. That means the water molecules within it aren’t arranged in a neat pattern, as in normal, crystalline ice. Other types of amorphous ice are already known, but they have densities either lower or higher than water’s density under standard conditions. Some scientists hope this newly made amorphous ice could help solve the scientific mysteries that swirl around water.</p>





<p>To generate the new ice, scientists used a surprisingly simple technique. Called ball milling, it involves shaking a container of ice and stainless steel balls, cooled to 77 kelvins (nearly –200° Celsius). The researchers were motivated by curiosity; they didn’t expect the technique to produce a new amorphous ice. “It was a sort of Friday-afternoon idea we had, to just give it a go and see what happens,” says physical chemist Christoph Salzmann of University College London.</p>



<p>An analysis of how X-rays scattered from the frosty stuff suggested they’d created an amorphous ice. And computer simulations that mimicked the effects of ball milling revealed that a disordered structure could be produced by layers of ice sliding past one another in random directions, in response to the forces exerted by the balls.</p>



<p>“You have to be open, as a scientist, for the unexpected,” says chemical physicist Anders Nilsson of Stockholm University, who was not involved with the research. The ball milling technique, he says, “was quite innovative to do.”</p>

<p>Since the material was made by mashing up normal ice, its relationship to liquid water is unknown. It’s unclear whether it can be produced directly, by cooling liquid water. Not all amorphous ices share this connection with their liquid state.</p>



<p>If the new ice does have this link to the liquid, the ice might help scientists better understand water’s quirks. Water is puzzling because it flouts the norms for liquids. For example, whereas most liquids become denser upon cooling, water gets denser as it gets closer to 4° C, but becomes less dense as it is cooled further.</p>



<p>Many scientists suspect water’s weirdness is connected to its behavior as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-motion-experiment-reveals-supercooled-water-dual-nature">supercooled liquid</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>9/28/20</em>). Pure water can remain a liquid at temperatures well below freezing. Under such conditions, liquid water is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooled-water-phase-critical-point-liquid-fluid">thought to exist in two different phases</a>, a high-density liquid and a low-density one, and that dual nature could explain water’s behavior under more typical conditions (<em>SN: 11/19/20</em>). But much remains uncertain about that idea.</p>





<p>Salzmann and colleagues suggest that the new ice could be a special form of water called a glass. Glasses can be made by cooling a liquid quickly enough that the molecules can’t rearrange into a crystal structure. &nbsp;The glass in a windowpane is an example of this kind of material, made by cooling molten silica sand, but other substances can form glasses, too.</p>



<p>If the new ice is a glass state of water, scientists would need to work out how it fits into that dual-liquid picture. And that could help scientists tease out what’s really going on at difficult-to-study supercooled conditions.</p>



<p>But some researchers are skeptical that the new material has any connection to the weird physics of liquid water. Physical chemist Thomas Loerting of the University of Innsbruck in Austria thinks that the ice is “closely related to very small, distorted ice crystals,” rather than the liquid form of water.</p>



<p>Still, earlier computer simulations have suggested that water could form glasses of a range of densities close to liquid water, says computational physicist Nicolas Giovambattista of Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. Those simulations produced structures similar to the ones seen in the computer simulation of ball milling ice, says Giovambattista, who was not involved with the new research. “It opens doors for new questions. It’s new, so what is it?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-silent-tanzania-species">A newfound ‘croakless’ frog may communicate via touch</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newfound species of frog doesn’t ribbit. In fact, it doesn’t make any sound at all.</p>



<p>Many frogs have unusual characteristics, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">turning translucent</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">being clumsy jumpers</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/22; 6/15/22).</em> The recently discovered amphibian lacks a voice. It joins a group of seven other voiceless frog species called spiny-throated reed frogs that reside in East Africa.</p>



<p>Instead of croaking, the spines on male frogs’ throats might help their female counterparts recognize potential mates via touch, sort of like braille, says conservation biologist Lucinda Lawson of the University of Cincinnati.</p>





<p>Lawson and colleagues spotted the little frog, only about 25 millimeters long, in 2019 while surveying wildlife in Tanzania’s Ukaguru Mountains. The team immediately recognized the animal, now named <em>Hyperolius ukaguruensis</em>, as a spiny-throated reed frog. But something seemed off.</p>



<p>“It [was] the wrong color,” Lawson says. Most frogs from this group are green and silver, but this one was gold and brown. Some quick measurements to check if the peculiar frog simply had trivial color variations or if it could be a new species revealed that its eyes were smaller than other spiny-throated reed frogs. The researchers agreed: “Let’s do some genetics,” Lawson says.</p>



<p>They ran DNA tests on two frogs that looked like they belonged to the suspected new species, as well as 10 individuals belonging to known spiny-throated species. Comparing the golden frogs’ genetic makeup with that of the others revealed the oddballs were <a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=wMEW2uyIJF38s2DLY1mMSCCTrM9wHhasKabkKW3l49rU1plnRW-2F-2F8md7ltt9UEj2FV91pSKy5d0nghjQQ7S5S30odYDpEnmW1A2172yx14B98935kjYlkmh2UFLcSc2zmeHP_OqkkNpDGCRVgdo4R0zTCNLBNehFvqOZehI8j-2Br6jnTBlPmiQg3azExkOD-2F5vYYp2iDTdjTAp79WgneMGsqzg-2BGdwyUs9rk9V07-2B8wxGpphOqRijsl1I5fAlYbDMTXsZesz8jmlIV-2BB-2FGZUyNKgRedbmfGVXvvBdkeqdta31W0CxoijH-2Bf8RoXEBe7lkp4EGIw89d6VYJy7SyOSjkORa6tkKjkQoFc-2FwJbMCjnE3ILe7N-2FmV1uM58qKmD92lLx2YK6ECeC3crPcz5IbjPK9DQvxAhLNIRXMA4ySyh7g0EbuNHx9V8p-2B-2BLgBq1hlJl8pTfbATrI6iuuMRu1Cch5EAkTaEXI5nRDTDslxaZAJNQJA-2FeUlwf5-2FGbY7VUFhvgCZNHgMlSH0j3HkKh3oVIckVTQQ-3D-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically distinct</a>, Lawson and colleagues report February 2 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>

<p>Each frog species in this voiceless group — including <em>H. ukaguruensis</em> — lives in its own isolated domain of forest. All seven of the previously known species are endangered or vulnerable. This seclusion makes it vital to distinguish species and get them added to the conservation priority list, Lawson says. Then, governments and organizations can begin protecting the region that the new, potentially endangered animal calls home.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-play-fighting-aggression-tell">Are your cats having fun or fighting? Here are some ways to tell</a></h4>

              
                <p>Are your cats play fighting or fighting fur real?</p>



<p>It turns out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26121-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain behaviors in domestic cats could be telltale signs</a> that an interaction is friendly, aggressive or something in between, researchers report January 26 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“It is a question we hear a lot from cat owners,” says cat behavior expert Mikel Delgado of Feline Minds, a cat behavior consulting company in Sacramento, Calif., who was not involved in the study. “So I was excited to see that researchers are taking on this topic.”</p>





<p>Scientists have studied cats’ social relationships — both with other cats and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-attachment-styles-people">humans</a> — but it can be tricky to tell whether two cats are playing or fighting, says veterinarian and cat behavior researcher Noema Gajdoš-Kmecová of the University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Košice, Slovakia (<em>SN: 9/23/19</em>). </p>



<p>Sometimes cat owners miss the signs of a tense relationship because they think their pets are just playing, which can lead to stress and illness in the animals, she says. Other times, owners rehome their cats after incorrectly assuming their pets are fighting.</p>



<p>To assess and categorize interactions, Gajdoš-Kmecová and colleagues watched about 100 videos of different cats interacting in pairs. After viewing around one-third of the videos, Gajdoš-Kmecová identified six types of behaviors, including wrestling and staying still. She then watched all of the videos and noted how often each cat exhibited one of the specified behaviors, and for how long. By running statistical analyses on the behaviors, she pinpointed three types of interactions between the cat pairs: playful, aggressive and intermediate.</p>



<p>To confirm the outcome, other members of the team also watched the videos and classified each interaction between felines.</p>



<p>Some clear connections emerged. Quietly wrestling, for instance, suggested playtime, whereas chasing and vocalizations, like growling, hissing or gurgling, implied aggressive encounters.</p>



<p>Intermediate interactions had elements of both playful and aggressive encounters, but especially included prolonged activity of one cat toward the other, such as pouncing on or grooming its fellow feline. These in-between encounters could hint that one cat wants to keep playing while the other doesn’t, with the more playful cat gently nudging to see if its partner wants to continue, the authors say.</p>





<p>This work provides initial insights into cat interactions, Gajdoš-Kmecová says, but it’s just the start. In the future, she plans to study more subtle behaviors, like ear twitches and tail swishes. Both Gajdoš-Kmecová and Delgado also stress that one contentious encounter doesn’t necessarily signal a cat-astrophic relationship.</p>



<p>“This is not just about one interaction,” Gajdoš-Kmecová says. Owners “really should look into the different, multiple interactions in multiple periods of life of the cats and then put it into context.”</p>

<p>We may never identify the earliest retracted paper. For the time being, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/14/what-did-retractions-look-like-in-the-17th-century/">this 1756 article</a> about Benjamin Franklin is the earliest one in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">database</a>. And here might be a runner-up, of a sort, from a friend of Franklin’s the following year. </p>



<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/">David Hume</a> is widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of his or any age. His writings on causality, reason, and empiricism, as well as his history of England, were considered masterpieces when they appeared in the 18th century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1757, Hume published a collection of previously released works under the title “Four Dissertations,” which helped – if that’s the right word – cement his reputation as one of the age’s leading skeptics about religion. </p>



<span id="more-126494"></span>



<p>Hume wasn’t known for holding his tongue, particularly about Christianity; his abundance of candor cost him academic positions and, occasionally, friendships (both Samuel Johnson and James Boswell decried his lack of piety).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177014/the-infidel-and-the-professor">The Infidel and the Professor</a>, a delightful 2017 book by <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/dennis-c-rasmussen">Dennis Rasmussen</a> about the close friendship between Hume and another famous Scottsman, Adam Smith, Hume was not immune to second thoughts. Missing from “Four Dissertations” were two earlier essays in which he’d questioned “the immorality of suicide and the immortality of the soul.” </p>



<p>Evidently, Hume had decided to withdraw the two articles from the collection at the urging of his friends because he feared they would spark outrage from the devout – that is to say, pretty much everyone in positions of authority in that era. In their place he substituted an essay on the less tendentious but non-trivial question of how to measure taste, sure to animate salons but hardly likely to trigger calls for excommunication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Rasmussen, a faculty member at Syracuse University, writes:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We do not know what exactly persuaded Hume to retract the essays. In 1772 he recalled having “repented” immediately after sending them to his publisher, declaring that “from my abundant Prudence I suppress’d” these pieces.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rasmussen notes in the event, Hume’s reputation as a heretic didn’t suffer. How could it with lines like:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men’s dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatic asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Writes Rasmussen:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Once again, then, Hume’s response to a charge of impiety was to set about earning it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Of course, purists might quibble that Hume’s decision to drop the essays from his new collecting wasn’t technically a retraction – a distinction Rasmussen acknowledged to us in a recent email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Maybe something like “omit” would have been better. Because … Hume wasn’t disavowing these pieces or saying that they were wrong; he just decided that it would be more prudent to leave them out. That probably doesn’t amount to a retraction in Retraction Watch’s sense. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps not. But as the great thinker might have said, a thing with multiple potential causes can have the same net effect.</p>

                <p>Vikings brought horses and dogs to the British Isles from Scandinavia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis of bone fragments from a cemetery in England provides <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first solid scientific evidence of animals traveling with Vikings across the North Sea</a>, scientists report February 1 in <em>PLOS ONE.</em></p>



<p>In the 1990s, researchers unearthed the cremated remains of a human adult and child as well as of a dog, horse and probable pig from a burial mound in a Viking cemetery in Derbyshire, England. In previous work, radiocarbon dating of femur, skull and rib fragments revealed that the inhabitants all died sometime between the eighth and 10th centuries. That date was narrowed down to the year 873, thanks to the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which records that a Viking army wintered near the site that year.</p>

<p>Where the animals came from has been a mystery. Norse raiders are known to have stolen horses from people in England around the time. And researchers have generally thought that Viking boats at the time were too small to allow for much transport of animals from Scandinavia to the British Isles. One entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes Vikings moving from France to England along with their horses in the year 892, but no physical evidence of such activity had been found before.</p>



<p>In the new work, Tessi Löffelmann and colleagues turned to certain forms, or isotopes, of strontium to unravel the individuals’ provenance. The element accumulates in bones over time through diet, leaving a distinct signature of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-hyksos-dynasty-conquered-ancient-egypt-marriage">where an individual has lived</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/19</em>).</p>





<p>Strontium ratios in the child’s remains matched those of shrubs growing at the burial site, suggesting the child spent most, if not all, of its life in England. The ratios of the adult and three animals, on the other hand, differed substantially from the local fauna, the team found. That suggests the individuals hadn’t spent much time in the country before they died. Instead, their ratios were similar to ones found in the Baltic Shield region in Norway, central and northern Sweden and Finland, suggesting a Scandinavian origin.</p>



<p>“One of the joys of isotope analysis is that you are able to really pinpoint things that previously we could discuss endlessly,” says Marianne Moen, an archeologist at the University of Oslo who was not involved in the study. Using strontium to analyze more cremated remains, which can elude common forms of isotope analysis including carbon and nitrogen, “is the next logical chapter for understanding prehistoric mobility.”</p>



<p>Isotope analysis helped reveal where these individuals lived and when they died, but it couldn’t answer why the dog, horse and pig made the journey to England in the first place. That’s where historical records can help, says Löffelmann, of Durham University in England and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.</p>



<p>For Löffelmann, the small sizes of early Norse ships combined with the fact that the animals and people were buried together suggest Vikings may have initially brought animals with them for companionship, not just function.</p>





<p>“It could have only been selected animals that made that journey,” she says. “They were important to what the person was.… They went through life together, and now they’re going through death.”</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neurons spend most of their energy building ion gradients across the cell
membrane. During energy deprivation the neurons swell, and the concomitant
mixing of their ions is commonly assumed to lead towards a Donnan equilibrium,
at which the concentration gradients of all permeant ion species have the same
Nernst potential. This Donnan equilibrium, however, is not isotonic, as the
total concentration of solute will be greater inside than outside the neurons.
The present theoretical paper, in contrast, proposes that neurons follow a path
along which they swell quasi-isotonically by co-transporting water and ions.
The final neuronal volume on the path is taken that at which the concentration
of impermeant anions in the shrinking extracellular space equals that inside
the swelling neurons. At this final state, which is also a Donnan equilibrium,
all permeant ions can mix completely, and their Nernst potentials vanish. This
final state is isotonic and electroneutral, as are all intermediate states
along this path. The path is in principle reversible, and maximises the work of
mixing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/egyptian-mummy-chemical-mixtures">Chemical residue reveals ancient Egyptians’ mummy-making mixtures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have unwrapped long-sought details of embalming practices that ancient Egyptians used to preserve dead bodies.</p>



<p>Clues came from analyses of chemical residue inside vessels from the only known Egyptian embalming workshop and nearby burial chambers. Mummification specialists who worked there concocted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05663-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific mixtures to embalm the head, wash the body, treat the liver and stomach, and prepare bandages that swathed the body</a>, researchers report February 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“Ancient Egyptian embalmers had extensive chemical knowledge and knew what substances to put on the skin to preserve it, even without knowing about bacteria and other microorganisms,” Philipp Stockhammer, an archaeologist at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, said at a January 31 news conference.</p>





<p>The findings come courtesy of chemical residue inside 31 vessels found in an Egyptian embalming workshop and four vessels discovered in an adjacent pair of burial chambers. Writing on workshop vessels named embalming substances, provided embalming instructions (such as “to put on his head”) or both. All the artifacts — dating from Egypt’s 26th dynasty which rose to power between 664 B.C. and 525 B.C. — were excavated at a cemetery site called Saqqara in 2016. Archaeologist and study coauthor Ramadan Hussein, who died in 2022, led that project.</p>



<h4>Newfound mummy embalming mixtures</h4>



<p>Five of the vessels had the label <em>antiu</em>. The substance was thought to have been a fragrant resin called myrrh. The <em>antiu</em> at Saqqara, however, consisted of oil or tar from cedar and juniper or cypress trees mixed with animal fats. Writing on these jars indicates that <em>antiu</em> could have been used alone or combined with another substance called <em>sefet</em>.</p>



<p>Three vessels from the embalming workshop bore the label <em>sefet</em>, which researchers have usually described as an unidentified oil. At Saqqara, <em>sefet</em> was a scented, fat-based ointment with added ingredients from plants. Two <em>sefet</em> pots contained animal fats mixed with oil or tar from juniper or cypress trees. A third container held animal fats and elemi, a fragrant resin from tropical trees.</p>



<p>Clarification of the ingredients in <em>antiu</em> and <em>sefet</em> at Saqqara “takes mummification studies further than before,” says Egyptologist Bob Brier of Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y., who was not part of the research.</p>



<p>Egyptians may have started <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origins-egyptian-mummy-making-may-predate-pyramids">mummifying their dead as early as 6,330 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/14</em>). Mummification procedures and rituals focused on keeping the body fresh so the deceased could enter what was believed to be an eternal afterlife.</p>





<p>Embalming and mummification procedures likely changed over time, says team member Maxime Rageot, a biomolecular archaeologist also at Ludwig Maximilians University. Embalmers’ mixtures at Saqqara may not correspond, say, to those used around 700 years earlier for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/king-tut-tutankhamun-tomb-discovery-archaeology">King Tutankhamun</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/22</em>).</p>



<h4>Mummy embalming instructions</h4>



<p>Outside surfaces of other vessels from the Saqqara embalming workshop and burial chambers sported labels and, in some cases, instructions for treatment of the head, preparation of linen mummy bandages, washing the body and treating the liver and stomach. Inscriptions on one jar referred to an administrator who performed embalming procedures, mainly on the head.</p>



<p>Chemical residue inside these pots consisted of mixtures specific to each embalming procedure. Ingredients included oils or tars of cedar and juniper or cypress trees, pistachio resin, castor oil, animal fats, heated beeswax, bitumen (a dense, oily substance), elemi and a resin called dammar.</p>



<p>Most of those substances have been identified in earlier studies of chemical residues from Egyptian mummies and embalming vessels in individual tombs, says Egyptologist Margaret Serpico of University College London. But elemi and dammar resins have not previously been linked to ancient Egyptian embalming practices and are “highly unexpected,” notes Serpico, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Elemi was an ingredient in the workshop mixtures used to treat the head, the liver and bandages wrapped around the body. Chemical signs of dammar appeared in a vessel from one of the burial chambers that included remnants of a range of substances, indicating that the container had been used to blend several different mixtures, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Specific properties of elemi and dammar that aided in preserving dead bodies have yet to be investigated, Stockhammer said.</p>



<h4>A far-flung trade network for mummy embalming ingredients</h4>



<p>Elemi resin reached Egypt from tropical parts of Africa or Southeast Asia, while dammar originated in Southeast Asia or Indonesia, Rageot says. Other embalming substances detected at Saqqara came from Southwest Asia and parts of southern Europe and northern Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea. These findings provide the first evidence that ancient Egyptian embalmers depended on substances transported across vast trade networks.</p>



<p>Egyptian embalmers at Saqqara took advantage of a trade network that already connected Egypt to sites in Southeast Asia, Stockhammer said. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supply-chains-3000-years-bronze-age-shipwreck">Other Mediterranean and Asian societies also engaged in long-distance trade</a> during ancient Egypt’s heyday (<em>SN: 1/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that ancient Egyptians imported embalming ingredients from distant lands, Brier says. “They were great traders, had limited [local] wood products and really wanted these substances to achieve immortality.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insects-fall-outside-protected-areas">76 percent of well-known insects fall outside protected areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>The existing boundaries of national parks and other habitat preserves aren’t enough to protect <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.12.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than three-quarters of the world’s well-studied insects</a>.</p>



<p>The finding, reported February 1 in <em>One Earth</em>, shows that people who design nature preserves “don’t really think about insects that much,” says coauthor Shawan Chowdhury, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig.</p>



<p>That’s a problem because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-crisis-book-threats-population-decline-problem">insect populations around the globe are plummeting</a>, a growing body of research suggests, probably due to climate change and human development (<em>SN: 4/26/22</em>). For instance, insect abundance in Puerto Rico has dropped by up to 98 percent over the last 35 years.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Threats to insect survival could have ripple effects on plants and other animals. Insects help form the foundation for many ecosystems: They pollinate around 80 percent of all plant species and serve as a staple in the diets of hundreds of thousands of animals (and the occasional carnivorous plant).</p>



<p>One way to avert insect extinctions is to set aside the land they need to survive. But scientists know the ranges for only about 100,000 of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. To determine how well existing protected areas may be aiding insect conservation, Chowdhury and colleagues mapped the known habitats of about 89,000 of those species and compared the ranges with the boundaries of preserves from the <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Database on Protected Areas</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, these spaces don’t safeguard enough habitat for 67,384 insect species — about 76 percent of the species included in the study — the team found. Roughly 2 percent of species do not overlap with protected areas at all.</p>



<p>Conserving insects, Chowdhury says, will mean setting aside more insect-friendly spaces in the years ahead.</p>

<p>A group of cancer researchers once all based at Harvard have earned a retraction after acknowledging data duplication “errors” in an article published more than eight years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1417015112">Synthetic lethality of combined glutaminase and Hsp90 inhibition in mTORC1-driven tumor cells</a>,” was published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) </em>in December 2014. It has been cited 52 times, according to <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000347447100007">Clarivate’s Web of Science</a>. The study informed a clinical trial from <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/clinical_trial/NCT01362400">Infinity Pharmaceuticals</a> on a drug for people with lung cancer, according to Dimensions, a scientific research database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2020, the paper drew scrutiny from commenters on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83120D8F11244924EFD9B7219AC31F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer</a>. The posts include claims of duplications in several of the paper’s figures; none of the authors has responded to the 10 comments on the site.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126484"></span>



<p>Pseudonymous critic Claire Francis drew attention to these concerns in a November 2020 email to editors at <em>PNAS,</em> as well as academic and legal representatives from Harvard, Cornell, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. That email received no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 6 this year, <em>PNAS </em>published the following <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220405120">retraction notice</a> for the paper:&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/">arXiv announces new policy on ChatGPT and similar tools</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent release of AI technology that generates new text has raised serious questions among the research community. For one, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can ChatGPT be named an author of a research paper?&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resounding answer from arXiv leaders and advisors is, “No.” A computer program cannot, for example, take responsibility for the contents of a paper. Nor can it agree to arXiv’s terms and conditions. </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00107-z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other organizations agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this issue, arXiv has adopted a <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html#policy-for-authors-use-of-generative-ai-language-tools">new policy</a> for authors regarding the use of generative AI language tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official policy is:</span></p>
<h3><b>arXiv policy for authors’ use of generative AI language tools </b></h3>
<p><b>January, 31 2023</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv recognizes that authors of scientific works use a variety of tools to do the science on which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated ones. Community opinion on the appropriateness of such tools may be varied and evolving; AI powered language tools have in particular led to significant debate. We note that tools may generate useful and helpful results, but also errors or misleading results; therefore, knowing which tools were used is relevant to evaluating and interpreting scientific works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In view of this, we </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to require authors to report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools, such as instruments and software; we now include in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should be reported consistent with subject standards for methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a paper, they each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the contents were generated. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, it is the responsibility of the author(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generative AI language tools should not be listed as an author; instead authors should refer to (1).</span></li>
</ol>

                <p><em>Note: this post  was originally published on the <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/01/EarthArXiv-live">PLOS Latitude Blog</a></em></p>



<p></p>



<p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2022/12/plos-and-eartharxiv/">planned integration</a> between PLOS and the <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a> preprint server is now live!</p>



<p>Beginning today, authors submitting to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Water</em></a> will have the option to automatically forward their manuscript to EarthArXiv, right from our submission system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation is easy. During submission, authors will indicate whether their manuscript has been posted as a preprint already. If it has, we&rsquo;ll ask for the DOI. If it has not, authors can check a box to opt-in to this new service. Once received by EarthArXiv, each manuscript will be <a href="https://eartharxiv.github.io/moderation.html">screened for suitability</a>, including checks for scope, appropriateness, and potential dual use research of concern. Most preprints will appear on the server within a week.</p>



<p>In fields related to our environment, the timely and thorough exchange of knowledge is vital. Preprints empower researchers to take control of their scientific communications and share research when it&rsquo;s ready. PLOS authors use preprints to establish priority, share results more efficiently, seek community feedback, and build their careers.</p>



<p>Preprints also support more inclusive scientific communications, opening opportunities for collaboration and feedback, and allowing everyone to participate on their own terms. Including more of the research community deepens and expands both the scientific record and the network of expert peer reviewers, forging new connections and supporting high-quality research. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">Learn more about the benefits of preprints on our website</a>.</p>

<p>2022 marked the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/king-tut-tutankhamun-tomb-discovery-archaeology">100th anniversary of the discovery of King Tut’s tomb</a> (<em>SN: 11/19/22, p. 14</em>). Now, thousands of artifacts from the tomb — along with tens of thousands of other archaeological finds from ancient Egypt — will go on display when this museum, located within view of the Pyramids of Giza, opens. More than a decade in the making, it will be one of the largest archaeological museums in the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-vexas-syndrome-common-doctors">The deadly VEXAS syndrome is more common than doctors thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious new disease may be to blame for severe, unexplained inflammation in older men. Now, researchers have their first good look at who the disease strikes, and how often.</p>



<p>VEXAS syndrome, an illness discovered just two years ago, affects nearly <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2800661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 4,000 men over 50 years old</a>, scientists estimate January 24 in <em>JAMA</em>. The disease also occurs in older women, though less frequently. Altogether, more than 15,000 people in the United States may be suffering from the syndrome, says study coauthor David Beck, a clinical geneticist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. Those numbers indicate that physicians should be on the lookout for VEXAS, Beck says. “It’s underrecognized and underdiagnosed. A lot of physicians aren’t yet aware of it.”</p>





<p>Beck’s team reported discovering VEXAS syndrome in 2020, linking <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutations in a gene called <em>UBA1</em></a> to a suite of symptoms including fever, low blood cell count and inflammation. His team’s new study is the first to estimate how often VEXAS occurs in the general population — and the results are surprising. “It’s more prevalent than we suspected,” says Emma Groarke, a hematologist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., who was not involved with the study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>What are the symptoms of VEXAS syndrome?</h3>



<p>People with the disease may experience an assortment of symptoms across the body, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Painful skin rashes</li>



<li>Swelling and pain of the ears, nose and joints</li>



<li>Cough and shortness of breath</li>



<li>Blood vessel inflammation</li>



<li>Fever</li>



<li>Extreme fatigue</li>



<li>Anemia</li>



<li>Low blood cell count</li>



<li>Blood clots</li>
</ul>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</div>
</div>





<p>VEXAS tends to show up later in life ­­— after people somehow acquire <em>UBA1</em> mutations in their blood cells. Patients may feel overwhelming fatigue, lethargy and have skin rashes, Beck says. “The disease is progressive, and it’s severe.” VEXAS can also be deadly. Once a person’s symptoms begin, the <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/140/13/1496/485796/Translation-of-cytoplasmic-UBA1-contributes-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">median survival time is about 10 years</a>, his team has found.</p>



<p>Until late 2020, no one knew that there was a genetic thread connecting VEXAS syndrome’s otherwise unexplained symptoms. In fact, individuals may be diagnosed with other conditions, including polyarteritis nodosa, an inflammatory blood disease, and relapsing polychondritis, a connective tissue disorder, before being diagnosed with VEXAS.</p>



<p>To ballpark the number of VEXAS-affected individuals, Beck’s team combed through electronic health records of more than 160,000 people in Pennsylvania, in a collaboration with the NIH and Geisinger Health. In people over 50, the disease-causing <em>UBA1</em> mutations showed up in roughly 1 in 4,000 men. Among women in that age bracket, about 1 in 26,000 had the mutations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A genetic test of the blood can help doctors diagnose VEXAS, and treatments like steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs, which tamp down inflammation, can ease symptoms. Groarke and her NIH colleagues have also started a small phase II clinical trial testing bone marrow transplants as a way to swap patients’ diseased blood cells for healthy ones.</p>



<p>Beck says he hopes to raise awareness about the disease, though he recognizes that there’s much more work to do. In his team’s study, for instance, the vast majority of participants were white Pennsylvanians, so scientists don’t know how the disease affects other populations. Researchers also don’t know what spurs the blood cell mutations, nor how they spark an inflammatory frenzy in the body.</p>



<p>“The more patients that are diagnosed, the more we’ll learn about the disease,” Beck says. “This is just one step in the process of finding more effective therapies.”</p>

<p>The journal that published a hotly contested article by a professor at Harvard Law School arguing that Korean women forced into sexual slavery during World War II were willing prostitutes has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0144818823000030">reaffirmed</a> a prior expression of concern over the paper, but stopped short of retracting the article.</p>



<p>However, the <em>International Review of Law and Economics</em> encourages readers of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301848">article</a>, by <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/j-mark-ramseyer/">Mark Ramseyer</a>, to &#8220;also consult the comments published in IRLE and in other venues for the broader historical perspective.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexis Dudden, a professor of history at the University of Connecticut who has written extensively about Japan&#8217;s wartime system of military sexual slavery, called the statement &#8220;wishy-washy.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;For the denialists, this is a victory,&#8221; she told Retraction Watch. &#8220;The IRLE decision is rotten at the core.”</p>



<span id="more-126477"></span>



<p>Japan’s record of sex trafficking of hundreds of thousands of women and girls as young as 8 — the so-called “comfort women” — has been thoroughly documented and is a matter of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/03/524192">consensus</a> among most historians outside that country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his article, Ramseyer argued that the &#8220;political dispute between South Korea and Japan over the wartime brothels called &#8216;comfort stations&#8217; obscures the contractual dynamics involved.&#8221; Instead, Ramseyer used game theory in an effort to show that the women negotiated voluntary contracts for sex work. The article, published online in December 2020 and titled “Contracting for sex in the Pacific War,” has been cited eight times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Ramseyer also stated in an <a href="https://japan-forward.com/recovering-the-truth-about-the-comfort-women/">op-ed</a> in <em>JAPAN Forward</em> that the narrative of comfort women as sex slaves was &#8220;pure fiction.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two articles quickly sparked <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/seeking-the-true-story-of-the-comfort-women-j-mark-ramseyer">international</a> <a href="https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/03/10/a-harvard-professor-argued-that-korean-women-forced-into-sex-slavery-in-wwii-did-so-voluntarily-now-hes-facing-a-backlash/">furor</a>. In February 2021, the <em>IRLE </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000090">issued</a> an expression of concern, noting that &#8220;concerns have been raised regarding the historical evidence in the article &#8230; These claims are currently being investigated and the International Review of Law and Economics will provide additional information as it becomes available.&#8221;</p>



<p>In its new statement from January 18, the journal said it solicited comments from several historians; asked Ramseyer for his response to the criticism; and requested confidential reviews from several additional historians with subject-matter expertise.</p>



<p>All of the experts had misgivings about Ramseyer’s interpretation of the evidence and agreed it did “not warrant overturning the historical consensus,&#8221; the journal says. Still, it found &#8220;nothing that rises to the level of clear data fabrication or falsification and the COPE description of honest error appears orthogonal to the current situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>The journal leaves open the question of whether &#8220;Ramseyer’s interpretation and judgment regarding the way he used sources constitutes qualitative error akin to a miscalculation or an experimental flaw&#8221;:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the end the editors are divided on whether the paper should be retracted based on [COPE and Elsevier] guidelines. We are agreed, however, that the guidelines are clearly intended to present a high threshold for retraction and, as such, we have decided to retain the Expression of Concern attached to Professor Ramseyer’s article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While Ramseyer&#8217;s article may not contain fabricated data, Dudden said his contortion of the historical record could still be construed as a version of that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Maybe thinking of it in terms of how the Russian state is currently refusing even to call the Ukraine invasion a war, when we talk about data fabrication, that&#8217;s becoming truth for many Russians. And so that&#8217;s what data fabrication is here, playing with words.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s human trafficking of minors for sex. And that&#8217;s what it is, and it&#8217;s state-sponsored. And Ramseyer denies all of that,&#8221; added Dudden, who edited a <a href="https://apjjf.org/2021/5/ToC2.html">supplementary issue</a> about the <em>IRLE </em>article in <em>The Asia-Pacific Journal</em>, for which she is a contributing editor. &#8220;That&#8217;s what right-wing radio does. But it&#8217;s not what academics do.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Ramseyer pointed to an article in which he <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4000145">discussed</a> the main accusations against him, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Certainly, I stand by my article, my discussion of the accusations, and more longer [sic] more recent article about the controversy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Amy Beth Stanley, a professor of history at Northwestern University, was among the people who contacted the <em>IRLE </em>to request a retraction of the paper. Along with other scholars, she laid out her reasoning in <a href="https://apjjf.org/2021/5/ConcernedScholars.html">an article</a> in <em>The Asia-Pacific Journal</em>, arguing that a paper “containing this level of academic misconduct should not have passed peer review, or have been published in an academic journal.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stanley told Retraction Watch the <em>IRLE</em>&#8216;s<em> </em>decision was a “reasonable outcome,” especially because COPE’s threshold for retraction is &#8220;extremely high” and relies “on language about ‘data falsification’ that seems more suited to scientific research.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, she added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In my opinion, citing evidence that doesn&#8217;t exist to say things that the evidence does not say does constitute &#8220;data falsification.&#8221; But I think this issue highlights the problem with our standards as they are written, especially for the humanities and social sciences, as I believe it is absolutely crucial to be able to distinguish scholarship that is fraudulent or dishonest from scholarship that is merely offensive, controversial, and unpopular.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-scan-mystery-ancient-chinese-wall">Muon scanning hints at mysteries within an ancient Chinese wall</a></h4>

              
                <p>For nearly 650 years, the fortress walls in the Chinese city of Xi’an have served as a formidable barrier around the central city. At 12 meters high and up to 18 meters thick, they are impervious to almost everything — except subatomic particles called muons.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to their penetrating abilities, muons may be key to ensuring that the walls that once protected the treasures of the first Ming Dynasty — and are now a national architectural treasure in their own right — stand for centuries more.</p>



<p>A refined detection method has provided the <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0123337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-resolution muon scans yet</a> produced of any archaeological structure, researchers report in the Jan. 7 <em>Journal of Applied Physics</em>. The scans revealed interior density fluctuations as small as a meter across inside one section of the Xi’an ramparts. The fluctuations could be signs of dangerous flaws or “hidden structures archaeologically interesting for discovery and investigation,” says nuclear physicist Zhiyi Liu of Lanzhou University in China.</p>

Liu <em>et al</em>/<em>Journal of Applied Physics </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Muons are like electrons, only heavier. They rain down all over the planet, produced when charged particles called cosmic rays hit the atmosphere. Although muons can travel deep into earth and stone, they are scattered or absorbed depending on the material they encounter. Counting the ones that pass through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">makes them useful</a> for studying volcano interiors, scanning pyramids for hidden chambers and even searching for contraband stashed in containers impervious to X-rays (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>Though muons stream down continuously, their numbers are small enough that the researchers had to deploy six detectors for a week at a time to collect enough data for 3-D scans of the rampart. </p>



<p>It’s now up to conservationists to determine how to address any density fluctuations that might indicate dangerous flaws, or historical surprises, inside the Xi’an walls.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-metric-extinction-risk-species">A new metric of extinction risk considers how cultures care for species</a></h4>

              
                <p>In shallow coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans, a seagrass-scrounging cousin of the manatee is in trouble. Environmental strains like pollution and habitat loss pose a major threat to dugong (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) survival, so much so that in December, the International Union for Conservation of Nature <a href="https://www.iucn.org/press-release/202212/human-activity-devastating-marine-species-mammals-corals-iucn-red-list#:~:text=Dugong%20populations%20in%20East%20Africa,under%20900%20in%20New%20Caledonia." target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded the species’ extinction risk</a> status to vulnerable. Some populations are now classified as endangered or critically endangered.</p>



<p>If that weren’t bad enough, the sea cows are at risk of losing the protection of a group who has long looked after them: the Torres Strait Islanders. These Indigenous people off the coast of Australia historically have been stewards of the dugong populations there, sustainably hunting the animals and monitoring their numbers. But the Torres Strait Islanders are also threatened, in part because sea levels are rising and encroaching on their communities, and warmer air and sea temperatures are making it difficult for people to live in the region.</p>





<p>This situation isn’t unique to dugongs. A global analysis of 385 culturally important plant and animal species found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217303120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent were both biologically </a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217303120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable </a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217303120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and </a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217303120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at risk of losing their cultural protections</a>, researchers report January 3 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>The findings clearly illustrate that biology shouldn’t be the primary factor in shaping conservation policy, says cultural anthropologist Victoria Reyes-García. When a culture dwindles, the species that are important to that culture are also under threat. To be effective, more conservation efforts need to consider the vulnerability of both the species and the people that have historically cared for them, she says.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>A lot of the people in the conservation arena think we need to separate people from nature,” says Reyes-García, of the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies and the Autonomous University of Barcelona. But that tactic overlooks the caring relationship many cultural groups – like the Torres Strait Islanders – have with nature, she says.</p>



<p>“Indigenous people, local communities, also other ethnic groups – they are good stewards of their biodiversity,” says Ina Vandebroek, an ethnobotanist at the University of the West Indies at Mona in Kingston, Jamaica, who was not involved in the work. “They have knowledge, deep knowledge, about their environments that we really cannot overlook.”</p>



<p>One way to help shift conservation efforts is to give species a “biocultural status,” which would provide a fuller picture of their vulnerability, Reyes-García and colleagues say. In the study, the team used existing language vitality research to determine a culture’s risk of disappearing: The more a cultural group’s language use declines, the more that culture is threatened. And the more a culture is threatened, the more culturally vulnerable its important species are. Researchers then combined a species’ cultural and biological vulnerability to arrive at its biocultural status. In the dugong’s case, its biocultural status is endangered, meaning it is more at risk than its IUCN categorization suggests.</p>



<p>This intersectional approach to conservation can help species by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-conservation-west-harm-fresh-banana-leaves-book">involving the people that have historically cared for them</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/22</em>). It can also highlight when communities need support to continue their stewardship, Reyes-García says. She hopes this new framework will spark more conservation efforts that recognize local communities’ rights and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-goats-vanishing-indigenous-land-culture-canada">encourage their participation</a> – leaning into humans’ connection with nature instead of creating more separation (<em>SN: 3/8/22</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two papers coauthored by a computer scientist whose work on visual effects has been credited in big-name Hollywood movies will soon be retracted after a publisher’s investigation found falsification of data in the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has also learned that the University of Southern California (USC) found that <a href="http://www.hao-li.com/Hao_Li/Hao_Li_-_about_me.html">Hao Li</a> “falsely presented his research” in the two publications while he was a professor there. The articles, both published in journals of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), describe a system to create a 3D digital avatar head from a person’s photo using artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li co-founded and is CEO of Pinscreen, a startup which is commercializing that technology. On <a href="http://pinscreen.com/">its website</a>, Pinscreen touts its products as “the most advanced AI-driven versatile avatars.” Besides personalized avatars for use in virtual or augmented reality systems, Pinscreen offers the ability to <a href="http://pinscreen.com/facereplacement/">replace a person’s face</a> in videos, creating what’s known as “deepfakes.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126466"></span>



<p><em>MIT Technology Review</em> named Li an “innovator under 35” <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/08/21/176710/meet-hao-li-2013-innovator-under-35/">in 2013</a>, and in a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/16/133686/the-worlds-top-deepfake-artist-is-wrestling-with-the-monster-he-created/">2019 profile</a> the magazine called him “a pioneer of digital fakery.” The article also described Li’s work to create an onscreen image of the actor Paul Walker for the movie <em>Furious 7</em>, after Walker died halfway through filming. Li’s other <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5260155/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">visual effects credits</a> include <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> and <em>The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies.</em></p>



<p>Both of the articles to be retracted date from 2017. “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3130800.31310887">Avatar digitization from a single image for real-time rendering</a>” was published in <em>ACM Transactions on Graphics</em>, and “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3098333.3107546">Pinscreen: creating performance-driven avatars in seconds</a>” accompanied a presentation at the ACM computer graphics conference SIGGRAPH 2017 Real Time Live!</p>



<p>In the presentation, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpuEdXn_M0Q">uploaded to YouTube</a> (beginning at 31:15), Li and several Pinscreen employees take the stage to explain and demonstrate the company’s technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What we’re going to show you later is how to build a high-quality 3D avatar from a single image, fully rigged, animatable, and we’re going to show you how to bring them to life using a single webcam,” Li said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To demonstrate, Iman Sadeghi, then Pinscreen’s vice president of engineering, took a picture of himself with a webcam, and a few seconds later, a 3D image of his head appeared on the computer screen, animated and changing its facial expressions. Sadeghi then proceeded to click on photos of other people, and their avatar heads appeared on the screen, apparently generated in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But according to a lawsuit Sadeghi filed later, and USC’s investigation, Pinscreen’s technology at the time of the presentation could not perform as it appeared to do. At the request of the university’s investigation committee, a consultant reviewed the computer code Sadeghi used to present and found that all of the avatars in the demonstration had been built beforehand. The model of Sadeghi’s head would appear no matter what picture the webcam took as an input, according to the consultant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadeghi sued Pinscreen in 2018 (as reported at the time by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-pinscreen-lawsuit-20180620-story.html"><em>LA Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2018/10/30/viterbi-professor-embattled-in-lawsuit-with-his-former-employee/">USC Annenberg Media</a>), alleging Li had fired him for raising concerns about the company misrepresenting its technology in the SIGGRAPH Real Time Live! presentation and other venues. The suit is ongoing in Los Angeles Superior Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After filing his suit, Sadeghi reported the falsification to ACM and USC, where Li was a professor in the Viterbi School of Engineering and director of the Institute for Creative Technologies Vision and Graphics Lab. USC began looking into the allegations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a version of <a href="http://sadeghi.com/USC-Investigation-Report-re-Hao-Li-and-Pinscreen-Scientific-Misconduct-at-SIGGRAPH-RTL-2017/">USC’s investigation report</a> posted on Sadeghi’s website, the investigation committee <a href="http://sadeghi.com/USC-Investigation-Report-re-Hao-Li-and-Pinscreen-Scientific-Misconduct-at-SIGGRAPH-RTL-2017/#page14">concluded</a> that Li:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Knowingly and intentionally presented a falsified demonstration of his software at the SIGGRAPH Real-Time-Live show on August 1, 2017 with the intention to mislead the audience into believing that they were viewing a real-time demonstration of the automatic avatar-generating software that he and his team claimed to have developed, when in fact, Dr. Li and his team presented pre-programmed, manually produced avatar generation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the engineering school has not responded to our request for comment on the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li’s research was funded by two federal grants. One, on which Li was the principal investigator, was from the Office of Naval Research. The title of the project in the <a href="http://sadeghi.com/USC-Investigation-Report-re-Hao-Li-and-Pinscreen-Scientific-Misconduct-at-SIGGRAPH-RTL-2017/#att4">attached grant</a> matches the title of the Young Investigator Award that Li won to develop realistic avatars for virtual training systems for the Navy. USC’s <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2018/03/hao-li-earns-office-naval-research-young-investigator-award/">announcement of the award</a> in 2018 stated that it was worth $600,000 over three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li left USC in 2020, and, <a href="http://www.hao-li.com/Hao_Li/Hao_Li_-_about_me.html">according to his website</a>, spent the next two years as a distinguished fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He is now an associate professor at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="http://sadeghi.com/USC-Investigation-Report-re-Hao-Li-and-Pinscreen-Scientific-Misconduct-at-SIGGRAPH-RTL-2017/#att3">responses</a> to USC’s inquiry report, Li denied that he misrepresented Pinscreen’s technology and said that preloading the avatars for the presentation was allowed in case of connectivity issues. His response also references letters from SIGGRAPH organizers that he said support his claims. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Let me be very clear: there was absolutely NO fabrication and/or falsification from either our teams at USC or Pinscreen at any point in time. Nor did I or anyone associated with me mislead the public or the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">ACM’s investigation concluded last year, and did not vindicate Li’s defense that the conference organizers had allowed the preloaded avatars as presented.&nbsp;According to a decision letter dated Sept. 14, 2022 and <a href="http://sadeghi.com/ACM-Investigation-re-Hao-Li-and-Pinscreen-Scientific-Misconduct-at-SIGGRAPH-and-SIGGRAPH-Asia-2017.pdf">posted online</a> to Sadeghi’s website, the ACM Ethics and Plagiarism Committee of the ACM Publications Board investigated complaints about the work and found the authors “guilty” of violating the organization’s <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview">policy</a> on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Specifically, the Committee found that the presentation at SIGGRAPH 2017 Real Time Live! falsely presented pre-generated images as dynamically created. This fact should have been disclosed to the audience, but was not. This data falsification extended to the ACM Transaction on Graphics article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee decided that the violation was “<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations">severe</a>,” and imposed penalties including retraction of the articles and a five-year ban on submitting work to or serving in any official role for ACM publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scott Delman, ACM’s director of publications who signed the letter, told us the letter was “confidential” and “not intended to be made public.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadeghi also <a href="http://sadeghi.com/ACM-Policies-Protecting-Whistleblowers-and-Victims-of-Coercion-Abuse-Or-Lack-Thereof/">posted a letter</a> he sent to ACM in response, asking for the organization to reconsider the penalties for himself.&nbsp;In his letter, dated October 14, Sadeghi wrote that he had reported the violations to the group, and to USC, and that he had “actively participated and provided information during both investigations and preserved key evidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the CEO of Pinscreen and my direct superior in the company, Li exploited his power differential to force me into participating in his fraud. Li depended on that differential as well as my obligations under the Confidentiality Contract to keep his coercive, abusive, and fraudulent practices from being reported.</p>



<p>My involvement in Pinscreens fraudulent publications and presentations is an untoward consequence of Li’s coercive and abusive practices. The repeated whistleblowing and objections I presented to Li resulted in the retaliatory termination of my employment immediately after Pinscreen’s public deception at ACM SIGGRAPH Real-Time Live 2017. According to the policy, ACM should investigate this coercive and abusive situation and seek to remediate the untoward consequences and the retaliatory actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holding the perpetrator and the victim of coercion equally accountable for fraud simply because both are listed as the authors on the fraudulent publications is against the spirit of the Code.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prairie-voles-hormone-oxytocin-bond">Prairie voles can find partners just fine without the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prairie voles have long been heralded as models of monogamy. Now, a study suggests that the “love hormone” once thought essential for their bonding — oxytocin — might not be so necessary after all.</p>



<p>Interest in the romantic lives of prairie voles (<em>Microtus ochrogaster</em>) was first sparked more than 40 years ago, says Devanand Manoli, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Biologists trying to capture voles to study would frequently catch two at a time, because “what they were finding were these male-female pairs,” he says. Unlike many other rodents with their myriad partners, prairie voles, it turned out, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-really-changes-when-male-vole-settles-down">mate for life</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/15</em>).</p>





<p>Pair-bonded prairie voles prefer each other’s company over a stranger’s and like to huddle together both in the wild and the lab. Because other vole species don’t have social behaviors as complex as prairie voles do, they have been a popular animal system for studying how social behavior evolves.</p>



<p>Research over the last few decades has implicated a few hormones in the brain as vital for proper vole manners, most notably oxytocin, which is also important for social behavior in humans and other animals.</p>



<p>Manoli and colleagues thought the oxytocin receptor, the protein that detects and reacts to oxytocin, would be the perfect test target for a new genetic engineering method based on CRISPR technology, which uses molecules from bacteria to selectively turn off genes. The researchers used the technique on vole embryos to create animals born without functioning oxytocin receptors. The team figured that the rodents wouldn’t be able to form pair-bonds — just like voles in past experiments whose oxytocin activity was blocked with drugs.</p>



<p>Instead, Manoli says, the researchers got “a big surprise.” The <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)01084-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voles could form pair-bonds even without oxytocin</a>, the team reports in the March 15 <em>Neuron</em>.</p>



<p>“I was very surprised by their results,” says Larry Young, a biologist at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved with the study but has studied oxytocin in prairie voles for decades.</p>



<p>A key difference between the new study and past studies that used drugs to block oxytocin is the timing of exactly when the hormone’s activity is turned off. With drugs, the voles are adults and have had exposure to oxytocin in their brains before the shutoff. With CRISPR, “these animals are born never experiencing oxytocin signaling in the brain,” says Young, whose research group has recently replicated Manoli’s experiment and found the same result.</p>



<p>It may be, Young says, that pair-bonding is controlled by a brain circuit that typically becomes dependent on oxytocin through exposure to it during development, like a symphony trained by a conductor. Suddenly remove that conductor and the symphony will sound discordant, whereas a jazz band that’s never practiced with a conductor fares just fine without one.</p>





<p>Manoli agrees that the technique’s timing matters. A secondary reason for the disparity, he says, could be that drugs often have off-target effects, such that the chemicals meant to block oxytocin could have been doing other things in the voles’ brains to affect pair-bonding. But Young disagrees. “I don’t believe that,” he says. “The [drug] that people use is very selective,” not even binding to the receptor of oxytocin’s closest molecular relative, vasopressin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does this result mean that decades of past work on pair-bonding has been upended? Not quite.</p>



<p>“It shows us that this is a much more complicated question,” Manoli says. “The pharmacologic manipulations … suggested that [oxytocin] plays a critical role. The question is, what is that role?”</p>



<p>The new seemingly startling result makes sense if you look at the big picture, Manoli says. The ability for voles to pair-bond is “so critical for the survival of the species,” he says. “From a genetics perspective, it may make sense that there isn’t a single point of failure.”</p>



<p>The group now hopes to look at how other hormones, like vasopressin, influence pair-bonding using this relatively new genetic technique. They are also looking more closely at the voles’ behavior to be sure that the CRISPR gene editing didn’t alter it in a way they haven’t noticed yet.</p>



<p>In the game of vole “love,” it looks like we’re still trying to understand all the players.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-marks-ice-age-cave-art">Mysterious marks on Ice Age cave art may have been a form of record keeping</a></h4>

              
                <p>As far back as roughly 25,000 years ago, Ice Age hunter-gatherers may have jotted down markings to communicate information about the behavior of their prey, a new study finds.</p>



<p>These markings include dots, lines and the symbol “Y,” and often accompany images of animals. Over the last 150 years, the mysterious depictions, some dating back nearly 40,000 years, have been found in hundreds of caves across Europe.</p>



<p>Some archaeologists have speculated that the markings <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-time-calendar-ancient-human-art">might relate to keeping track of time</a>, but the specific purpose has remained elusive (<em>SN: 7/9/19)</em>. Now, a statistical analysis, published January 5 in <em>Cambridge</em> <em>Archeological Journal</em>, presents evidence that past people may have been recording <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/an-upper-palaeolithic-protowriting-system-and-phenological-calendar/6F2AD8A705888F2226FE857840B4FE19#article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mating and birthing schedule of local fauna</a>.</p>





<p>By comparing the marks to the animals’ life cycles, researchers showed that the number of dots or lines in a given image strongly correlates to the month of mating across all the analyzed examples, which included aurochs (an extinct species of wild cattle), bison, horses, mammoth and fish. What’s more, the position of the symbol “Y” in a sequence was predictive of birth month, suggesting that “Y” signifies “to give birth.”</p>



<p>The finding is one of the earliest records of a coherent notational system, the researchers say. It indicates that people at the time were able to interpret the meaning of an item’s position in a sequence and plan ahead for the distant future using a calendar of sorts — reinforcing the suggestion that they were capable of complex cognition.</p>

Bacon <em>et al</em>/<em>Cambridge Archaeological Journal</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is a really big deal cognitively,” says Ben Bacon, an independent researcher based in London. “We&#8217;re dealing with a system that has intense organization, intense logic to it.”</p>



<p>A furniture conservator by day, Bacon spent years poring through scientific articles to compile over 800 instances of these cave markings. From his research and reading the literature, he reasoned that the dots corresponded to the 13 lunar cycles in a year. But he thought that the hunter-gatherers would’ve been more concerned with seasonal changes than the moon.</p>



<p>In the new paper, he and colleagues argue that rather than pinning a calendar to astronomical events like the equinox, the hunter-gatherers started their calendar year with the snowmelt in the spring. Not only would the snowmelt be a clear point of origin, but the meteorological calendar would also account for differences in timing across locations. </p>





<p>For example, though snowmelt would start on different dates in different latitudes, bison would always mate approximately four lunar cycles — or months — after that region’s snowmelt, as indicated by four dots or lines.</p>



<p>“This is why it&#8217;s such a clever system, because it&#8217;s based on the universal,” Bacon says. “Which means if you migrate from the Pyrenees to Belgium, you can just use the same calendar.”</p>



<p>He needed data to prove his idea. After compiling the markings, he worked with academic researchers to identify the timing of migration, mating and birth for common Ice Age animals targeted by hunter-gatherers by using archaeological data or comparing with similar modern animals. Next, the researchers determined if the marks aligned significantly with important life events based on this calendar. When the team ran the statistical analysis, the results strongly supported Bacon’s theory.</p>



<p>When explaining the markings, “we’ve argued for notational systems before, but it’s always been fairly speculative as to what the people were counting and why they were counting,” says Brian Hayden, an archaeologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, who peer-reviewed the paper. “This adds a lot more depth and specificity to why people were keeping calendars and how they were using them.”</p>



<p>Linguistic experts argue that, given the lack of conventional syntax and grammar, the marks wouldn’t be considered writing. But that doesn’t make the finding inherently less exciting, says paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger of the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar in Portugal, who wasn’t involved in the study. Writing systems are often mistakenly considered a pinnacle of achievement, when in fact writing would be developed only in cultural contexts where it’s useful, she says. Instead, it’s significant that the marks provide a way to keep records outside of the mind.</p>



<p>“In a way, <em>that </em>was the huge cognitive leap,” she says. “Suddenly, we have the ability to preserve [information] beyond the moment. We have the ability to transmit it across space and time. Everything starts to change.”</p>



<p>The debate over these marks’ meanings continues. Archaeologist April Nowell doesn’t buy many of the team’s assumptions. “It boggles my mind why one would need a calendar … to predict that animals were going to have offspring in the spring,” says Nowell, of the University of Victoria in British Columbia. “The amount of information that this calendar is providing, if it really is a calendar, is quite minimal.”</p>



<p>Hayden adds that, while the basic pattern would still hold, some of the cave marks had “wiggle room for interpretation.” The next step, he says, will be to review and verify the interpretations of the marks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">It’s possible to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez saw the future of energy on a broiling-hot day last September.</p>



<p>An email alert hit her inbox from the San&nbsp;Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company. “Extreme heat straining the grid,” read the message, which was also pinged as a text to 27 million people. “Save energy to help avoid power interruptions.”</p>



<p>It worked. People cut their energy use. Demand plunged, blackouts were avoided and California successfully weathered a crisis exacerbated by climate change. “It was very exciting to see,” says Hidalgo-Gonzalez, an electrical engineer at the University of California, San Diego who studies renewable energy and the power grid.</p>





<p>This kind of collective societal response, in which we reshape how we interact with the systems that provide us energy, will be crucial as we figure out how to live on a changing planet.</p>



<p>Earth has warmed at least 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, when the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">began belching heat-trapping gases</a> such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Scientists agree that only drastic action to cut emissions can keep the planet from blasting past 1.5 degrees of warming — a threshold beyond which the consequences become even more catastrophic than the rising sea levels, extreme weather and other impacts the world is already experiencing.</p>



<p>The goal is to achieve what’s known as net-zero emissions, where any greenhouse gases still entering the atmosphere are balanced by those being removed — and to do it as soon as we can.</p>



<p>Scientists say it is possible to swiftly transform the ways we produce and consume energy. To show the way forward, researchers have set out paths toward a world where human activities generate little to no carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases — a decarbonized economy.</p>



<p>The key to a decarbonized future lies in producing vast amounts of new electricity from sources that emit little to none of the gases, such as wind, solar and hydropower, and then transforming as much of our lives and our industries as possible to run off those sources. Clean electricity needs to power not only the planet’s current energy use but also the increased demands of a growing global population.</p>



<p>Once humankind has switched nearly entirely to clean electricity, we will also have to counter­balance the carbon dioxide we still emit — yes, we will still emit some — by pulling an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it somewhere permanently.</p>





<p>Achieving net-zero emissions won’t be easy. Getting to effective and meaningful action on climate change requires overcoming decades of inertia and denial about the scope and magnitude of the problem. Nations are falling well short of existing pledges to reduce emissions, and global warming remains on track to charge past 1.5 degrees perhaps even by the end of this decade.</p>



<p>Yet there is hope. The rate of growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is slowing globally — down from 3 percent annual growth in the 2000s to half a percent annual growth in the last decade, according to the <a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Carbon Project</a>, which quantifies greenhouse gas emissions. </p>



<p>There are signs annual emissions could start shrinking. And over the last two years, the United States, by far the biggest cumulative contributor to global warming, has passed several pieces of federal legislation that include financial incentives to accelerate the transition to clean energy. “We’ve never seen anything at this scale,” says Erin Mayfield, an energy researcher at Dartmouth College.</p>



<p>Though the energy transition will require many new technologies, such as innovative ways to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere, many of the solutions, such as wind and solar power, are in hand — “stuff we already have,” Mayfield says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>How to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050</h3>



<p>In a 2021 report, the International Energy Agency described the steps necessary to ensure that by 2050 the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere globally balances the amount being taken out. This chart shows how carbon dioxide emissions would have to drop across sectors to bring planetwide emissions from roughly 34 billion metric tons annually to net-zero. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>The current state of carbon dioxide emissions</h4>



<p>Of all the emissions that need to be slashed, the most important is carbon dioxide, which comes from many sources such as cars and trucks and coal-burning power plants. The gas accounted for 79 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. The next most significant greenhouse gas, at 11 percent of emissions in the United States, is methane, which comes from oil and gas operations as well as livestock, landfills and other land uses.</p>



<p>The amount of methane may seem small, but it is mighty — over the short term, methane is more than 80 times as efficient at trapping heat as carbon dioxide is, and methane’s atmospheric levels have nearly tripled in the last two centuries. Other greenhouse gases include nitrous oxides, which come from sources such as applying fertilizer to crops or burning fuels and account for 7 percent of U.S. emissions, and human-made fluorinated gases such as hydrofluorocarbons that account for 3 percent.</p>



<p>Globally, emissions are dominated by large nations that produce lots of energy. The United States alone emits around 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. It is responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions throughout history and ceded the spot for top annual emitter to China only in the mid-2000s. India ranks third.</p>



<p>Because of the United States’ role in producing most of the carbon pollution to date, many researchers and advocates argue that it has the moral responsibility to take the global lead on cutting emissions. And the United States has the most ambitious goals of the major emitters, at least on paper. President Joe Biden has said the country is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Leaders in China and India have set net-zero goals of 2060 and 2070, respectively.</p>



<p>Under the auspices of a 2015 international climate change treaty known as the Paris agreement, 193 nations plus the European Union have pledged to reduce their emissions. The agreement aims to keep global warming well below 2 degrees, and ideally to 1.5 degrees, above preindustrial levels. But it is insufficient. Even if all countries cut their emissions as much as they have promised under the Paris agreement, the world would likely blow past 2&nbsp;degrees of warming before the end of this century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every nation continues to find its own path forward. “At the end of the day, all the solutions are going to be country-specific,” says Sha Yu, an earth scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and University of Maryland’s Joint Global Change Research Institute in College Park, Md. “There’s not a universal fix.”</p>



<p>But there are some common themes for how to accomplish this energy transition — ways to focus our efforts on the things that will matter most. These are efforts that go beyond individual consumer choices such as whether to fly less or eat less meat. They instead penetrate every aspect of how society produces and consumes energy.</p>



<p>Such massive changes will need to overcome a lot of resistance, including from companies that make money off old forms of energy as well as politicians and lobbyists. But if society can make these changes, it will rank as one of humanity’s greatest accomplishments. We will have tackled a problem of our own making and conquered it.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at what we’ll need to do.</p>



<h4>Make as much clean electricity as possible</h4>



<p>To meet the need for energy without putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, countries would need to dramatically scale up the amount of clean energy they produce. Fortunately, most of that energy would be generated by technologies we already have — renewable sources of energy including wind and solar power.</p>



<p>“Renewables, far and wide, are the key pillar in any net-zero scenario,” says Mayfield, who worked on an <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/the-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential 2021 report from Princeton University’s Net-Zero America project</a>, which focused on the U.S. economy.</p>



<p>The Princeton report envisions wind and solar power production roughly quadrupling by 2030 to get the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050. That would mean building many new solar and wind farms, so many that in the most ambitious scenario, wind turbines would cover an area the size of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma combined.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>How much solar and wind power would we need?</h3>



<p>Achieving net-zero would require a dramatic increase in solar and wind power in the United States. These maps show the footprint of existing solar and wind infrastructure in the contiguous United States (as of 2020) and a possible footprint for a midrange scenario for 2050.

<p>Such a scale-up is only possible because prices to produce renewable energy have plunged. The cost of wind power has dropped nearly 70 percent, and solar power nearly 90 percent, over the last decade in the United States. “That was a game changer that I don’t know if some people were expecting,” Hidalgo-Gonzalez says.</p>



<p>Globally the price drop in renewables has allowed growth to surge; China, for instance, installed a record 55 gigawatts of solar power capacity in 2021, for a total of 306 gigawatts or nearly 13 percent of the nation’s installed capacity to generate electricity. China is almost certain to have had another record year for solar power installations in 2022.</p>



<p>Challenges include figuring out ways to store and transmit all that extra electricity, and finding locations to build wind and solar power installations that are acceptable to local communities. Other types of low-carbon power, such as hydropower and nuclear power, which comes with its own public resistance, will also likely play a role going forward.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>More renewable electricity globally</h3>



<p>Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydropower, account for a larger share of global electricity generation today than they did in 2015. The International Energy Agency expects that trend to continue, projecting that renewables will top 38 percent in 2027.</p>

<h4>Get efficient and go electric</h4>



<p>The drive toward net-zero emissions also requires boosting energy efficiency across industries and electrifying as many aspects of modern life as possible, such as transportation and home heating.</p>



<p>Some industries are already shifting to more efficient methods of production, such as steelmaking in China that incorporates hydrogen-based furnaces that are much cleaner than coal-fired ones, Yu says. In India, simply closing down the most inefficient coal-burning power plants provides the most bang for the buck, says Shayak Sengupta, an energy and policy expert at the Observer Research Foundation America think tank in Washington, D.C. “The list has been made up,” he says, of the plants that should close first, “and that’s been happening.”</p>



<p>To achieve net-zero, the United States would need to increase its share of electric heat pumps, which heat houses much more cleanly than gas- or oil-fired appliances, from around 10&nbsp;percent in 2020 to as much as 80 percent by 2050, according to the Princeton report. Federal subsidies for these sorts of appliances are rolling out in 2023 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-climate-change-bill-legislation-clean-energy">as part of the new Inflation Reduction Act</a>, legislation that contains a number of climate-related provisions.</p>



<p>Shifting cars and other vehicles away from burning gasoline to running off of electricity would also lead to significant emissions cuts. In <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25932/accelerating-decarbonization-of-the-us-energy-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a major 2021 report</a>, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said that one of the most important moves in decarbonizing the U.S. economy would be having electric vehicles account for half of all new vehicle sales by 2030. That’s not impossible; electric car sales accounted for nearly 6 percent of new sales in the United States in 2022, which is still a low number but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">nearly double the previous year</a><em>.</em></p>



<h4>Make clean fuels</h4>



<p>Some industries such as manufacturing and transportation can’t be fully electrified using current technologies — battery powered airplanes, for instance, will probably never be feasible for long-duration flights. Technologies that still require liquid fuels will need to switch from gas, oil and other fossil fuels to low-carbon or zero-carbon fuels.</p>



<p>One major player will be fuels extracted from plants and other biomass, which take up carbon dioxide as they grow and emit it when they die, making them essentially carbon neutral over their lifetime. To create biofuels, farmers grow crops, and others process the harvest in conversion facilities into fuels such as hydrogen. Hydrogen, in turn, can be substituted for more carbon-intensive substances in various industrial processes such as making plastics and fertilizers — and maybe even as fuel for airplanes someday.</p>



<p>In one of the Princeton team’s scenarios, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast would become peppered with biomass conversion plants by 2050, so that fuels can be processed close to where crops are grown. Many of the biomass feedstocks could potentially grow alongside food crops or replace other, nonfood crops.</p>

<h3>Solar and wind power trends in the United States </h3>



<p>The amount of electricity generated from wind and solar power in the United States has surged in the last decade. The boost was made possible in large part by drops in the costs of producing that energy.</p>

<h4>Cut methane and other non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h4>



<p>Greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon dioxide will also need to be slashed. In the United States, the majority of methane emissions come from livestock, landfills and other agricultural sources, as well as scattered sources such as forest fires and wetlands. But about one-third of U.S. methane emissions come from oil, gas and coal operations. These may be some of the first places that regulators can target for cleanup, especially “super emitters” that can be pinpointed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-locate-methane-ultra-emitters">using satellites and other types of remote sensing</a>.</p>



<p>In 2021, the United States and the European Union unveiled what became a global methane pledge endorsed by 150 countries to reduce emissions. There is, however, no enforcement of it yet. And China, the world’s largest methane emitter, has not signed on.</p>



<p>Nitrous oxides could be reduced by improving soil management techniques, and fluorinated gases by finding alternatives and improving production and recycling efforts.</p>



<h4>Sop up as much CO<sub>2</sub> as possible</h4>



<p>Once emissions have been cut as much as possible, reaching net-zero will mean removing and storing an equivalent amount of carbon to what society still emits.</p>



<p>One solution already in use is to capture carbon dioxide produced at power plants and other industrial facilities and store it permanently somewhere, such as deep underground. Globally there are around 35 such operations, which collectively draw down around 45 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. About 200 new plants are on the drawing board to be operating by the end of this decade, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>



<p>The Princeton report envisions carbon capture being added to almost every kind of U.S. industrial plant, from cement production to biomass conversion. Much of the carbon dioxide would be liquefied and piped along more than 100,000 kilometers of new pipelines to deep geologic storage, primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast, where underground reservoirs can be used to trap it permanently. This would be a massive infrastructure effort. Building this pipeline network could cost up to $230&nbsp;billion, including $13 billion for early buy-in from local communities and permitting alone.</p>



<p>Another way to sop up carbon is to get forests and soils to take up more. That could be accomplished by converting crops that are relatively carbon-intensive, such as corn to be used in ethanol, to energy-rich grasses that can be used for more efficient biofuels, or by turning some cropland or pastures back into forest. It’s even possible to sprinkle crushed rock onto croplands, which accelerates natural weathering processes that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.</p>



<p>Another way to increase the amount of carbon stored in the land is to reduce the amount of the Amazon rainforest that is cut down each year. “For a few countries like Brazil, preventing deforestation will be the first thing you can do,” Yu says.</p>



<h4>When it comes to climate change, there’s no time to waste</h4>



<p>The Princeton team estimates that the United States would need to invest at least an additional $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years for the country to have a shot at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Congress has begun ramping up funding with two large pieces of federal legislation it passed in 2021 and 2022. Those steer more than $1 trillion toward modernizing major parts of the nation’s economy over a decade — including investing in the energy transition to help fight climate change.</p>



<p>Between now and 2030, solar and wind power, plus increasing energy efficiency, can deliver about half of the emissions reductions needed for this decade, the International Energy Agency estimates. After that, the primary drivers would need to be increasing electrification, carbon capture and storage, and clean fuels such as hydrogen.</p>

That steam spins turbines to make electricity.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121276">ADAMKAZ/E+/GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The trick is to do all of this without making people’s lives worse. Developing nations need to be able to supply energy for their economies to develop. Communities whose jobs relied on fossil fuels need to have new economic opportunities.</p>



<p>Julia Haggerty, a geographer at Montana State University in Bozeman who studies communities that are dependent on natural resources, says that those who have money and other resources to support the transition will weather the change better than those who are under-resourced now. “At the landscape of states and regions, it just remains incredibly uneven,” she says.</p>



<p>The ongoing energy transition also faces unanticipated shocks such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent energy prices soaring in Europe, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially slashed global emissions but later saw them rebound.</p>



<p>But the technologies exist for us to wean our lives off fossil fuels. And we have the inventiveness to develop more as needed. Transforming how we produce and use energy, as rapidly as possible, is a tremendous challenge — but one that we can meet head-on. For Mayfield, getting to net-zero by 2050 is a realistic goal for the United States. “I think it’s possible,” she says. “But it doesn’t mean there’s not a lot more work to be done.”</p>

--><p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>Current SNNs studies frequently ignore dendrites, the thin membranous extensions of biological neurons that receive and preprocess nearly all synaptic inputs in the brain.
However, decades of experimental and theoretical research suggest that dendrites possess compelling computational capabilities that greatly influence neuronal and circuit functions.
Notably, standard point-neuron networks cannot adequately capture most hallmark dendritic properties.
Meanwhile, biophysically detailed neuron models can be suboptimal for practical applications due to their complexity, and high computational cost.
For this reason, we introduce Dendrify, a new theoretical framework combined with an open-source Python package (compatible with Brian2) that facilitates the development of bioinspired SNNs. Dendrify allows the creation of reduced compartmental neuron models with simplified yet biologically relevant dendritic and synaptic integrative properties.
Such models strike a good balance between flexibility, performance, and biological accuracy, allowing us to explore dendritic contributions to network-level functions while paving the way for developing more realistic neuromorphic&nbsp;systems.</p>

<p>A federal judge has denied a request for a preliminary injunction by a breast cancer researcher at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn who sued the university last year after an institutional investigation determined that she committed research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the judge noted “troubling aspects of this case that bear on serious public health concerns” – namely the discontinuation of the scientist’s research – and also expressed concern about SUNY Downstate and the NIH’s treatment of her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/exclusive-cancer-researcher-sues-med-school-for-retaliation-after-research-misconduct-finding/">previously reported</a>, <a href="https://www.downstate.edu/faculty/cell-biology/blain.html">Stacy Blain</a>, an associate professor of pediatrics and cell biology at SUNY Downstate, has alleged the university discriminated against her for decades because of her sex, and that the investigation’s finding of misconduct was the result of retaliation after she complained of the discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126459"></span>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Blain-injunction-request.pdf">request for a preliminary injunction</a> filed the same day as she filed the lawsuit, Blain asked a judge to order SUNY Downstate not to initiate disciplinary proceedings or other “adverse employment actions” against her, not to contact journals asking for retractions of her papers, and to reinstate her as the principal investigator on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/27/nih-asked-to-replace-a-pi-on-grants-after-university-said-she-violated-policy/">two grants from the National Institutes of Health from which she’d been removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In denying the request, Judge Frederic Block <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/73-injunction-denial.pdf">ruled this week</a> that Blain had failed to prove “that there is a likelihood of success that she will prevail on the merits.” He also wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The tangled circumstances that flowed from the anonymous whistleblower’s complaint back in 2019 has embroiled Dr. Blain in a Kafkaesque nightmare. She stands accused by SUNY Downstate of research misconduct, but she might very well be exonerated at her disciplinary hearing. Only time will tell.</p>



<p>On the federal level, ORI is reviewing the finding of research misconduct. Its decision will not be rendered for some indeterminate period of time and there is no certainty that it will agree that Dr. Blain is culpable.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The opinion summarized the evidence that Block found concerning. Among it was testimony from <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/andrew-koff">Andrew Koff</a>, a molecular biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Koff testified that an experimental cancer drug Blain had invented could make it to clinical trials “within two years,” and that SUNY Downstate’s requests to retract Blain’s papers would “end the program.” He also said that he disagreed with the conclusion in SUNY Downstate’s investigation of Blain that the data falsification would be obvious to any cell biologist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Koff – whom Block described as “one of the world’s leading molecular biologists” – <a href="https://concarlo.com/our-team/">serves as a scientific advisor</a> to Concarlo Therapeutics, the biotech company Blain founded in 2016 to commercialize her research. A lawyer for Blain said Koff did disclose his role in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Block wrote that, as a result of the evidence Blain presented, he had:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>became concerned about NIH’s wisdom in jettisoning Dr. Blain. Her discovery of the drug that holds out the promise of reducing cancerous growths suggests that it was in the public’s best interest for NIH to have allowed her to continue her quest to rid the world of cancer.</p>



<p>It is the Court’s hope that Dr. Blain can be returned as the PI on the grant. Although the Court has acknowledged that it has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the decisions and actions of SUNY Downstate, ORI and NIH, it believes that this is a rare occasion when a court should stray from the strictures of its jurisdiction and speak to the public in<em> dicta</em> because of the profound public interests at stake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Still, Block concluded that the evidence Blain presented thus far did not establish sex discrimination or retaliation by SUNY Downstate:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no evidence that SUNY Downstate took any action that it would not have taken against a similarly situated male professor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Block also wrote that he believed “the investigation of Dr. Blain was not in SUNY Downstate’s reputational or financial interest,” and was “convinced that only the most serious and legitimate reasons would lead SUNY Downstate to act against those interests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for SUNY Downstate has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/27/nih-asked-to-replace-a-pi-on-grants-after-university-said-she-violated-policy/">previously told us</a> that the university “does not comment on pending litigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Walden, an attorney at Walden, Macht &amp; Haran in New York who represents Blain, commented:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>First, we thank U.S. District Judge Frederic Block, for identifying and addressing what is at the heart of this matter.&nbsp; As Judge Block stated, SUNY’s plagued research misconduct investigation against Dr. Blain has been a “Kafkaesque nightmare.”&nbsp; As we have maintained all along, this investigation, as Judge Block found, was “compromised.”&nbsp; For example, Judge Block was “greatly troubled” by the final investigation report’s exclusion of exculpatory evidence; Judge Block questioned the integrity of the investigation committee, noting that they failed to include witness statements supporting Dr. Blain’s research or interview witnesses who would have testified that Dr. Blain did not and would never engage in research misconduct.&nbsp; Judge Block emphasized that one of the world’s leading molecular biologists – who was “eminently qualified” to take issue with the investigation committee’s findings – disagreed with the investigation committee’s conclusion that Dr. Blain committed research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these reasons, Judge Block expressed that SUNY’s actions against Dr. Blain have harmed science and raised “serious public health concerns” and, to correct this travesty, Dr. Blain should be “returned as the [principal investigator] on the grant” from which she was removed as a result of the investigation.&nbsp; The fact that a federal judge took the extraordinary step of making a public pronouncement of his disapproval and concern speaks volumes about the case and the integrity of Dr. Blain’s research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Judge Block did not grant Dr. Blain a preliminary injunction against SUNY, as Judge Block noted, all of the claims litigated survive and remain to be litigated with full discovery as to SUNY’s biased and unfair investigation.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Metoposaurus krasiejowensis </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">dwelled in what we now call Poland during the Late Triassic Period around 227–216.5 years ago. Discovered in Krasiejów &#8211; the village to which it owes its name &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Metoposaurus krasiejowensis </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">is the most abundant metoposaurid amphibian from the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike amniotes, the occurrences of cancer in anamniotes is scarcely documented. In this <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> paper, Surmik et al., provided the first documentation of primary malignant bone tumor in a vertebra of a Mesozoic non-amniote. Gross anatomy, histology and x-ray computed micro-tomography revealed aggressive bone destruction and massive new bone formation, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">indicating a sarcoma of the osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma variety. Using</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> sections from the sample, the researchers found that the osteosarcoma penetrated deep from the surface of the bone into its interior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The discovery of neoplasm in this ancient patient not only expands our knowledge on the ancient ancestry of cancer, but can shine light onto the pathophysiological aspects of carcinogenesis. This in turn, may aid in the development of new treatment strategies for cancer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When does being good allow us to be bad? According to the theory of moral licensing, when an individual behaves in a way they consider moral, this increases confidence in their self image. This moral confidence then ‘licenses’ them against immoral choices in the future. A simple example would be, someone indulging themselves with unhealthy food, after a period of eating healthy food. Moral licensing is a theory widely used in social psychology to explain human behavior and moral-regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an effort to better understand the influence of moral licensing on scientific misconduct, researchers from Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University and Hebei University of Engineering constructed a moderated mediation model. 287 medical researchers from China were recruited for the study, wherein researchers found that creative performance was positively associated with scientific misconduct. Zhang et al. argue that researchers with higher creativity are more likely to establish moral licensing, resulting in subsequent scientific misconduct. However, they also explained that participants with high levels of moral identity &#8211; the importance of morality to one’s identity &#8211; are more likely to restrain the establishment of moral licensing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although an individual’s characteristics can play a role in scientific misconduct, other factors such as unethical academic climate and flawed organizational systems have been shown to encourage such behaviors. A holistic approach in limiting the occurrence of misconduct in science is required. This study published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> provides a moral psychology perspective, and practical significance for prevention of scientific misconduct in medical research institutions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As humans live longer, the older population grows dramatically. This shift in the population has important implications for society. Understanding the intricacies of aging is crucial, to ensure that humans can live not only longer, but also healthier lives. The proper functioning of the host-immune system is largely affected by the gut microbiome, and age-related immune system decline significantly affects the health of older people. However, genetic evidence of age-related immune changes in the gut microbiota, remains under-explored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A recent study published in <em>BMC Gastroenterology</em> investigated a total of 112 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of small intestine samples from young mice transplanted with old donor gut microbiota. Using estimations from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, the association between the immune-associated DEGs and the microenvironment status in the normal gut tissues were established. Giannos and co-authors identified a 25-gene signature of immune-associated DEGs. Among others, these DEGs were associated with naive T-cell, effector memory T-cell, and central memory T-cell. In the recipient mice transplanted with old gut microbiota, antigen presentation was the most down-regulated pathway. These genes may have a role as candidate markers of immune dysregulation, in the aging gut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disturbance in the composition and the diversity of the gut microbiota, coincides with the decline in immune homeostasis during aging. This study gives insight into the gene signatures associated with an aging gut, and the relationship between aging in the gut microbiota and immune functionality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally. Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to human papillomaviruses infection and vaccination, and screening remains a key component in elimination of cervical cancer. Due to barriers to screening uptake, low and middle income countries bear the largest burden of cervical cancer mortality. Uncovering the barriers along with implementation of measures that prioritize increased screening uptake is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a study published in <em>BMC Women’s Health</em>, researchers performed a systematic review to investigate the barriers to cervical cancer screening among women in low and middle income countries. After a screening of 2148 articles, 79 studies published between 2010 and 2020 were included, with the majority of the studies undertaken in Africa. Including studies using qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods study designs, the authors identified five categories that described these barriers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Individual or personal barriers (including lack of knowledge, awareness and understanding of screening)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Social barriers (including gender relations, community obstacles, misconceptions about screening and cancer)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cultural, traditional or religious barriers (concerns norms and expectations associated with culture and religious beliefs)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Health system barriers (including lack of policies and services, lack of resources, and overall design, function and implementation of health systems)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Structural barriers (including but not limited to financial constraints, unaffordable screening cost, low levels of education)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This review provides a comprehensive overview of the barriers of cervical cancer screening uptake and shows that the barriers are complex and layered. There is an urgent need to tackle the barriers from all directions, from implementation of policies supporting the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls, to addressing misconceptions prevalent in many communities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The researchers leave us with a takeaway message: </span><em>“It i</em><i>s only in reducing the barriers to cervical cancer screening that so many women continue to face, that the aims of the WHO’s global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem will be fulfilled.”</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global HPV immunization coverage remains sub-optimal. While parental hesitancy is a known significant barrier, provider recommendation remains the strongest patient-level predictor of HPV vaccine uptake. To improve HPV vaccine uptake, further refinement of more structured electronic health records is needed. Adding a patient refusal to vaccine measure can provide a better understanding of all instances where a provider recommended vaccination, and whether it led to refusal or vaccination. However, many electronic health records are not designed to document vaccine refusals in a way that is consistent and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To improve healthcare provider performance and professional practice, audit and feedback plays an important role. In this study published in <em>BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, </em>a parent trial was done to compare coach-based versus web-based practice to increase HPV vaccination uptake in community-based pediatric practices. Secondary data analysis was then conducted to look at whether adding a patient refusal measure as a parameter can improve the electronic health records and provider fidelity in the context of human papillomavirus vaccine. The researchers reported that measuring documented vaccine refusals, together with documented vaccine administration enables a more accurate measurement of provider compliance to vaccination guidelines. Although they found mixed results when it comes to feasibility and limited adoption among the pediatric practices, they found strong use among practices that adopt the method, along with ability to identify patient demographic patterns of vaccine refusals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enabling a more systematic and streamlined documentation of vaccine refusals can aid in future assessment and feedback efforts by improving adherence to HPV vaccination guidelines. On top of addressing vaccine hesitancy, implementation of an efficient patient refusal documentation may aid in increased immunization coverage. </span></p>
