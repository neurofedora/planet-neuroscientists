<p><em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title, has retracted an article a group of sleuths described as “a kind of case study of all the red flags for fraud that we look for” in an open letter to the publisher’s head of research integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41314-y">Hybrid CNN-LSTM model with efficient hyperparameter tuning for prediction of Parkinson’s disease</a>,” appeared in September 2023. It has been cited 11 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BE2E334302A3B028B84D49A35C44B1#1">commented</a> on 13 tortured phrases the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> had flagged in the article, such as the use of “Parkinson’s illness,” “Parkinson’s infection,” and “Parkinson’s sickness” rather than Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130380"></span>



<p>“These typically result from an attempt to avoid plagiarism detection using a paraphrasing software,” the commenter wrote about the phases. “How come these incorrect wordings survived proofreading by the coauthors, editors, referees, copy editors, and typesetters?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59648-6">author correction</a>” to the article appeared the following April, stating “several non-standard terms” had been “replaced with established scientific terminology,” including all of the incorrect references to “Parkinson’s disease.” The correction listed eight sections with updated wording for other phrases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original article also incorrectly identified the software the authors used in their analysis as python rather than SPSS, according to the correction, and five sentences were updated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BE2E334302A3B028B84D49A35C44B1#2">August comment</a> on the correction, the original PubPeer commenter wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Astonished that these tortured phrases and other issues got through peer review. Astonished that a correction was accepted. Astonished that some tortured phrases are still there, e.g., 10-overlay instead of 10-fold.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correction was “outrageous,” Guillaume Cabanac, a computer scientist and sleuth who developed the Problematic Paper Screener, posted on X October 9:&nbsp;</p>

<p>That same day, the journal added an editor’s note to the article, which stated it was under investigation, stating: “Appropriate editorial action will be taken once the investigation has concluded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, multiple sleuths added comments to the PubPeer pages for the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BE2E334302A3B028B84D49A35C44B1#4">article</a> and its <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/AB22CD1F2F709E28CA9A39D3FF31D1#3">correction</a>, pointing out more issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 16, sleuth Dorothy Bishop posted “<a href="https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2024/10/an-open-letter-regarding-scientific.html">An open letter regarding Scientific Reports</a>” on her blog, addressed to Chris Graf, Springer Nature’s director of research integrity. In it, she and 22 other “sleuths and forensic meta-scientists” wrote they were “concerned that Springer Nature is failing in its duty to protect the scientific literature from fraudulent and low quality work” due to problems with <em>Scientific Reports</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corrected article was “a striking example” of the sometimes “inadequate” response of the journal editor or integrity team to concerns the sleuths have raised, they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As is evident from <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/AB22CD1F2F709E28CA9A39D3FF31D1">comments on PubPeer</a>, it turned out to be a kind of case study of all the red flags for fraud that we look for. As well as (still uncorrected) tortured phrases, it contained irrelevant content, irrelevant citations, meaningless gibberish, a nonsensical figure, and material recycled from other publications.</p>



<p>This is perhaps the most flagrant example, but we argue that it indicates problems with your editorial processes that are not going to be fixed by AI.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sleuths concluded with their recommendations for addressing the issues they raised, including “an urgent audit of all editors” for <em>Scientific Reports</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On November 7, the editors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78418-y">retracted</a> the offending article “due to concerns regarding the validity and veracity of the work presented,” with a list of six issues sleuths had posted on PubPeer. The authors “have not responded to correspondence from the Editors about this retraction,” according to the notice. Corresponding author Pugazhenthan Thangaraju of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Raipur, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, told Retraction Watch in a statement:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The paper was already under investigation prior to the publication of the letter. After carefully considering the facts of the matter, we concluded that retracting the paper was the appropriate editorial action to take.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Three Springer Nature journals, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/07/another-springer-nature-journal-has-retracted-over-300-papers-since-july/"><em>Soft Computing</em></a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/15/springer-nature-journal-has-retracted-over-200-papers-since-september/"><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em></a>, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/"><em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em></a>, have been retracting articles en masse beginning last year, approaching 900 combined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/15/springer-nature-journal-has-retracted-over-200-papers-since-september/">reported previously</a>, the publisher listed paper mills as a significant threat to its business in paperwork for its October initial public offering. The company identified “a significant number” of articles published in its journals that came from paper mills, and stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>These investigations continue and could result in many retractions, which could negatively impact our reputation.</p>

<p>An engineering journal has retracted two papers after a company complained the authors of the articles used  its software without a valid license. </p>



<p>Both retracted papers were published by <em>Ain Shams Engineering Journal </em>in the last couple of years by different authors based in Egypt. Both papers used <a href="https://www.flow3d.com/">FLOW-3D</a>, software that is used to simulate the dynamics of liquids and gasses, which is developed by the firm Flow Science, Inc., in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-jensen-b31a69/">Tom Jensen</a>, vice president of Flow Science, told <em>Retraction Watch</em> the firm offered the authors of both studies to legalize their version of the software by purchasing a license.</p>



<p>But the company didn’t receive a response, Jensen said, despite informing the researchers&nbsp; a retraction would be sought from the journal without a valid license. “We offer greatly reduced prices for licenses for academic institutions and we have numerous academic users around the world,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130354"></span>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes <em>Ain Shams Engineering Journal</em>, said it is “each journal’s responsibility to check if software licences are valid.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jensen said the company came across the papers because it regularly conducts reviews of citations of its software on the internet.&nbsp; How the authors obtained the software in the first place is unclear, Jensen said, “but we are aware that cracked copies of our software (and many others) appear on the so-called ‘dark web’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case is not the first time journals have been forced to pull articles for unlicensed uses of copyrighted work. In 2017, a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers">scientist came under spotlight</a> after asking for tens of thousands of dollars from researchers using his copyrighted questionnaire for research purposes, resulting in at least two teams withdrawing their papers instead of paying up. But a paper that helped form the basis of that questionnaire was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/24/paper-that-helped-form-basis-of-pricy-research-tool-retracted/">retracted in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both retraction notices, issued by the journal’s editor-in-chief, contain similar wording, including:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that the article does not violate any Intellectual Property rights of any person or entity and that the use of any software is made under a license or permission from the software owner.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447922001101">retracted studies</a>, “Investigating the peak outflow through a spatial embankment dam breach,” which was originally published in November 2022, has been cited three times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. It was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447923003337">retracted</a> in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Retraction Watch</em> reached out to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashraf-Jatwary">Ashraf Jatwary</a>, the corresponding author of the 2022 article, who is based at Zagazig University in Egypt, for a comment but didn’t hear back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447922003458">retracted study</a>, “Effect of tailwater depth on non-cohesive earth dam failure due to overtopping,” was originally published in August 2023. It was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447924003794">pulled</a> last month  and has so far been cited 2 times.</p>



<p>We also contacted <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shaimaa-Aman">Shaimaa Aman</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=bRtxMRIAAAAJ&amp;hl=th">Rabiea Nasr</a> of Alexandria University, both corresponding authors of this study, for a comment but didn’t receive a reply.</p>

<p><em>Soft Computing</em>, a Springer Nature title, has retracted at least 335 papers this year, many from issues with guest editors. </p>



<p>The mass retractions began in July, with the latest appearing November 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notes contain identical language to notices in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/"><em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em></a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/15/springer-nature-journal-has-retracted-over-200-papers-since-september/"><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em></a>, which have also been retracting articles en masse this year:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An investigation by the publisher found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised editorial handling and peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references or not being in scope of the journal or guest-edited issue. Based on the investigation’s findings the publisher no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sleuths using the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:3::::::">Problematic Paper Screener</a> have flagged more than 700 articles in the journal that cite retracted or otherwise problematic papers or contain <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02134-0">tortured phrases</a>, nonstandard language that hints at the use of a thesaurus or paraphrasing software to avoid plagiarism detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Content has been retracted from at least 10 guest-edited issues, according to a Springer Nature spokesperson. The publisher assesses each article individually rather than retracting entire issues, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature’s investigation into the affected guest-edited issues “is nearing completion,” but not finished yet, Chris Graf, director of research integrity at the publisher, told Retraction Watch in a statement, indicating more retractions may still come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides retracting articles, the publisher has made changes at the journal including an update to its editorial board, ensuring the editor-in-chief oversees every paper, no longer considering unsolicited proposals for special issues, and adding new research integrity tools to the submission process, Graf said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These retractions are part of our ongoing work to identify and act on any papers of concern, informed by our own investigations and whistleblower information,” Graf said. “Our message to those who attempt to manipulate the publication process and undermine trust in research is clear: our commitment to ensuring the integrity of our content is ironclad and we will not hesitate to take action.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/907528112/0/oupblogpsychology/">In the spirit of Oswald</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/11/in-the-spirit-of-oswald/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Abugel-Feature-480x185.png" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/11/in-the-spirit-of-oswald/">In the spirit of Oswald</a></p><p>It’s been more than 60 years since the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Those who remember where they were and what they were doing on that fateful day in 1963 are becoming smaller in number. Since that afternoon in Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald has been viewed as a glory-seeking sociopath who, according to every official account, acted alone. No one offered him the adulation or hero worship he so desired.</p><p>That is, perhaps, until now. For today’s potential assassins and mass shooters, there could not be a better role model than this isolated extremist seeking fame and achieving it, albeit the short-lived kind. Now, among certain young people, Oswald is achieving the admiration he sought.</p><p>Thomas Matthew Crooks’ thinking may have been <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-shooter-thomas-crooks-oswald-kennedy-google-search/">remarkably like Oswald’s</a> when he took the shot at Donald Trump. Both were outcasts by all accounts—bullied, isolated, and in desperate need of validation. Oswald’s bullet hit his target; Crooks’ only grazed his. But while the distance from Oswald’s nest in the Texas Schoolbook Depository to Kennedy’s limousine was some 265 feet, Crooks’ bullet had to travel roughly 400 feet. Crooks’ shot was more difficult and surprisingly accurate in light of the fact that years earlier he had failed to make the high school rifle team because he was such a bad shot.</p><p>Oswald’s name surfaced again in reference to rooftop shooter Robert Crimo III, who killed seven people and injured dozens of others during a Highland Park Fourth of July parade in 2022. A famous photo of Crimo features a newspaper announcing Oswald’s murder taped to an otherwise bare wall behind him.</p><p>Mass shootings have become commonplace in the modern world. But as every incident and shooter is analyzed, new common denominators are emerging—a link between shooters of the past and those of the present. More often than not, these perpetrators are neither insane nor delusional. But they are political extremists, with their beliefs constantly reinforced by others of the same mind: their violent acts are in fact due to their extreme overvalued beliefs.</p><p>An extreme belief “is one that is shared by others in a person’s cultural, religious, or subcultural group. The belief is often relished, amplified, and defended,” <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/extreme-overvalued-beliefs-9780197612552">forensic scientist Tahir Rahman states</a>. “An extreme belief may grow more dominant over time, more refined, and more resilient to challenge. Thinking becomes simplistic, binary, and absolute. The individual has an intense emotional commitment to the belief and may carry out violent behavior because of it.&#8221;</p><p>Extreme Overvalued Beliefs include:</p><ul><li>The 9/11 attacks;</li><li>Unabomber (Ted Kaczynski);</li><li>Oklahoma City bombing;</li><li>Boston Marathon attack;</li><li>Dylan Roof (hate crime);</li><li>Thomas Matthew Crooks (attack on former president Trump).</li></ul><div><blockquote>The individual has an intense emotional commitment to the belief and may carry out violent behavior because of it.</blockquote></div><p>Crucial to Rahman’s discourse is the fact that the post 9/11 world set the stage for a breakthrough—the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/www.rma.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Terrorist-Radicalization-Assessment-Protocol-18-TRAP-18.pdf">Terrorism Radicalization Assessment Protocol (TRAP-18), developed by psychologist and FBI consultant Dr. J. Reid Meloy</a>. The TRAP-18 is a structured and scientifically tested approach for threat assessment that has undoubtedly saved numerous lives. Importantly, the TRAP-18 helps professionals identify potential attackers before the violence starts. Behaviors of potential assailants fall into two categories: <em>distal characteristics</em> (of which there are 10) and <em>proximal warning signs</em> (of which there are 8). Distal characteristics include personal grievances, failure to affiliate with a group (rejection from those with like beliefs), and criminal violence. Proximal warning signs include things like fixation, a sudden burst of energy in the perpetrator, or a directly communicated threat.</p><p>Oswald was not unknown to the state department and other federal agencies of 1963. If FBI and Secret Service units had access to current threat assessment tools, he might never have made it as far as his sniper’s nest in the Texas School Book Depository. To thwart potential future offenders, TRAP-18 needs to be utilized to an even greater degree, Rahman feels.</p><h2>Threat Analysis</h2><p>To do this, Rahman has created a four-part threat analysis to identify facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe that an individual is committing or is attempting to commit a criminal offense (poses a threat to self and/or others). This assessment tool takes away personal bias and instead focuses on actual behavioral signatures, in doing so avoiding profiling people based solely on their race, ethnicity, etc.</p><h2><strong>1. Threats due to psychotic delusions (fixed, false, idiosyncratic)</strong></h2><p>&#8220;My neighbor is a space alien and is trying to kill me.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Satan has instructed me to kill them.&#8221;</p><p>Commonly seen in: Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder with psychosis, Depression with psychosis, Drug-induced psychosis.</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong>&nbsp;Secure weapons with law enforcement, antipsychotic medications, emergency civil commitment to a mental health facility, case management.</p><h2><strong>2. Threats due to Extreme Overvalued Beliefs</strong></h2><p>&#8220;I am going to be a professional school shooter.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The West is at war with Islam.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Black people are replacing White people.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Intervention:</strong>&nbsp;Secure weapons with law enforcement, treat co-occurring problems (e.g. mood, anxiety, drug use), crisis response teams, unique behavioral management (e.g. family, group, and individual therapy), case management.</p><h2><strong>3. Threats due to obsessions&nbsp;(intrusive, unwanted thoughts)</strong></h2><p>Usually pose a low risk of harm to others.</p><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop thinking that I might hurt someone.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong>&nbsp;OCD medication, talk therapy, OCD foundation.</p><h2><strong>4. Threats due to addictive/behavioral issues, alcohol/drugs, paraphilias, domestic violence, or personality disorder (e.g. Psychopathy)</strong></h2><p><strong>Treatment</strong>:&nbsp;Secure weapons with law enforcement, drug rehabilitation centers, medication- assisted treatment, (family, individual, and group) therapy. Sometimes jail or prison is the only answer.</p><div><blockquote>This assessment tool takes away personal bias and instead focuses on actual behavioral signatures</blockquote></div><p>Since 2014, the U.S. has witnessed <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807638">more than 4,000 shootings</a> involving multiple victims. More often than not, mental illness or delusional thinking is blamed. But in truth, what lies beyond these facades may be as diverse as the cultures from which they spring.</p><p>Extreme Overvalued Beliefs lie at the heart of many incidents. Once that is recognized, the steps toward preventing radicalization may well be doable.</p><p><sub><em>Featured image by Dakota L. via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=44448674">Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0.</a></em></sub></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/907528112/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/907528112/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f11%2fAbugel-Feature-480x185.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/907528112/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/11/all-the-way-back-south/">&#xA0;All the way back: &#8220;South&#8221;</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/10/up-north/">Up north</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/10/self-words/">Self words</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>The University of Newcastle in Australia is investigating the work of two prominent skin cancer researchers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer have posted questions about the data in 42 papers by <a href="https://melanoma.org.au/news/team/professor-peter-hersey/">Peter Hersey</a> and <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/xu-zhang">Xu Dong Zhang</a>, both well-known in Australian melanoma research. So far, two of the papers have been retracted and four corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Newcastle’s head of research and innovation confirmed that the university has launched an investigation into both experts, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. That official has a complex history of her own: a paper of hers was retracted in 2013, leading to the return of a substantial amount of grant funding.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130342"></span>



<p>Neither Hersey, who was at Newcastle until 2010 and is now at the University of Sydney, nor Zhang, who appears to still be employed at Newcastle, has directly responded to our requests for comment. The pair have addressed a handful of the allegations on PubPeer, at times disputing the claims or attributing the issues to a research assistant, and promising to seek corrections that are mostly yet to appear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One paper, ‘<a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.15028">Selection for TRAIL resistance results in melanoma cells with high proliferative potential</a>’, published in <em>FEBS Letters</em> in 2005 and cited 23 times, was retracted in September following “concerns raised by a third party, which revealed inappropriate duplications,” according to the notice. The authors, who included both Hersey and Zhang, couldn’t provide a satisfactory explanation for the problematic images, and “given the extent of the identified issues, the editors have lost confidence in the data presented and the article&#8217;s conclusions can no longer be considered reliable.” Three months earlier, an anonymous commenter had <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/E6B521FF63EBF581A65D17BDE0EE5A#">noted several suspected duplications </a>in the paper on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second retraction also followed <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/DB4DBFD93191C1CAB0DF66C469D0AD#">a series of comments</a> on PubPeer which pointed out image similarities. ‘<a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2013.1292">Suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced invasion and migration of breast cancer cells through the downregulation of heparanase’</a>, a 2013 paper published in <em>International Journal of Molecular Medicine </em>and cited 30 times, was retracted for overlapping data and several duplications. Again the authors, including Zhang, “did not offer a satisfactory response to account for the various issues identified in these figures,” according to the <a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2021.5021">retraction notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, in response to suspected data duplication in <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/1372C203F9D70C6D2A7D0B4C78C823#">two</a> other <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/50076E593642FAD25DC31F7C64F129#">papers</a> flagged by a user in October, Hersey claimed he was unable to contact the first author in both cases, but that the papers seemed “well-supported” by other studies. In <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/0ED08D90178322B78B3CAF15C5F1AD#">another instance</a>, Hersey admitted a mislabelled error bar was “an oversight on our part”, although no correction to the paper appears to have followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2489">2013 paper</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/B9B703A4A2FD27CCC88DFCDD16F97C#">flagged for image similarities</a> in June, Zhang wrote their own “intensive investigation” found no errors in the paper, but the authors did find a microphotograph from the study was “mistakenly used” in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2012214">2013 paper</a> published in <em>Oncogene</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, in June this year, Zhang <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/4787D01AE3AA29D16892722BC37425#">thanked an anonymous commenter</a> for bringing attention to the “alarming issue” of suspected image duplication in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2013192">a 2013 paper published</a> in <em>Cell Death &amp; Disease</em>, but claimed there were no errors in the work. The authors “mistakenly used” microphotographs from the <em>Cell Death &amp; Disease </em>paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2013237">a later work published</a> in <em>Oncogene</em> in 2014, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In both instances, Zhang wrote that he would contact the journal to seek corrections “as soon as possible,” but so far neither has been corrected for those issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2014 <em>Oncogene</em> paper received a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2016144">correction</a> in 2016, after image integrity expert Elisabeth Bik found duplicated images while undertaking a <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00809-16">systematic screening</a> of biomedical research papers. According to <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/4BC544C72449A62D3F7771BCA41926#">Zhang’s post on PubPeer</a>, when the journal editors informed the authors of the issue, they “immediately” carried out an internal investigation. Zhang blamed a research assistant for “inappropriate manipulation” of the data. He wrote in the post that the assistant worked with the first author, Chen Chen Jiang, and that both himself and Jiang “did not carefully check the figure and did not note the manipulation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jiang, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle, is a frequent co-author with Hersey and Zhang on the papers flagged on PubPeer. She did not respond to our queries about the papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/1337FCB5DEECFEB640708B9E9D9E0B#">another comment</a> in June regarding suspected image duplication, Zhang wrote the authors had spotted the error years prior, but he mistakenly thought he had sent it to the journal for correction. He said he would contact the journal for a correction as soon as possible, but to date, no correction has been posted.</p>



<p>Similarly, in 2021, <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/818D62E680F9C36839352C679212BA#">Zhang agreed</a> “the images were misused” when a commenter pointed out duplicated Western blots and other rotated images. He promised to follow up with the journal for “the necessary next steps.” No correction appears to have been made on the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hersey, who had a paper <a href="https://pathsocjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/path.2082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retracted</a> in 2006 because of &#8220;substantial overlap&#8221; with an earlier article from the same authors, has not responded to our requests for comment. Zhang referred us to the university’s media office when we asked him about the suspect papers. The office responded with a statement from Juanita Todd, the pro vice-chancellor for research. </p>



<p>“The University of Newcastle is committed to the responsible and ethical conduct of research. When questions are raised about our research, we have robust processes in place to manage and investigate any research-related concerns,” Todd told us. ”We can confirm the University is currently reviewing concerns raised regarding the matter in question. However, we cannot comment until the review is complete.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Zee Upton, the deputy vice-chancellor of research and innovation at Newcastle, wrote the university is investigating both Hersey and Zhang. Upton herself has previously been in the spotlight for the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/08/29/australian-university-to-repay-275k-grant-because-of-misleading-and-incorrect-information/">return of hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> worth of government grant funding at Queensland University of Technology in 2014, where she then worked, after a graduate student spotted errors in her <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128657/">now-retracted paper</a> on stem cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email response to our questions about how her past might inform her work now, Upton demurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am fully focussed on my current role, working to build and enhance research and innovation capacity at the University of Newcastle, to deliver on our strategic goals and serve our community,” she wrote.</p>



<p>“I do not intend to comment further on the work associated with my time at a previous institution, which was fully assessed at the time and in the public domain.”</p>

                <p>Submissions to arXiv continue to grow! arXiv has tracked the number of new submissions we receive every month from our very first submission all the way back in August 1991. We share our monthly submission data on our <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">stats page</a> (which houses lots of interesting break downs of the data).</p>
<p>In the month of October of 2024, there were a total of 24,226 new submissions to arXiv, beating the previous monthly record from July 2024 of 21,794 new submissions. October has historically been a heavy submission month for arXiv &#8211; in October of 2023, there were a total of 20,710 new submissions to arXiv. The very first time arXiv monthly broke the 20,000 marker for number of submissions received in a single month was May 2023.</p>
<p>This brings arXiv&#8217;s overall total submission count, from August 1991 to the end of October 2024, to 2,597,322!</p>
<p>Of arXiv&#8217;s 9 scientific subject areas covered, the subject area with the most submissions in October 2024 was computer science. Within that subject area, the top categories within Computer Science during the month of October 2024 were cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) which alone accounted for over 6,000 new submissions to arXiv this past month.</p>
<p>For those that want to dive into the data, visit <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">https://arxiv.org/stats/main</a>. There you can find arXiv&#8217;s hourly usage rates, monthly submissions, monthly downloads, submissions by subject, and more.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the arXiv users who are taking their research, ideas, and hard work and sharing them openly on arXiv!</p>

<p>A controversial rocket scientist in India earned his fourth retraction in October after an investigation at a physics journal found a core part of his work was “inaccurate and paradoxical.”</p>



<p>At issue is a highly technical concept developed by V.R. Sanal Kumar, a professor of aerospace engineering at Amity University in New Delhi. Other scientists have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/24/controversial-rocket-scientist-in-india-threatens-legal-action-after-journals-pull-papers/">denounced the concept</a>, which Kumar has dubbed “Sanal flow choking,” as “absolute nonsense,” as we reported in April.</p>



<p>The editors of <em>AIP Advances</em> appear to agree. An <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/14/10/109901/3316040/Retraction-A-closed-form-analytical-model-for">October 9 notice</a> announcing the retraction of “<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/8/2/025315/569923/A-closed-form-analytical-model-for-predicting-3D">A closed-form analytical model for predicting 3D boundary layer displacement thickness for the validation of viscous flow solvers</a>” stated:</p>



<span id="more-130323"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, questions were raised regarding the soundness of the analytical model presented in the manuscript. Upon further investigation, the Editors of AIP Advances concluded that the model is flawed. The investigation revealed that the core model is inaccurate and paradoxical because it falsely ignores entropy increases in choked flows and combines two incompatible theories. The verification presented is also invalid due to the conflict between the premise and objective of the approach. As a result of these issues, the Editors no longer have confidence in the results reported in the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 12 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Kumar earned his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36260-8">first retraction</a> last year, in Springer Nature’s <em>Scientific Reports</em>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202470083">two</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202470082">more</a> followed in March in Wiley’s <em>Global Challenges</em>.</p>



<p>The researcher claims his ideas represent a “paradigm shift” and have applications in a wide range of fields and diseases. He has threatened legal action against editors and publishers for pulling his work, which he asserts could help protect “millions of lives,” as we reported earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar also opposes the latest retraction, according to the notice, but did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>



<p>For our previous story, we contacted the editors of two AIP Publishing<em> </em>titles – <em>AIP Advances</em> and <em>Physics of Fluids</em> – that had published Kumar’s work. The publisher told us it would review our request “and the related material and comments.”</p>



<p>We also quoted <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/people/n.ganesh">Ganesh Natarajan</a> of the Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad, who found it worrisome AIP Publishing hadn’t “really bothered to consider” complaints he had sent about Kumar’s papers.</p>



<p>In August, Natarajan told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[Kumar’s] group continues to strongly publish based on this flawed idea in non peer-reviewed conferences (see for instance <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-4598">https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-4598</a>, but there are a couple of other works in the same conference as well as the LinkedIn post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7225742187144052736/">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7225742187144052736/</a>). The AIP Publishing team did contact me and informed me that they are looking into the matter following your story on RW, but it has been three months since then but there are no proactive actions or updates from them. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the October retraction in <em>AIP Advances</em>, Natarajan said the publisher had told him “the concerns on the Phys Fluids works are also being taken up with the Editors. I hope to see those papers retracted too.”</p>



<p>We asked <em>AIP Publishing</em> for an update about <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/search-results?page=1&amp;q=%22V.%20R.%20Sanal%20Kumar%22&amp;fl_SiteID=1000037">the three papers</a> Kumar and his colleagues have published in <em>Physics of Fluids</em>. Wendy Beatty, director of content experience, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We appreciate the whistleblower bringing this to our attention &#8212; AIP Publishing is taking the matter seriously. The publisher is reviewing this issue and the related materials in accordance with our policies. We will follow up with you when there is an update on our end.</p>

<p>An article estimating how many people might have died during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitals was retracted in August after advocates for the drug launched a campaign criticizing the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.leprogres.fr/sante/2024/09/03/hydroxychloroquine-et-covid-pourquoi-l-etude-lyonnaise-a-t-elle-ete-depubliee">French</a> media have reported <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/sciences-sante/sante/retraction-dune-etude-sur-lhydroxychloroquine-intimidations-reseau-pro-raoult-et-proces-en-heresie-EGAAO4OQUFGOFGJIKSEQMR27VQ/">criticism</a> of the retraction as <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2024/09/10/covid-19-the-controversy-over-deaths-linked-to-hydroxychloroquine-reignites_6725428_10.html#">inappropriate</a>, and <a href="https://www.msn.com/fr-fr/sante/other/d%C3%A9c%C3%A8s-li%C3%A9s-%C3%A0-l-hydroxychloroquine-un-article-retir%C3%A9-sous-la-pression/ar-AA1qc1Mj">speculation</a> the journal caved to pressure from hydroxychloroquine advocates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to Retraction Watch, the journal stood by its decision to retract the article due to “some clear fatal flaws” identified in letters to the editor, which it said it declined to publish due to their tone it deemed “not suitable for publication in a scientific journal.”</p>



<span id="more-130306"></span>



<p>The editor in chief’s decision “was based solely on scientific considerations, and the process was in line with Committee on Publication Ethics best practices,” a spokesperson for the publisher said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Correspondence between the journal and authors of the paper obtained by Retraction Watch, including the critical letters to the editor and authors’ responses, shed some light on the specific arguments the editor considered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222301853X">Deaths induced by compassionate use of hydroxychloroquine during the first COVID-19 wave: An estimate</a>,” appeared online January 2 in the journal <em>Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy</em>, an Elsevier title. It has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors, led by Jean-Christophe Lega of Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud in France, estimated 17,000 deaths related to hydroxychloroquine may have occurred in Belgium, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, and the US, with a range from about 6,300 to 19,300.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although our estimates are limited by their imprecision, these findings illustrate the hazard of drug repurposing with low-level evidence,” the authors concluded.</p>



<p>As has been the case with hydroxychloroquine, the findings made international headlines. Then, the criticism began, in online articles, videos and blog posts, letters to the journal editor, and emails to Lega and the president of the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, where he is a professor. The university got so many emails, many of which accused Lega of fraud and questioned his integrity, the institution formally reported them to the public prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 15, an Elsevier employee named Adam Fraser emailed Lega on behalf of the journal editor, Danyelle Townsend of the University of South Carolina in Charleston. The email acknowledged receiving a request from Lega to correct the article, and mentioned a “readers’ debate” about the paper. The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal has received a number of Letters to the Editor which are being assessed and, if they are accepted, you will be given a right to reply, prior to publication, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines and journal policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal on January 28 published an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224000647">editor’s note</a>, which has since been updated, about the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 1, Fraser, whose title is executive publisher for pharmacology, sent another email on behalf of Townsend with eight letters to the editor for Lega and his colleagues to consider for a response. But by that time, Townsend had decided to handle the matter differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After assessing all the information, and the extent and depth of the criticism, I have made the decision to change approach and handle this matter through the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) process for corrections to the scientific record,” she wrote. The substance of the complaints in the letters, “if true, would violate our publishing policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An update to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224000647">editor’s note</a> on the article echoed Townsend’s email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Townsend for comment on the change of tack and received the following statement from an Elsevier spokesperson:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal assessed the letters to the editor received and had them independently peer reviewed by an expert reviewer, who submitted their opinion to the journal.</p>



<p>The initial plan, as published in an earlier version of the Editor’s Note, was to publish these Letters to the editor, after the Authors of the above article had been given the right to reply and submit a response (which would also be published, after review). After assessing all letters to the editor (which came from a wide range of geographies and persons) and the review of the letters to the editor, the editor decided to change approach. The criticisms were too extensive to be addressed by a corrigendum, and some clear fatal flaws/ key errors were identified by some of the letters and the review.&nbsp; The tone of some of the letters was not suitable for publication in a scientific journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On July 4, Lega sent the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00222.pdf">responses</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00276.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00452.pdf">each</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00544.pdf">of</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00627.pdf">the</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00681-1.pdf">letters</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00681.pdf">on</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00992.pdf">behalf</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_general_comment.pdf">of</a> all the authors. In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cover_Letter.pdf">cover letter</a>, Lega wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The only letter that holds our attention is that of Viera et al. (BIOPHA-D-24-00992), which presents well-constructed and factual arguments (use of risk ratio, adjusted mortality rate) for a better estimation of the excess mortality related to the prescription of HCQ. The calculations lead to estimates of the same order of magnitude as those produced by our study.</p>



<p>However, this does not qualitatively challenge our results, as written by the authors of the letter. The authors mistakenly used a treatment effect combining hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from a network meta-analysis for their estimates, which is not the purpose of our study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One group of authors engaged a lawyer to pressure <em>Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy</em> to publish their letter, according to a <a href="https://bonsens.info/mise-en-demeure-par-voie-davocat-a-leditrice-en-chef-du-journal-ayant-publie-letude-estimant-des-milliers-de-deces-dus-a-lhydroxychloroquine/">copy</a> posted to the website of BonSens.org, a French organization that has since <a href="https://bonsens.info/bonsens-soutient-la-science-et-la-medecine/">taken partial credit</a> for the retraction. The authors <a href="https://www.fortunejournals.com/articles/erroneous-assessment-of-the-effect-of-hospital-treatment-ndash-the-misleading-creation-of-17000-deaths-and-its-consequences-for-go.html">published</a> their letter July 30 in the <em>Archives of Microbiology &amp; Immunology</em>, a title of Fortune Journals<em>.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Fraser emailed Lega and his coauthors August 9 with Townsend’s decision to retract the article, and asked them to respond within five days. The email included a proposed retraction notice with the reasons for the decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, the Journal was made aware of readers’ debate about this article. The Journal received a number of Letters to the Editor and correspondence from readers. The plan, as published in an early version of an Editor’s Note, was initially to publish these Letters to the Editor, after the Authors of the above article had been given the right to reply and submit a response (which would also be published, after review).</p>



<p>After assessing all the information at this stage, and the extent and depth of the criticism, the Editor-in-Chief made the decision to change approach and handle this matter through the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) process for corrections to the scientific record: <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">https://publicationethics.org/</a></p>



<p>Upon completion of this process, and following careful consideration of all available information, this article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief.</p>



<p>The decision to retract was made due to two major issues:</p>



<p>Reliability of the data and choice of the data. The Belgian dataset in particular was found to be unreliable, based on estimates.</p>



<p>The assumption that all patients that entered the clinic were being treated the same pharmacologically was incorrect.</p>



<p>The above two issues meant that the Editor-in-Chief found the conclusions of the article to be unreliable, and needed to be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega responded on behalf of the authors on August 19, disputing the retraction and asserting the value of their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We transparently emphasized throughout the manuscript that these were approximations with large confidence intervals given the significant uncertainties surrounding several parameters,” he wrote. The authors were aware of the limited data for Belgium, but “addressed and fully acknowledged” the limitation in the article. “We also specifically varied the parameters to generate uncertainty by taking the minimum and maximum values of exposure to hydroxychloroquine.”</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We understand that science can bring controversies, especially in the context of COVID-19, which has generated polarized debate. However, as provided in our point-by-point response, we truly believe that the validity of the arguments raised by the few readers who questioned the validity of the results were largely unfounded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega proposed publishing a correction or “response from the authors” to address the issues in the retraction notice. He also sent an email to Sarah Jenkins, senior director for the Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise at Elsevier, asking for “your input on the ongoing retraction process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jenkins’ reply, dated August 22, restated Townsend’s decision. “Within the Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise, we uphold the independence of our Editors-in-Chief in these matters,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224012381">notice</a>, dated August 26, largely matched the proposed language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After seeing the notice, Lega wrote to Jenkins:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am saddened that our responses are not commented on more by the editorial board. The comments we received were from non-experts in the field of pharmacology and modelling, with activity on social networks aggressively questioning the scientific basis and the scientists. I would therefore have liked to understand better how they were assessed by the journal.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in order to prevent the resumption of the campaign of harassment, I would appreciate it if the journal would indicate that the accusations of fraud and falsification have not been sustained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 29, after some back-and-forth, Fraser emailed the authors on behalf of Townsend, stating:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[She] has considered your response to the retraction notice, but does not feel this changes her decision to retract the article, and thus does not require any changes to the existing text. </p>



<p>She does not also believe it would be advantageous to publish letters to the editor and responses as the key information for the community is contained within the retraction notice, particularly once the drafted update is published. As noted this update will make it clear that you disagree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it, and make it clear that there was no evidence of fraud.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update, dated September 2024, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal wishes to clarify that at no point did the investigation find evidence of fraud in the article, and instead believe it was honest error on the part of the authors.</p>



<p>The authors were responsive to the Journal’s correspondence and engaged with the process throughout. The authors do not agree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega and his colleagues are working to revise the article and resubmit it to another journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I deeply regret, as do the co-authors, the lack of transparency for the scientific community in the process that led to the retraction, despite the respect I have for the Editor,” Lega told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he wrote in an email to Townsend regarding the update to the retraction notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We deeply regret the lack of communication from the Journal about the reasons and the context for the retraction. Scientists and the media are once again under pressure from French conspiracy groups, who support the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19.
