              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-early-primates-lived-swampy-arctic">Fossils suggest early primates lived in a once-swampy Arctic</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Arctic today is a hostile place for most primates. But a series of fossils found since the 1970s suggest that wasn’t always the case.</p>



<p>Dozens of fossilized teeth and jaw bones unearthed in northern Canada <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">belonged to two species of early primates</a> — or at least close relatives of primates — that lived in the Arctic around 52 million years ago, researchers report January 25 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. These remains are the first primate-like fossils ever discovered in the Arctic and tell of a groundhog-sized animal that may have skittered across trees in a swamp that once existed above the Arctic Circle. &nbsp;</p>





<p>The Arctic was significantly warmer during that time. But creatures still had to adapt to extreme conditions such as long winter months without sunlight. These challenges make the presence of primate-like creatures in the Arctic “incredibly surprising,” says coauthor Chris Beard, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. “No other primate or primate relative has ever been found this far north so far.”</p>



<p>Between frigid temperatures, limited plant growth and months of perpetual darkness, living in the modern Arctic isn’t easy. This is especially true for primates, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-sheds-light-early-primates">which evolved from small, tree-dwelling creatures</a> that largely fed on fruit (<em>SN: 6/5/13</em>). To this day, most primates — humans and few other outliers like Japan’s snow monkeys excepted — tend to stick to tropical and subtropical forests, largely found around the equator.</p>



<p>But these forests haven’t always been confined to their present location. During the early Eocene Epoch, which started around 56 million years ago, the planet underwent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eocene-temperature-spike-caused-half-much-co2-once-thought">a period of intense warming</a> that allowed forests and their warm-loving residents to expand northward (<em>SN: 11/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know about this early Arctic climate in part because of decades of paleontological work on Ellesmere Island in northern Canada. These digs revealed that the area was once dominated by swamps not unlike those found in the southeastern United States today. This ancient, warm, wet Arctic environment was home to a wide array of heat-loving animals, including giant tapirs and crocodile relatives.</p>

<p>For the new study, Beard and his colleagues examined dozens of teeth and jawbone fossils found in the area, concluding that they belong to two species, <em>Ignacius mckennai </em>and <em>Ignacius dawsonae</em>. These two species belonged to a now-extinct genus of small mammals that was widespread across North America during the Eocene. The Arctic variants probably made their way north as the planet warmed, taking advantage of the new habitat opening up near the poles.</p>



<p>Scientists have long debated whether this lineage can be considered true primates or whether they were simply close relatives. Regardless, it’s still “really weird and unexpected” to find primates or their relatives in the area, says Mary Silcox, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Toronto Scarborough.</p>





<p>For one thing, Ellesmere Island was already north of the Arctic Circle 52 million years ago. So while conditions may have been warmer and wetter, the swamp was plunged into continuous darkness during the winter months.</p>



<p>Newly arrived <em>Ignacius</em> would have had to adapt to these conditions. Unlike their southern kin, the Arctic <em>Ignacius </em>had unusually strong jaws and teeth suited to eating hard foods, the researchers found. This may have helped these early primates feed on nuts and seeds over the winter, when fruit wasn’t as readily available.</p>



<p>This research can shed light on how animals can adapt to live in extreme conditions. “Ellesmere Island is arguably the best deep time analog for a mild, ice-free Arctic,” says Jaelyn Eberle, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Studying how plants and animals adapted to this remarkable period in Arctic history, Beard says, could offer clues to the Arctic’s future residents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-shape-shifting-gallium-melt-reform-magnetic-fields">These shape-shifting devices melt and re-form thanks to magnetic fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shape-shifting liquid metal robots might not be limited to science fiction anymore.</p>



<p>Miniature machines can <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2022.12.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch from solid to liquid and back again</a> to squeeze into tight spaces and perform tasks like soldering a circuit board, researchers report January 25 in <em>Matter</em>.</p>



<p>This phase-shifting property, which can be controlled remotely with a magnetic field, is thanks to the metal gallium. Researchers embedded the metal with magnetic particles<a></a> to direct the metal’s movements with magnets<em>. </em>This new material could help scientists develop soft, flexible robots that can shimmy through narrow passages and be guided externally. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists have been developing magnetically controlled soft robots for years. Most existing materials for these bots are made of either stretchy but solid materials, which can’t pass through the narrowest of spaces, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permanent-liquid-magnets-have-now-been-created-lab">magnetic liquids</a>, which are fluid but unable to carry heavy objects (<em>SN: 7/18/19</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, researchers blended both approaches after finding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean">inspiration from nature</a> (<em>SN: 3/3/21</em>). Sea cucumbers, for instance, “can very rapidly and reversibly change their stiffness,” says mechanical engineer Carmel Majidi of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “The challenge for us as engineers is to mimic that in the soft materials systems.”</p>



<p>So the team turned to gallium, a metal that melts at about 30° Celsius — slightly above room temperature. Rather than connecting a heater to a chunk of the metal to change its state, the researchers expose it to a rapidly changing magnetic field to liquefy it. The alternating magnetic field generates electricity within the gallium, causing it to heat up and melt. The material resolidifies when left to cool to room temperature.</p>



<p>Since magnetic particles are sprinkled throughout the gallium, a permanent magnet can drag it around. In solid form, a magnet can move the material at a speed of about 1.5 meters per second. The upgraded gallium can also carry about 10,000 times its weight.</p>



<p>External magnets can still manipulate the liquid form, making it stretch, split and merge. But controlling the fluid’s movement is more challenging, because the particles in the gallium can freely rotate and have unaligned magnetic poles as a result of melting. Because of their various orientations, the particles move in different directions in response to a magnet.</p>



<p>Majidi and colleagues tested their strategy in tiny machines that performed different tasks. In a demonstration straight out of the movie <em>Terminator 2</em>, a toy person escaped a jail cell by melting through the bars and resolidifying in its original form using a mold placed just outside the bars.</p>





<p>On the more practical side, one machine removed a small ball from a model human stomach by melting slightly to wrap itself around the foreign object before exiting the organ. But gallium on its own would turn to goo inside a real human body, since the metal is a liquid at body temperature, about 37° C. A few more metals, such as bismuth and tin, would be added to the gallium in biomedical applications to raise the material’s melting point, the authors say. In another demonstration, the material liquefied and rehardened to solder a circuit board.</p>

In the second clip, one device removes a ball from a model human stomach by melting slightly to wrap itself around the foreign object and exiting the organ.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although this phase-shifting material is a big step in the field, questions remain about its biomedical applications, says biomedical engineer Amir Jafari of the University of North Texas in Denton, who was not involved in the work. One big challenge, he says, is precisely controlling magnetic forces inside the human body that are generated from an external device.</p>



<p>“It’s a compelling tool,” says robotics engineer Nicholas Bira of Harvard University, who was also not involved in the study. But, he adds, scientists who study soft robotics are constantly creating new materials.</p>



<p>“The true innovation to come lies in combining these different innovative materials.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Yar Muhammad will talk about some of his work in a presentation entitled &quot;Brain-Computer Interface &amp; their Applications, Challenges, Future &amp; Our research contributions&quot;.
The abstract of the presentation could be found below, together with supporting papers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>An electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain–computer interface (BCI) is a
system that provides a pathway between the brain and external devices by
interpreting EEG. EEG-based BCI applications have initially been developed for
medical purposes, with the aim of facilitating the return of patients to normal
life. In addition to the initial aim, EEG-based BCI applications have also
gained increasing significance in the non-medical domain, improving the life of
healthy people, for instance, by making it more efficient, and collaborative
and helping them develop themselves.</p>
<p>There are many challenges in EEG-based BCI development and research as the
cross-subject classification of motor imagery data. Due to the highly
individualized nature of EEG signals, it has been difficult to develop a
cross-subject classification method that achieves sufficiently high accuracy
when predicting the subject’s intention. In 2020, we proposed a multi-branch 2D
convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes different hyperparameter
values for each branch and is more flexible to data from different subjects.
Our model, EEGNet Fusion, achieves 84.1% and 83.8% accuracy when tested on the
103-subject eegmmidb dataset for executed and imagined motor actions,
respectively. The model achieved statistically significantly higher results
compared with three state-of-the-art CNN classifiers: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
and DeepConvNet. However, the computational cost of the proposed model is up to
four times higher than the model with the lowest computational cost used for
comparison.</p>
<p>In our recent studies, we improve the model with a 5-branches 2D CNN that
employs several hyperparameters for every branch and this network is more
adaptable to data from various subjects. The proposed model achieved promising
results on three publicly available datasets, the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery,
the BCI Competition IV 2a, and the BCI Competition IV 2b dataset. The eegmmidb
dataset is used for testing for actual and imagined motor activity and our
newly proposed model, EEGNet Fusion V2, achieves 89.6% and 87.8% accuracy,
respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, the proposed model outperforms on the BCI Competition IV-2a and 2b
datasets with an accuracy of 74.3% and 84.1% for the cross-subject
classifications, respectively. Compared with the EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
DeepConvNet, and EEGNet Fusion, the proposed model’s accuracy is higher.
However, the proposed model has a bit higher computational cost, i.e., it takes
around 3.5 times more computational time per sample than the EEGNet Fusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/procrastination-harm-fix-resolution">Procrastination may harm your health. Here’s what you can do</a></h4>

              
                <p>The worst procrastinators probably won’t be able to read this story. It’ll remind them of what they’re trying to avoid, psychologist Piers Steel says.</p>



<p>Maybe they’re dragging their feet going to the gym. Maybe they haven’t gotten around to their New Year’s resolutions. Maybe they’re waiting just one more day to study for that test.</p>



<p>Procrastination is “putting off to later what you know you should be doing now,” even if you’ll be worse off, says Steel, of the University of Calgary in Canada. But all those tasks pushed to tomorrow seem to wedge themselves into the mind — and it may be harming people’s health.</p>





<p>In a study of thousands of university students, scientists <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked procrastination to a panoply of poor outcomes</a>, including depression, anxiety and even disabling arm pain. “I was surprised when I saw that one,” says Fred Johansson, a clinical psychologist at Sophiahemmet University in Stockholm. His team reported the results January 4 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>The study is one of the largest yet to tackle procrastination’s ties to health. Its results echo findings from earlier studies that have gone largely ignored, says Fuschia Sirois, a behavioral scientist at Durham University in England, who was not involved with the new research.</p>



<p>For years, scientists didn’t seem to view procrastination as something serious, she says. The new study could change that. “It’s that kind of big splash that’s … going to get attention,” Sirois says. “I’m hoping that it will raise awareness of the physical health consequences of procrastination.”</p>



<h4>Procrastinating may be bad for the mind and body</h4>



<p>Whether procrastination harms health can seem like a chicken-and-egg situation.</p>



<p>It can be hard to tell if certain health problems make people more likely to procrastinate — or the other way around, Johansson says. (It may be a bit of both.) And controlled experiments on procrastination aren’t easy to do: You can’t just tell a study participant to become a procrastinator and wait and see if their health changes, he says.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>The perils of procrastinating</h3>



<p>In a new study, researchers have tied procrastination to a range of potential health issues and other negative outcomes, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Depression</li>



<li>Anxiety</li>



<li>Stress</li>



<li>Disabling arm pain</li>



<li>Poor sleep quality</li>



<li>Physical inactivity</li>



<li>Loneliness</li>



<li>Economic difficulties</li>
</ul>

</div>



<p>Many previous studies have relied on self-reported surveys taken at a single time point. But a snapshot of someone makes it tricky to untangle cause and effect. Instead, in the new study, about 3,500 students were followed over nine months, so researchers could track whether procrastinating students later developed health issues.</p>



<p>On average, these students tended to fare worse over time than their prompter peers. They were slightly more stressed, anxious, depressed and sleep-deprived, among other issues, Johansson and colleagues found. “People who score higher on procrastination to begin with … are at greater risk of developing both physical and psychological problems later on,” says study coauthor Alexander Rozental, a clinical psychologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. “There is a relationship between procrastination at one time point and having these negative outcomes at the later point.”<s></s></p>



<p>The study was observational, so the team can’t say for sure that procrastination causes poor health. But results from other researchers also seem to point in this direction.

<p>Stress may be to blame for procrastination’s ill effects, data from Sirois’ lab and other studies suggest. She thinks that the effects of chronic procrastinating could build up over time. And though procrastination alone may not cause disease, Sirois says, it could be “one extra factor that can tip the scales.”</p>



<h4>No, procrastinators are not lazy</h4>



<p>Some 20 percent of adults are estimated to be chronic procrastinators. Everyone might put off a task or two, but chronic procrastinators make it their lifestyle, says Joseph Ferrari, a psychologist at DePaul University in Chicago, who has been studying procrastination for decades. “They do it at home, at school, at work and in their relationships.” These are the people, he says, who “you know are going to RSVP late.”</p>



<p>Though procrastinators may think they perform better under pressure, Ferrari has reported the opposite. They actually <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked more slowly and made more errors</a> than non-procrastinators, his experiments have shown. And when deadlines are slippery, procrastinators tend to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.783789/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let their work slide</a>, Steel’s team reported last year in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, researchers have focused on the personalities of people who procrastinate. Findings vary, but some scientists suggest procrastinators may be impulsive, worriers and have trouble regulating their emotions. One thing procrastinators are not, Ferrari emphasizes, is lazy. They’re actually “very busy doing other things than what they’re supposed to be doing,” he says.</p>



<p>In fact, Rozental adds, most research today suggests procrastination is a behavioral pattern.</p>



<p>And if procrastination is a behavior, he says, that means it’s something you can change, regardless of whether you’re impulsive.</p>



<h4>Why procrastinators should be kind to themselves</h4>



<p>When people put off a tough task, they feel good — in the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p><em>“You made a mistake and procrastinated. It’s not the end of the world…. What can you do to move forward?</em>&#8220;</p><cite>Behavioral scientist Fuschia Sirois, Durham University</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Procrastinating is a way to sidestep the negative emotions linked to the task, Sirois says. “We’re sort of hardwired to avoid anything painful or difficult,” she says. “When you procrastinate, you get immediate relief.” A backdrop of stressful circumstances — say, a worldwide pandemic — can strain people’s ability to cope, making procrastinating even easier. But the relief it provides is only temporary, and many seek out ways to stop dawdling.</p>



<p>Researchers have experimented with procrastination treatments that run the gamut from the logistical to the psychological. What works best is still under investigation. Some scientists have reported success with time-management interventions. But the evidence for that “is all over the map,” Sirois says. That’s because “poor time management is a symptom not a cause of procrastination,” she adds.</p>



<p>For some procrastinators, seemingly obvious tips can work. In his clinical practice, Rozental advises students to simply put down their smartphones. Silencing notifications or studying in the library rather than at home can quash distractions and keep people on task. But that won’t be enough for many people, he says.</p>



<p>Hard-core procrastinators may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy. In a 2018 <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01588/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of procrastination treatments</a>, Rozental found that this type of therapy, which involves managing thoughts and emotions and trying to change behavior, seemed to be the most helpful. Still, not many studies have examined treatments, and there’s room for improvement, he says.</p>



<p>Sirois also favors an emotion-centered approach. Procrastinators can fall into a shame spiral where they feel uneasy about a task, put the task off, feel ashamed for putting it off and then feel even worse than when they started. People need to short-circuit that loop, she says. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-018-9926-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Self-forgiveness may help</a>, scientists suggested in one 2020 study. So could mindfulness training.</p>



<p>In a small trial of university students, eight weekly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608022001315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness sessions reduced procrastination</a>, Sirois and colleagues reported in the January <em>Learning and Individual Differences</em>. Students practiced focusing on the body, meditating during unpleasant activities and discussed the best way to take care of themselves. A little self-compassion may snap people out of their spiral, Sirois says.</p>



<p>“You made a mistake and procrastinated. It’s not the end of the world,” she says. “What can you do to move forward?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tatooine-planets-binary-stars-life-space">Lots of Tatooine-like planets around binary stars may be habitable</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SEATTLE</strong> — Luke Skywalker’s home planet in <em>Star Wars</em> is the stuff of science fiction. But Tatooine-like planets in orbit around pairs of stars might be our best bet in the search for habitable planets beyond our solar system.</p>



<p>Many stars in the universe come in pairs. And lots of those should have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">planets orbiting them</a> (<em>SN: 10/25/21</em>). That means there could be many more planets orbiting around binaries than around solitary stars like ours. But until now, no one had a clear idea about whether those planets’ environments could be conducive to life. New computer simulations suggest that, in many cases, life could imitate art.</p>





<p>Earthlike planets orbiting some configurations of binary stars can <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS241/Itinerary/PresentationDetail.aspx?evdid=1523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay in stable orbits for at least a billion years</a>, researchers reported January 11 at the American Astronomical Society meeting. That sort of stability, the researchers propose, would be enough to potentially allow life to develop, provided the planets aren’t too hot or cold.</p>



<p>Of the planets that stuck around, about 15 percent stayed in their habitable zone — a temperate region around their stars where water could stay liquid — most or even all of the time.</p>



<p>The researchers ran simulations of 4,000 configurations of binary stars, each with an Earthlike planet in orbit around them. The team varied things like the relative masses of the stars, the sizes and shapes of the stars’ orbits around each other, and the size of the planet’s orbit around the binary pair.</p>



<p>The scientists then tracked the motion of the planets for up to a billion years of simulated time to see if the planets would stay in orbit over the sorts of timescales that might allow life to emerge.</p>



<p>A planet orbiting binary stars can get kicked out of the star system due to complicated interactions between the planet and stars. In the new study, the researchers found that, for planets with large orbits around star pairs, only about 1 out of 8 were kicked out of the system. The rest were stable enough to continue to orbit for the full billion years. About 1 in 10 settled in their habitable zones and stayed there.</p>



<p>Of the 4,000 planets that the team simulated, roughly 500 maintained stable orbits that kept them in their habitable zones at least 80 percent of the time.</p>



<p>“The habitable zone . . . as I’ve characterized it so far, spans from freezing to boiling,” said Michael Pedowitz, an undergraduate student at the College of New Jersey in Ewing who presented the research. Their definition is overly strict, he said, because they chose to model Earthlike planets without atmospheres or oceans. That’s simpler to simulate, but it also allows temperatures to fluctuate wildly on a planet as it orbits.</p>





<p>“An atmosphere and oceans would smooth over temperature variations fairly well,” says study coauthor Mariah MacDonald, an astrobiologist also at the College of New Jersey. An abundance of air and water would potentially allow a planet to maintain habitable conditions, even if it spent more of its time outside of the nominal habitable zone around a binary star system.</p>



<p>The number of potentially habitable planets “will increase once we add atmospheres,” MacDonald says, “but I can&#8217;t yet say by how much.”</p>



<p>She and Pedowitz hope to build more sophisticated models in the coming months, as well as extend their simulations beyond a billion years and include changes in the stars that can affect conditions in a solar system as it ages.</p>



<p>The possibility of stable and habitable planets in binary star systems is a timely issue says Penn State astrophysicist Jason Wright, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“At the time <em>Star Wars</em> came out,” he says, “we didn’t know of any planets outside the solar system, and wouldn’t for 15 years. Now we know that there are many and that they orbit these binary stars.”</p>



<p>These simulations of planets orbiting binaries could serve as a guide for future experiments, Wright says. “This is an under-explored population of planets. There’s no reason we can’t go after them, and studies like this are presumably showing us that it’s worthwhile to try.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-trex-reveal-dinosaurs-fossil-paleontology">A bird with a T. rex head may help reveal how dinosaurs became birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 120-million-year-old fossil bird found in China could offer some new clues about how landbound dinosaurs evolved into today’s flying birds. The dove-sized <em>Cratonavis zhui</em> sported a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01921-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dinosaur-like head atop a body similar to those of today’s birds</a>, researchers report in the January <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>The flattened specimen came from the Jiufotang Formation, an ancient body of rock in northeastern China that is a hotbed for preserved feathered dinosaurs and archaic birds. CT scans revealed that <em>Cratonavis</em> had a skull that was nearly identical (albeit smaller) as those of theropod dinosaurs like <em>Tyrannosaurus rex, </em>paleontologist Li Zhiheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues report. This means that <em>Cratonavis</em> still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-fowl-bit-dinosaur-and-pecked-bird">hadn’t evolved the mobile upper jaw found in modern birds</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/18</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="346" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_at_thero-bird_inline1.jpg" alt="A digital reconstruction from CT scans shows the flattened Cratonavis specimen." class="wp-image-3121197" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_at_thero-bird_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_at_thero-bird_inline1-330x168.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121197">Researchers used CT scans to digitally reconstruct the flattened <em>Cratonavis</em> specimen (shown). The scans revealed that the creature had a theropod’s head and a bird’s body.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121197">Wang Min</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s among just a handful of specimens that belong to a recently identified group of intermediate birds known as the jinguofortisids, says Luis Chiappe, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County who was not involved in the study. Its dino-bird mishmash “is not unexpected.” Most birds discovered from the Age of Dinosaurs exhibited more primitive, toothed heads than today’s birds, he says. But the new find “builds on our understanding of this primitive group of birds that are at the base of the tree of birds.”</p>



<p><em>Cratonavis </em>also had an unusually elongated scapula and hallux, or backward-facing toe. Rarely seen in Cretaceous birds, enlarged shoulder blades might have compensated for the bird’s otherwise underwhelming flight mechanics, the researchers say. And that hefty big toe? It bucks the trend of shrinking metatarsals seen as birds continued to evolve. <em>Cratonavis</em> might have used this impressive digit to hunt like today’s birds of prey, Li’s team says.</p>



<p>Filling those shoes may have been too big of a job for <em>Cratonavis</em>, though. Given its size, Chiappe says, the dino-headed bird would have most likely been a petite hunter, taking down the likes of beetles, grasshoppers and the occasional lizard rather than terrorizing the skies.</p>

<p>A key paper linking use of talc-based baby powder to cancer contains fraudulent information, according to a <a href="https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/J_and_J_subsidiary_accuses_expert_of_falsifying_talc_report/205736">new complaint</a> against an author of the article who has testified on behalf of plaintiffs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A judge had previously allowed the release of a document confirming the identity of one of the patients in the article, who had claimed exposure to asbestos besides in baby powder, contrary to the authors’ claim that the cases in the series had no other exposures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2020/01000/Mesothelioma_Associated_With_the_Use_of_Cosmetic.3.aspx">Mesothelioma Associated With the Use of Cosmetic Talc</a>,” was published in the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em> in January 2020. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Corresponding author Jacqueline Moline of Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., has also referenced the article in expert testimony for plaintiffs in talc litigation, as well as in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110311/witnesses/HHRG-116-GO05-Wstate-MolineJ-20191210.pdf">remarks before Congress</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126445"></span>



<p>The abstract of the paper states that its objective is “to describe 33 cases of malignant mesothelioma among individuals with no known asbestos exposure other than cosmetic talcum powder.”</p>



<p>The authors further wrote that their article “is the first to describe mesothelioma among talcum powder consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But some patients described in the publication had other exposures to asbestos, lawyers for LTL Management, a <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/bankruptcyroundtable/tag/ltl-management/">recently-formed subsidiary</a> of Johnson &amp; Johnson that holds liability for cosmetic talc litigation, argue in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022.12.16-Moline-Complaint.docx.pdf">complaint against Moline</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the course of other cosmetic talc litigation, Northwell Health confirmed the identity of one of the patients in the study, whom Moline had described in her Congressional testimony. The patient had claimed worker’s compensation for asbestos exposure at a textile plant, apart from her exposure to cosmetic talc as a hairdresser. A judge <a href="https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/399/90071/Talc-expert-complaint-NC-order.pdf">ordered in December</a> that the document Northwell provided to confirm the patient’s identity could be released and used in other litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stacieann Yuhasz, the managing editor of the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em>, told Retraction Watch that the journal “has received a letter to the editor regarding the Moline publication, and Dr. Moline has notified JOEM that a response will be submitted late January.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Northwell informed us that Moline would not comment, “pending ongoing litigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed Paul DeFilippo of the New York City firm Wollmuth, Maher, &amp; Deutsch and Allison Brown of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, also based in New York City, the lawyers who filed the complaint on behalf of LTL Management, but did not hear back.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-sea-spiders-regrow-rear-ends">Some young sea spiders can regrow their rear ends</a></h4>

              
                <p>No backside, no problem for some young sea spiders.</p>



<p>The creatures can regenerate <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217272120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly complete parts of their bottom halves</a> — including muscles, reproductive organs and the anus — or make do without them, researchers report January 23 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>The ability to regrow body parts isn’t super common, but some species manage to pull it off. Some sea slug heads <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">can craft an entirely new body</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/21</em>). Sea spiders and some other arthropods — a group of invertebrates with an exoskeleton — can regrow parts of their legs. But researchers thought new legs were the extent of any arthropod’s powers, perhaps because tough exteriors somehow stop them from regenerating other body parts.</p>

<p>A mishap first clued evolutionary biologist Georg Brenneis in that sea spiders (<em>Pycnogonum litorale)</em> might be able handle more complex repairs too. He accidentally injured one young specimen that he was working on in the lab with forceps. “It wasn’t dead, it was moving, so I just kept it,” says Brenneis, of the University of Vienna. Several months later, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-016-1333-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sea spider had an extra leg</a> instead of a scar, he and evolutionary biologist Gerhard Scholtz of Humbolt University of Berlin reported in 2016 in <em>The Science of Nature</em>.</p>



<p>In the new study, most of the 19 young spiders recovered and regrew missing muscles and other parts of their lower halves after amputation, though the regeneration wasn’t always perfect. Some juveniles sported six or seven legs instead of eight.</p>



<p>None of four adults regenerated. That may be because adults no longer shed their skin as they grow, suggesting that regeneration and molting are somehow linked, Brenneis says. Two young sea spiders also didn’t regenerate at all. The animals survived with only four legs and without an anus. Instead of pooping, the pair regurgitated waste out of their mouths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">Earth’s inner core may be reversing its rotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our planet may have had a recent change of heart.</p>



<p>Earth’s inner core <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01112-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have temporarily stopped rotating</a> relative to the mantle and surface, researchers report in the January 23 <em>Nature Geoscience</em>. Now, the direction of the inner core’s rotation may be reversing — part of what could be a roughly 70-year-long cycle that may influence the length of Earth’s days and its magnetic field — though some researchers are skeptical.</p>



<p>“We see strong evidence that the inner core has been rotating faster than the surface, [but] by around 2009 it nearly stopped,” says geophysicist Xiaodong Song of Peking University in Beijing. “Now it is gradually mov[ing] in the opposite direction.”</p>





<p>Such a profound turnaround might sound bizarre, but Earth is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">volatile</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Bore through the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">ever-shifting</a> crust and you’ll enter the titanic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-mantle-may-be-hotter-thought">mantle</a>, where behemoth masses of rock flow viscously over spans of millions of years, sometimes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/upwelling-rock-beneath-atlantic-ocean-may-drive-continents-apart">upwelling</a> to excoriate the overlying crust (<em>SN: 1/11/17, SN: 3/2/17, SN: 2/4/21</em>). Delve deeper and you’ll reach Earth’s liquid outer core. Here, circulating currents of molten metals conjure our planet’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetic-mystery-center-earth">magnetic field</a> (<em>SN: 9/4/15</em>). And at the heart of that melt, you’ll find a revolving, solid metal ball about 70 percent as wide as the moon.</p>



<p>This is the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field">inner core</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>). Studies have suggested that this solid heart may rotate within the liquid outer core, compelled by the outer core’s magnetic torque. Researchers have also argued the mantle’s immense gravitational pull may apply an erratic brake on the inner core’s rotation, causing it to oscillate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/382221a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inner core’s fluctuating rotation first emerged in 1996</a>. Geophysicist Paul Richards of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., and Song, then also at Lamont-Doherty, reported that over a span of three decades, seismic waves from earthquakes took different amounts of time to traverse Earth’s solid heart.</p>



<p>The researchers inferred that the inner core rotates at a different speed than the mantle and crust, causing the time differences. The planet spins roughly 360 degrees in a day. Based on their calculations, the researchers estimated that the inner core, on average, rotates about 1 degree per year faster than the rest of Earth.</p>



<p>But other researchers have questioned that conclusion, some suggesting that the core spins slower than Song and Richards’ estimate or doesn’t spin differently at all. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, while analyzing global seismic data stretching back to the 1990s, Song and geophysicist Yi Yang — also at Peking University — made a surprising observation.</p>





<p>Before 2009, seismic waves generated by sequences and pairs of repeating earthquakes — known as multiplets and doublets — traveled at different rates through the inner core. This indicated the waves from recurring quakes were crossing different parts of the inner core, and that the inner core was rotating at a different pace than the rest of Earth, aligning with Song’s previous research.</p>



<p>But around 2009, the differences in travel times vanished. That suggested the inner core had ceased rotating with respect to the mantle and crust, Yang says. After 2009, these differences returned, but the researchers inferred that the waves were crossing parts of the inner core that suggested it was now rotating in the opposite direction relative to the rest of Earth.</p>



<p>The researchers then pored over records of Alaskan earthquake doublets dating to 1964. While the inner core appeared to rotate steadily for most of that time, it seems to have made another reversal in rotation in the early 1970s, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Song and Yang infer that the inner core may oscillate with a roughly 70-year periodicity — switching directions every 35 years or so. Because the inner core is gravitationally linked to the mantle and magnetically linked to the outer core, the researchers say these oscillations could explain known 60- to 70-year variations in the length of Earth’s days and the behavior of the planet’s magnetic field. However, more work is needed to pin down what mechanisms might be responsible.</p>



<p>But not all researchers are on board. Yang and Song “identif[y] this recent 10-year period [that] has less activity than before, and I think that&#8217;s probably reliable,” says geophysicist John Vidale of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research. But beyond that, Vidale says, things get contentious.</p>



<p>In 2022, he and a colleague reported that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm9916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic waves from nuclear tests</a> show the inner core may reverse its rotation every three years or so. Meanwhile, other researchers have proposed that the inner core isn’t moving at all. Instead, they say, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JB017532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes to the shape of the inner core’s surface </a>could explain the differences in wave travel times.</p>



<p>Future observations will probably help disentangle the discrepancies between these studies, Vidale says. For now, he’s unruffled by the purported chthonic standstill. “In all likelihood, it&#8217;s irrelevant to life on the surface, but we don&#8217;t actually know what&#8217;s happening,” he says. “It’s incumbent on us to figure it out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-rabbit-ecological-role-spreading-seeds">A rare rabbit plays an important ecological role by spreading seeds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A crucial link in the life cycle of one parasitic plant may be found in a surprising place — the bellies of the descendants of an ancient line of rabbits.</p>



<p>Given their propensity for nibbling on gardens and darting across suburban lawns, it can be easy to forget that rabbits are wild animals. But a living reminder of their wildness can be found on two of Japan’s Ryukyu Islands, if you have the patience to look for it: the endangered Amami rabbit, a “living fossil” that looks strikingly similar to ancient Asian rabbits.</p>





<p>One estimate suggests there are fewer than 5,000 of the animals left in the wild. The lives of Amamis (<em>Pentalagus furnessi</em>) are shrouded in mystery due to their rarity, but they seem to play <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a surprising ecological role as seed dispersers</a>, researchers report January 23 in <em>Ecology</em>.</p>



<p>Seed dispersal is the main point in a plant’s life cycle when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-dandelion-seeds-spread-wide">it can move to a new location</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/22</em>). So dispersal is crucially important for understanding how plant populations are maintained and how species will respond to climate change, says Haldre Rogers, a biologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, who was not involved with the study. Despite this, seed dispersal hasn’t received much attention, she says. “We don’t know what disperses the seeds of most plants in the world.”</p>



<p>Locals from the Ryukyu Islands were the first to notice that the “iconic yet endangered” Amami rabbit was nibbling on the fruit of another local species, the plant <em>Balanophora yuwanensis</em>, says Kenji Suetsugu, a biologist at Kobe University in Japan.</p>



<p>Rabbits generally like to eat vegetative tissue from plants, like leaves and stems, and so haven’t been thought to contribute much to spreading seeds, which are often housed in fleshy fruits.</p>



<p>To confirm what the locals reported, Suetsugu and graduate student Hiromu Hashiwaki set up camera traps around the island to catch the rabbits in the act. The researchers were able to record rabbits munching on <em>Balanophora </em>fruits 11 times, but still needed to check whether the seeds survived their trip through the bunny tummies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_di_amami-rabbit_inline1.jpg" alt="A night photo of an Amami rabbit munching on the fruit of a parasitic plant." class="wp-image-3121192" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_di_amami-rabbit_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_di_amami-rabbit_inline1-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_di_amami-rabbit_inline1-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011923_di_amami-rabbit_inline1-280x186.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121192">A camera trap captured this Amami rabbit munching on the fruit of the parasitic plant <em>Balanophora yuwanensis</em>.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121192">Kenji Suetsugu and Hiromu Hashiwaki</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So the team headed out to the subtropical islands and scooped up rabbit poop, finding <em>Balanophora </em>seeds inside that could still be grown. By swallowing the seeds and pooping them out elsewhere, the Amami rabbits were clearly acting as seed dispersers.</p>



<p><em>Balanophora </em>plants are parasitic and don’t have chlorophyll, so they can’t use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origin-photosynthesis-may-go-further-back-estimates-50-years-ago">photosynthesis</a> to make food of their own (<em>SN: 3/2/17</em>). Instead, they suck energy away from a host plant. This means where their seeds end up matters, and the Amami rabbits “may facilitate the placement of seeds near the roots of a compatible host” by pooping in underground burrows, Suetsugu says. “Thus, the rabbits likely provide a crucial link between <em>Balanophora</em> and its hosts” that remains to be further explored, he says.</p>





<p>Understanding the ecology of an endangered species like the Amami rabbit can help with conserving both it and the plants that depend on it.</p>



<p>An animal need not be in obvious peril for a change in its number to affect seed dispersal, with potentially negative consequences for the ecosystem. For example, “we think of robins as super common … but they’ve declined a lot in the last 50 years,” Rogers says. “Half as many robins means half as many seeds are getting moved around, even though no one’s worried about robins as a conservation issue.”</p>

<p>Springer Nature has retracted a book chapter which critics say was plagued with “extremely offensive and outdated” statements about the deaf community. </p>



<p>The chapter, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2600-6_27">Literature Review on Sign Language Generation</a>,” was published in September 2022 as part of <em>Data Management, Analytics and Innovation: Proceedings of ICDMAI 2022 (International Conference on Data Management, Analytics and Innovation)</em>. The authors, five researchers at the Cummins College of Engineering for Women in Pune, India, attempted to review work on sign language translation – specifically with artificial intelligence and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the abstract:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126431"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The deaf and dumb community uses sign language to communicate. Sign language is a language of signs including facial expressions and not of spoken words. It is a visual mode of communication. The position of hands, the movement of fingers and the expressions on the face play a vital role in sign language. Sign languages have a very limited set of words. The grammar is difficult to understand. On the contrary, spoken languages across the globe have a rich vocabulary. It is difficult for signers to understand a spoken language. There is a need to develop a system that establishes a link between spoken and sign languages. Translating from spoken languages to sign languages is a challenging task. This paper presents the state-of-the work that has been done in the field of translating English (a spoken language) to Indian Sign Language.</p>

<p>When referring to members of the deaf community, the terms “deaf” and “hard of hearing” are widely accepted, according to the <a href="https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-frequently-asked-questions/">National Association of the Deaf</a>. The “deaf and dumb” phrasing used in the abstract, however, is the “granddaddy of all negative labels pinned on deaf and hard of hearing people,” according to the association.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after publication, the paper’s abstract received sharp criticism on Twitter:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Springer has a publishing contract with ICDMAI (<a href="https://link.springer.com/conference/icdmai">International Conference on Data Management, Analytics &amp; Innovation</a>) for their conference proceedings. The conference proceeding in question was part of a series for the Applied Sciences programme, published in September 2022.</p>



<p>On notification of this paper, it was looked into as a matter of priority by the Springer Nature editorial team, and was subsequently retracted in line with COPE guidelines, with the full support of editors and researchers involved.</p>



<p>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is one of our highest strategic priorities at Springer Nature and we are committed to ensuring that we play an active role in promoting and celebrating DEI across our company and through our publications and activities. We also have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01607-0been%20made%20aware%20of%20this%20particular%20conference%20paper">editorial guidelines&nbsp; </a>in place to encourage authors, reviewers and editors to ensure that they respect the dignity and rights of groups of people in their work and publications.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Springer spokesperson confirmed the external criticism coincided with their own inquiry:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We saw the notification of the paper and it was looked into in line with COPE and our editorial guidelines for authors.</p>



<p>There was also one external contact that enquired which happened at the same time as our internal conversations.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The deaf community has criticized Springer Nature before for publishing offensive language. The publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/01/springer-nature-to-retract-chapter-on-sign-language-critics-call-unbelievably-insulting/">retracted another conference paper in 2021</a> for using similarly insensitive terminology and neglecting to involve experts in sign languages.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/JICTS/article/view/14079">an article</a> published in the <em>Journal of ICT Standardization</em> by River Publishers was withdrawn and republished, and the original title, “Sign Language Recognition for Deaf and Dumb People Using Convolution Neural Network” altered, after an email exchange between three academics and the editors and authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rain Bosworth, one of the academics who pushed for those changes, said the Springer Nature chapter that was just retracted contained unsubstantiated claims that play into misinformation about the deaf community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It claims deaf people are helpless, and communicating with us is fraught with difficulties,” Bosworth, a deaf experimental psychologist at the Rochester Institute of Technology, told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abstract’s claim that “the grammar is difficult to understand” in sign languages is only true “if you don’t know it,” Bosworth argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I felt quite upset and shocked that deaf people and sign languages would be described in such a way in this day and age,” said <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dcal/people/core-team/dr-kate-rowley">Kate Rowley</a>, a deaf linguistics researcher at University College London. “They used extremely offensive and outdated terms.”</p>



<p>Rowley also condemned the abstract’s claims that sign languages have a “limited set of words” compared to spoken languages which “have a rich vocabulary”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These statements are false,” she wrote in an email. “Sign languages have a rich vocabulary and complex grammatical systems – equally as complex as spoken languages.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both critics agreed the flawed assertions might have been avoided through collaboration with members of the deaf community – an oversight that was singled out in the paper’s retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Deaf people who are experts in linguistics should have been a part of this,” Bosworth said. “The best thing that scientists who study deaf people can do is INCLUDE deaf consultants and even deaf team members who are involved in the research progress.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">Rare earth elements could be pulled from coal waste</a></h4>

              
                <p>In Appalachia’s coal country, researchers envision turning toxic waste into treasure. The pollution left behind by abandoned mines is an untapped source of rare earth elements.</p>



<p>Rare earths are a<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology"> valuable set of 17 elements</a> needed to make everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to fluorescent bulbs and lasers. With global demand skyrocketing and China having a near-monopoly on rare earth production — the United States <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">has only one active mine</a> — there’s a lot of interest in finding alternative sources, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycling-rare-earth-elements-hard-new-methods">ramping up recycling</a>.</p>





<p>Pulling rare earths from coal waste offers a two-for-one deal: By retrieving the metals, you also help clean up the pollution.</p>



<p>Long after a coal mine closes, it can leave a dirty legacy. When some of the rock left over from mining is exposed to air and water, sulfuric acid forms and pulls heavy metals from the rock. This acidic soup can pollute waterways and harm wildlife.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/3FE0D2F4-1001-44FF-B0C1-9B535DA41935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recovering rare earths from what’s called acid mine drainage</a> won’t single-handedly satisfy rising demand for the metals, acknowledges Paul Ziemkiewicz, director of the West Virginia Water Research Institute in Morgantown. But he points to several benefits.</p>



<p>Unlike ore dug from typical rare earth mines, the drainage is rich with the most-needed rare earth elements. Plus, extraction from acid mine drainage also doesn’t generate the radioactive waste that’s typically a by-product of rare earth mines, which often contain uranium and thorium alongside the rare earths. And from a practical standpoint, existing facilities to treat acid mine drainage could be used to collect the rare earths for processing. “Theoretically, you could start producing tomorrow,” Ziemkiewicz says.</p>



<p>From a few hundred sites already treating acid mine drainage, nearly 600 metric tons of rare earth elements and cobalt — another in-demand metal — could be produced annually, Ziemkiewicz and colleagues estimate.</p>



<p>Currently, a pilot project in West Virginia is taking material recovered from an acid mine drainage treatment site and extracting and concentrating the rare earths.</p>



<p>If such a scheme proves feasible, Ziemkiewicz envisions a future in which cleanup sites send their rare earth hauls to a central facility to be processed, and the elements separated. Economic analyses suggest this wouldn’t be a get-rich scheme. But, he says, it could be enough to cover the costs of treating the acid mine drainage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycling-rare-earth-elements-hard-new-methods">Recycling rare earth elements is hard. Science is trying to make it easier</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Our modern lives depend on rare earth elements, and someday soon we may not have enough to meet growing demand.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology">their special properties</a>, these 17 metallic elements are crucial ingredients in computer screens, cell phones and other electronics, compact fluorescent lamps, medical imaging machines, lasers, fiber optics, pigments, polishing powders, industrial catalysts – the list goes on and on (<em>SN Online: 1/16/23</em>). Notably rare earths are an essential part of the high-powered magnets and rechargeable batteries in the electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies needed to get the world to a low- or zero-carbon future.</p>





<p>In 2021, the world <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2022/mcs2022-rare-earths.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mined 280,000 metric tons of rare earths</a> — roughly 32 times as much as was mined in the mid-1950s. And demand is only going to increase. By 2040, experts estimate, we’ll need up to seven times as much rare earths as we do today.</p>



<p>Satisfying that appetite won’t be easy. Rare earth elements are not found in concentrated deposits. Miners must excavate huge amounts of ore, subject it to physical and chemical processes to concentrate the rare earths, and then separate them. The transformation is energy intensive and dirty, requiring toxic chemicals and often generating a small amount of radioactive waste that must be safely disposed of. Another concern is access: China has a near monopoly on both mining and processing; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">the United States has just one active mine</a> (<em>SN Online: 1/1/23</em>).</p>



<p>For most of the jobs rare earths do, there are no good substitutes. So to help meet future demand and diversify who controls the supply — and perhaps even make rare earth recovery “greener” — researchers are looking for alternatives to conventional mining.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals include everything from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">extracting the metals from coal waste</a> to really out-there ideas like mining the moon. But the approach most likely to make an immediate dent is recycling. “Recycling is going to play a very important and central role,” says Ikenna Nlebedim, a materials scientist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Institute. “That’s not to say we’re going to recycle our way out of the critical materials challenge.” </p>



<p>Still, in the rare earth magnets market, for instance, by about 10 years from now, recycling could satisfy as much as a quarter of the demand for rare earths, based on some estimates. “That’s huge,” he says.</p>



<p>But before the rare earths in an old laptop can be recycled as regularly as the aluminum in an empty soda can, there are technological, economic and logistical obstacles to overcome.</p>



<h4>Why are rare earths so challenging to extract?</h4>





<p>Recycling seems like an obvious way to get more rare earths. It’s standard practice in the United States and Europe to recycle from 15 to 70 percent of other metals, such as iron, copper, aluminum, nickel and tin. Yet today, only about 1 percent of rare earth elements in old products are recycled, says Simon Jowitt, an economic geologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>



<p>“Copper wiring can be recycled into more copper wiring. Steel can just be recycled into more steel,” he says. But a lot of rare earth products are “inherently not very recyclable.”</p>

<p>The scheme would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">provide valuable rare earth metals</a> and help clean up coal mining’s dirty legacy.</p>
</div>



<p>Rare earths are often blended with other metals in touch screens and similar products, making removal difficult. In some ways, recycling rare earths from tossed-out items resembles the challenge of extracting them from ore and separating them from each other. Traditional rare earth recycling methods also require hazardous chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and a lot of heat, and thus a lot of energy. On top of the environmental footprint, the cost of recovery may not be worth the effort given the small yield of rare earths. A hard disk drive, for instance, might contain just a few grams; some products offer just milligrams.</p>



<p>Chemists and materials scientists, though, are trying to develop smarter recycling approaches. Their techniques put microbes to work, ditch the acids of traditional methods or attempt to bypass extraction and separation.</p>



<h4>Microbial partners can help recycle rare earths</h4>



<p>One approach leans on microscopic partners. <em>Gluconobacter</em> bacteria naturally produce organic acids that can pull rare earths, such as lanthanum and cerium, from spent catalysts used in petroleum refining or from fluorescent phosphors used in lighting. The bacterial acids are less environmentally harmful than hydrochloric acid or other traditional metal-leaching acids, says Yoshiko Fujita, a biogeochemist at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. Fujita leads research into reuse and recycling at the Critical Materials Institute. “They can also be degraded naturally,” she says.</p>



<p>In experiments, the bacterial acids can recover only about a quarter to half of the rare earths from spent catalysts and phosphors. Hydrochloric acid can do much better — in some cases extracting as much as 99 percent. But bio-based leaching <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might still be profitable</a>, Fujita and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering</em>. <a></a></p>



<p>In a hypothetical plant recycling 19,000 metric tons of used catalyst a year, the team estimated annual revenues to be roughly $1.75 million. But feeding the bacteria that produce the acid on-site is a big expense. In a scenario in which the bacteria are fed refined sugar, total costs for producing the rare earths are roughly $1.6 million a year, leaving around just $150,000 in profits. Switching from sugar to corn stalks, husks and other harvest leftovers, however, would slash costs by about $500,000, raising profits to about $650,000.</p>

This reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory prepares an organic acid mixture for such recycling.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121115">Idaho National Lab</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Other microbes can also help extract rare earths and take them even further. A few years ago, researchers discovered that some bacteria that metabolize rare earths produce a protein that preferentially grabs onto these metals. This protein, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.1c00724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lanmodulin, can separate rare earths</a> from each other, such as neodymium from dysprosium — two components of rare earth magnets. A lanmodulin-based system might eliminate the need for the many chemical solvents typically used in such separation. And the waste left behind — the protein — would be biodegradable. But whether the system will pan out on a commercial scale is unknown.</p>



<h4>How to pull rare earths from discarded magnets</h4>



<p>Another approach already being commercialized skips the acids and uses copper salts to pull the rare earths from discarded magnets, a valuable target. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets are about 30 percent rare earth by weight and the single largest application of the metals in the world. One projection suggests that recovering the neodymium in magnets from U.S. hard disk drives alone could meet up about 5 percent of the world’s demand outside of China before the end of the decade.</p>



<p>Nlebedim led a team that developed a technique that uses copper salts to leach rare earths out of shredded electronic waste that contains magnets. Dunking the e-waste in a copper salt solution at room temperature dissolves the rare earths in the magnets. Other metals can be scooped out for their own recycling, and the copper can be reused to make more salt solution. Next, the rare earths are solidified and, with the help of additional chemicals and heating, transformed into powdered minerals called rare earth oxides. The process, which has also been used on material left over from magnet manufacturing that typically goes to waste, can recover 90 to 98 percent of the rare earths, and the material is pure enough to make new magnets, Nlebedim’s team has demonstrated.</p>



<p>In a best-case scenario, using this method to recycle 100 tons of leftover magnet material might produce 32 tons of rare earth oxides and net more than $1 million in profits, an economic analysis of the method suggests.</p>



<p>That study also evaluated the approach’s environmental impacts. Compared with producing one kilogram of rare earth oxide via one of the main types of mining and processing currently used in China, the copper salt method has <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than half the carbon footprint</a>. It produces an average of about 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of rare earth oxide versus 110, Nlebedim’s team reported in 2021 in <em>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering</em>.</p>

</ul>
</div>



<p>But it’s not necessarily greener than all forms of mining. One sticking point is that the process requires toxic ammonium hydroxide and roasting, which consumes a lot of energy, and it still releases some carbon dioxide. Nlebedim’s group is now tweaking the technique. “We want to decarbonize the process and make it safer,” he says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the technology seems promising enough that TdVib, an Iowa company that designs and manufactures magnetic materials and products, has licensed it and built a pilot plant. The initial aim is to produce two tons of rare earth oxides per month, says Daniel Bina, TdVib’s president and CEO. The plant will recycle rare earths from old hard disk drives from data centers.</p>



<p>Noveon Magnetics, a company in San Marcos, Texas, is already making recycled neodymium-iron-boron magnets. In typical magnet manufacturing, the rare earths are mined, transformed into metal alloys, milled into a fine powder, magnetized and formed into a magnet. Noveon knocks out those first two steps, says company CEO Scott Dunn.</p>



<p>After demagnetizing and cleaning discarded magnets, Noveon directly mills them into a powder before building them back up as new magnets. Unlike with other recycling methods, there’s no need to extract and separate the rare earths out first. The final product can be more than 99 percent recycled magnet, Dunn says, with a small addition of virgin rare earth elements — the “secret sauce,” as he puts it — that allows the company to fine-tune the magnets’ attributes.</p>



<p>Compared with traditional magnet mining and manufacturing, Noveon’s method <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352186416300025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cuts energy use by about 90 percent</a>, Miha Zakotnik, Noveon’s chief technology officer, and other researchers reported in 2016 in <em>Environmental Technology &amp; Innovation</em>. Another 2016 analysis estimated that for every kilogram of magnet produced via Noveon’s method, about 12 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent are emitted. That’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827116006508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about half as much of the greenhouse gas as conventional magnets</a>.</p>



<p>Dunn declined to share what volume of magnets Noveon currently produces or how much its magnets cost. But the magnets are being used in some industrial applications, for pumps, fans and compressors, as well as some consumer power tools and other electronics.</p>

<h4>Rare earth recycling has logistical hurdles</h4>



<p>Even as researchers clear technological hurdles, there are still logistical barriers to recycling. “We don’t have the systems for collecting end-of-life products that have rare earths in them,” Fujita says, “and there’s the cost of dismantling those products.” For a lot of e-waste, before rare earth recycling can begin, you have to get to the bits that contain those precious metals.</p>



<p>Noveon has a semiautomated process for removing magnets from hard disk drives and other electronics.</p>



<p>Apple is also trying to automate the recycling process. The company’s Daisy robot can dismantle iPhones. And in 2022, Apple announced a pair of robots called Taz and Dave that facilitate the recycling of rare earths. Taz can gather magnet-containing modules that are typically lost during the shredding of electronics. Dave can recover magnets from taptic engines, Apple’s technology for providing users with tactile feedback when, say, tapping an iPhone screen.</p>



<p>Even with robotic aids, it would still be a lot easier if companies just designed products in a way that made recycling easy, Fujita says.</p>



<p>No matter how good recycling gets, Jowitt sees no getting around the need to ramp up mining to feed our rare earth–hungry society. But he agrees recycling is necessary. “We’re dealing with intrinsically finite resources,” he says. “Better we try and extract what we can rather than just dumping it in the landfill.”</p>

<p>Starting in 2011, however, journals began pulling his papers over such issues as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/12/31/urology-researcher-in-iran-has-third-paper-retracted/">failure to verify data</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/04/24/urology-researcher-in-iran-up-to-six-retractions/">inappropriate statistical analyses</a>. The <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477-5131(22)00279-0">latest retraction</a>, from August 2022, brings the tally up to 15, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSafarinejad%252c%2bMohammad%2bReza">Retraction Watch Database</a>. And on January 10, <em>The Journal of Urology</em> issued expressions of concern for 14 of his papers, which have been cited a total of nearly 800 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The journal states:</p>

<p>When Retraction Watch emailed Safarinejad for comments, he responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since 2006 after publishing two articles about Dapoxetine, Johnson &amp; Johnson Company is all trying to hit and retract my articles. During these years I have received too many fake emails and letters. I don&#8217;t know who you are and who do you work for.. But I know well that if the author&#8217;s rights are lost, he/she can do nothing. Most likely you are also from Johnson &amp; Johnson Company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He elaborated in another email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Publishing two articles about Dapoxetine had great impact in drop down of this drug as a drug of choice for treatment of premature of ejaculation by FDA. Despite extensive efforts of J&amp;J company using hired physicians and Editor-in Chiefs of dependent journals to hit me in any way I was among 2 percent of world scientists in 2020.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. But Jennifer Regala, director of publications at the American Urological Association, which publishes <em>The Journal of Urology</em>, told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm that the Journal&#8217;s Editorial Office and Dr. [Robert] Siemens [the journal’s editor] have not been contacted by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<p>We have also reached out to Dr. Safarinejad as part of our investigation but have not received a response.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern statements will remain on these articles until our investigation is complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal’s actions come on the heels of a letter to the editor in <em>Andrologia </em>by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">data sleuth Ben Mol</a> and his colleagues that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.14573">spotlighted suspicious numbers</a> in seven of the Iranian researcher&#8217;s clinical trials (none of them was published in <em>The Journal of Urology</em>, but one is the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Abstract/2006/09000/Comparison_of_Dapoxetine_Versus_Paroxetine_in.1.aspx">2006 study on dapoxetine</a> that Safarinejad said set off his troubles). Two of those studies, for instance, include rows of six data points that are entirely identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month after the letter was published, Mol brought his concerns to editors and publishers of several journals, including <em>The Journal of Urology</em>. He pointed out that Safarinejad&#8217;s top papers had been cited hundreds of times. &#8220;Through these citations,&#8221; he wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch, &#8220;fake data is continuously being implemented into reviews that are used for clinical practice.&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked if he had any financial ties to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mol told us, &#8220;Nope, not at all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On his LinkedIn profile, Safarinejad <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-reza-safarinejad-4382bb40">claims</a> that he has &#8220;been selected among the list that represents the top 2 percent of the most-cited scientists in the world&#8221; and has an H-index of 41. This <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/15/why-misconduct-could-keep-scientists-from-earning-highly-cited-researcher-designations-and-how-our-database-plays-a-part/">could change</a> if he is found to have committed scientific misconduct.</p>



<p>Safarinejad told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All of my articles have been retracted with reason of “Inappropriate Analyses”!!??&nbsp; The related journals didn’t accept to publish my reply. I proposed that all the article data be published on the Journal site as supplementary materials and the readers be the final judges. In addition we invite three well known independent statisticians and comment on the statistical analysis of the articles.&nbsp; Now we face a new scenario (expressions of concern) . I have not even received any letters or emails in this regard. Do you know what is their concern? I don’t know what is the subject. The Journal of Urology was the only journal that had resisted all the pressures so far. This journal seems to have surrendered too. Do you know what can I do? There is close relationship between pharmaceutical company and scientists and journals, there are many ghost writers, there are many hired writers and scientists etc.</p>

                <p>arXiv has pioneered open access for more than 30 years by removing financial, institutional, and geographic barriers to research. No paywalls or fees, no login required for reading. This approach – which gives researchers maximum control over the release of their results and broad visibility – transformed the research process and launched the open access movement.</p>
<p>However, access is not the same as accessibility, which is the practice of ensuring access regardless of disability. The vast majority of research papers posted to any journal or platform do not meet basic accessibility standards.</p>
<p>In 2022, arXiv completed intensive user research with over 40 people to determine the extent of the problem, evaluate current mitigation efforts, and consider solutions. This work, informed by arXiv staff, accessibility experts, and arXiv readers and authors who use assistive technology, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07286">posted on arXiv</a> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07286">PDF</a> and <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html">HTML</a> formats (arXivID: 2212.07286).</p>
<p>In extensive interviews, our research participants shared that finding research, reading it, preparing documents, and submitting work are all steps in the research process where people encounter barriers. In particular, interpreting math equations, figures, and charts is problematic.</p>
<p>Flexible content can help address these issues. Offering well-formatted HTML, alongside PDF and TeX source, will lead to critical accessibility gains. <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/21/arxiv-articles-as-responsive-web-pages/">arXiv’s collaboration with ar5iv</a>, which currently renders HTML for approximately 70% of arXiv papers, is a first step in this process. Next, we expect to reduce the error rate and add a link to HTML on arXiv abstract pages.</p>
<p>Accessibility of research papers is not a problem that arXiv can solve alone, and this will be an iterative, collaborative process.</p>
<p>In the words of arXiv users who generously shared their perspectives with us:</p>
<p><strong>“I prefer HTML versions. As an assistive tech user I find it much faster to navigate.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“HTML also works for the deaf community. English is a second language to deaf readers… they would rather get ASL. There are tools for converting HTML to ASL.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“In a dream world every technical document will just work [with screen readers]. In a smaller dream world, it just works on arXiv.”</strong></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-dna-jungle-fowl-genetics">Chicken DNA is replacing the genetics of their ancestral jungle fowl</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today’s red jungle fowl — the wild forebears of the domesticated chicken — are becoming more chickenlike. New research suggests that a large proportion of the wild fowl’s DNA has been inherited from chickens, and relatively recently.</p>



<p>Ongoing interbreeding between the two birds may threaten wild jungle fowl populations’ future, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and even hobble humans’ ability to breed better chickens</a>, researchers report January 19 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red jungle fowl (<em>Gallus gallus</em>) are forest birds native to Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. Thousands of years ago, humans domesticated the fowl, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-domestication-bones-origin-asia-rice-fields-exotic-animals">possibly in the region’s rice fields</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/6/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Chickens are arguably the most important domestic animal on Earth,” says Frank Rheindt, an evolutionary biologist at the National University of Singapore. He points to their global ubiquity and abundance.&nbsp; Chicken is also one of the cheapest sources of animal protein that humans have.</p>



<p>Domesticated chickens (<em>G. gallus domesticus</em>) were known to be interbreeding with jungle fowl near human settlements in Southeast Asia. Given the unknown impacts on jungle fowl and the importance of chickens to humankind, Rheindt and his team wanted to gather more details. Wild jungle fowl contain a store of genetic diversity that could serve as a crucial resource for breeding chickens resistant to diseases or other threats.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed and compared the genomes — the full complement of an organism’s DNA — of 63 jungle fowl and 51 chickens from across Southeast Asia. Some of the jungle fowl samples came from museum specimens collected from 1874 through 1939, letting the team see how the genetic makeup of jungle fowl has changed over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last century or so, wild jungle fowl’s genomes have become increasingly similar to chickens’. Between about 20 and 50 percent of the genomes of modern jungle fowl originated in chickens, the team found. In contrast, many of the roughly 100-year-old jungle fowl had a chicken-ancestry share in the range of a few percent.</p>



<p>The rapid change probably comes from human communities expanding into the region’s wilderness, Rheindt says. Most modern jungle fowl live in close vicinity to humans’ free-ranging chickens, with which they frequently interbreed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such interbreeding has become “almost the norm now” for any globally domesticated species, Rheindt says, such as dogs hybridizing with wolves and house cats crossing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with wildcats</a>. Pigs, meanwhile, are mixing with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-022-00517-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild boars</a> and ferrets <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/113/5/500/6657699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with polecats</a>.</p>





<p>Wild populations that interbreed with their domesticated counterparts could pick up physical or behavioral traits that change how the hybrids function in their ecosystem, says Claudio Quilodrán, a conservation geneticist at the University of Geneva not involved with this research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effect is likely to be negative, Quilodrán says, since some of the traits coming into the wild population have been honed for human uses, not for survival in the local environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wild jungle fowl have lost their genetic diversity as they’ve interbred too. The birds’ heterozygosity — a measure of a population’s genetic diversity — is now just a tenth of what it was a century ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This result is initially counterintuitive,” Rheindt says. “If you mix one population with another, you would generally expect a higher genetic diversity.”</p>



<p>But domesticated chickens have such low genetic diversity that certain versions of jungle fowl genes are being swept out of the population by a tsunami of genetic homogeneity.&nbsp;The whittling down of these animals’ genetic toolkit may leave them vulnerable to conservation threats.</p>



<p>“Having lots of genetic diversity within a species increases the chance that certain individuals contain the genetic background to adapt to a varied range of different environmental changes and diseases,” says Graham Etherington, a computational biologist at the Earlham Institute in Norwich, England, who was not involved with this research.</p>



<p>A shallower jungle fowl gene pool could also mean diminished resources for breeding better chickens.&nbsp;The genetics of wild relatives are sometimes used to bolster the disease or pest resistance of domesticated crop plants. Jungle fowl genomes could be similarly valuable for this reason.</p>



<p>“If this trend continues unabated, future human generations may only be able to access the entirety of ancestral genetic diversity of chickens in the form of museum specimens,” Rheindt says, which could hamper chicken breeding efforts using the wild fowl genes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some countries such as Singapore, Rheindt says, have started managing jungle fowl populations to reduce interbreeding with chickens.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-night-sky-bright-citizen-science">New data show how quickly light pollution is obscuring the night sky</a></h4>

              
                <p>The night sky has been brightening faster than researchers realized, thanks to the use of artificial lights at night. A study of more than 50,000 observations of stars by citizen scientists reveals that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf4952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the night sky grew about 10 percent brighter</a>, on average, every year from 2011 to 2022.</p>



<p>In other words, a baby born in a region where roughly 250 stars were visible every night would see only 100 stars on their 18th birthday, researchers report in the Jan. 20 Science.</p>





<p>The perils of light pollution go far beyond not being able to see as many stars. Too much brightness at night can <a href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harm people’s health</a>, send <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-lights-out-philly-save-migrating-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migrating birds flying into buildings</a>, disrupt food webs by drawing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-foil-plant-insect-hookups-and-not-just-night">pollinating insects</a> toward lights instead of plants and may even interrupt <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-may-disrupt-firefly-sex">fireflies trying to have sex</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/17</em>; <em>SN: 8/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>“In a way, this is a call to action,” says astronomer Connie Walker of the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory in Tucson. “People should consider that this does have an impact on our lives. It’s not just astronomy. It impacts our health. It impacts other animals who cannot speak for themselves.”</p>



<p>Walker works with the <a href="https://www.globeatnight.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globe at Night</a> campaign, which began in the mid-2000s as an outreach project to connect students in Arizona and Chile and now has thousands of participants worldwide. Contributors compare the stars they can see with maps of what stars would be visible at different levels of light pollution, and enter the results on an app.</p>



<p>“I’d been quite skeptical of Globe at Night” as a tool for precision research, admits physicist Christopher Kyba of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. But the power is in the sheer numbers: Kyba and colleagues analyzed 51,351 individual data points collected from 2011 to 2022.</p>



<p>“The individual data are not precise, but there’s a whole lot of them,” he says. “This Globe at Night project is not just a game; it’s really useful data. And the more people participate, the more powerful it gets.”</p>



<p>Those data, combined with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/third-population-cant-see-milky-way-night">a global atlas of sky luminance</a> published <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=4.00&amp;lat=45.8720&amp;lon=14.5470&amp;layers=B0FFFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFFF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, allowed the team to conclude that the night sky’s brightness increased by an average 9.6 percent per year from 2011 to 2022 (<em>SN: 6/10/16</em>).</p>



<p>Most of that increase was missed by satellites that collect brightness data across the globe. Those measurements saw just a 2 percent increase in brightness per year over the last decade.</p>





<p>There are several reasons for that, Kyba says. Since the early 2010s, many outdoor lights have switched from high-pressure sodium lightbulbs to LEDs. LEDs are more energy efficient, which has environmental benefits and cost savings.</p>



<p>But LEDs also emit more short-wavelength blue light, which scatters off particles in the atmosphere more than sodium bulbs’ orange light, creating more sky glow. Existing satellites are not sensitive to blue wavelengths, so they underestimate the light pollution coming from LEDs. And satellites may miss light that shines toward the horizon, such as light emitted by a sign or from a window, rather than straight up or down.</p>

<p>Astronomer and light pollution researcher John Barentine was not surprised that satellites underestimated the problem. But “I was still surprised by how much of an underestimate it was,” he says. “This paper is confirming that we’ve been undercounting light pollution in the world.”</p>



<p>The good news is that no major technological breakthroughs are needed to help fix the problem. Scientists and policy makers just need to convince people to change how they use light at night — easier said than done.</p>



<p>“People sometimes say light pollution is the easiest pollution to solve, because you just have to turn a switch and it goes away,” Kyba says. “That’s true. But it’s ignoring the social problem — that this overall problem of light pollution is made by billions of individual decisions.”</p>



<p>Some simple solutions include dimming or turning off lights overnight, especially floodlighting or lights in empty parking lots.</p>



<p>Kyba shared a story about a church in Slovenia that switched from four 400-watt floodlights to a single 58-watt LED, shining behind a cutout of the church to focus the light on its facade. The result was a 96 percent reduction in energy use and much less wasted light , Kyba reported in the <em>International Journal of Sustainable Lighting </em>in 2018. The <a href="https://lightingjournal.org/index.php/path/article/view/80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">church was still lit up</a>, but the grass, trees and sky around it remained dark.</p>



<p>“If it was possible to replicate that story over and over again throughout our society, it would suggest you could really drastically reduce the light in the sky, still have a lit environment and have better vision and consume a lot less energy,” he says. “This is kind of the dream.”</p>



<p>Barentine, who leads a private dark-sky consulting firm, thinks widespread awareness of the problem — and subsequent action — could be imminent. For comparison, he points to a highly publicized <a href="https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil slick fire on the Cuyahoga River</a>, outside of Cleveland, in 1969 that fueled the environmental movement of the 1960s and ’70s, and prompted the U.S. Congress to pass the Clean Water Act.</p>



<p>“I think we’re on the precipice, maybe, of having the river-on-fire moment for light pollution,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-worsen-allergy-symptoms-hay-fever">Too much of this bacteria in the nose may worsen allergy symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <p>A type of bacteria that’s overabundant in the nasal passages of people with hay fever may worsen symptoms. Targeting that bacteria may provide a way to rein in ever-running noses.</p>



<p>Hay fever occurs when allergens, such as pollen or mold, trigger an inflammatory reaction in the nasal passages, leading to itchiness, sneezing and overflowing mucus. Researchers analyzed the composition of the microbial population in the noses of 55 people who have hay fever and those of 105 people who don’t. There was less diversity in the nasal microbiome of people who have hay fever and a whole lot <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01301-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of a bacterial species called <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em></a>, the team reports online January 12 in <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. &nbsp;</p>





<p><em>S. salivarius</em> was 17 times more abundant in the noses of allergy sufferers than the noses of those without allergies, says Michael Otto, a molecular microbiologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. That imbalance appears to play a part in further provoking allergy symptoms. In laboratory experiments with allergen-exposed cells that line the airways, <em>S. salivarius</em> boosted the cells’ production of proteins that promote inflammation.</p>



<p>And it turns out that <em>S. salivarius</em> really likes runny noses. One prominent, unpleasant symptom of hay fever is the overproduction of nasal discharge. The researchers found that <em>S. salivarius</em> binds very well to airway-lining cells exposed to an allergen and slathered in mucus — better than a comparison bacteria that also resides in the nose.</p>



<p>The close contact appears to be what makes the difference. It means that substances on <em>S.</em> <em>salivarius’</em> surface that can drive inflammation — common among many bacteria — are close enough to exert their effect on cells, Otto says.</p>



<p>Hay fever, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4324099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupts daily activities and disturbs sleep</a>, is estimated to affect as many as 30 percent of adults in the United States. The new research opens the door “to future studies targeting this bacteria” as a potential treatment for hay fever, says Mahboobeh Mahdavinia, a physician scientist who studies immunology and allergies at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. </p>



<p>But any treatment would need to avoid harming the “good” bacteria that live in the nose, says Mahdavinia, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>The proteins on <em>S. salivarius’ </em>surface that are important to its ability to attach to mucus-covered cells might provide a target, says Otto. The bacteria bind to proteins called mucins found in the slimy, runny mucus. By learning more about <em>S. salivarius’ </em>surface proteins, Otto says, it may be possible to come up with “specific methods to block that adhesion.”</p>

<p>A highly cited economics paper that suggested people raised during recessions were more likely to vote for left-leaning political parties has been retracted, apparently due to a coding error that rendered the results invalid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction marks a rarity among economics papers, which research has shown are infrequently retracted compared to papers on other subjects. The article appears to be the first in <em>The Review of Economic Studies</em> to have been retracted for a reason other than publisher error.</p>



<p>The study’s authors, Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo, are economists at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles and the International Monetary Fund, respectively. Giuliano is also the Chauncey J. Medberry Chair in Management at UCLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper,<a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/81/2/787/1520611?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> “Growing up in a Recession,”</a> was published in November 2013. It has been cited 222 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/political-efficacy-and-participation_4548cad8-en">Working</a> <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/an-updated-oecd-framework-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-to-meet-current-and-future-challenges_b6c5478c-en">papers</a> from the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37569">World</a> <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36913">Bank</a> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have also cited the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126415"></span>



<p>The paper was retracted on January 11. According to the retraction notice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors and editorial team are retracting this article because the original findings cannot be replicated, likely as a result of an inadvertent coding error. While the original codes and data sets are no longer available, new analysis with a markedly similar data set does not support the original results.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the paper’s authors nor the editors of the journal responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023060848id_/http://www.anderson.ucla.edu:80/faculty/paola.giuliano/Recession_RESTUD.pdf">study</a> has received a fair amount of media attention. An article in<a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/12/03/study_recession_could_create_a_generation_of_democrats_partner/"> <em>Salon</em></a>, published soon after the final version of the study, was titled, “Has the recession spawned a generation of Democrats?” An earlier, working version of the article available in 2009 sparked an opinion piece in the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/opinion/30douthat.html"> <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>from conservative columnist Ross Douthat. More recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/15/the-2000-stimulus-cheques-alone-wont-work-the-us-needs-better-infrastructure">articles</a> have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-covid-19-led-to-donald-trumps-defeat-150110">cited the study</a> in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. government’s response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retractions from economics journals have been rarer than for some other subjects, such as the biomedical sciences. A<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/12/12/why-arent-there-more-retractions-in-business-and-economics-journals/"> 2012 study</a> examining retractions of economics papers for plagiarism found only six going back to 2009. But the Retraction Watch Database shows that around 700 economics papers were retracted between 2013 and December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion of the retraction on Twitter was mixed. Economist Florian Ederer<a href="https://twitter.com/florianederer/status/1613112047926902786"> </a>applauded the authors for retracting the paper.</p>

<p>Others were more critical of the retraction notice, particularly the assertion that the code used in the study no longer exists.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t really understand the reason,” wrote Tim Martens, an assistant professor of accounting at Bocconi University in Italy, in a<a href="https://twitter.com/econ_martens/status/1613116811079258113"> reply to Ederer’s tweet</a>. “Did their dogs eat the code?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hydrogel-electronics-nanostructure-materials">Want a ‘Shrinky Dinks’ approach to nano-sized devices? Try hydrogels</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-tech shrink art may be the key to making tiny electronics, 3-D nanostructures or even holograms for hiding secret messages.</p>



<p>A new approach to making tiny structures relies on <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrinking them down after building them</a>, rather than making them small to begin with, researchers report in the Dec. 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The key is spongelike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breakup-doesnt-keep-hydrogel-down">hydrogel materials</a> that expand or contract in response to surrounding chemicals (<em>SN: 1/20/10</em>). By inscribing patterns in hydrogels with a laser and then shrinking the gels down to about one-thirteenth their original size, the researchers created patterns with details as small as 25 billionths of a meter across.</p>





<p>At that level of precision, the researchers could create letters small enough to easily write this entire article along the circumference of a typical human hair.</p>



<p>Biological scientist Yongxin Zhao and colleagues deposited a variety of materials in the patterns to create nanoscopic images of Chinese zodiac animals. By shrinking the hydrogels after laser etching, several of the images ended up roughly the size of a red blood cell. They included a monkey made of silver, a gold-silver alloy pig, a titanium dioxide snake, an iron oxide dog and a rabbit made of luminescent nanoparticles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="503" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline-503x450.jpg" alt="two red dragons made from hydrogels" class="wp-image-3120791" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline-503x450.jpg 503w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline-428x383.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline-208x186.jpg 208w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline-649x580.jpg 649w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010523_jr_nano-structures_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120791">These two dragons, each roughly 40 micrometers long, were made by depositing cadmium selenide quantum dots onto a laser-etched hydrogel. The red stripes on the left dragon are each just 200 nanometers thick.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120791">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Carnegie Mellon University</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Because the hydrogels can be repeatedly shrunk and expanded with chemical baths, the researchers were also able to create holograms in layers inside a chunk of hydrogel to encode secret information. Shrinking a hydrogel hologram makes it unreadable. “If you want to read it, you have to expand the sample,” says Zhao, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “But you need to expand it to exactly the same extent” as the original. In effect, knowing how much to expand the hydrogel serves as a key to unlock the information hidden inside. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the most exciting aspect of the research, Zhao says, is the wide range of materials that researchers can use on such minute scales. “We will be able to combine different types of materials together and make truly functional nanodevices.”</p>

<p>Tiny, pond-dwelling <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215000120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Halteria</em> ciliates are virovores</a>, able to survive on a virus-only diet, researchers report December 27 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The single-celled creatures are the first known to thrive when viruses alone are on the menu.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that some microscopic organisms snack on aquatic viruses such as chloroviruses, which infect and kill algae. But it was unclear whether viruses alone could provide enough nutrients for an organism to grow and reproduce, says ecologist John DeLong of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>





<p>In laboratory experiments, <em>Halteria</em> that were living in water droplets and given only chloroviruses for sustenance reproduced, DeLong and colleagues found. As the number of viruses in the water dwindled, <em>Halteria</em> numbers went up. Ciliates without access to viral morsels, or any other food, didn’t multiply. But <em>Paramecium</em>, a larger microbe, didn’t thrive on a virus-only diet, hinting that viruses can’t satisfy the nutritional requirements for all ciliates to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Viruses could be a good source of phosphorus, which is essential for making copies of genetic material, DeLong says. But it probably takes a lot of viruses to account for a full meal.</p>



<p>In the lab, each <em>Halteria</em> microbe ate about 10,000 to 1 million viruses daily, the team estimates. <em>Halteria</em> in small ponds with abundant viral snacks might chow down on about a quadrillion viruses per day.</p>



<p>These feasts could shunt previously unrecognized energy into the food web, and add a new layer to the way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-plankton-held-hostage-pirate-viruses">viruses move carbon</a> through an ecosystem — if it happens in the wild, DeLong says (<em>SN: 6/9/16</em>). His team plans to start finding out once ponds in Nebraska thaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There shouldn’t have been many differences between the women recruited for the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14767058.2015.1011121?journalCode=ijmf20">three</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767058.2016.1192601">clinical</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-015-3911-y">trials</a>: All of them gave birth at the same two Cairo hospitals over a period of less than three years, and all of them were treated to prevent or manage postpartum bleeding. Three samples from this pool of patients, Ben Mol felt, should have had largely similar baseline characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, mysteriously, the women’s mean age and BMI varied markedly across the studies—from 25 to 34 years and from 25 to 29 kg/m2, respectively—as did the birthweight of their babies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the researcher turned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">data sleuth</a> began digging. His worries only grew. Eventually, he would come to question the integrity of <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">nearly two dozen randomized controlled trials</a> led by Ahmed Maged, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Egypt&#8217;s top medical school, Kasr AlAiny at Cairo University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, based in part on Mol’s findings, two journals published by Taylor &amp; Francis have issued a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">retraction</a> and nine expressions of concern for the following papers:</p>



<span id="more-126410"></span>

</ul>



<p>&#8220;What we see here, nine expressions of concern in one month, is really a breakthrough,&#8221; Ben Mol, who leads the Evidence-based Women’s Health Care research group at Monash University, in Australia, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Among these titles, there are papers that inform the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, which is maternal-mortality cause number one around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This stuff ends up in <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011689.pub2/full">meta-analyses</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This is the first time a journal has publicly expressed concern over Maged’s work. Mol, however, has taken aim at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">research</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/10/critics-face-legal-threats-as-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-act/">from</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/">Egypt</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/15/how-journal-editors-kept-questionable-data-about-womens-health-out-of-the-literature-years-before-retractions/">several</a> times before, using statistical techniques and simple reasoning to flag potential fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor and publisher of <em>The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care</em>, which retracted a 2018 report by Maged and his colleagues titled “Benefits of vaginal misoprostol prior to IUD insertion in women with previous caesarean delivery: a randomised controlled trial,” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">state</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, significant concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data and reported results in the article. While the authors have fully cooperated with the investigation and provided information in response to our queries, they have not been able to adequately address the concerns raised. As we cannot verify the validity of the published work, we are therefore retracting the article. The authors listed in this publication have been informed, and they do not agree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science; the nine papers that earned expressions of concern from <em>The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine</em> have been cited 86 times in total. </p>



<p>In each of these nine cases, the journal notes that the authors have provided their raw data, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have also referred concerns about this paper to the authors’ institution, in order to conduct a full investigation. As this investigation may take some time to resolve, we advise readers to interpret the information presented in the article with due caution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sabina Alam, director of Publishing Ethics and Integrity at Taylor &amp; Francis, told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction and expressions of concern notices have come about as a result of an investigation being carried out by my Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity team. This investigation does stem partly from concerns raised by Ben Mol about specific papers, but also partly from issues raised through internal audits of our journals. We take cases of unethical conduct very seriously and comply fully with COPE guidelines in any investigation we undertake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added that her team nearly doubled in size last year, reflecting a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">growing industry trend</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis has been investing in resources for ethics and integrity so that my team is now able to lead all large or complex ethics cases, like this one. This brings more expertise and consistency to the investigations and subsequent resolutions of such cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expressions of concern include two of the three studies of women with postpartum bleeding. The third was published in the Springer journal <em>Maternal-Fetal Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol emailed Maged with his concerns in the summer of 2020, two months before he and his colleagues submitted <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">the paper</a> detailing their findings to the <em>American Journal of Perinatology</em>. Later, he also shared his misgivings with the 13 journals that have published the dozens of reports spawned by Maged&#8217;s clinical trials. So far, Taylor &amp; Francis is the only publisher to have taken visible measures as a result.</p>



<p>Maged has defended his work vociferously on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Ahmed+M.+Maged%22">PubPeer</a>, but appears to have offered little by way of evidence or scientific explanations. Instead, in an August email to Monash that Retraction Watch has seen, he accused Mol of &#8220;racist behavior&#8221; and &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; He sounded the same notes in an email to Retraction Watch, adding several unsubstantiated claims and noting that he and his coauthors:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… completely refused the retraction as no evidence that require retraction was proved by either the complainer or the editor. The authors believe that if all these issues undergo a fair, ethical, and unbiased investigations, the journal will withdraw the retraction and expression of concerns.</p>



<p>Wait for the new evidence and changes of these decisions within the near time</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mol told Retraction Watch what drives him “is that I&#8217;m very concerned actually about the impact [scientific misconduct] has on the outcomes of meta-analyses and therefore guidelines all around the world.”</p>



<p>He believes fraud is much more widespread in the literature than most people realize and that blindly trusting the data is a risky proposition:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>So it&#8217;s nice to say that we should work on trust, but whether you talk about your tax return or sports or the safety of airplanes, right, there are controls and checks there … I think that nobody actually has really considered that this happened on such a large scale, and I think that is still part of the problem that editors and publishers do not believe that it&#8217;s happening on such a big scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidna-snot-bubble-cooling">These adorable Australian spike-balls beat the heat with snot bubbles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals cover themselves in all kinds of unsavory fluids to keep cool. Humans sweat, kangaroos spit and some birds will urinate on themselves to survive hot days. It turns out that echidnas do something much cuter — though perhaps just as sticky (and slightly icky) — to beat the heat.</p>



<p>The spiny insectivores <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay cool by blowing snot bubbles</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. The bubbles pop, keeping the critters’ noses moist. As it evaporates, this moisture draws heat away from a blood-filled sinus in the echidna’s beak, helping to cool the animal’s blood.</p>





<p>Short-beaked echidnas (<em>Tachyglossus aculeatus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidnas-do-list-sleep-eat-dig-australia">look a bit like hedgehogs but are really monotremes</a> — egg-laying mammals unique to Australia and New Guinea (<em>SN: 11/18/16</em>). Previous lab studies showed that temperatures above 35° Celsius (95° Fahrenheit) should kill echidnas. But echidnas don’t seem to have gotten the memo. They live everywhere from tropical rainforests to deserts to snow-capped peaks, leaving scientists with a physiological puzzle.</p>



<p>Mammals evaporate water to keep cool when temperatures climb above their body temperatures, says environmental physiologist Christine Cooper of Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “Lots of mammals do that by either licking, sweating or panting,” she says. “Echidnas weren’t believed to be able to do that.” But it’s known that the critters blow snot bubbles when it gets hot.</p>



<p>So, armed with a heat-vision camera and a telephoto lens, Cooper and environmental physiologist Philip Withers of the University of Western Australia in Perth drove through nature reserves in Western Australia once a month for a year to film echidnas.</p>



<p>In infrared, the warmest parts of the echidnas’ spiny bodies glowed in oranges, yellows and whites. But the video revealed that the tips of their noses were dark purple blobs, kept cool as moisture from their snot bubbles evaporated. Echidnas might also lose heat through their bellies and legs, the researchers report, while their spikes could act as an insulator.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="See where echidnas’ bodies are hot — and where they’re not | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDzYMU0iLuI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An echidna looks like a hot spiky ball of yellow, orange and white in this heat-vision video — except for its chilly nose, which shows up as a purple and black blob. That’s because these Australian mammals blow snot bubbles to keep their noses wet, which cools the critters down as the moisture evaporates, a new study concludes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Finding a way of doing this work in the field is pretty exciting,” says physiological ecologist Stewart Nicol of the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, who was not involved in the study. “You can understand animals and see how they&#8217;re responding to their normal environment.” The next step, he says, is to quantify how much heat echidnas really lose through their noses and other body parts.</p>



<p>Monotremes parted evolutionary ways with other mammals between 250 million and 160 million years ago as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tethys-ocean-implicated-pangaea-breakup">the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/15</em>). So “they have a whole lot of traits that are considered to be primitive,” Cooper says. “Understanding how they might thermoregulate can give us some ideas about how thermal regulation … might have evolved in mammals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemists-long-lasting-roman-concrete">These chemists cracked the code to long-lasting Roman concrete</a></h4>

              
                <p>MIT chemist Admir Masic really hoped his experiment wouldn’t explode.</p>



<p>Masic and his colleagues were trying to re-create an ancient Roman technique for making concrete, a mix of cement, gravel, sand and water. The researchers suspected that the key was a process called “hot mixing,” in which dry granules of calcium oxide, also called quicklime, are mixed with volcanic ash to make the cement. Then water is added.</p>



<p>Hot mixing, they thought, would ultimately produce a cement that wasn’t completely smooth and mixed, but instead contained small calcium-rich rocks. Those little rocks, ubiquitous in the walls of the Romans’ concrete buildings, might be the key to why those structures have withstood the ravages of time.</p>





<p>That’s not how modern cement is made. The reaction of quicklime with water is highly exothermic, meaning that it can produce a lot of heat — and possibly an explosion.</p>



<p>“Everyone would say, ‘You are crazy,’” Masic says.</p>



<p>But no big bang happened. Instead, the reaction produced only heat, a damp sigh of water vapor — and a Romans-like cement mixture bearing small white calcium-rich rocks.</p>



<p>Researchers have been trying for decades to re-create the Roman recipe for concrete longevity — but with little success. The idea that hot mixing was the key was an educated guess.</p>



<p>Masic and colleagues had pored over texts by Roman architect Vitruvius and historian Pliny, which offered some clues as to how to proceed. These texts cited, for example, strict specifications for the raw materials, such as that the limestone that is the source of the quicklime must be very pure, and that mixing quicklime with hot ash and then adding water could produce a lot of heat.</p>



<p>The rocks were not mentioned, but the team had a feeling they were important.</p>





<p>“In every sample we have seen of ancient Roman concrete, you can find these white inclusions,” bits of rock embedded in the walls. For many years, Masic says, the origin of those inclusions was unclear — researchers suspected incomplete mixing of the cement, perhaps. But these are the highly organized Romans we’re talking about. How likely is it that “every operator [was] not mixing properly and every single [building] has a flaw?”</p>



<p>What if, the team suggested, these inclusions in the cement were actually a feature, not a bug? The researchers’ chemical analyses of such rocks embedded in the walls at the archaeological site of Privernum in Italy indicated that the inclusions were very calcium-rich. </p>



<p>That suggested the tantalizing possibility that these rocks might be helping the buildings heal themselves from cracks due to weathering or even an earthquake. A ready supply of calcium was already on hand: It would dissolve, seep into the cracks and re-crystallize. Voila! Scar healed.</p>



<p>But could the team observe this in action? Step one was to re-create the rocks via hot mixing and hope nothing exploded. Step two: Test the Roman-inspired cement. The team created concrete with and without the hot mixing process and tested them side by side. Each block of concrete was broken in half, the pieces placed a small distance apart. Then water was trickled through the crack to see how long it took before the seepage stopped.</p>



<p>“The results were stunning,” Masic says. The blocks incorporating hot mixed cement healed within two to three weeks. The concrete produced without hot mixed cement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never healed at all</a>, the team reports January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Cracking the recipe could be a boon to the planet. The Pantheon and its soaring, detailed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-concrete-planet-strange-and-fascinating-story-worlds-most-common-man-made">concrete dome have stood nearly 2,000 years</a>, for instance, while modern concrete structures have a lifespan of perhaps 150 years, and that’s a best case scenario (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>). And the Romans didn’t have steel reinforcement bars shoring up their structures.</p>



<p>More frequent replacements of concrete structures means more greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete manufacturing is a huge source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, so longer-lasting versions could reduce that carbon footprint. &#8220;We make 4 gigatons per year of this material,” Masic says. That manufacture produces as much as 1 metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per metric ton of produced concrete, currently amounting to about 8 percent of annual global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>



<p>Still, Masic says, the concrete industry is resistant to change. For one thing, there are concerns about introducing new chemistry into a tried-and-true mixture with well-known mechanical properties. But “the key bottleneck in the industry is the cost,” he says. Concrete is cheap, and companies don’t want to price themselves out of competition.</p>



<p>The researchers hope that reintroducing this technique that has stood the test of time, and that could involve little added cost to manufacture, could answer both these concerns. In fact, they’re banking on it: Masic and several of his colleagues have created a startup they call DMAT that is currently seeking seed money to begin to commercially produce the Roman-inspired hot-mixed concrete. “It’s very appealing simply because it’s a thousands-of-years-old material.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cyclones-arctic-intense-frequent-climate">Cyclones in the Arctic are becoming more intense and frequent</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> – In January 2022, a cyclone blitzed a large expanse of ice-covered ocean between Greenland and Russia. Frenzied gusts galvanized 8-meter-tall waves that pounded the region’s hapless flotillas of sea ice, while a bombardment of warm rain and a surge of southerly heat laid siege from the air.</p>



<p>Six days after the assault began, about a quarter, or roughly 400,000 square kilometers, of the vast area’s sea ice had disappeared, leading to a record weekly loss for the region.</p>





<p>The storm is the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD037161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest Arctic cyclone ever documented</a>. But it may not hold that title for long. Cyclones in the Arctic have become more frequent and intense in recent decades, posing risks to both sea ice and people, researchers reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. “This trend is expected to persist as the region continues to warm rapidly in the future,” says climate scientist Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<h4>Rapid Arctic warming and more destructive storms</h4>



<p>The Arctic Circle is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">about four times as fast</a> as the rest of Earth (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). A major driver is the loss of sea ice due to human-caused climate change. The floating ice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-reflection-light-dim-earthshine-moon-solar-radiation">reflects far more solar radiation</a> back into space than naked seas do, influencing the global climate (<em>SN: 10/14/21</em>). During August, the heart of the sea ice melting season, cyclones have been observed to amplify sea ice losses on average, exacerbating warming.</p>



<p>There’s more: Like hurricanes can ravage regions farther south, boreal vortices can threaten <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-report-card-how-poor-environmental-health-affects-everyday-life">people living and traveling in the Arctic</a> (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). As the storms intensify, “stronger winds pose a risk for marine navigation by generating higher waves,” Vavrus says, “and for coastal erosion, which has already become a serious problem throughout much of the Arctic and forced some communities to consider relocating inland.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">Climate change is intensifying storms farther south</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). But it’s unclear how Arctic cyclones might be changing as the world warms. Some previous research suggested that pressures, on average, in Arctic cyclones’ cores have dropped in recent decades. That would be problematic, as lower pressures generally mean more intense storms, with “stronger winds, larger temperature variations and heavier rainfall [and] snowfall,” says atmospheric scientist Xiangdong Zhang of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</p>



<p>But inconsistencies between analyses had prevented a clear trend from emerging, Zhang said at the meeting. So he and his colleagues aggregated a comprehensive record, spanning 1950 to 2021, of Arctic cyclone timing, intensity and duration.</p>



<p><a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1095296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctic cyclone activity has intensified in strength and frequency</a> over recent decades, Zhang reported. Pressures in the hearts of today’s boreal vortices are on average about 9 millibars lower than in the 1950s. For context, such a pressure shift would be roughly equivalent to bumping a strong category 1 hurricane well into category 2 territory. And vortices became more frequent during winters in the North Atlantic Arctic and during summers in the Arctic north of Eurasia.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Storm surge</h3>



<p>In the last decade, strong vortices — with central pressures lower than 990 millibars — appeared in the Arctic more often each year, on average, than in the 1950s, up about 20 percent in the summer and 35 percent in the winter.</p>

<p>What’s more, August cyclones appear to be <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1053374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damaging sea ice more than in the past</a>, said meteorologist Peter Finocchio of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, Calif. He and his colleagues compared the response of northern sea ice to summer cyclones during the 1990s and the 2010s.</p>



<p>August vortices in the latter decade were followed by a 10 percent loss of sea ice area on average, up from the earlier decade’s 3 percent loss on average. This may be due, in part, to warmer water upwelling from below, which can melt the ice pack’s underbelly, and from winds pushing the thinner, easier-to-move ice around, Finocchio said.</p>



<h4>Stronger spring storms spell trouble too</h4>



<p>With climate change, cyclones may <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1092888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue intensifying in the spring too</a>, climate scientist Chelsea Parker said at the meeting. That’s a problem because spring vortices can prime sea ice for later summer melting.</p>



<p>Parker, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and her colleagues ran computer simulations of spring cyclone behavior in the Arctic under past, present and projected climate conditions. By the end of the century, the maximum near-surface wind speeds of spring cyclones — around 11 kilometers per hour today — could reach 60 km/h, the researchers found. And future spring cyclones may keep swirling at peak intensity for up to a quarter of their life spans, up from around 1 percent today. The storms will probably travel farther too, the team says.</p>



<p>“The diminishing sea ice cover will enable the warmer Arctic seas to fuel these storms and probably allow them to penetrate farther into the Arctic,” says Vavrus, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Parker and her team plan to investigate the future evolution of Arctic cyclones in other seasons, to capture a broader picture of how climate change is affecting the storms.</p>



<p>For now, it seems certain that Arctic cyclones aren’t going anywhere. What&#8217;s less clear is how humankind will contend with the storms&#8217; growing fury.</p>
