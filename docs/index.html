<p>A space scientist formerly based at the University of Sydney made up data in an unpublished manuscript, an investigation by the institution has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachim-schmidt-63370730/?originalSubdomain=au">Joachim Schmidt</a>, “utilised Adobe Photoshop to make up results,” according to a letter dated Feb. 15, 2023, from Emma Johnston, deputy vice-chancellor of research at the University of Sydney, to scientists at the University of Michigan who reported complaints in late 2019 about work by Schmidt and his former professor <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/iver-cairns.html">Iver Cairns</a> to the Australian institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the above, the Panel found there had been breaches of the Research Code on the part of Dr Schmidt. The breaches were viewed as serious, and the Panel considered them to be sufficiently serious to warrant a finding of research misconduct as defined in the <em>Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</em>,” the letter, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/230215-Letter-to-Prof-Toth-Dr-vanderHolst-Prof-Manchester-re-Investigation-outcome-1-1-1.pdf">obtained by Retraction Watch</a>, stated.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126776"></span>



<p>The fabricated image appears in a manuscript about the effects of weather in space Schmidt wrote with Cairns. The paper has yet to be published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sydney has also launched a probe into all the images published in papers Schmidt co-authored in the last five years, according to the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2020, Sydney <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/11/20/university-wins-coveted-space-award.html">was named</a> the Academic Institution of the Year at the Australian Space Awards, and Cairns was one of the scientists who accepted the award. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachim-schmidt-63370730/?originalSubdomain=au">his LinkedIn page</a>, Schmidt was a lecturer at Sydney’s School of Physics from November 2010 to March 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schmidt could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Sydney told <em>Retraction Watch</em> that Schmidt had not been dismissed from the university; instead, he left the institution after his fixed-term contract expired.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/toth-gabor/">Gábor Toth</a>, one of the scientists at the University of Michigan whose model Schmidt used, noticed the fishy image in the manuscript when Cairns emailed it to him and asked if he wanted to be a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Schmidt-Cairns-Investigation-report_redacted-1.pdf">redacted version of a Jan. 2023 report</a> on the case obtained by <em>Retraction Watch</em>, the investigation panel determined that Schmidt used Photoshop “to alter or create” a figure in the 2019 manuscript that was purported to be the output of Toth’s model. Neither Schmidt nor digital forensics experts could reproduce the image with the model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel concluded that Schmidt alone produced the Photoshopped figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At interview, Professor Cairns explained that he has no experience with Photoshop, confirmed that he did not make any amendments, and could not recall asking Dr Schmidt to make any adjustments using Photoshop,” the report stated. It noted that the creation or alteration of the figure “amounted to fabrication and falsification on the part of Dr Schmidt.”</p>



<p>“​​The cheating is so obvious that it can be understood by anyone, no scientific knowledge is needed,” Toth told <em>Retraction Watch.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/richard-de-grijs">Richard de Grijs</a>, a physicist at MacQuarie University in Australia, and <a href="https://staffprofile.usq.edu.au/Profile/Rob-Wittenmyer">Rob Wittenmyer</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of South Queensland, who carried out the investigation, wrote in the report that if one were to accept Schmidt’s claim that he used Photoshop to make the internal structures of the image brighter and more visible, there would need to be an explanatory note in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This should have been done at the draft stage so that Professor Cairns and other prospective authors were made aware of the adjustments for the purposes of their consideration of the draft paper,” they wrote.</p>



<p>The report exonerated Cairns of any wrongdoing, noting that he had no involvement in producing the figure in question and wasn’t aware that Schmidt had fabricated and falsified the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Toth isn’t satisfied. He said Cairns deserves some blame and that clearing him of wrongdoing is “completely irresponsible”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cairns declined to comment, citing confidentiality agreements. Wittenmyer and de Grijs also declined to comment on their report, citing confidentiality.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Toth has claimed nobody in the community believes the results described in Schmidt and Cairns’ other papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.167751578.81634844/v1">rebuttal he published on another of Schmidt and Cairns’ preprints last month</a>, Toth wrote the results were so outlandish they had “only one reasonable explanation”: that they “were most likely not obtained by reproducible numerical simulations.” Previous papers by the duo using the same technique are “similarly questionable,” Toth wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It also seems likely that several published papers with questionable content have slipped through the peer review process,” Toth continued. “Readers and reviewers who only rely on the manuscript and published papers may or may not be able to distinguish genuine science from the type of content presented by [Schmidt and Cairns].”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seeds-alan-turing-patterns-nature-math">Chia seedlings verify Alan Turing’s ideas about patterns in nature</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> – Chia seeds sprouted in trays have experimentally confirmed a mathematical model proposed by computer scientist and polymath Alan Turing decades ago. The model describes how patterns might emerge in desert vegetation, leopard spots and zebra stripes.</p>



<p>These and other blotchy and stripy features in nature are examples of what are called Turing patterns, so named because in 1952, Turing presented equations for how simple interactions between competing factors can lead to surprisingly complex surface patterns. In the case of arid regions, the competition for moisture among plants would drive the intricate distribution of vegetation.</p>





<p>But proving that Turing’s model explains patterns in the real world <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tweaking-pattern-equations">has been challenging</a> (<em>SN: 10/21/15</em>). It wasn’t clear whether Turing’s idea is really behind natural distributions of vegetation. It could be that the idea is a mathematical just-so story that happens to produce similar shapes in a computer, says physicist Flavio Fenton of Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>In research presented at the American Physical Society meeting, Brendan D’Aquino, who studied in Fenton’s lab during the summer of 2022, described an experiment that seems to confirm that <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/F46.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing’s model truly underlies patterns in vegetation</a>.</p>



<p>The team grew chia seeds in even layers in trays and then adjusted the available moisture. In essence, the researchers were experimentally tweaking the factors that appear in the Turing equations. Sure enough, patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged. The patterns also strongly resembled computer simulations of the Turing model.</p>

Simulated landscapes show similar patterns as rainfall increases (left to right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122978">Brendan D’Aquino (photos), Abouzar Kaboudian (simulations)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“In previous studies,” said D’Aquino, who is an undergraduate computer science student at Northeastern University, “people kind of retroactively fit models to observe Turing patterns that they found in the world. But here we were actually able to show that changing the relevant parameters in the model produces experimental results that we would expect.”</p>



<p>Although Turing patterns have been produced in some chemistry experiments and other artificial systems, the team believes this is the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified Turing’s mathematical insight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-human-bodies-health-risks">Microplastics are in our bodies. Here’s why we don’t know the health risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny particles of plastic have been found everywhere — from the deepest place on the planet, the Mariana Trench, to the top of Mount Everest. And now more and more studies are finding that microplastics, defined as plastic pieces less than 5 millimeters across, are also in our bodies.</p>



<p>“What we are looking at is the biggest oil spill ever,” says Maria Westerbos, founder of the Plastic Soup Foundation, an Amsterdam-based nonprofit advocacy organization that works to reduce plastic pollution around the world. Nearly all plastics are made from fossil fuel sources. And microplastics are “everywhere,” she adds, “even in our bodies.”</p>





<p>In recent years, microplastics have been documented in all parts of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722020009?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the human lung</a>, in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal and fetal placental tissues</a>, in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9269371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human breast milk</a> and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human blood</a>. Microplastics scientist Heather Leslie, formerly of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and colleagues found microplastics in blood samples from 17 of 22 healthy adult volunteers in the Netherlands. The finding, published last year in <em>Environment International</em>, confirms what many scientists have long suspected: These tiny bits can get absorbed into the human bloodstream.</p>



<p>“We went from expecting plastic particles to be absorbable and present in the human bloodstream to knowing that they are,” Leslie says.</p>

<h3>Microplastics in the blood</h3>



<p>Microplastic particles were detected in blood samples from 17 of 22 healthy adult volunteers in the Netherlands. The types of polymer present varied across the group — as did the concentrations. Donors 11, 12 and 13 contributed two samples, both with microplastics. For many others (starred), one sample had microplastics and a second did not.</p>

<p>The findings aren’t entirely surprising; plastics are all around us. Durable, versatile and cheap to manufacture, they are in our clothes, cosmetics, electronics, tires, packaging and so many more items of daily use. And the types of plastic materials on the market continues to increase. “There were around 3,000 [plastic materials] when I started researching microplastics over a decade ago,” Leslie says. “Now <a href="https://www.campusplastics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are over 9,600</a>. That’s a huge number, each with its own chemical makeup and potential toxicity.”</p>



<p>Though durable, plastics do degrade, by weathering from water, wind, sunlight or heat — as in ocean environments or in landfills — or by friction, in the case of car tires, which releases plastic particles along roadways during motion and braking.</p>



<p>In addition to studying microplastic particles, researchers are also trying to get a handle on nanoplastics, particles which are less than 1&nbsp;micrometer in length. “The large plastic objects in the environment will break down into micro- and nanoplastics, constantly raising particle numbers,” says toxicologist Dick Vethaak of the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who collaborated with Leslie on the study finding microplastics in human blood.</p>



<p>Nearly two decades ago, marine biologists began drawing attention to the accumulation of microplastics in the ocean and their<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oceans-plastics-offer-floating-fortress-mess-microbes"> potential to interfere with organism and ecosystem health</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;2/20/16, p. 20</em>). But only in recent years have scientists started focusing on microplastics in people’s food and drinking water — as well as in indoor air.</p>



<p>Plastic particles are also intentionally added to cosmetics like lipstick, lip gloss and eye makeup to improve their feel and finish, and to personal care products, such as face scrubs, toothpastes and shower gels, for the cleansing and exfoliating properties. When washed off, these microplastics enter the sewage system. They can end up in the sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, which is used to fertilize agricultural lands, or even in treated water released into waterways.</p>



<p>What if any damage microplastics may do when they get into our bodies is not clear, but a growing community of researchers investigating these questions thinks there is reason for concern. Inhaled particles might irritate and damage the lungs, akin to the damage caused by other particulate matter. And although the composition of plastic particles varies, some contain chemicals that are known to interfere with the body’s hormones.</p>



<p>Currently there are huge knowledge gaps in our understanding of how these particles are processed by the human body.</p>



<h4>How do microplastics get into our bodies?</h4>



<p>Research points to two main entry routes into the human body: We swallow them and we breathe them in.</p>



<p>Evidence is growing that our <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food and water is contaminated with microplastics</a>.

Wheat and lettuce plants have been observed taking up microplastic particles in the lab; uptake from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0567-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soil containing the particles</a> is probably how they get into our produce in the first place.</p>



<p>Sewage sludge can contain microplastics not only from personal care products, but also from washing machines. One study looking at sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in southwest England found that if all the treated sludge produced there were used to fertilize soils, a volume of microplastic particles equivalent to what is found in more than 20,000 plastic credit cards could potentially be released into the environment each month.</p>



<p>On top of that, fertilizers are coated with plastic for controlled release, plastic mulch film is used as a protective layer for crops and water containing microplastics is used for irrigation, says Sophie Vonk, a researcher at the Plastic Soup Foundation.</p>



<p>“Agricultural fields in Europe and North America are estimated to receive far higher quantities of microplastics than global oceans,” Vonk says.</p>

<h3>Microplastics in everyday produce</h3>



<p>Fruits and vegetables purchased at local markets in Catania, Italy, showed wide variability in the numbers of microplastic particles present. The research highlights the need for more studies on the sources of microplastic exposure.</p>

<p>A recent pilot study commissioned by the Plastic Soup Foundation found microplastics in all <a href="https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Final-Report-pilot-study-plastic-particles-in-livestock-feed-milk-meat-and-blood-SIGNED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood samples collected from pigs and cows on Dutch farms</a>, showing livestock are capable of absorbing some of the plastic particles from their feed, water or air. Of the beef and pork samples collected from farms and supermarkets as part of the same study, 75 percent showed the presence of microplastics. Multiple studies document that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-021-00885-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastic particles are also in fish muscle</a>, not just the gut, and so are likely to be consumed when people eat seafood.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214799321000333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microplastics are in our drinking water, whether it’s from the tap or bottled</a>. The particles may enter the water at the source, during treatment and distribution, or, in the case of bottled water, from its packaging.</p>



<p>Results from studies attempting to quantify levels of human ingestion vary dramatically, but they suggest people might be consuming on the order of tens of thousands of microplastic particles per person per year. These estimates may change as more data come in, and they will likely vary depending on people’s diets and where they live. Plus, it is not yet clear how these particles are absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the human body, and if not excreted immediately, how long they might stick around.</p>



<p>Babies might face particularly high exposures. A small study of six infants and 10 adults found that the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00559" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infants had more microplastic particles in their feces</a> than the adults did. Research suggests <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics can enter the fetus via the placenta</a>, and babies could also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9269371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingest the particles via breast milk</a>. The use of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00171-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic feeding bottles</a> and teething toys adds to children’s microplastics exposure.</p>



<p>Microplastic particles are also floating in the air. Research conducted in Paris to <a href="https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01195546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document microplastic levels in indoor air</a> found concentrations ranging from three to 15 particles per cubic meter of air. Outdoor concentrations were much lower.</p>



<p>Airborne particles may turn out to be more of a concern than those in food. One study reported in 2018 compared the amount of microplastics present <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within mussels harvested off Scotland’s coasts</a> with the amount of microplastics present in indoor air. Exposure to microplastic fibers from the air during the meal was far higher than the risk of ingesting microplastics from the mussels themselves.</p>



<p>Extrapolating from this research, immunologist Nienke Vrisekoop of the University Medical Center Utrecht says, “If I keep a piece of fish on the table for an hour, it has probably gathered more microplastics from the ambient air than it has from the ocean.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where in the air?</h3>



<p>Concentrations of microplastics and nanoplastics in the air likely vary with location. Researchers are interested in studying various settings to better understand human exposure and risk including traffic lights, indoor sports stadiums, textile factories and living rooms.</p>

<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722020009?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study of human lung tissue</a> reported last year offers solid evidence that we are breathing in plastic particles. Microplastics showed up in 11 of 13 samples, including those from the upper, middle and lower lobes, researchers in England reported.</p>



<p>Perhaps good news: Microplastics seem unable to penetrate the skin. “The epidermis holds off quite a lot of stuff from the outside world, including [nano]particles,” Leslie says. “Particles can go deep into your skin, but so far we haven’t observed them passing the barrier, unless the skin is damaged.”</p>



<h4>What do we know about the potential health risks?</h4>



<p>Studies in mice suggest microplastics are not benign. Research in these test animals shows that lab exposure to microplastics can disrupt the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653519327328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut microbiome, lead to inflammation</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389420314199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower sperm quality and testosterone levels</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389422002199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negatively affect learning and memory</a>.</p>



<p>But some of these studies used concentrations that may not be relevant to real-world scenarios. Studies on the health effects of exposure in humans are just getting under way, so it could be years before scientists understand the actual impact in people.</p>



<p>Immunologist Barbro Melgert of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands has studied the effects of nylon microfibers on human tissue grown to resemble lungs. Exposure to nylon fibers reduced both the number and size of airways that formed in these tissues by 67 percent and 50 percent, respectively. “We found that the cause was not the microfibers themselves but rather the chemicals released from them,” Melgert says.</p>



<p>“Microplastics could be considered a form of air pollution,” she says. “We know air pollution particles tend to induce stress in our lungs, and it will probably be the same for microplastics.”</p>



<p>Vrisekoop is studying how the human immune system responds to microplastics. Her unpublished lab experiments suggest immune cells don’t recognize microplastic particles unless they have blood proteins, viruses, bacteria or other contaminants attached. But it is likely that such bits will attach to microplastic particles out in the environment and inside the body. </p>



<p>“If the microplastics are not clean … the immune cells [engulf] the particle and die faster because of it,” Vrisekoop says. “More immune cells then rush in.” This marks the start of an immune response to the particle, which could potentially trigger a strong inflammatory reaction or possibly aggravate existing inflammatory diseases of the lungs or gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>Some of the chemicals added to make plastic suitable for particular uses are also known to cause problems for humans: Bisphenol A, or BPA, is used to harden plastic and is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960076011001063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known endocrine disruptor</a> that has been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890623813003456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developmental effects in children and problems with reproductive systems and metabolism in adults</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/09, p. 5</em>). Phthalates, used to make plastic soft and flexible, are associated with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389417304570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adverse effects on fetal development and reproductive problems in adults</a> along with insulin resistance and obesity. And flame retardants that make electronics less flammable are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412014002736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with endocrine, reproductive and behavioral effects</a>.</p>



<p>“Some of these chemical products that I worked on in the past [like the polybrominated diphenyl ethers used as flame retardants] have been phased out or are prohibited to use in new products now [in the European Union and the United States] because of their neurotoxic or disrupting effects,” Leslie says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Concerning chemicals</h3>



<p>Bits of plastic floating in the world’s air and water contain chemicals that may pose risks to human health. A 2021 study identified <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c00976?source=cen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2,400 chemicals of potential concern</a> found in plastics or used in their processing. Here are a few of the most worrisome.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Short-chain chlorinated paraffins</strong> are used as lubricants, flame retardants and plasticizers. They can cause cancer in lab rodents, but the mechanisms may not be relevant for human health.</li>



<li>The chlorinated compound<strong> mirex</strong> was once used as a flame retardant and can persist in the environment. It’s suspected of being a human carcinogen and may affect fertility.</li>



<li><strong>2,4,6-Tri-tert-butylphenol</strong> is an antioxidant and ultraviolet stabilizer, added to plastics to prevent degradation. There’s evidence that it causes liver damage in lab animals with prolonged or repeated exposure.</li>



<li><strong>Benzo(a)pyrene</strong> is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon that can be released when organic matter such as coal or wood burns. It is also produced in grilled meats. It has been shown to cause cancer, damage fertility and affect development in lab animals.</li>



<li><strong>Dibutyl phthalate</strong> is a plasticizer that is known to cause endocrine disruption, may interfere with male fertility and has been shown to affect fetal development in lab animals.</li>



<li><strong>Tetrabromobisphenol-A</strong> is a flame retardant that can cause cancer in lab animals and may be an endocrine disruptor. It is chemically related to bisphenol&nbsp;A, which has been linked to developmental effects in children.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are the open questions?</h4>



<p>The first step in determining the risk of microplastics to human health is to better understand and quantify human exposure. Polyrisk — <a href="https://polyrisk.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five large-scale research projects</a> under CUSP, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and experts from 75 organizations across 21 European countries <a href="https://cusp-research.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying micro- and nanoplastics</a> — is doing exactly that.</p>



<p>Immunotoxicologist Raymond Pieters, of the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences at Utrecht University and coordinator of Polyrisk, and colleagues are studying people’s inhalation exposure in a number of real-life scenarios: near a traffic light, for example, where cars are likely to be braking, versus a highway, where vehicles are continuously moving. Other scenarios under study include an indoor sports stadium, as well as occupational scenarios like the textile and rubber industry.</p>



<p>Melgert wants to know how much microplastic is in our houses, what the particle sizes are and how much we breathe in. “There are very few studies looking at indoor levels [of microplastics],” she says. “We all have stuff in our houses — carpets, insulation made of plastic materials, curtains, clothes — that all give off fibers.”</p>



<p>Vethaak, who co-coordinates <a href="https://momentummicroplastics.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOMENTUM</a>, a consortium of 27 research and industry partners from the Netherlands and seven other countries studying microplastics’ potential effects on human health, is quick to point out that “any measurement of the degree of exposure to plastic particles is likely an underestimation.” In addition to research on the impact of microplastics, the group is also looking at nanoplastics. Studying and analyzing these smallest of plastics in the environment and in our bodies is extremely challenging. “The analytical tools and techniques required for this are still being developed,” Vethaak says.</p>



<p>Vethaak also wants to understand whether microplastic particles coated with bacteria and viruses found in the environment could spread these pathogens and increase infection rates in people. Studies have suggested that microplastics in the ocean can serve as safe havens for germs.</p>



<p>Alongside knowing people’s level of exposure to microplastics, the second big question scientists want to understand is what if any level of real-world exposure is harmful. “This work is confounded by the multitude of different plastic particle types, given their variations in size, shape and chemical composition, which can affect uptake and toxicity,” Leslie says. “In the case of microplastics, it will take several more years to determine what the threshold dose for toxicity is.”</p>



<p>Several countries have banned the use of microbeads in specific categories of products, including rinse-off cosmetics and toothpastes. But there are no regulations or policies anywhere in the world that address the release or concentrations of other microplastics — and there are very few consistent monitoring efforts. California has recently taken a step toward monitoring by approving the world’s first <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/27/california-leads-the-world-in-testing-drinking-water-for-microplastics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements for testing microplastics in drinking water sources</a>. The testing will happen over the next several years.</p>



<p>Pieters is very pragmatic in his outlook: “We know ‘a’ and ‘b,’” he says. “So we can expect ‘c,’ and ‘c’ would [imply] a risk for human health.”</p>



<p>He is inclined to find ways to protect people now even if there is limited or uncertain scientific knowledge. “Why not take a stand for the precautionary principle?” he asks.</p>



<p>For people who want to follow Pieters’ lead, there are ways to reduce exposure.</p>



<p>“Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate,” Melgert says. She recommends not only proper ventilation, including opening your windows at home, but also regular vacuum cleaning and air purification. That can remove dust, which often contains microplastics, from surfaces and the air.</p>



<p>Consumers can also choose to avoid cosmetics and personal care products containing microbeads. Buying clothes made from natural fabrics like cotton, linen and hemp, instead of from synthetic materials like acrylic and polyester, helps reduce the shedding of microplastics during wear and during the washing process.</p>



<p>Specialized microplastics-removal devices, including laundry balls, laundry bags and filters that attach to washing machines, are designed to reduce the number of microfibers making it into waterways.</p>



<p>Vethaak recommends not heating plastic containers in the microwave, even if they claim to be food grade, and not leaving plastic water bottles in the sun.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest thing people can do is rely on plastics less. Reducing overall consumption will reduce plastic pollution, and so reduce microplastics sloughing into the air and water.</p>



<p>Leslie recommends functional substitution: “Before you purchase something, think if you really need it, and if it needs to be plastic.”</p>



<p>Westerbos remains hopeful that researchers and scientists from around the world can come together to find a solution. “We need all the brainpower we have to connect and work together to find a substitute to plastic that is not toxic and doesn’t last [in the environment] as long as plastic does,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-fish-rainbow-light-iridescent">These transparent fish turn rainbow with white light. Now, we know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ghost catfish transforms from glassy to glam when white light passes through its mostly transparent body. Now, scientists know why.</p>



<p>The fish’s iridescence comes from light bending as it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2219300120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travels through microscopic striped structures in the animal’s muscles</a>, researchers report March 13 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Many fishes with iridescent flair have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hardyhead-silverside-fish-crystals-colorful-dots">tiny crystals in their skin or scales</a> that reflect light (<em>SN: 4/6/21</em>). But the ghost catfish (<em>Kryptopterus vitreolus</em>) and other transparent aquatic species, like eel larvae and icefishes, lack such structures to explain their luster.</p>





<p>The ghost catfish’s see-through body caught the eye of physicist Qibin Zhao when he was in an aquarium store. The roughly 5-centimeter-long freshwater fish is a popular ornamental species. “I was standing in front of the tank and staring at the fish,” says Zhao, of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “And then I saw the iridescence.”</p>



<p>To investigate the fish’s colorful properties, Zhao and colleagues first examined the fish under different lighting conditions. The researchers determined its iridescence arose from light passing through the fish rather than reflecting off it. By using a white light laser to illuminate the animal’s muscles and skin separately, the team found that the muscles generated the multicolored sheen.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When backlit with a white light, the mostly transparent ghost catfish becomes iridescent. Microscopic striped structures in the fish’s muscles diffract the light, separating it into different wavelengths. These structures change in length as the fish swims, causing the rainbow colors to flicker. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers then characterized the muscles’ properties by analyzing how X-rays scatter when traveling through the tissue and by looking at it with an electron microscope. The team identified sarcomeres — regularly spaced, banded structures, each roughly 2 micrometers long, that run along the length of muscle fibers — as the source of the iridescence.</p>



<p>The sarcomeres’ repeating bands, comprised of proteins that overlap by varying amounts, bend white light in a way that separates and enhances its different wavelengths. The collective diffraction of light produces an array of colors. When the fish contracts and relaxes its muscles to swim, the sarcomeres slightly change in length, causing a shifting rainbow effect.</p>

Fan <em>et al/PNAS</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The purpose of the ghost catfish’s iridescence is a little unclear, says Heok Hee Ng, an independent ichthyologist in Singapore who was not involved in the new study. Ghost catfish live in murky water and seldom rely on sight, he says. But the iridescence might help them visually coordinate movements when traveling in schools, or it could help them blend in with shimmering water to hide from land predators, like some birds, he adds.</p>



<p>Regardless of function, Ng is excited to see scientists exploring the ghost catfish’s unusual characteristics.</p>





<p>“Fishes actually have quite a number of these interesting structures that serve them in many ways,” he says. “And a lot of these structures are very poorly studied.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">Mathematicians have finally discovered an elusive ‘einstein’ tile</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 13-sided shape known as “the hat” has mathematicians tipping their caps.</p>



<p>It’s the first true example of an “einstein,” a single shape that forms a special tiling of a plane: Like bathroom floor tile, it can cover an entire surface with no gaps or overlaps but only with a pattern that never repeats.</p>



<p>“Everybody is astonished and is delighted, both,” says mathematician Marjorie Senechal of Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who was not involved with the discovery. Mathematicians had been searching for such a shape for half a century. “It wasn’t even clear that such a thing could exist,” Senechal says.</p>





<p>Although the name “einstein” conjures up the iconic physicist, it comes from the German <em>ein Stein</em>, meaning “one stone,” referring to the single tile. The einstein sits in a weird purgatory between order and disorder. Though the tiles fit neatly together and can cover an infinite plane, they are aperiodic, meaning they can’t form a pattern that repeats.</p>



<p>With a periodic pattern, it’s possible to shift the tiles over and have them match up perfectly with their previous arrangement. An infinite checkerboard, for example, looks just the same if you slide the rows over by two. While it’s possible to arrange other single tiles in patterns that are not periodic, the hat is special because there’s no way it can create a periodic pattern.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="412" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1.jpg" alt="An image of a &quot;hat&quot; which is made up of eight dark gray, small, kite shapes." class="wp-image-3123084" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1-632x383.jpg 632w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1-307x186.jpg 307w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123084">The “hat” (one highlighted) is a polygon made up of eight smaller kite shapes (dark gray lines).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123084">D. Smith <em>et al</em>/<em>arXiv.org</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Identified by David Smith, a nonprofessional mathematician who describes himself as an “imaginative tinkerer of shapes,” and reported in a paper posted online March 20 at arXiv.org, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hat is a polykite</a> — a bunch of smaller kite shapes stuck together. That’s a type of shape that hadn’t been studied closely in the search for einsteins, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss of the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City, one of a group of trained mathematicians and computer scientists Smith teamed up with to study the hat.</p>



<p>It’s a surprisingly simple polygon. Before this work, if you’d asked what an einstein would look like, Goodman-Strauss says, “I would’ve drawn some crazy, squiggly, nasty thing.”</p>



<p>Mathematicians previously knew of nonrepeating tilings that involved multiple tiles of different shapes. In the 1970s, mathematician Roger Penrose discovered that just two different shapes formed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-islamic-penrose-tiles-0">tiling that isn’t periodic</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/07</em>). From there, “It was natural to wonder, could there be a single tile that does this?” says mathematician Casey Mann of the University of Washington Bothell, who was not involved with the research. That one has finally been found, “it’s huge.”</p>

But Taylor-Socolar tiles have disconnected pieces (illustrated), stretching the definition of a tile.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123086">Parcly Taxel/Wikimedia Commons (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Other shapes have come close. Taylor-Socolar tiles are aperiodic, but they are a jumble of multiple disconnected pieces — not what most people think of as a single tile. “This is the first solution without asterisks,” says mathematician Michaël Rao of CNRS and École Normale Supérieure de Lyon in France.</p>



<p>Smith and colleagues proved that the tile was an einstein in two ways. One came from noticing that the hats arrange themselves into larger clusters, called metatiles. Those metatiles then arrange into even larger supertiles, and so on indefinitely, in a type of hierarchical structure that is common for tilings that aren’t periodic. This approach revealed that the hat tiling could fill an entire infinite plane, and that its pattern would not repeat.</p>





<p>The second proof relied on the fact that the hat is part of a continuum of shapes: By gradually changing the relative lengths of the sides of the hat, the mathematicians were able to form a family of tiles that can take on the same nonrepeating pattern. By considering the relative sizes and shapes of the tiles at the extremes of that family — one shaped like a chevron and the other reminiscent of a comet — the team was able to show that the hat couldn’t be arranged in a periodic pattern.</p>

By comparing shapes at the extremes of this family, one shaped like a chevron and the other reminiscent of a comet, the researchers were able to show that the hat couldn’t form a pattern that repeats.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the paper has yet to be peer-reviewed, the experts interviewed for this article agree that the result seems likely to hold up to detailed scrutiny.</p>



<p>Nonrepeating patterns can have real-world connections. Materials scientist Dan Shechtman won the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unusual-crystal-patterns-win-chemistry-nobel">his discovery of quasicrystals</a>, materials with atoms arranged in an orderly structure that never repeats, often described as analogs to Penrose’s tilings (<em>SN: 10/5/11</em>). The new aperiodic tile could spark further investigations in materials science, Senechal says.</p>



<p>Similar tilings have inspired artists, and the hat appears to be no exception. Already the tiling has been rendered artistically as <a href="https://twitter.com/alytile/status/1638506055381708801?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smiling turtles</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/RobFathauerArt/status/1638244474349555714?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumble of shirts and hats</a>. Presumably it’s only a matter of time before someone puts hat tiles on a hat.</p>

<p>And the hat isn’t the end. Researchers should continue the hunt for additional einsteins, says computer scientist Craig Kaplan of the University of Waterloo in Canada, a coauthor of the study. “Now that we’ve unlocked the door, hopefully other new shapes will come along.”</p>

<p>Three major publishers have removed several authors’ names from five papers, most published a decade ago, following correspondence from an attorney representing one of the individuals.</p>



<p>Three of the papers appeared in <em>PLOS ONE </em>in 2013, one appeared in Springer Nature’s <em>Tumor Biology</em> the same year, and one appeared in Elsevier’s <em>Obesity Research &amp; Clinical Practice</em> in 2014. As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/11/author-loses-five-papers-most-for-compromised-peer-review/">reported in 2016</a>, the journals retracted the articles because one of the authors – Lishan Wang – had forged the rest of his co-authors’ names and manipulated the peer review process.</p>



<p>Years later, Yongyong Shi, a distinguished professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Bio-X Institutes and one of the authors whose name Wang forged, hired a lawyer named <a href="https://www.dorsey.com/people/l/lewin-joseph">Joseph Lewin</a>, a solicitor with Dorsey &amp; Whitney (Europe) LLP. Lewin, in turn, requested that the three publishers remove Shi’s name from the original papers.</p>



<span id="more-126758"></span>



<p>Elsevier <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871403X17300807">appears to have done that in September 2021</a>. Springer Nature complied in March 2022. And PLOS <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160299">did so in June 2022</a>.</p>



<p>The move is “extremely rare,” Renee Hoch, managing editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team, told Retraction Watch. “Over a period of several years, I recall fewer than 5 cases at PLOS.” Hoch continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is not uncommon for us to receive such requests from authors, but in accordance with the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/files/cope-retraction-guidelines-v2.pdf">COPE Retraction Guidelines</a> we almost always decline these requests and preserve the original published record of the research, including the article’s authorship and contributions. We hold authors to the contributor information they provided prior to publication, and we recognize that requests to remove authors following a retraction decision may be motivated by competing interests involving anticipated impacts of a retraction on the requestor’s professional standing.</p>



<p>However, we have had a couple of cases in which there was very strong evidence to support claims that an individual did not contribute to the published work and was included on an author list without their knowledge or consent. In these cases, we concluded that the individual in question was not truly an author of the article in question and we amended the published record accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Asked about any involvement from Shi’s attorney, Hoch said: “We cannot provide any details about this case beyond what was published in the retraction notices.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature confirmed that Shi was removed as an author in March 2022, but said that “due to legal reasons, I’m afraid we cannot share any further information.” An Elsevier spokesperson would not confirm when Shi and the others were removed as authors, saying only:&nbsp; “We are bound by confidentiality on this retraction, so the only official statement is the retraction notice itself.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We learned of the authorship changes on Dec. 20, 2022, when Lewin emailed us a letter demanding we remove Shi’s name from the five relevant entries in the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?http://retractiondatabase.org/">Retraction Watch Database</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lewin’s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">letter</a>, which we interpreted as a legal threat, also demanded we respond within 10 business days. (Note that the letter arrived by email just a few business days before the traditional Christmas holiday.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the event that the confirmation requested above is not received within that time limit, our client will need to take the appropriate legal next steps,” Lewin concluded, citing various statutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told us this week that he was “sorry” we found the letter threatening, adding: “We do not agree with that characterisation.”</p>



<p><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">Judge for yourself</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This was the first we had heard from Shi, or anyone representing him, since our post in 2016. We told Lewin that to make any changes to the database we would need to learn more about what had happened in the intervening years that prompted three major publishers to take an unusual step. We also informed him that for the sake of transparency – and because it is an interesting story about retractions – we would publish a post on Retraction Watch about the development.</p>



<p>Lewin did not agree, writing that “we do not understand that there would be any need to update previous coverage or to quote from any confidential correspondence.” He added: “If Retraction Watch believes it would be helpful to make a post, then we would require that the wording of such a post to be agreed in advance with our client to avoid any further damage being caused.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch readers will not be surprised that we did not find that suggestion acceptable.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After more than two months of back and forth, we asked Lewin for his client’s responses to these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Please tell us, in your own words, how you came to be listed as an author on the original paper.</li>



<li>Please forward any reports of the “institutional investigation, conducted by the Administration Office of Bio-X Institutes at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,” referred to by several of the retraction notices.</li>



<li>Please indicate what steps, including legal threats to journals and/or publishers, that you took to have your name removed as an author of the five papers to which your attorney’s Dec. 20, 2022 letter refers.</li>



<li>Please forward any correspondence you and/or your attorneys have had with PLOS, Elsevier, and Springer Nature regarding these five papers.</li>



<li>Please indicate when your name was removed from the original papers.</li>



<li>We did not hear from you from 2017 until the letter from your attorney in December 2022, years after these entries were added to the database. Can you explain the delay?</li>
</ul>



<p>Lewin reiterated – more gently this time – that he did not agree with our publishing a new post about this case:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We again repeat our client’s request that Retraction Watch reconsider whether it really wishes to publish an article in relation to our client.&nbsp; He understandably wants nothing to do with these articles and does not want his name linked with them any further.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He did not respond directly to the first question, writing only that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is our understanding that Retraction Watch, which has published on this matter already, is aware that our client had no involvement in these articles, and that his name was falsely added to them without his knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given these circumstances, there is nothing surprising or unexpected about the fact that publishers would agree to remove an attribution of authorship in an article to an individual whom they know was not an author.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we and PLOS’s Hoch noted, publishers ceding to such requests is unusual.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Despite the reports of the investigations having been shared with the three publishers, Lewin declined to share them with us, claiming that “the contents of the investigations, requested at bullet point two, are set out clearly in the retraction notes and letter statements by the publishers.”</p>



<p>We pointed out that all that was included in those retraction notices and letters – more on those later – were descriptions of what the report said, not “the contents of the investigations.” We and others have long <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01728-z">recommended</a> that universities make public in the interests of transparency and improvement.</p>



<p>Lewin also declined to share any of his letters to the three publishers, providing only one letter each from Elsevier and Springer Nature to him that he said “set out what had happened and explain why the publishers agreed to remove Professor Shi’s name.” He said “no equivalent letter exists in respect of the PLOS article.” As a condition of seeing those letters, we agreed not to publish them, but Lewin said we could “refer to, paraphrase or quote from them in a limited fashion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter from Elsevier, dated Sept. 22, 2021, says that “the attribution was incorrect,” based on the publisher’s investigation and the university report, and that they had removed Shi as an author of the original article and published a retraction notice. That presumably refers to an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2017.08.004">updated retraction notice</a> – confusingly labeled as an “erratum”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Publisher would like to bring to your notice that certain individuals who were listed as authors of the paper “Association between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, UCP3 and lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms and obesity in Chinese adolescents ” have informed the journal that this occurred without consent or knowledge of the submission. In addition the email address provided with the paper was not the correct email address. Please note that these authors previously identified by the submitting author as co-authors in the original publication of the paper were not the authors of this manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsevier also asks Shi to “Please accept our apologies that this occurred.”</p>



<p>The letter from Springer Nature, dated March 3, 2022, is similar, but does not include an apology.</p>



<p>Given that we consider publishers to be the entities that determine who an author is, and that they have removed Shi and others’ names from the original papers, we have done the same for the seven relevant entries – five retractions, and two corrections to relevant papers – in our database. (Note that Elsevier has done so inconsistently; Shi&#8217;s name is removed from the original article and a related erratum, but the publisher removed author Jianhua Chen only from the erratum. All other author names remain the same on both Elsevier pages.)</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We of course still have questions about what happened between 2016 and 2022. When we asked Lewin for the second time to respond to our final question, about why we did not hear from his client for more than six years until receiving what we perceived as a legal threat from his solicitor, Lewin responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our client does not propose to respond further.&nbsp; For the sake of clarity, you will note that the answers to your first and last questions are already set out in the letter that we sent to you in December 2022.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As readers will see, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">they are not</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/raccoon-dog-dna-covid-origins-debate">How raccoon dog DNA fits into the COVID-19 origins debate</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been three years since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Yet the mystery of how it got started continues to make headlines again and again and to fuel a heated, and oft-time political, debate.</p>



<p>While what exactly happened in the earliest days of the pandemic remains an ongoing question, some genetic studies have tipped the scales in favor of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breathless-book-covid-19-pandemic-coronavirus">pandemic originating from a viral spillover from animals</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/22</em>). A hypothesis, but no evidence, suggests the virus could have been leaked, either accidentally or deliberately, from a lab.</p>





<p>U.S. intelligence agencies are split over which scenario they deem more likely. The Department of Energy and the FBI lean more toward the possibility of a lab leak, while the National Intelligence Council and others suspect a natural origin. It is important to note that most of these agencies drew their conclusions with “low confidence,” which means the available data the intelligence community had to rely on is “scant, questionable or very fragmented,” according to the National Intelligence Council.</p>



<p>Very soon, we will see what that intelligence looks like. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/20/statement-by-the-president-on-s-619-the-covid-19-origin-act-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill into law on March 20 to declassify government information</a> on the virus’s origins within 90 days.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a new genetic analysis adds another piece to the puzzle in favor of the spillover scenario, this time with a possible suspect: raccoon dogs.</p>



<p>“These data do not provide a definitive answer to how the pandemic began,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a March 17 news briefing. “But every piece of data is important to moving us closer to that answer.”</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about the latest data and what they mean for pinning down the events that sparked the pandemic.</p>



<h4>What is the latest line of evidence for a natural origin?</h4>



<p>The first cluster of coronavirus cases in humans was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers">linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market</a> in Wuhan, China (<em>SN: 1/24/20</em>). Environmental samples taken in 2020 from the southwest corner of the market, where live animals were sold, carried <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-origins-research-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market-lab-leak/673390/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetic material from both the coronavirus and animals</a>, the <em>Atlantic</em> first reported on March 16.</p>





<p>In some virus-positive samples, computational biologist Alex Crits-Christoph and an international team of colleagues also found DNA from the common raccoon dog (<em>Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>). The foxlike animal native to Asia is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7706974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">susceptible to coronavirus infections</a>, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that traces of both animal and coronavirus were uncovered in the same samples suggest that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-mutation-pandemic-covid-genetics-bat-human">the virus may have jumped from bats</a> to raccoon dogs or other animals at the market and then to people, the team writes (<em>SN: 7/12/21</em>). It posted <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZBtS8OzMJhH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its analysis</a> March 20 on Zenodo, a repository where scientists can post research results that have not yet been reviewed by their peers.</p>



<p>This analysis builds on evidence from two studies published in <em>Science </em>in July 2022. In the first study, researchers reported that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants from the pandemic’s early days suggest that there may have been <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two separate jumps from animals to people</a>: one in late November 2019 and another weeks later. The second study used the first known COVID-19 cases and coronavirus-positive environmental samples from the seafood market to identify the southwest part of the market with live animal vendors as the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely epicenter of the pandemic’s spread</a>.</p>



<p>In the new analysis, Crits-Christoph, who works from Baltimore for the nonprofit Cultivarium, and colleagues analyzed public genetic data that had been released in early March from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That data, linked to a February 2022 preliminary study from the China CDC (which is now under review at a scientific journal), allowed the team to zoom in on an animal stall in the southwest part of the market that had the most virus-positive samples. A sample from a cart in that stall also contained plenty of genetic material from raccoon dogs, as well as a handful of other animals such as ducks.</p>



<p>There was no evidence of human DNA in that sample, a finding that hints that animals, not necessarily people, were close to the coronavirus in that spot. Raccoon dogs or another animal, the results suggest, might have served as a bridge to take the coronavirus from bats to humans. </p>



<h4>Does this finding confirm where the coronavirus originated? &nbsp;</h4>



<p>No. As Ghebreyesus said on March 17, the findings aren’t a nail in the coffin to confirm the spillover hypothesis. Finding evidence of animal and coronavirus together in samples hints that the two were mighty close to one another. But this particular spillover story is still circumstantial. It&#8217;s unclear if animals housed in the stalls might have been infected with the virus, and if these animals then passed the virus on to humans.</p>



<p>It would have been better to have a positive swab from a live animal that was for sale at the market in late November or December 2019. Or to find the virus in wild animals. But both of those things may now be almost impossible.</p>



<p>By the time officials came to investigate the market in early 2020, any infected animals were probably long gone. And the virus has evolved since then. It’s morphed in people — giving us the alpha and delta variants as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">omicron and its spawn</a> (<em>SN:10/17/22</em>). And it’s still evolving in animals, too. Coronaviruses circulating in animals now, or even two years ago, probably won’t look the same as SARS-CoV-2 did at the end of 2019, so viruses from nature won’t be an exact match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s like a cold criminal case,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “There may be mounting evidence that, you know, John Doe did it. But not conclusive enough to try John Doe for the crime.”</p>



<p>That isn’t unusual when it comes to pinning down the source of an outbreak. Such investigations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-origins-bats-virus">can take years</a> and may never provide a definitive answer (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). Eventually, we may reach a point where we’re relying on the best evidence available and will have to accept that it’s as close as we’re going to get.</p>



<h4>Do we need to know COVID-19’s origins to prepare for the next pandemic?</h4>



<p>Not really. While the evidence we have leans toward spillover, we’re “mired in the mud,” says Osterholm, who notes that he’s agnostic for how the pandemic got started. He says it’d be better to focus on preparing for the next pandemic, rather than paying attention to only this one. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unavoidable that another pandemic is in our future; whether it will be another coronavirus, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">bird flu</a> or something else entirely is anyone’s guess (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>).</p>



<p>What we can do now is think more carefully about how we use land and do research.</p>



<p>As wildlife habitats disappear, humans come across animals more often, perhaps introducing more opportunities to exchange pathogens. Farming animals in tight quarters provides more opportunities too. Fixing those problems could help prevent spillover, or at least make it less likely.</p>



<p>Lab regulations — making sure potentially risky work is done safely or not done at all — can help to stop a lab leak.</p>



<p>There’s no reason we can’t start doing these things now, Osterholm says. “I wish we’d move on and start addressing … what we’re going to do to be better prepared” for the next potential spillover or lab leak, he says. “Because we’re not.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-recorded-brain-waves-free-octopus">Scientists have now recorded brain waves from freely moving octopuses</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, scientists have recorded brain waves from freely moving octopuses. The data reveal some unexpected patterns, though it’s too early to know <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00145-8#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how octopus brains control the animals’ behavior</a>, researchers report February 23 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“Historically, it&#8217;s been so hard to do any recordings from octopuses, even if they’re sedated,” says neuroscientist Robyn Crook of San Francisco State University, who was not involved in the study. “Even when their arms are not moving, their whole body is very pliable,” making attaching recording equipment tricky.</p>





<p>Octopuses also tend to be feisty and clever. That means they don’t usually put up with the uncomfortable equipment typically used to record brain waves in animals, says neuroethologist Tamar Gutnick of the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To work around these obstacles, Gutnick and colleagues adapted portable data loggers typically used on birds, and surgically inserted the devices into three octopuses. The researchers also placed recording electrodes inside areas of the octopus brain that deal with learning and memory. The team then recorded the octopuses for 12 hours while the cephalopods went about their daily lives — sleeping, swimming and self-grooming — in tanks.</p>



<p>Some brain wave patterns emerged across all three octopuses in the 12-hour period. For instance, some waves resembled activity in the &nbsp;human hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. Other brain waves were similar to those controlling sleep-wake cycles in other animals.</p>



<p>The researchers also recorded some brain waves that they say have never been seen before in any animal. The waves were unusually slow, cycling just two per second, or 2 hertz. They were also unusually strong, suggesting a high level of synchronization between neurons. Sometimes just one electrode picked up the weird waves; other times, they showed up on electrodes placed far apart,</p>



<p>Observing these patterns is exciting, but it’s too early to tell whether they’re tied to a specific behavior or type of cognition, Gutnick says. Experiments with repetitive tasks are necessary to fully understand how these brain areas are activated in octopuses during learning.</p>



<p>The new research is exciting in that it provides a technique for future researchers to observe brain activity in awake and naturally behaving octopuses, Crook says. It could be used to explore brain activity behind the animals’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/skin-color-changes-reveal-octopus-drama">color-changing abilities</a>, spectacular vision, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-sleep-stages-active-color-quiet-rem-brain">sleep patterns</a> and adept arm control (<em>SN: 1/29/16; SN: 3/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Octopuses are highly intelligent, so by studying the creatures “you can get ideas about what is important for intelligence,” Gutnick says. “The problems that the animals face are the same problems, but the solutions that they find are sometimes similar and sometimes different and all of these comparisons teach us something.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/math-black-holes-proof-space-physics">Here’s a peek into the mathematics of black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Black holes exist in our universe. That’s widely accepted today. Physicists have detected the X-rays emitted when black holes feed, analyzed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">gravitational waves from black hole collisions</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">imaged two of these behemoths</a>.</p>



<p>But mathematician Elena Giorgi of Columbia University studies black holes in a different way. “Black holes are mathematical solutions to the Einstein equation,” Giorgi says — the “master equation” that is the basis of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">general theory of relativity</a>.</p>



<p>She and other mathematicians seek to prove theorems about these solutions and otherwise probe the math of general relativity. Their goal: unlock unsuspected truths about black holes or&nbsp;verify existing suspicions.</p>

<p>Within general relativity, “one can understand clean mathematical statements and study those statements, and they can give an unambiguous answer within that theory,” says Christoph Kehle, a mathematician at ETH Zurich’s Institute for Theoretical Studies. Mathematicians can solve equations that have bearing on questions about the nature of black holes’ formation, evolution and stability.</p>



<p>Last year, in a paper posted online at arXiv.org, Giorgi and colleagues settled a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14808.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-standing mathematical question</a> about black hole stability. A stable black hole, mathematically speaking, is one that if poked, nudged or otherwise disturbed will eventually settle back into being a black hole. Like a rubber band that has been stretched and then released, the black hole doesn’t rip apart, explode or cease to exist, but returns to something like its former self.</p>





<p>Black holes seem to be physically stable — otherwise they couldn’t endure in the universe — but proving it mathematically is a different beast.</p>



<p>And a necessary feat, Giorgi says. If black holes are stable, as researchers presume, then the math describing them had better reflect that stability. If not, something is wrong with the underlying theory.</p>



<p>“Most of my work,” Giorgi says, “is about proving things that we already expected to be true.”</p>



<p>Mathematics has a history of big contributions in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/history-black-holes-science-news">the realm of black holes</a>. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild published a solution to Einstein’s equations for general relativity near a single spherical mass. The math showed a limit to how small a mass could be squeezed, an early sign of black holes. More recently, British mathematician Roger Penrose won the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics for his calculations showing that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-prize-2020-black-hole-roger-penrose-reinhard-genzel-andrea-ghez">black holes were real-world predictions</a> of general relativity. In a landmark paper published in 1965, Penrose described how matter could collapse to form a black hole with a singularity at its center.</p>





<p>Just a couple of years earlier, in 1963, New Zealand mathematician <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/1975/04/00368423.ap071689.07a00220.pdf">Roy Kerr found a solution</a> to Einstein’s equation for a rotating black hole. This was a “game changer for black holes,” Giorgi noted in a public lecture given at the virtual 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians. Rotating black holes were much more realistic astrophysical objects than the non-spinning black holes that Karl Schwarzschild had solved the equations for.</p>



<p>“Physicists really had believed for decades that the black hole region was an artifact of symmetry that was appearing in the mathematical construction of this object but not in the real world,” Giorgi said in the talk. Kerr’s solution helped establish the existence of black holes.</p>



<p>In a nearly 1,000-page paper, Giorgi and colleagues used a type of “proof by contradiction” to show that Kerr black holes that rotate slowly (meaning they have a small angular momentum relative to their mass) are mathematically stable. The technique entails assuming the opposite of the statement to be proved, then discovering an inconsistency. That shows that the assumption is false. The work is currently undergoing peer review. “It’s a long paper, so it’s going to take some time,” Giorgi says.</p>



<p>The result doesn’t yet extend to Kerr black holes that rotate quickly with respect to their mass, which are also known to exist in the universe.</p>



<p>Though the result isn’t likely to upend our view of black holes, these kinds of mathematical journeys can yield new insights.</p>



<p>That’s been true in Giorgi’s study of black holes with an electric charge, which are also solutions to Einstein’s equations. She’s been exploring what happens to those black holes in the face of disturbances that feature both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. These waves may surround black holes, fall inside them or interact with them at a distance, she says. Through that work, she reached a new mathematical definition of electromagnetic radiation that could be used in additional research on charged black holes.</p>



<p>Giorgi has straddled the fields of physics and math since high school, when she realized that “if I know math, I can also do physics.” Her enduring interest in physics and attraction to differential geometry, which deals with geometry of smooth spaces, made general relativity a natural fit. But her straddling has led some colleagues to misunderstand her work.</p>



<p>Some physicists think black hole mathematicians are proving things “more rigorously that they have already sort of proven, that they’re convinced of,” Giorgi says. Meanwhile, some mathematicians consider her work “more physics than math” — that is until they see the length of her full mathematical proofs.</p>



<p>Giorgi likes the freedom she has found in research. “You can choose to work on whatever you want,” she says. “You have to find your own problems.”</p>

<p>When researchers with disabilities, such as blindness or dyslexia, cannot access the research papers in their field, can we really call it &#8220;open&#8221; science?</p>
<p>On April 17th, arXiv will be hosting a half-day online forum for everyone invested in making research outputs accessible to every researcher, regardless of disability. The forum will center the experiences of academic researchers who face barriers to accessing and reading papers, and will be useful for people across the authoring and publishing ecosystem. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">We hope you will join us</a>. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.</p>
<h2>Why a forum?</h2>
<p>In December, arXiv <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.07286">published our research results on the accessibility of research papers</a> in preparation for improving the accessibility of the arXiv corpus. What we heard from researchers is that not only are the vast majority of papers not fully accessible, but that efforts to improve those outcomes have largely stalled.</p>
<p>As we work on offering HTML versions of papers published on arXiv alongside the existing PDF and source files, we also discovered how intertwined our efforts are with those of authors, authoring tools, publishers, conferences, standards, and more. We are part of an ecosystem and hope others who are also committed to making accessible research papers a reality will join us for informative presentations, a panel discussion, and digging more deeply into specific challenges in breakout discussion groups. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">Learn more about the forum here</a>, and <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_br1lFL94OVQB5nE">register for free</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beethoven-hair-dna-composer-death">DNA from Beethoven’s hair hints at what killed the composer</a></h4>

              
                <p>DNA from strands of Beethoven’s hair is helping to uncover what may have caused his death, researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The composer was plagued with health issues for most of his life. On March 26, 1827, he succumbed to what many historians suspect was liver failure while in his apartment in Vienna. Now, an analysis of several locks of hair passed down through families and gathered by collectors shows that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beethoven carried several genetic risk factors for liver disease</a>, the scientists report March 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>This elevated risk — paired with a potential liver infection and the composer’s alleged drinking habits — may have hastened Beethoven’s premature death at the age of 56, says Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>It’s well-known that Beethoven’s storied career was cut short by progressive hearing loss that left the composer completely deaf by age 45. Beethoven also suffered from gastrointestinal issues and a deteriorating liver. That faulty organ is thought to be responsible for the composer’s skin reportedly turning yellow in the summer of 1821. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The root cause of Beethoven’s plethora of health issues has been a source of fascination to many. But working out what ailed a man that lived nearly two centuries ago is no easy task. Researchers have had to rely on notes from the composer’s two autopsies, preformed after he was exhumed in 1863 and 1888, and other historical documents.</p>

Genetic analyses are helping to uncover the source of some of his ailments.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123009">Beethoven-Haus Bonn</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Clues, however, could hide in Beethoven’s DNA. Only a few historical figures — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/genetic-tests-confirm-remains-are-those-king-richard-iii">such as Richard III</a> — have had their DNA analyzed (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). But these genetic treasure troves can provide information that “no anatomical examination, after two hundred years, could provide,” says Carles Lalueza-Fox, a paleogeneticist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In 2014, Begg and his colleagues decided to reconstruct Beethoven’s genetic instruction book, or genome. First, the team needed a piece of the composer himself. Luckily, around 30 separate locks of hair attributed to Beethoven had survived, in the possession of collectors and the descendants of people who first received the hair in the 19th century.</p>



<p>Begg partnered with Beethoven enthusiasts to ask the owners of these locks to part with a few strands. The team was able to gather samples from eight locks said to have been snipped from 1821 to 1827.</p>





<p>One lock didn’t yield enough DNA for analysis. Of the others, two locks could not have come from the composer; one belonged to a woman with an ancestry consistent with Ashkenazi Jews, the researchers found. But five of the locks, which came from various sources, clearly belong to a single individual with central European ancestry, which Beethoven would have had. The natural degradation of DNA over time in these locks was also consistent with the hair dating to the early 19th century.</p>



<p>Those common features — along with a clear record of who owned these separate locks of hair over the centuries — makes Begg “extremely confident” that these locks are Beethoven’s.</p>



<p>Lalueza-Fox agrees. “I think they provide compelling evidence of five samples being from the composer,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers used some of the best-preserved locks to reconstruct the composer’s genome. This analysis didn’t uncover any genetic markers for deafness or intestinal issues. But the team did identify several risk factors for liver disease, including a variant of the gene <em>PNPLA3 </em>that would have tripled the composer’s risk of developing liver issues in his lifetime.</p>



<p>Those risk factors alone shouldn’t have doomed Beethoven. But the scientists also found traces of the hepatitis B virus, which damages livers, in one of the strands reportedly collected shortly after Beethoven’s death. The risk to the liver from a hepatitis B infection would have been further compounded by regular alcohol use, the researchers say. Some contemporaries claimed that the composer was drinking heavily by the end of his life.</p>



<p>While we don’t know exactly what combination of factors killed Beethoven, “this is a fascinating detective story,” says Ian Gilmore, a hepatologist at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in England, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>A fascinating story with a new twist: The Y chromosome in the five hair samples doesn’t match those of five people who share a 14th century ancestor with Beethoven. (The composer never had any known children.) This could be a sign that the hair is inauthentic. Or, more likely, one of Beethoven’s direct ancestors on his father’s side had a child outside of marriage, possibly sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries, Begg says.</p>

<p>Astrophysicist Erika Nesvold once asked an executive of a company aiming to mine the moon how he planned to address risks that mining equipment might carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life">microbes from Earth and contaminate the moon</a> (<em>SN: 1/10/18</em>).

<p>“Space settlement advocates often advertise space as a blank slate where we can build utopian societies free from the crowded territory and bloodied history of our terrestrial home,” Nesvold writes. “But adopting a ‘worry about it later’ attitude toward human rights and ethics strikes me as a path to repeating the tragedies of that history through ignorance.”</p>



<p>Nesvold is a developer for the education software/video game <a href="https://universesandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Universe Sandbox</em></a>. In the last several years, she has shifted her focus to how to build a fair and just future in space, cofounding the <a href="https://justspacealliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JustSpace Alliance</a>, a nonprofit working to do just that. <em>Off-Earth</em> is an extension of her 2017 podcast, <a href="https://makingnewworlds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Making New Worlds</em></a>, which asked ethical questions about space settlement. The book takes some of the same questions and expands on them. Each chapter title is a question: “Why are we going?” “Who gets to go?” “Who’s in charge?” “What if I get sick?” “Which way is Mecca?”</p>



<p>Most chapters start with three vignettes, usually from different time periods. A chapter outlining debates over whether to settle space at all starts by asking the reader to imagine being in the 1600s and deciding to uproot your family and head to the New World. A chapter on how land usage and ownership rights might work in space imagines a person recently freed from slavery in the U.S. South in 1865 and worrying that the new president will take back the land they finally own. A chapter on the ethical questions that will arise when people get sick in space conjures a hospital worker in 2020 making gut-wrenching triage decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The third vignette is usually set in the year 2100, on a space settlement.</p>



<p>Then Nesvold examines how various ethical scenarios related to the chapter’s theme might play out in space. She quotes experts in fields that don’t often come up in space science: ethics, philosophy, Indigenous history, law.</p>



<p>This approach is a departure from many books about the future of life on the final frontier, forcing readers to confront hard realities and possible points of friction. A lot of arguments for moving humankind off Earth assume space is a land of infinite resources. But at least at first, settlers will have much more limited resources than they did on Earth. And situations where humans are isolated with limited resources, like on ships or in colonial settlements, have often been recipes for disaster.</p>





<p>So how will space settlers share what little they have? How will they decide who lives and dies, and what quality of life and death they’ll have? Will living in the harsh conditions of an early space settlement nurture innovation and creative progress, or encourage humankind’s worst tendencies toward exploitation and tyranny?</p>



<p>Most of these questions don’t have clear answers. That’s partly because ethical questions rarely do. The book “has undoubtedly revealed much about my own political opinions and priorities, not to mention the influence of my personal background and the culture in which I was raised,” Nesvold writes. “In the same way, your position on these issues is likely deeply connected with your own values and beliefs.”</p>



<p>Finding answers is also challenging because it requires anticipating what our descendants, who will live in the space communities we are already creating, will want, need and believe. To have the best chance of avoiding disaster, the time to consider these questions is now, not later, even though space settlement may be decades or centuries away, Nesvold argues.</p>



<p><em>Off-Earth</em> should be required reading for anyone who dreams about living in space. Space is not a blank slate, but imagining a better world there can help us build one — and can help make our earthbound civilizations better too.</p>

<p>One more paper co-authored by Australian health journalist Maryanne Demasi has earned an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388198123000331">expression of concern</a> for image duplication.</p>



<p>The move comes seven years after the journal <em>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</em> (<em>BBA</em>) was first made aware of potential problems with a figure in Demasi&#8217;s paper that showed Western blots. It marks the third time one of the former researcher&#8217;s scientific publications has been officially <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/26/controversial-australian-journalists-paper-flagged-journal/">flagged as concerning</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">retracted</a>.</p>



<p>Demasi, who <a href="https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/22067">earned her PhD</a> from the University of Adelaide in 2004, has been in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/do-mask-mandates-work.html">news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/03/face-masks-work-study/">recently</a> after she did a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/opinion/masks-work-cochrane-study.html">controversial interview</a> with the <a href="https://drtomjefferson.com/">lead author</a> of a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full">Cochrane review</a> that cast doubt on face masks. She has drawn <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-challenges-the-mainstream/9980708">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-cops-criticism-over-wi-fried/9973056">rebuke</a> over the past decade, beginning with a 2013 program in which her reporting questioned statins. She and her co-authors <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">told us</a> in 2018 that they believe her work as a journalist made her research a target of criticism.</p>



<span id="more-126749"></span>



<p>Following a yearslong probe by the university into allegations of image manipulation in Demasi’s PhD thesis, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/09/controversial-australian-science-journalist-admits-to-duplication-in-her-phd-thesis/">she admitted</a> she had &#8220;duplicated or probably duplicated&#8221; some images. However, as we reported earlier, this practice was felt to have been acceptable at the time and Demasi was not found guilty of research misconduct.</p>



<p>In its new notice, published March 11, <em>BBA</em> referred to another probe:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following an investigation by the Central Adelaide Local Health Networks (CALHN) panel, concerns have been raised relating to the veracity of the data presented in Fig. 6. These concerns cannot be resolved since the original data are no longer available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The problematic images were first spotted in 2016 by <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a> of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne (Vaux is a member of the board of directors of The Center for Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organization). He shared his misgivings with <em>BBA</em> and the University of Adelaide that same year, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/21/paper-co-authored-by-australian-journalist-maryanne-demasi-to-be-marked-with-expression-of-concern/">we reported earlier</a>. The journal told him the paper would receive an expression of concern in October, but the notice did not appear until this month&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux welcomed the new development, but told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While having the original data might have helped them determine which of the authors was responsible for making the figure, the availability of the original images is not necessary to show, on balance of probabilities, that parts of the image had been duplicated and altered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Judging by <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#3">a comment she left</a> on PubPeer in 2021, sleuth Elisabeth Bik seems to agree:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Not only appear the four lanes to be showing the same blot strip, the molecular weights and aspect ratios appear to have changed as well, suggesting this is not a simple mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vaux also pointed out that an earlier comment on PubPeer had also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#2">raised concerns</a> about other images in the paper that were not addressed in the journal&#8217;s statement. According to that comment:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All points are same in Fig. 2A and Demasi [PhD] thesis Fig. 7.5 except 18 hr hypoxia point, which has different mean and SEMs. Could the authors please explain?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Demasi as well as the corresponding and first authors, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388198106002721">paper</a>, titled &#8220;Endothelial cell COX-2 expression and activity in hypoxia,&#8221; was published in 2006. It has been cited 31 times, including twice this year, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The authors &#8220;would like us to believe the [paper&#8217;s] conclusions are not affected, as concerns have not been raised about Figs. 3, 4, and 5,&#8221; Vaux told us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormone-shot-drunk-mice-sober-quickly">A hormone shot helped drunk mice sober up quickly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The only cure to being drunk is to wait it out. But that might not always be the case: Injecting drunk mice with a naturally occurring hormone helped them sober up more quickly than they otherwise would have, a new study shows.</p>



<p>Mice that received a shot of FGF21 — a hormone made by the liver — <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00041-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woke up from a drunken stupor roughly twice as fast </a>as those that didn’t, researchers report in the March 7 <em>Cell Metabolism</em>.</p>





<p>The find could one day be used to help treat alcohol poisoning, a sometimes-deadly side effect of heavy drinking that lands millions of people in the emergency room every year, says molecular endocrinologist David Mangelsdorf.</p>



<p>The sobering effect of FGF21 isn’t the first time the hormone has been linked to drinking. Scientists have previously shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877817305525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livers ramp up production of this hormone</a> when alcohol floods the bloodstream. And while FGF21 doesn’t help break down alcohol, researchers have found that the hormone can help protect livers from the toxic effects of liquor while dampening the desire to continue drinking in mice and monkeys.</p>



<p>Those findings made Mangelsdorf, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and his colleagues curious whether FGF21 also plays a role in recovering from too much alcohol. So the team fed mice enough alcohol to knock them out and waited to see how long it took for them to wake up.</p>



<p>Mice that were genetically altered to be unable to produce their own FGF21 took around an hour and a half longer to wake up than normal mice. But regular mice given an extra dose of FGF21 woke up twice as fast than those that hadn’t received a shot. Drunk mice that were injected with FGF21 were also able to keep their balance for longer than their peers while placed on a slowly rotating platform.</p>



<p>FGF21 probably helps mice sober up by activating nerve cells in a part of the brain involved with stimulating wakefulness, the researchers say. If the hormone works in similar ways in people, it could be used to nudge people suffering from alcohol poisoning back into wakefulness, Mangelsdorf says.</p>



<p>That ability could be useful because — aside from the hazard of choking while unconscious — doctors sometimes must wait for people with alcohol poisoning to wake up before being able to address their symptoms.</p>



<p>“There is no drug for treating alcohol poisoning,” Mangelsdorf says. A drug that could help people wake up — much in the same way that the medication <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/opioid-crisis-overdose-death&#039;">Narcan prods consciousness along in opioid overdoses</a> — would be a “phenomenal” improvement for treating people rushed to the emergency room, he says (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-cure-intoxication-sober">found ways to sober up mice before</a>, but these treatments didn’t work well in people (<em>SN: 11/29/22</em>). FGF21 might be a different story, Mangelsdorf thinks, because of the previous research on the hormone in monkeys, which are more like humans than mice.</p>



<p>Any drugs derived from FGF21 wouldn’t have to stick to treating alcohol poisoning. Researchers are also looking to use the hormone to address liver disease and alcohol addiction, says Lorenzo Leggio, a physician scientist with the National Institutes of Health who is based in Baltimore and was not involved with the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Leggio says, this study adds “an important piece to the puzzle” for understanding the role of FGF21 and developing new treatments for alcohol addiction and other ailments.</p>

<p>Nineteen journals from the open-access publisher Hindawi were removed from Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science Monday when the indexer refreshed its Master Journal List. </p>



<p>The delistings follow a disclosure by Wiley, which bought Hindawi in 2021, that the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">suspended publishing special issues</a> for three months because of “compromised articles.” That lost the company $9 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate updates its Master Journal List of titles included in Web of Science on a monthly basis. It dropped more than 50 journals from its indexes in March, according to a <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/supporting-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-our-commitment-to-curation-and-selectivity-in-the-web-of-science/">blog post</a> by Nandita Quaderi, editor in chief and vice president of Web of Science, for failing to meet <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">24 quality criteria</a> such as adequate peer review, appropriate citations, and content that’s relevant to the stated scope of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delisting 50 journals at once is more than usual for Clarivate, and may be the beginning of a larger culling. Quaderi wrote that the company developed an AI tool “to help us identify outlier characteristics that indicate that a journal may no longer meet our quality criteria.” The tool flagged more than 500 journals at the beginning of this year, according to her blog post, and Web of Science’s editors continue to investigate them.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126734"></span>



<p>Removing a journal from Web of Science means Clarivate will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a>, as universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions. The company also suppresses journals from its yearly Journal Citation Report that publishes impact factors, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">we’ve reported</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in the past</a>.</p>



<p>The data company does <s>has a new policy</s> not to publish a list of journals removed from Web of Science, a Clarivate spokesperson told us, though it does say which journals it suppresses from its Journal Citation Report. We compared the <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/collection-list-downloads">new lists of journals</a> included in the four indices of the Web of Science Core Collection with the lists from last month to identify journals that were delisted. We identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><s>83 </s>82 delisted titles</a>, which a Clarivate spokesperson told us included journals removed for “not meeting production requirements.” [See update at the end of this post.]</p>

<p>We’ve previously reported on issues with the content of several of the journals on the list: A special issue of <em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em> hosted the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">Twitter-famous paper</a> with capital Ts standing in for error bars, and an investigation by Hong Kong Polytechnic University found that one of its PhD students let a former professor “borrow” his email account to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">edit two special issues</a> of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Hindawi and Wiley said last year that they were retracting more than <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">500 papers linked to peer review rings</a>.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">analysis of papermill activity</a> in Hindawi journals, sleuth Dorothy Bishop looked at special issues from ten journals, nine of which were among those delisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was pleased to see that these journals have been delisted,” Bishop told us, “because their inclusion in Clarivate’s Web of Science seemed inappropriate because they were publishing many articles from paper mills, where the editorial and/or review process appeared to be compromised.”</p>



<p>Paper mills targeted the journals, Bishop said, “precisely because they are included in Web of Science, which gives them kudos and means that any citations count towards indicators such as H-index, which is used by many institutions in hiring and promotion.”</p>



<p>“I feel sorry for the honest authors who have published in these journals,” she said, “as they will find their publications tainted by association with these journals.”</p>



<p>Separately, the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> recently delisted 10 Hindawi journals, all of which were also delisted from Web of Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wiley has taken important actions to address research integrity challenges impacting Hindawi’s Special Issues,” Jay Flynn, executive vice president and general manager of Wiley’s research division told us in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Once we identified misconduct in the external peer review process, we immediately paused the publication of special issues, purged bad actors and implemented rigorous new checks throughout our publishing workflows. Additionally, we added expert staffing, increased editorial controls, introduced AI-based screening tools, and accelerated the retraction process to ensure the integrity of the scholarly record. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though integrity challenges are an issue across the industry, we are confident in the value and demand for research publishing and steadfast in our commitment to research integrity as we serve researchers around the globe who deliver life-changing findings every day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We take full responsibility for the quality of the content we publish at Wiley. We also must work together as an industry to strengthen the lines of defense against those attempting to subvert the scholarly record. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 2200 UTC, 3/22/23: After this post was published, the Clarivate spokesperson identified the journals from our list that were dropped for editorial reasons–which the company had previously declined to do–and we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">updated it accordingly</a>. The spokesperson said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We do think it is important that misinformation is corrected and in this case we are happy to clarify which journals have been dropped for failing to meet quality criteria. We continue to listen to the scholarly community and keep our policies under constant review in order to protect research integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/building-block-life-asteroid-ryugu">A crucial building block of life exists on the asteroid Ryugu</a></h4>

              
                <p>Uracil, a building block of life, has been found on the asteroid Ryugu.</p>



<p>Yasuhiro Oba and colleagues discovered the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36904-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precursor to life in samples collected from the asteroid</a> and returned to Earth by Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft, the team reports March 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“The detection of uracil in the Ryugu sample is very important to clearly demonstrate that it is really present in extraterrestrial environments,” says Oba, an astrochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>





<p>Uracil had been previously detected in samples from meteorites, including a rare class called CI-chondrites, which are abundant in organic compounds. But those meteorites landed on Earth, leaving open the possibility they had been contaminated by humans or Earth’s atmosphere. Because the Ryugu samples were collected in space, they are the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">purest bits of the solar system scientists have studied to date</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). That means the team could rule out the influence of terrestrial biology.</p>



<p>Oba’s team was given only about 10 milligrams of the Ryugu sample for its analysis. As a result, the researchers were not confident they would be able to detect any building blocks, even though they’d been able to previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">detect uracil and other nucleobases in</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">meteorites</a> (<em>SN: 4/26/22).</em></p>



<p>Nucleobases are biological building blocks that form the structure of RNA, which is essential to protein creation in all living cells. One origin-of-life theory suggests RNA predated DNA and proteins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quite-switch">that ancient organisms relied on RNA for the chemical reactions associated with life</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/04</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="345" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032023_ag_ryugu_inline1.jpg" alt="Two photos side by side showing two samples taken from the asteroid Ryugu.

Analysis of about 10 milligrams of the sample revealed the presence of uracil, a key building block of life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122968">Y. Oba <em>et a</em>l/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2023, JAXA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team used hot water to extract organic material from the Ryugu samples, followed by acid to further break chemical bonds and separate out uracil and other smaller molecules.</p>



<p>Laura Rodriguez, a prebiotic chemist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, who was not involved in the study, says this method leaves the possibility that the uracil was separated from a longer chain of molecules in the process. “I think it’d be interesting in future work to look at more complex molecules rather than just the nucleobases,” Rodriguez says.</p>





<p>She says she’s seen in her research that the nucleobases can form bonds to create more complex structures, such as a possible precursor to the nucleic acid which may lead to RNA formation. “My question is, are those more complex structures also forming in the asteroids?”</p>



<p>Oba says his team plans to analyze samples from NASA’s OSIRIS-REX mission, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">grabbed a bit of asteroid Bennu in 2020</a> and will return it to Earth this fall (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-sickness-elimination-experimental-drug-africa">Sleeping sickness is nearing elimination. An experimental drug could help</a></h4>

              
                <p>The patient arrived at the hospital one hot night in Masi-Manimba, an agricultural town unfurled along the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Lukula River.</p>



<p>He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t walk, he was conscious but “barely could make … gestures,” says Béatrice Kasita, a nurse who was there when he came in. She remembers his deformed posture, how his body curved into a fetal position.</p>



<p>He was also unusually drowsy — a telltale sign of his illness. The patient, a 27-year-old man, had been brought in by a medical team screening villagers for sleeping sickness, a deadly parasitic disease spread via the bite of a blood-feeding fly.</p>





<p>Since the first case report in the late 14th century, the illness has ebbed and flowed in sub-Saharan Africa. Across the continent, the predominant form of sleeping sickness shows up in about two dozen countries, most cases now occurring in the DRC. The disease is a nightmarish scourge that can maim the brain and ultimately kill. But today, cases hover near an all-time low. In 2021, the World Health Organization <a href="https://apps.who.int/neglected_diseases/ntddata/hat/hat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported just 747 cases</a> of the predominant form, down from more than 37,000 in 1998.</p>



<p>That precipitous plunge came out of decades of work, millions of screenings, spinal taps upon spinal taps, toxic treatments and the rapid rise of safer though often burdensome ones, countless IV infusions, long hospital days and nights, medicine lugged to remote villages, and communities on constant alert for sleeping sickness’s insidious symptoms.</p>



<p>Now, a promising drug has fanned hope for halting transmission of the disease. Called acoziborole, the drug is taken by mouth in just a single dose. Kasita’s patient, who arrived at the hospital in June 2017, was among the first to try it.</p>



<p>Her hospital is one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea working to test the drug with the <a href="https://dndi.org/diseases/sleeping-sickness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative</a>, or DNDi, a nonprofit organization based in Geneva. In a small trial reported last year, the drug appeared to be safe and effective. A larger trial is ongoing, with results expected by the end of this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="449" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg" alt="photo of nurse Béatrice Kasita holding some papers seated at a table outside a clinic surrounded by other healthcare workers" class="wp-image-3122753" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-580x383.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-282x186.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122753">Béatrice Kasita (center) is a nurse at a hospital in Masi-Manimba, one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea for a new sleeping sickness drug. She has been caring for people with the disease for 10 years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122753">PAUL SHEMISI/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the findings hold up, the drug would be “a game changer,” says Emmanuel Bottieau, an infectious disease specialist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is not involved with the clinical trial. A single-dose medication is “really a dream for us, coming from such a long history of very difficult or toxic or cumbersome treatments.”</p>



<p>But he and others know that even a game-changing drug doesn’t guarantee a win. The dominant form of sleeping sickness is on a short list of neglected tropical diseases the WHO is targeting for elimination by 2030. That means bringing cases in certain areas down to zero knowing that some control efforts may still be required. Vastly harder to achieve is disease eradication, where cases worldwide stay parked at zero permanently. (To date, just a single human infectious disease — smallpox — has been eradicated.)</p>





<p>Even elimination is no easy task — and can get harder as you approach the finish line. “We are advancing very well,” says José Ramón Franco, a WHO medical officer based in Geneva, “but we [haven’t] reached the last mile.”</p>



<p>Still, tiptoeing along the edges of optimism, some, like Kasita, are finding moments to cheer. For the severely ill patient, her team initially wondered if acoziborole would work. “Are we really going to help him with this single-dose treatment?”</p>



<p>Two weeks later, he could stand, with some support, and had started speaking again, a radical recovery. Kasita smiles widely as she remembers it. Watching him heal “was a great pleasure,” she says.</p>



<h4>The symptoms of sleeping sickness</h4>



<p>About 400 kilometers to the west of Masi-Manimba, physician Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji is preparing to visit Kasita’s hospital. Afterward, he’ll hit up hospitals in Idiofa, Bagata and then Bandundu, three other acoziborole clinical trial sites in the DRC. To reach the sites, Mutombo will travel by boat, plane, car and motorbike. He’ll stay in both modern hotels and hotels without running water or electricity. Then, he’ll return home to Kinshasa, the DRC’s bustling capital. It’s a great and noisy city, he grins, with people playing music in the streets and “many, many, many traffic jams.”</p>



<p>In Kinshasa, Roi Baudouin hospital is one of the DNDi’s acoziborole trial sites. Mutombo has been organizing logistics and ensuring that each site has what it needs to treat and monitor patients. That includes generators for electricity, an internet connection, medical equipment and trained clinical trial staff.</p>



<p>Mutombo has worked with sleeping sickness patients since 2004. Two weeks after finishing his medical training in Kasaï province, he shipped out to Kasansa, becoming the only medical doctor in a village of about 11,000 people. In Kasansa, which lies in western DRC, north of the Angola border, sleeping sickness was then, and still remains, endemic.</p>



<p>The disease, also called human African trypanosomiasis, is caused by a single-celled, ruffle-edged parasite that worms its way into the brain. One subspecies, <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em>, causes the vast majority of cases and tends to plague western and central Africa. Another, <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> occurs in the eastern and southern parts of the continent and causes a more rapid, acute illness with far fewer cases in people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="455" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4.jpg" alt="microscopic image of Trypanosoma brucei parasites amid blood cells" class="wp-image-3122738" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-572x383.jpg 572w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-673x450.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-278x186.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122738">Sleeping sickness is caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> parasites, which appear in dark purple in this 1,000-fold magnification of a blood sample.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122738">DR. MAE MELVIN/CDC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Both subspecies can ride in the guts and glands of tsetse flies, which often buzz near bodies of water; many of Mutombo’s patients in Kasansa were fishers or farmers. When the fly bites, the parasite enters the bloodstream. From there, it can get picked up again when other flies feed, shuttling from insects to humans in a disease-spreading cycle.</p>



<p>In the blood, <em>T.b. gambiense</em> sparks a slow-burning illness that can begin with a fever and, if left untreated, end with death. As the parasite multiplies, lymph nodes enlarge and the head, muscles and joints ache. Patients can also become intensely itchy, scratching hard enough to damage the skin, Kasita says.</p>



<p>When the parasite slips past the blood-brain barrier, patients enter the second stage of the disease. No one knows exactly where the parasite lodges in the brain, but neurological symptoms can vary. Doctors and nurses describe a range of distressing and bizarre behaviors. One common behavior gives the illness its name. Somehow, the parasite reverses people’s sleep/wake cycle. “They will sleep a lot during the day, and at night, they will be up, watching,” Kasita says.</p>



<p>Patients can also feel depressed and confused, neglect to care for themselves, hallucinate or experience logorrhea, words cascading from lips in nonsensical streams. In some infected people, personalities can swing like a wrecking ball. Jacques Pépin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, worked with sleeping sickness patients in the 1980s and remembers one who suddenly threw a large rock at his head.</p>



<p>Such outbursts can be scary for patients and families, says Antoine Tarral, a pharmacologist and infectious disease physician who works with Mutombo and led the DNDi’s sleeping sickness program for 10 years. Fear of the disease can prompt villages to reject infected individuals, he says.</p>



<p>Sleeping sickness carries a social stigma that makes people feel like outcasts, Mutombo agrees. “This disease is terrible.” When he first began treating patients, he says, “I was doing my best to make them feel like human beings.”</p>



<p>But for decades, available treatments were terrible, too.</p>

<h4>Sleeping sickness has a history of terrible treatments</h4>



<p>For most of treatment history, injected or intravenous drugs were the only option for sleeping sickness. They could cure patients, but only if doctors administered them in time. And when cases advanced to the second stage, medical staff had to switch tactics. For patients, that meant a spinal tap to confirm diagnosis followed by different drugs.</p>



<p>Until the late 2000s, the most-used treatment for advanced gambiense sleeping sickness was the highly toxic melarsoprol. The drug is derived from arsenic (and it’s still the leading treatment for advanced rhodesiense cases). Medical staff administered the drug for 10 days via daily intravenous infusions that burned entering patients’ veins, Mutombo says. The treatment could also be lethal, killing some 5 percent of patients.</p>



<p>Mutombo grows somber remembering two of his patients who died, young men he tried to cure in Kasansa. “That was a very bad experience,” he says. “When patients come to the hospital, they come to receive a treatment, not to die … [from] the drug we gave them.”</p>



<p>But doctors didn’t have a lot of options. Without melarsoprol, patients with serious cases faced near-certain death.</p>



<p>Not long after his patients died, Mutombo heard that the DNDi was launching a project on a new, less toxic treatment for advanced cases. He jumped at the chance, applied to be an investigator and joined the project in 2006. The new treatment, called NECT, combined eflornithine, an IV drug developed for cancer, with the oral drug nifurtimox. Eflornithine was already being used to treat sleeping sickness, but required dozens of infusions, and nifurtimox was a treatment for Chagas disease.</p>



<p>In 2009, after a clinical trial and the WHO’s endorsement, NECT took off, rocketing past melarsoprol or eflornithine alone as the first-line treatment for advanced sleeping sickness. But NECT had some logistical snafus, Mutombo says. It wasn’t easy to transport, for one. Treatment for four patients came in 40-kilogram packages that had to be trucked over bad roads into rural areas that lacked medical workers. “That was a problem with NECT,” Mutombo says. “It was effective, but it was heavy and needed trained staff.”</p>



<p>Less than a decade later, Mutombo, Tarral and their DNDi colleagues debuted an easier alternative. Fexinidazole, at long last, was a drug doctors could deliver exclusively via pills rather than an IV. It’s not perfect — it’s administered by a nurse, patients need to take it for 10 days and it’s not best for the most severe cases (for these, the WHO still recommends NECT). But easy-to-use oral drugs lower the burden on health systems, Mutombo says. Medical staff could more easily bring treatments to remote patients. And that brought scientists one step closer to sleeping sickness’s elimination.</p>

<h3>Sleeping sickness efforts pay off</h3>



<p>The number of reported sleeping sickness cases caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> (yellow) and <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> (orange) has dropped steadily since the late 1990s. The World Health Organization hopes to eliminate transmission of gambiense sleeping sickness by 2030. </p>

<h4><strong>A new drug could help bring cases to zero</strong></h4>



<p>Acoziborole, the drug now being tested in clinical trials, may be another big step in the right direction. Just one dose cured some <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00660-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of patients with late-stage infections</a>, Mutombo, Tarral and colleagues reported November 29 in the <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. That’s comparable to treatment with NECT. “Acoziborole is one solution to manage this disease,” Tarral says.</p>



<p>Not only does the drug seem to be effective, but “it’s given orally … and it needs to be given only once,” says the University of Sherbrooke’s Pépin, who was not involved with the trial but <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00686-7/fulltext?rss=yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote an opinion piece</a> that appeared alongside the new report.</p>



<p>Yet, as Pépin points out, the acoziborole study has some limitations. The scientists tested the drug in just 208 patients, so no one knows if serious adverse effects might occur in larger populations. And the study wasn’t performed like the classic gold-standard clinical trial, with patients randomly assigned into different groups receiving different interventions.</p>



<p>Tarral acknowledges these drawbacks, which he says were due to low participant numbers. The researchers included only people with video-confirmed parasitic infections, which required years of searching for patients across 10 hospitals in two different countries.</p>



<p>“It’s not the standard approach, but that was the only possible approach,” Pépin says. “They did what could be done with the number of cases that are occurring now.”</p>



<p>The study’s promising results spurred a new, larger trial that will include 1,200 participants. This time, the team is enrolling people with positive antibody blood tests even if the parasite’s presence hasn’t been confirmed. Many of these participants may not actually be sick, says Veerle Lejon, a scientist at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Montpellier who was not involved in developing the drug but is collaborating with the DNDi on evaluating sleeping sickness diagnostics.</p>



<p>What this trial will offer, she says, is a raft of new data that will help determine the drug’s safety.</p>

<h4>The challenges of eliminating an infectious disease</h4>



<p>Even if acoziborole gets the green light, stamping out sleeping sickness isn’t a sure bet.</p>



<p>Eliminating an infectious disease is a slippery task. Success can, paradoxically, churn out new challenges. When case numbers dip low enough, for instance, interest in the disease can wane. Donors move money to other public health priorities, and once-robust control programs wither.</p>



<p>That happened for sleeping sickness in the 1960s, the last time cases dropped. Over the next few decades, cases ratcheted up, and epidemics broke out in Angola, the DRC and South Sudan. “Control of the disease was neglected, and then slowly, the disease came back,” says WHO medical officer Franco.</p>



<p>A doubled-down effort to find cases and treat them with ever-improving drugs got sleeping sickness under control again, with case numbers cratering to their low point today. But that level of surveillance is not sustainable, Franco says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="674" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg" alt="photo in which Felix Akwaso Massa appears in the foreground holding a notebook with his back to the camera as he speaks to Charnelle Mafuta and her four children who are seated in front of a building" class="wp-image-3122739" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-573x383.jpg 573w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-278x186.jpg 278w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-868x580.jpg 868w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122739">Physician Felix Akwaso Massa (far left), an investigator with the DNDi’s sleeping sickness clinical trials, speaks with Charnelle Mafuta (pictured with her family), a woman who was treated for sleeping sickness with the oral drug fexinidazole.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122739">XAVIER VAHED/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Health care workers can also lose knowledge of how to recognize the disease as they encounter fewer and fewer infected individuals, says Jennifer Palmer, a medical anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The challenge is really in making sure that people are aware that sleeping sickness is still a problem,” she says. In a small study in South Sudan, reported in 2020, Palmer and colleagues found that lay people encouraging people in the community to get tested <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/5/2/52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for more than half of detected cases</a>.</p>



<p>Still, getting patients tested and treated can depend on whether they’re able to safely travel to health facilities. With the threat of violence in South Sudan and armed conflict in eastern DRC, the fate of sleeping sickness may also be shaped by the whims of war.</p>



<p>Even if every infected person was promptly found and treated, the disease-causing parasite would likely linger in wild and domestic animals. Scientists have found <em>T.b. gambiense</em>, for instance, in dogs, pigs, goats and sheep. No one knows the role infected animals play in reigniting outbreaks in humans.</p>



<p>Though the road to elimination may still be rocky, the patients Kasita and others are treating in Masi-Manimba and beyond offer a lesson for those working on disease elimination: Don’t give up too soon. Maybe the world won’t reach zero sleeping sickness cases by 2030, Lejon says, “but I think we should really give it a try,” she says. “We have momentum at this moment to do it.”</p>



<p>Mutombo echoes her enthusiasm. In less than 20 years, new drugs have completely overhauled patient care, he says. “We’ve made a great change in less than one generation…. Now, we expect that elimination is within reach.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">U.S. cases of a deadly fungus nearly doubled in recent years</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fungus that recently evolved to infect humans is spreading rapidly in health care facilities in the United States and becoming harder to treat, a study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Candida auris</em></a> infections were first detected in the United States in 2013. Each year since, the number of people infected — though still small — has increased dramatically. In 2016, the fungus sickened 53 people. In 2021, the deadly fungus <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-3469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infected 1,471 people, nearly twice the 756 cases from the year before,</a> researchers report March 21 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. What’s more, the team found, the fungus is becoming resistant to antifungal drugs.</p>





<p>The rise of cases and antifungal resistance is “concerning,” says microbiologist and immunologist Arturo Casadevall, who studies fungal infections. “You worry because [the study] is telling you what could be a harbinger of things to come.” Casadevall, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  was not involved in the CDC study.</p>



<p>In tests of people at high risk of infection, researchers also found 4,041 individuals who carried the fungus in 2021 but were not sick at the time. A small percentage of carriers may later get sick from the fungus, says Meghan Lyman, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch in Atlanta, possibly developing bloodstream infections that carry a high risk of death.</p>



<p>Starting in 2012, <em>C. auris</em> infections popped up suddenly in hospitals on three continents, probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans">evolving to grow at human body temperature</a> as a result of climate change (<em>SN: 7/26/19</em>). The fungus, typically detected through blood or urine tests, usually infects people in health care settings such as hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and long-term care homes. Because people who get infected are often already sick, it can be hard to tell whether symptoms such as fevers are from the existing illness or an infection.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Upward trajectory</h3>



<p>The number of cases of <em>Candida auris</em> recorded each year has been increasing. Clinical cases (dark blue) are among people who had positive urine or blood tests for infections. Screening cases (light blue) are people who carry the fungus, but are not ill at the time of testing. Some screening cases may develop into clinical cases, but others will clear the fungus and have no symptoms.

<p>Those most at risk of infection include people who are ill; those who have catheters, breathing or feeding tubes or other invasive medical devices; and those who have repeated or long stays in health care facilities. Healthy people are usually not infected but can spread the fungus to others by contact with contaminated surfaces, including gowns and gloves worn by health care workers, Lyman says.</p>



<h4>Growing drug resistance</h4>



<p>Infections can be treated with antifungal drugs. But Lyman and colleagues found that the fungus is becoming resistant to an important class of such medications called echinocandins. These drugs are used as both the first line and the last line of defense against <em>C. auris</em>, says Casadevall.</p>



<p>Before 2020, six people were known to have echinocandin-resistant infections and four other people had infections resistant to all three class of existing antifungal drugs. That resistance developed during treatment using echinocandin. None of those cases passed the resistant strain to others. But in 2021, 19 people were diagnosed with echinocandin-resistant infections and seven with infections resistant to multiple drugs.</p>



<p>More concerning, one outbreak in Washington, D.C., and another in Texas suggested people could transmit the drug-resistant infections to each other. “Patients who had never been on echinocandins were getting these resistant strains,” Lyman says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some health care facilities have been able to identify cases early and prevent outbreaks. “We’re obviously very concerned,” Lyman says, “but we are encouraged by these facilities that have had success at containing it.” Using those facilities’ infection control measures may help limit cases of <em>C. auris</em>, she says, as well as reducing spread other fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on Monday, March 20th.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &ndash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) welcomes several new participants to its ongoing three-year consortial agreement with <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a> (CRL) and the <a href="https://nerl.org/">Northeast Research Libraries</a> (NERL) program. Joining twenty fellow member institutions who signed on during the first year, newly participating institutions for the second year include Duke University, Macalester College, University of Arizona, University of Denver, and University of Southern California, University of Texas at Austin, and University of Washington.</p>



<p>This agreement provides researchers with unlimited publishing privileges in PLOS journals without incurring fees. All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond article processing charges (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn3"><u>[3]</u></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;These additions to our NERL/CRL agreement represent more momentum in our mission to advance Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;These institutions share our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This agreement will allow all researchers at Duke to publish their work in any PLOS journal without having to worry about article processing charges,&rdquo; said Elena Feinstein, Head of Collection Strategy &amp; Development, Duke University Libraries. &ldquo;It also aligns with Duke University&rsquo;s commitments to equity and knowledge in the service of society.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The CRL/NERL partnership with PLOS continues to support members&rsquo; desire for innovative models that make publishing and research more equitable and inclusive. This collaboration supports mutually beneficial progress toward fair and accessible publishing. We are thrilled to see the continued growth of this meaningful partnership,&rdquo; said Lanette Garza, Director of NERL &amp; CRL Licensing.</p>



<p>Alongside CRL/NERL members, a growing list of institutions including the Big Ten Academic Alliance, the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester), the Sachsen and TIB consortia&rsquo;s in Germany, and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> have decided to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-christiaan-huygens-flawed-telescopes-solved">The mystery of Christiaan Huygens’ flawed telescopes may have been solved</a></h4>

              
                <p>17th century scientist Christiaan Huygens set his sights on faraway Saturn, but he may have been nearsighted.</p>



<p>Huygens is known, in part, for discovering Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, and deducing the shape of the planet’s rings. But by some accounts, the Dutch scientist’s telescopes produced fuzzier views than others of the time despite having well-crafted lenses.</p>



<p>That may be because Huygens needed glasses, astronomer Alexander Pietrow proposes March 1 in <em>Notes and Records: the Royal Society Journal of the History of Science</em>.</p>





<p>To make his telescopes, Huygens combined two lenses, an objective and an eyepiece, positioned at either end of the telescope. Huygens experimented with different lenses to find combinations that, to his eye, created a sharp image, eventually creating a table to keep track of which combinations to use to obtain a given magnification. But when compared with modern-day knowledge of optics, Huygens’ calculations were a bit off, says Pietrow, of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany.</p>



<p>One possible explanation: Huygens selected lenses based on his flawed vision. Historical records indicate that Huygens’ father was nearsighted, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Christiaan Huygens also suffered from the often-hereditary affliction.</p>



<p>Assuming that’s the reason for the mismatch, Pietrow calculates that Huygens had 20/70 vision: What someone with normal vision could read from 70 feet away, Huygens could read only from 20 feet. If so, that could be why Huygens’ telescopes never quite reached their potential.</p>

<h4>Bodily waste is cool, actually</h4>



<p><em>Snot bubbles may help a short-beaked echidna cool off by coating the critter’s nose with moisture, which evaporates and draws heat from a blood-filled sinus, helping to cool the blood, <strong>Elise Cutts</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidna-snot-bubble-cooling">Adorable spike-balls beat the heat with snot bubbles</a>” (</em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 32<em>).</em></p>



<p>Other animals also have creative ways of using fluids to stay cool. Some birds, for example, urinate on themselves to survive hot days, <strong>Cutts</strong> wrote. Reader <strong>James Wilson</strong> noted that the word “urinate” might be misleading, since bird waste is typically a mix of urine and feces.</p>





<p>It’s true that bird droppings are a mix of urine and feces that goes through one opening called the cloaca. So “excrete” might be a more appropriate term, says ornithologist <strong>Julián Cabello-Vergel</strong> of the University of Extremadura in Badajoz, Spain. For birds that cool off via waste elimination, a phenomenon called urohidrosis, the liquid component of bird droppings is key. When storks, herons, boobies and some other types of birds excrete extra-juicy waste on their legs, “it is the evaporation of the water contained in the excreta which produces heat loss from the [body] to the environment,” <strong>Cabello-Vergel</strong> says.</p>



<h4>When gene flow runs afowl</h4>



<p><em>About 20 to 50 percent of modern jungle fowl DNA comes from domesticated chickens due to interbreeding, threatening the genetic diversity and long-term survival of the wild birds, which live in South and Southeast Asia, <strong>Jake Buehler</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-dna-jungle-fowl-genetics">Chicken DNA runs amok in wild birds</a>” (</em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 14<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Van Snyder</strong> asked if wild jungle fowl transfer any of their genetic material to chickens.</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist <strong>Frank Rheindt </strong>has “no doubt that gene flow between domestic chickens and wild jungle fowl is bidirectional.” Many free-ranging domestic village chickens in South and Southeast Asia are probably regularly exposed to genes from wild red jungle fowl that they encounter near the boundaries between villages and forests.</p>





<p>But the flow of genetic material from wild red jungle fowl to chickens overall would be marginal, says <strong>Rheindt</strong>, of the National University of Singapore. “The vast global majority of domestic chickens are battery chickens kept in tight enclosures, mostly outside tropical Asia, and those chickens would remain unaffected.”</p>



<h4>Defining depression</h4>



<p><em>Depression is often blamed on a chemical imbalance in the brain. In reality, scientists don’t have a great explanation of what depression is or what causes it, despite decades of research, <strong>Laura Sanders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">No simple answers</a>” (</em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Many readers expressed their appreciation for <strong>Sanders’</strong> reporting.</p>



<p>“It’s a fantastic example of popular science writing for the public about an urgent and difficult issue concerning human suffering,” reader <strong>R.&nbsp;Michael Johnson</strong> wrote. “I was particularly impressed and gratified by your a­ssurances that depression isn’t one-size-fits-all, and that the geographical/cultural nuances are not to be slighted.”</p>



<h4>Why “Y”?</h4>



<p><em>Ice Age hunter-gatherers may have used cave art to track the mating and birthing seasons of local fauna, <strong>Anna Gibbs</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-marks-ice-age-cave-art">Ice Age cave art may be a calendar</a>” (</em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 16<em>). For instance, “Y” symbols in the art could signify birth, researchers suspect.</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Richard Delaware</strong> wondered why the “Y” symbol developed that meaning.</p>



<p>“We will probably never know,” says <strong>Ben Bacon</strong>, an independent researcher based in London who helped decipher the cave art. One possible explanation could be that the symbol represents the female pubic area. In Paleolithic art, including in small carved figurines and wall paintings, this area was often depicted with a pronounced Y-shaped outline, <strong>Bacon</strong> says. </p>



<p>Another possible interpretation relies on the fact that the symbol is a line that splits into two. “One becomes two, which describes perfectly the process of birth,” <strong>Bacon</strong> speculates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/310-million-year-old-fossil-jellyfish-anemone">310-million-year-old fossil blobs might not be jellyfish after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>What do you get when you flip a fossilized “jellyfish” upside down? The answer, it turns out, might be an anemone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fossil blobs once thought to be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spp2.1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient jellyfish were actually a type of burrowing sea anemone</a>, scientists propose March 8 in <em>Papers in Palaeontology</em>.</p>



<p>From a certain angle, the fossils’ features include what appears to be a smooth bell shape, perhaps with tentacles hanging beneath — like a jellyfish. And for more than 50 years, that’s what many scientists thought the animals were.</p>





<p>But for paleontologist Roy Plotnick, something about the fossils’ supposed identity seemed fishy. “It’s always kind of bothered me,” says Plotnick, of the University of Illinois Chicago. Previous scientists had interpreted one fossil feature as a curtain that hung around the jellies’ tentacles. But that didn’t make much sense, Plotnick says. “No jellyfish has that,” he says. “How would it swim?”</p>



<p>One day, looking over specimens at the Field Museum in Chicago, something in Plotnick’s mind clicked. What if the bell belonged on the bottom, not the top? He turned to a colleague and said, “I think this is an anemone.”</p>



<p>Rotated 180 degrees, Plotnick realized, the fossils’ shape — which looks kind of like an elongated pineapple with a stumpy crown — resembles some modern anemones. “It was one of those aha moments,” he says. The “jellyfish” bell might be the anemone’s lower body. And the purported tentacles? Perhaps the anemone’s upper section, a tough, textured barrel protruding from the seafloor.</p>



<p>Plotnick and his colleagues examined thousands of the fossilized animals, dubbed <em>Essexella asherae, </em>unearthing more clues. Bands running through the fossils match the shape of some modern anemones’ musculature. And some specimens’ pointy protrusions resemble an anemone’s contracted tentacles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="526" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031323_mr_anemone_inline.jpg" alt="On the left is a close up photo of an Essexella asherae fossil while on the right is a stylized drawing of an Essexella with a textured upper body, smooth lower body, and fingerlike tentacles." class="wp-image-3122783" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031323_mr_anemone_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031323_mr_anemone_inline-495x383.jpg 495w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031323_mr_anemone_inline-582x450.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031323_mr_anemone_inline-240x186.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122783">Fossils of <em>Essexella asherae</em> (one shown, left) resemble some modern sea anemones. In this stylized reconstruction (right), <em>Essexella</em> has a textured upper body, smooth lower body and fingerlike tentacles.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122783"><em>Papers in Palaeontology</em></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s totally possible that these are anemones,” says Estefanía Rodríguez, an anemone expert at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City who was not involved with the work. The shape of the fossils, the comparison with modern-day anemones — it all lines up, she says, though it’s not easy to know for sure.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Thomas Clements agrees. Specimens like <em>Essexella</em> “are some of the most notoriously difficult fossils to identify,” he says. “Jellyfish and anemones are like bags of water. There’s hardly any tissue to them,” meaning there’s little left to fossilize.</p>





<p>Still, it’s plausible that the blobs are indeed fossilized anemones, says Clements, of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. He was not part of the new study but has spent several field seasons at Mazon Creek, the Illinois site where <em>Essexella </em>lived some 310 million years ago. Back then, the area was near the shoreline, Clements says, with nearby rivers dumping sediment into the environment – just the kind of place ancient burrowing anemones may have once called home.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-does-plastic-go-when-were-done-with-it">Where does plastic go when we’re done with it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human-made plastic materials have become so essential that it can be hard to grasp that they barely existed a century ago. At my desk, I’m typing on a plastic keyboard, scrolling a plastic mouse, picking up a plastic pen, tapping on a plastic calculator. Day after day, more plastic enters my life, whether it’s a shampoo bottle, a plastic clamshell of grapes or new running shoes.</p>



<p>The invention of synthetic plastics in the early 1900s was a triumph of innovation, with chemists realizing they could orchestrate molecular structures to create materials that are lighter, stronger, brighter, cheaper, more flexible and more durable.</p>





<p>During World War II, nylon and other plastics became essential to the war effort. When the war ended, the nascent plastics industry focused on making products for everyday life. That’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/materials-science-history-modern-daily-life-environment">a history we explored last year</a> as part of our Century of Science project (<em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 16</em>). You can read more on the rise of plastics and other innovations at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century">Century of Science</a>.</p>



<p>But the ubiquity of plastic has become a curse, with discarded objects clogging waterways and landfills. And when plastic does finally fall apart, minute particles disperse in the environment. We’ve known for years that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oceans-plastics-offer-floating-fortress-mess-microbes">microplastics have permeated the oceans</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/16, p. 20</em>). In this issue, we report on research confirming that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3122937">microplastics are also accumulating in our bodies</a>. Plastic particles have been found in human blood, in body tissues and in breast milk.</p>



<p>Talk about environmental contamination hitting close to home. As independent journalist Anne Pinto-Rodrigues reports, microplastics probably enter the human body through the food we eat, the water we drink and even the air we breathe. Though consuming microplastics along with lunch is creepy enough, the notion that we might be inhaling invisible bits with each breath feels much more disturbing.</p>



<p>Researchers have only recently begun quantifying the abundance of microplastics in the air, so it’s not yet clear where people face the most exposure, whether at home, at work, on the road or somewhere else. Also unclear is what impact, if any, microplastics have on human health. Studies are just getting started to find the answers to these fundamental questions, and getting actionable data will take time.</p>



<p>I’m sure many of the pioneering chemists of a century ago didn’t think about the ultimate fate of the miracle materials they invented, nor of potential long-term impacts on health and the environment. Science abounds with examples of unintended consequences. The discovery of radioactive elements led to life-saving medical treatments and nuclear power, but also to nuclear weapons and disasters like the Chernobyl power plant meltdown. </p>



<p>Microplastics are an unintended consequence that we can’t put back into the Tupperware. Merely switching from plastic to paper bags won’t fix this problem. Science now needs to determine the extent of the threat microplastics might pose and invent new ways to protect against any harms.</p>

<p>A journal editor&nbsp; who disdains anonymous concerns about research integrity has just seen an article in his journal retracted, thanks to the work of a pseudonymous sleuth.</p>



<p>The paper at issue, “<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.3139/146.111245/html">An experimental investigation into the effects of Cr2O3 and ZnO2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties and durability of self-compacting mortar</a>,” was published in 2015 in International Journal of Materials Research (IJMR). It has been cited 23 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/14/the-iran-connection-a-ring-of-four-research-groups-has-published-hundreds-of-dodgy-papers-says-whistleblower/">In 2020</a>, the pseudonymous sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/15/a-researcher-with-30-retractions-and-counting-the-whistleblower-speaks/">Artemisia Stricta</a> first alerted IJMR leadership to possible image manipulation in the article as part of an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JxEchNhBb770sQyQur-RsOXdrz9M1iyK/view">extensive report</a> on hundreds of compromised papers. Editors and the journal’s publisher De Gruyter did not investigate the case for two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During that time, Guido Schmitz <a href="https://www.imw.uni-stuttgart.de/en/team/Schmitz-00001/">of the University of Stuttgart</a> became the journal’s editor in chief. When Artemisia followed up on their report, Schmitz said that he would not investigate the potential misconduct until Artemisia revealed their identity:</p>



<span id="more-126728"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can assure that I do not like fraud in scientific results and I will do my best to prevent them. But on the other hand, I hate anonymous accusations. So it would be my pleasure to follow up this matter after you have discovered your personality to me and send contact data under which I can reach you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schmitz also<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/28/why-editors-should-stop-ignoring-anonymous-whistleblowers-a-decade-later/"> told us</a> that authors were free to try to publish “bullshit and fiction,” and that “acting as policemen watching whether other people behave ethically” was not his top priority.</p>



<p>De Gruyter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/06/publisher-says-it-will-investigate-allegations-despite-editors-refusal/">opened an investigation</a> into the article following our coverage &#8212; and this investigation has now vindicated Artemisia by leading to the article’s retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Though the misconduct in this case was clearcut, this has been one of the hardest retractions I have ever worked,” Artemisia told us.</p>



<p>The full retraction notice, dated March 7, 2023, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following concerns raised by a third-party, this article has been retracted on the grounds of image duplication across a number of journal articles. As a result, the journal no longer has confidence in the images or the data presented.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schmitz did not reply to our requests for comment. Neither did the paper’s corresponding author, Ehsan Mohseni of the University of Guilan in Iran. Mohseni has <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dEhsan%2bMohseni">seven other retractions</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about the investigation that led to the retraction, a De Gruyter spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>De Gruyter adheres to the guidelines of the Committee of Publication Ethics (COPE). Following the recommended workflows of COPE, De Gruyter investigated this case in consultation with the journal editors and the authors of the article, and with the support of De Gruyter’s internal ethics committee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Per Artemisia:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Only following the involvement of Retraction Watch and a letter to the entire editorial board did the journal finally agree to investigate (and later retract) the paper. In a prior report to IJMR (under a previous editor-in-chief), three retractions were effected within two weeks of a report, which shows that the three year timeline was patently unnecessary. Cases like this are disappointing and discouraging. Editors should be motivated to vouchsafe [sic] the integrity of their own publications without the need for pressure or bad publicity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/09/why-editors-should-stop-ignoring-anonymous-whisteblowers-our-latest-labtimes-column/">long maintained</a> that editors should take the claims of anonymous sources seriously.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atmospheric-river-forecast-storm">By flying over atmospheric rivers, scientists aim to improve forecasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>The term “atmospheric river” may sound airy and ethereal, but these massive, fast-moving, drenching storms can hit as hard as a freight train. Since December, the U.S. West has been slammed with back-to-back-to-back atmospheric rivers, the most recent one deluging the state March 15 and another forecast to hit the state in the coming week. These powerful streams of water vapor arrive with strong winds, heavy rains and thick snow, spawning flooding, landslides and avalanches.</p>



<p>Big as they are, these storms are surprisingly tough to see coming. A week’s warning is about the best forecasters can do now.</p>





<p>A team of scientists is trying to change that. In just the past few months, they’ve flown more than three dozen reconnaissance missions into the storms. They’ve launched dozens of weather balloons high into the stratosphere, each carrying instruments to measure temperature, moisture, air pressure and wind. And the scientists have crunched reams of data and run hundreds of computer simulations, all to forecast when the next atmospheric river is going to arrive and how intense it’s likely to be.</p>



<p>The goal of this effort, the team says, is to improve predictions, to give the people in the storms’ path more time to prepare for flooding, and ultimately to find ways to manage the water for the region’s drier months.</p>



<p>It’s a big task, particularly during this year’s seemingly relentless barrage of storms. “We have been hammered here: December, January, February, March,” says meteorologist Marty Ralph. “It has been a long and active season.”</p>



<p>In just December and January, nine atmospheric rivers hammered western United States and Canada relentlessly, dumping record rain and snow across the region. Over 121 billion metric tons of water fell on California alone, according to the U.S. National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service.</p>



<p>And this task is likely to become even more challenging, given lingering uncertainty over how atmospheric rivers will shift in intensity and frequency as the planet continues to warm.</p>



<h4>Rivers in the sky</h4>



<p>Atmospheric rivers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rivers-sky">long, narrow bands of condensed water vapor</a>, typically around 1,500 kilometers long and 500 kilometers across (<em>SN: 2/11/11</em>). The streams form over warm ocean waters, often in the tropics, and snake through the sky, transporting huge amounts of water. One atmospheric river, on average, can transport up to 15 times the volume of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River. When these storms arrive over land, they can release that water as rain or snow.</p>





<p>While atmospheric rivers can bring welcome water to a parched region, they also are “the primary, almost the exclusive” cause of floods on the U.S. West Coast, says Ralph.</p>



<p>In 2013, he and colleagues created the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, or CW3E, at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. The group then created the first weather model tailored to predicting atmospheric rivers on the U.S. West Coast. This year, the team also created an <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JD037180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atmospheric river intensity scale</a>, ranking the events based on size and how much water they’re carrying.</p>



<p>To improve their forecasts of landfall and intensity, the team collects data from drifting ocean buoys, weather balloons and airplanes. The group even enlisted the aid of the U.S. Air Force’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/storm-front">hurricane hunters</a> — most famous for flying into the eyes of tropical cyclones from June to November — to do aerial reconnaissance (<em>SN: 5/18/12</em>).</p>



<p>The data collected by the planes fill an important information gap, says Anna Wilson. She’s a Scripps atmospheric scientist who also manages field research for CW3E. Weather balloons are the workhorses of weather prediction, but they’re launched over land, and “it’s important to see what happens before [an atmospheric river] makes landfall,” Wilson says.</p>



<p>Satellites can provide valuable atmospheric data over the ocean, but they generally can’t see through clouds and heavy precipitation, both characteristic features of atmospheric rivers. And atmospheric rivers hang low in the troposphere, the lowest part of Earth’s atmosphere, making it even harder for satellites to spy on them.</p>



<p>During each flight mission, the planes drop instruments called dropsondes that collect temperature, moisture, wind and other data as they fall. Since November 1, the hunters have flown 39 missions into the atmospheric rivers, Wilson says.</p>

<h2>How to study atmospheric rivers</h2>



<p>Before atmospheric rivers make landfall, temperature, moisture, pressure and wind data are collected by satellites, drifting buoys in the ocean and by airplanes that fly over the top of the atmospheric river (orange and yellow), releasing dropsondes, instruments that gather data as they sink through the air. The planes are also using an innovative technique called airborne radio occultation that uses GPS satellites and the slant of the horizon to measure atmospheric moisture to the sides of the flight paths.</p>

<p>In the U.S. West, atmospheric rivers tend to arrive from January through March. But that’s not really the start of atmospheric river season in this region: Atmospheric rivers make landfall in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the year, in the late fall. One such storm devastated that region in November 2021, spawning a deadly series of floods and landslides.</p>



<p>“That storm not only hurt people, it hurt the economy,” Ralph says, causing “thousand-year flooding that destroyed rail lines right in the middle of a serious supply chain issue.”</p>



<p>In the aftermath of that event, CW3E and their partners received funding to begin the airplane reconnaissance flights on November 1, two months earlier than these missions have begun in the past.</p>



<h4>How will climate change affect atmospheric rivers?</h4>



<p>Aside from the data-gathering challenges in predicting these storms, it’s also hard to disentangle the many factors that feed into them, from warm tropical waters to large-scale weather patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. How a warming world will influence on these storms is uncertain too, Ralph says.</p>



<p>“One thing to keep in mind is that the fuel of an atmospheric river is water vapor. It’s pushed along by the wind, formed by the temperature gradient between the poles and the equator,” he says.</p>



<p>Atmospheric rivers are also often associated with extratropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms formed by the collision of cold and warm water masses. Such cyclones can interact with an atmospheric river, perhaps pulling it along. One such fast-forming “bomb cyclone” helped spur on an atmospheric river that drenched California in January.</p>

<p>Global warming may be having two possibly offsetting effects on atmospheric rivers: Warmer air can hold more water vapor, which means more fuel for the storms. But the poles are also warming faster than the equatorial regions, which reduces the temperature difference between the regions, and that can weaken the winds.</p>



<p>“But what we’re finding is that even with that reduced gradient, there are still times when cyclones can form,” Ralph says. And those storms are feeding off the increase in water vapor. That, he says, could mean bigger and longer-lasting atmospheric rivers in the future.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest climate change won’t necessarily increase the number of atmospheric rivers, but it might increase their variability, Wilson says. “We may have more frequent shifts between very, very, very wet seasons and very, very, very dry seasons.” A warmer climate in general can mean that water is sucked up out of the soil more quickly.</p>



<p>That seesaw scenario is likely to make water management even more of a challenge in the U.S. West, where atmospheric rivers are already both a blessing and a curse. Still, “we’re very hopeful,” Wilson says, that the data will ultimately aid in the region’s complicated water management, such as by giving planners enough time to safely let water out of reservoirs before they’re flooded.</p>



<p>The events also provide as much as half of the region’s annual precipitation, bringing much-needed water to parched lands and topping off the snowpack in the high mountains, another reservoir of freshwater. This year’s storms “have done a lot to restore the landscape drought,” Ralph says, “greening up” the landscape and refilling many smaller reservoirs.</p>



<p>But “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">drought</a> is a complicated thing,” Ralph says (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). The historically low water levels in larger reservoirs in the West, such as Lake Powell and Lake Mead, isn’t so quickly replaced. “It will take more wet years like this one to recover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-soil-nutrients-rice-farming">Martian soil may have all the nutrients rice needs</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — Martian dirt may have all the necessary <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2990.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nutrients for growing rice</a>, one of humankind’s most important foods, planetary scientist Abhilash Ramachandran reported March 13 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. However, the plant may need a bit of help to survive amid perchlorate, a chemical that can be toxic to plants and has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-farming-harder-martian-regolith-soil">detected on Mars’ surface</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>“We want to send humans to Mars … but we cannot take everything there. It&#8217;s going to be expensive,” says Ramachandran, of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Growing rice there would be ideal, because it’s easy to prepare, he says. “You just peel off the husk and start boiling.”</p>





<p>Ramachandran and his colleagues grew rice plants in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103508002017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martian soil simulant</a> made of Mojave Desert basalt. They also grew rice in pure potting mix as well as several mixtures of the potting mix and soil simulant. All pots were watered once or twice a day.</p>



<p>Rice plants did grow in the synthetic Mars dirt, the team found. However, the plants developed slighter shoots and wispier roots than the plants that sprouted from the potting mix and hybrid soils. Even replacing just 25 percent of the simulant with potting mix helped heaps, they found.</p>



<p>The researchers also tried growing rice in soil with added perchlorate. They sourced one wild rice variety and two cultivars with a genetic mutation — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">modified for resilience</a> against environmental stressors like drought — and grew them in Mars-like dirt with and without perchlorate (<em>SN: 9/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>No rice plants grew amid a concentration of 3 grams of perchlorate per kilogram of soil. But when the concentration was just 1 gram per kilogram, one of the mutant lines grew both a shoot and a root, while the wild variety managed to grow a root.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that by tinkering with the successful mutant’s modified gene, <em>SnRK1a</em>, humans might eventually be able to develop a rice cultivar suitable for Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Oceans may be shrinking </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/earth-sciences-142"><em>Science News</em></a>, March 10, 1973</p>



<p>The oceans of the world may be gradually shrinking, leaking slowly away into the Earth’s mantle…. Although the oceans are constantly being slowly augmented by water carried up from Earth’s interior by volcanic activity … some process such as sea-floor spreading seems to be letting the water seep away more rapidly than it is replaced.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists traced the ocean’s leak to subduction zones, areas where tectonic plates collide and the heavier of the two sinks into the mantle. It’s still unclear how much water has cycled between the deep ocean and mantle through the ages. A 2019 analysis suggests that sea levels have <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GC008232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped by an average of up to 130 meters</a> over the last 230 million years, in part due to Pangea’s breakup creating new subduction zones. Meanwhile, molten rock that bubbles up from the mantle as continents drift apart may <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920121001734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“rain” water back into the ocean</a>, scientists reported in 2022. But since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-deep-interior-holds-vast-reservoir-water">Earth’s mantle can hold more water</a> as it cools (<em>SN: 6/13/14</em>), the oceans&#8217; mass might shrink by 20 percent every billion years.</p>

<p>Public attention to the use of animals in research is on the rise, and with good reason. As scientists, we have a responsibility to avoid using animals in our work whenever possible. Not only does this prevent needless suffering and waste of resources, it also leads to better science, because findings from animal experiments often fail to hold up in humans. If studies can be conducted ethically with human subjects, tissues, or organs, they should not use animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On paper, some journals appear to clear this bar. In reality, however, they fall short of carrying out their ethical responsibility: We see many examples, especially in journals in the nutrition field, of published research that was conducted in animals but could have been carried out in humans or using human-relevant methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/14/2852/htm">recent study</a> fed monkeys Western- and Mediterranean-style diets to produce information about the diets’ effects on human mood and behavior. Another <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/12/4350/htm">experiment</a> used pigs to evaluate how diets rich in fruits and vegetables can improve human microbiome health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should give pause to the National Library of Medicine (NLM). When deciding if a journal merits inclusion in MEDLINE, the leading bibliographic database for life sciences, NLM may <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_journal_selection.html">look at</a> whether the journal’s ethical policies align with best practices and how well individual articles adhere to those policies.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126716"></span>



<p>Consider the journal <em>Nutrients</em>, which published the studies cited above. In our view, it has a particularly bad record of accepting studies with egregious violations of ethical norms when it comes to experiments on animals. <em>Nutrients</em>’<em> </em>own<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/instructions#ethics"> guidelines</a> require the “replacement of animals by alternatives wherever possible.” However, the journal, and others like it, continuously publishes research using animals to study human nutrition when alternatives exist – and better ones at that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is onene more example: The manufacturer of a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/904">saffron-based nutrition supplement</a> explored the spice&#8217;s purported mood-boosting properties. But rather than administering the supplement to volunteers and tracking their depressive symptoms with validated instruments, as other researchers have done, the manufacturer force-fed it to mice via gavage and dropped the animals in water tanks to conduct forced swim tests as a measure of their mood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was approved by an institutional ethics committee, but we believe the journal’s ethics guidelines should still have blocked the article from being accepted. Ethics-committee approval is irrelevant to the question of whether such an experiment met the journal’s explicit guidelines for the use of animals in research.</p>



<p>In 2022, <em>Nutrients</em> published more than 4,000 research papers, and just under 800 of those (roughly 20%) used live animals. After spending more than a year investigating the journal, we find that most, if not all, of these studies could have been conducted with humans or human-relevant alternatives. This would not only have spared tens of thousands of animal lives, but would also have provided clinically meaningful data rather than results of uncertain relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Nutrients</em>, which is published by MDPI and indexed for MEDLINE, has a history of editorial problems. In 2018, the journal saw <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/open-access-editors-resign-after-alleged-pressure-publish-mediocre-papers">10 of its senior editors resign</a>, including the editor-in-chief, over alleged pressure to accept &#8220;mediocre&#8221; papers. The change in leadership and the ethical failings we have identified both warrant a fresh look at the journal&#8217;s participation in MEDLINE per the database&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_policies.html#reeval">policy for reexamination</a>.</p>



<p>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, along with the support of more than 700 physicians and health care professionals, brought these issues to the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/wxbqpxpmfk/letter-to-nutrients-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">journal</a>, publisher, MEDLINE staff, the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/zffv527vcn/letter-to-nlm-medline-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">National Library of Medicine</a>, and the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (the federal advisory committee that recommends journals for inclusion in MEDLINE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, insufficient action has been taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time after time, <em>Nutrients</em> claims its editorial office and ethics committee “checked the articles themselves to confirm that they contained ethics statements that are in accordance with the journal policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, MEDLINE “has independently verified that all articles you have brought to its attention include statements indicating that the studies were reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But ethics-committee approval is not sufficient to meet the journal’s stated ethical guidelines. We believe journals should take their ethical guidelines seriously, just as NLM should live up to its vetting function.</p>



<p>The continued retort by the National Institutes of Health is that we should direct our concerns to the publisher, which we have already done repeatedly to little apparent effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open-access, pay-to-publish journals become increasingly prevalent, we need to consider the financial motives of these publishers. MDPI, which publishes <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals">420 journals</a>, charges thousands of dollars for each published article, creating a deterrent to meticulously screen submissions for evidence of ethical misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to sustain research integrity, MEDLINE should make its reevaluation process transparent. Setting up a system for scientists to see why and how often journals are reevaluated and creating a platform where journals can be submitted for reevaluation could help boost confidence in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As scientists, we are often left leaning on the trust of bibliographic databases to know if a publication is trustworthy. If MEDLINE fails to enforce its rules, it is not only the journals that lose their credibility; MEDLINE’s credibility suffers in the process as does that of the body of scientific literature upon which we depend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If editors, publishers, and the NLM are not willing to take corrective action, we are left wondering whom the scientific community can depend on to uphold scientific accountability. Failing to abide by ethical standards in the literature is, in our opinion, leading to a research-integrity crisis.</p>
