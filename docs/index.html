<p>MDPI has retracted a study about vaping that one expert said seemed “like a joke” almost two years after the publisher received a complaint about the flawed work.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/14/2/37">paper</a>, published in <em>Neurology International</em> in 2022, reported e-cigarette users had a higher risk of early stroke than traditional tobacco users. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10177441/E-cigarette-users-15-likely-suffer-stroke-middle-age-regular-smokers.html">covered in the media</a>, featured in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240318124219/https:/www.undo.org/exposed/big-tobacco-fantasyland">a public campaign against vaping</a> and included in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9E38A75C420D1F19DA0D48C37FA8D8?utm_source=Firefox&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Firefox">contested</a><a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2300229?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">meta-analysis</a>.</p>



<p>But the study contained critical errors, as we reported in 2024 in a story for <em>Science</em> that investigated paper mill-like <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">businesses dangling quick-and-dirty publications</a> for international medical graduates looking for residency positions in the United States.</p>



<span id="more-133936"></span>



<p>The corresponding author, Urvish Patel, is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328141542/https:/researchupdate.org/team/urvish-patel/">founder and director</a> of one such outfit, the Texas-based <a href="https://researchupdate.org/">Research Update Organization</a>. Several or all of his coauthors were international medical graduates who paid to be part of the program. The paper did not mention this fact, but instead misrepresented Patel as being affiliated with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.</p>



<p>At the time of our <em>Science</em> story, Patel defended his publication, telling us it “described very well [the] methodology, data, every single thing.” But experts we consulted were not impressed. Biostatistician and epidemiologist Miguel Hernán of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, for example, told us the “paper seems like a joke” and said no “self-respecting journal should have published this.”</p>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/17/12/207">retraction notice</a> from December 18 states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding several major errors in the data analysis, raising concerns about the validity of the findings.</p>



<p>Adhering to our complaint procedure, an investigation was conducted by the Editorial Office and Editorial Board. Although the authors initially cooperated, they were unable to provide satisfactory explanations or supporting material to resolve the issues identified. Furthermore, attempts to contact the relevant institution for further information were unsuccessful, as no response was received.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors did not agree to the retraction, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel told us by email he had “a lot to say as usually it won’t take 3.5” years for “3 multivariate” regression models and “10-12 chi-square tests to be proven wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But there is no meaning in talking with either faustian or hypocrite person,” he wrote. “I wish I would not choose this topic for research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The anti-vaping campaign featuring the study was how it first caught the attention of Gal Cohen and Floe Foxon, both of whom work for companies that provide contract research and have ties to e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. Cohen is Head of Scientific Affairs at the Rose Research Center, and Foxon is a data scientist at Pinney Associates. In late 2023 and early 2024, the two sent several emails to Patel asking about his work, but did not receive any helpful information in reply.</p>



<p>On March 4, 2024, Cohen and Foxon submitted a comment to <em>Neurology International</em> describing all of their concerns, which included a glaring error in the sample size reported in the paper, insufficient stroke observations and a lack of information on whether the strokes occurred before or after vaping began.</p>



<p>In May of that year, following the publication of our <em>Science</em> story, the journal told Cohen and Foxon that instead of publishing their comment, it would initiate an investigation into Patel’s work, according to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1F118DC9A92A4FC13507BB5448462D#2">a PubPeer comment</a> from March 2025 in which the pair laid out the problems with the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To date,” they wrote, “the only public action taken by <em>Neurology International</em> has been to quietly remove the ‘Editor’s Choice’ badge from the article.”</p>



<p>Finally, on December 18, an MDPI employee told Foxon the publisher had “investigated the article of concern. As a result, our Editorial Board and the Editor in Chief determined that there were too many scientific flaws and decided to retract this article.”</p>



<p>MDPI did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s reassuring to see the journal take necessary action on such flawed research, and they do deserve some credit for that,” Foxon told us.</p>



<p>“Of course, there is the fundamental question of how this article was published in the first place,” he added. “It seems there are so many errors that anyone remotely familiar with this dataset and these methods should have spotted the issues a country mile away.”</p>

                For decades, Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been viewed as a disorder of the brain. This perspective was shaped by the presence of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates throughout the brain, combined with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Collectively, these dysfunctions drive the devastating motor symptoms, speech difficulties, and cognitive decline that characterise PD. However, recent research challenges this brain-centric view. Alpha-synuclein has been identified to appear in the...

<p>In a new memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kangaroo-Dreams-Prof-Tuan-Nguyen/dp/1965142613"><em>Kangaroo Dreams</em></a>, Tuan V. Nguyen, D.Sc., Ph.D., provides a unique perspective on medical research. Nguyen escaped Vietnam in 1981 as part of the mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people">“boat people”</a> exodus of refugees, taking to dangerous waters just a few months after his older brother attempted the same and disappeared. Making his way to Australia through grit and luck in 1982, Nguyen started his new life as a dishwasher before steadily building a career in science, ultimately specializing in bone research.</p>



<p>Nguyen is now distinguished professor of predictive medicine and director of the Center for Health Technologies at the University of Technology Sydney and adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales. He’s also a Leadership Fellow of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and a member of the Order of Australia. Dedicated to the memory of his lost brother, <em>Kangaroo Dreams</em> weaves Nguyen’s personal journey with a thoughtful examination of contemporary medical research. We interviewed him in writing to learn more. (Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: You were co-author on </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/367284a0"><strong>a 1994 <em>Nature</em> paper</strong></a><strong> subsequently </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/387106a0"><strong>corrected in 1997</strong></a><strong> which reported individuals with a particular vitamin D receptor gene benefitted from relatively high bone mineral density. When the research team made this finding, you write, “A nagging unease, however, bothered me. The results, while undeniably impressive, seemed almost too good to be true.” The team published the findings only to discover – after a <em>Nature</em> reader challenged the results – that a lab member who was ill likely contaminated samples, skewing the results. Did you regret not having pushed harder on your initial doubts? What held you back?</strong></p>



<span id="more-133901"></span>



<p>Nguyen: I come from a cultural background, particularly in Vietnam, where respect for teachers and senior colleagues is considered an ethical obligation rather than a matter of courtesy. This principle strongly shapes how junior scientists engage in professional discourse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In retrospect, I sometimes wish I had expressed my reservations more directly. At the time, however, as a junior member of the team, my response was shaped by a strong cultural and professional norm of deference to senior colleagues, limited experience, and a good-faith expectation that the results would be independently validated through subsequent work anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This experience became an important lesson for me in the need to actively insist on rigorous validation, particularly when findings appear unusually strong.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Why did it take three years to publish a correction</strong>?</p>



<p>Nguyen: The reader’s question prompted a careful re-examination of thousands of original samples. Investigating the matter, including confirming the likely source of sample contamination and re-running the analyses, required time and thoroughness. This process was followed by internal discussions and coordination among the co-authors to ensure a shared understanding of the findings. The journal’s correction procedures also contributed to the overall timeline. Importantly, after the analysis was completed, the main conclusions of the study remained unchanged, which was a considerable relief for all of us. Once the evidence was clear and fully documented, we proceeded with the correction.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Tell us briefly about the “experiment” you conducted which validated your suspicion about bias against papers authored by people with Vietnamese names.</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: At the time, I was running two research labs, one in Australia and one in Vietnam. In Vietnam, I had established a large, population-based prospective study with the support of many dedicated physicians and scientists. As this work progressed, I observed a recurring pattern: manuscripts from my Vietnamese lab received reviews that I regarded as unfair and unprofessional. Some were distinctly patronizing and, in certain cases, intimidating in tone. In some instances, reviewers raised statistically incorrect criticisms, even though I have extensive expertise in this area, having served as a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and as a statistical editor for three medical journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, some submissions were desk rejected with little or no explanation. Sometimes, the stated reason was that the work “added little to the literature,” despite the fact that these studies were genuinely novel. I also observed instances in which conceptually similar studies conducted in Western populations were subsequently published, while our previous work in Vietnam addressing the same questions with more rigor was deemed insufficiently original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prompted me to explore whether factors such as author affiliation or name recognition might be influencing editorial decisions. To do this, we submitted essentially similar manuscripts to the same journal, varying only the authorship. In the initial submission, all authors were based in Vietnam, and the manuscript was desk rejected. Several months later, a closely comparable version, now including my name and that of an Australian colleague, was submitted and was sent out for external review. At that point, we withdrew the manuscript and informed the editors of what we had done.</p>



<p>Although this was not a formal study, the outcome was consistent with my own experience and with broader discussions in the literature regarding unconscious bias in peer review, particularly as it relates to authors and institutions from lower-resource countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW: We frequently report on paper mills, citation cartels and the like, and these often are located in developing nations. Do you think our reporting is adding to the bias, and what would you advise?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I have followed Retraction Watch with great interest for many years, as its reporting consistently reflects issues I have encountered firsthand in practice. Drawing in part on insights from your reporting, I have for 20 years raised concerns about research and publication ethics in Vietnam through the popular press and books written in Vietnamese.</p>

<p>I consider that your reporting is essential in uncovering genuine misconduct and in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research, irrespective of geography. That said, there is a possibility that sustained emphasis on particular regions may unintentionally reinforce certain perceptions or stereotypes, especially if comparable issues elsewhere receive less attention. For example, researchers in economically advanced countries also publish in predatory or questionable journals and engage in a range of questionable research practices, such as salami publication or <em>p</em>-hacking. Highlighting these issues across diverse settings can help ensure a more balanced and contextualized understanding of research integrity challenges.</p>



<p>So, my suggestion would be to continue this important work. At the same time, it may be helpful to place greater emphasis on the broader, systemic drivers of misconduct, such as publication pressure and incentive structures that operate across all research systems. Where possible, including more cases from high-income settings would add valuable context. Taken together, this broader coverage can help ensure that the focus remains on practices and structures, rather than on geography alone.</p>



<p><strong>RW: In your book, you explore the dangers of narcissism to science. What do you think academics should do when they spot narcissism in a potential collaborator? In a detractor? In a mentee?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Over the course of my career, I have encountered many individuals with strong narcissistic traits in science. They can be intellectually stimulating colleagues, and some are undoubtedly highly talented. At the same time, these traits can present challenges in collaborative and mentoring contexts.</p>



<p>For potential collaborators, it is sensible to proceed with some caution. Reviewing their track record for equitable credit-sharing, collegiality, and ethical conduct can be helpful. If concerns arise, such as excessive self-promotion or a history of difficult collaborations, it may be wise to limit the scope of engagement or, if necessary, decline involvement.</p>



<p>For detractors, maintaining professionalism is the key. I find it helpful to focus discussions strictly on data, methods, and evidence, while documenting interactions and avoiding personal escalation. This approach helps keep disagreements constructive and protects one’s own position.</p>



<p>For mentees, early and thoughtful mentoring is particularly important. Setting clear expectations, modeling humility, and encouraging self-reflection can help channel ambition toward productive, collaborative outcomes. When left unaddressed, these traits can be detrimental not only to individuals but also to research groups and institutions.</p>



<p><strong>RW: It has been very challenging to stop bad behavior in the sciences, partly because of the problem of self-interested institutions, as you note in your book. Do you suppose there should be some system for weeding out or at least being vigilant about problem personalities in the sciences? And if so, what would that look like?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I would be cautious about any formal mechanism designed to “weed out” individuals, as such approaches risk misuse and unnecessary punishment. A more constructive approach is to focus on systems and institutional culture, rather than on labeling people.</p>



<p>For example, institutions could strengthen anonymous and well-protected channels for reporting bullying or misconduct. They could provide regular training in research ethics and professional conduct. Broader forms of feedback, such as 360-degree evaluations, could also be incorporated into promotion and leadership decisions. In addition, greater transparency around conflicts of interest, particularly for reviewers and editors, would help build trust in the system.</p>



<p>In addition, I think professional societies and funding agencies can play an important role. They can recognize and reward behaviors that promote collegiality, integrity, and mentorship, rather than focusing exclusively on narrow performance metrics. In my view, lasting improvement is more likely to arise from sustained cultural change and shared accountability than from purely punitive approaches.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Is there a role for overtly teaching humility in scientific training?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Yes, but it should be framed as a professional skill essential to scientific rigor, rather than as a moral trait.</p>



<p>In my cultural background, modesty and humility are considered professional and social norms. In other settings, however, humility may be interpreted as weakness, while overconfidence is sometimes rewarded as a sign of competence. In science, this inversion is problematic: overconfidence increases the risk of bias, discourages serious engagement with uncertainty, and can lead to premature or overstated conclusions.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is a strong case for giving humility more explicit attention in scientific training, alongside technical and methodological skills. Science advances through collective effort, and progress depends on recognizing uncertainty, fallibility, and the contributions of others. Humility, in this sense, underpins good judgment, reproducibility, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Early in my career, my institute director, a widely respected figure in DNA research, regularly reminded us to be modest and to share credit. This advice shaped my own approach to mentorship and is something I consciously pass on to my students.</p>



<p>Humility can also be addressed through structured training. In Vietnam, I have led workshops and seminars on research ethics and facilitated discussions of historical cases in which overconfidence or unrecognized bias led to serious scientific error. These settings allow trainees to see humility not as self-effacement, but as a safeguard against flawed reasoning.</p>



<p>That said, mentorship plays a central role in shaping scientific values. I was fortunate to train under a physician–scientist of exceptional integrity, who consistently modeled openness to critique, respect for replication, and a willingness to revise conclusions in light of new evidence. When demonstrated in practice, these principles are often absorbed more deeply than through formal instruction alone.</p>



<p>Thus, by treating humility as a core professional competency, essential to methodological rigor, we can strengthen both scientific outcomes and research culture.</p>

<p>A “scholarly business and management publication” is holding a researcher’s paper for ransom, requesting the author pay to withdraw the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher submitted a manuscript in August to the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal</em> in August, thinking he had sent it to the <a href="https://www.aom.org/publications/journals/journal/"><em>Academy of Management Journal</em></a><em>.</em> He asked to remain anonymous for fear of seeming careless “rather than recognizing the real predatory nature” of the journal.</p>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://archive.is/poCsx">homepage</a> notes it is indexed in Scopus, but it was <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/19700175176#tabs=2">delisted in 2021</a>, nor is it indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science. Its <a href="https://archive.is/AfFMm">most recent volume</a> contains five single-author articles from nonexistent universities. None of the articles has a DOI or provides an email for the author.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133910"></span>



<p>Once the researcher realized his mistake the following day, he asked to withdraw his manuscript. In emails seen by Retraction Watch, the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em>asked the researcher to pay €1,519 —&nbsp; roughly $1,770 — to “remove your article from our database.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months later, the journal emailed the researcher saying it was “working on” his article and asked if he had any revisions. The email, signed by “Blessy Mertins,” did not address the researcher’s withdrawal request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher then sent what he termed a “cease and desist” letter to the journal soon after. As of now, the article has not been published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal&nbsp; </em>did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iriem.org/pro/memberdetail.aspx?ID=295">Sang-Bing Tsai</a>, one of the <a href="https://archive.is/QHtWx">three listed editors-in-chief</a> on the journal’s website, told us he has no affiliation with the “fake journal” which is using his name “without permission.” Tsai said he reached out to the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em>“five or six years ago” to request his name be removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other two listed editors-in-chief are Shawn Carraher and Roberto Cerchione. Carraher’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-carraher-0b60b118/">LinkedIn profile</a> lists his affiliation with the journal and states he is doing a “post doctoral “Graduate Certificate in Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship” at Harvard University. A representative from Harvard told us no one by that name is currently enrolled in the program, which does not offer a post-doctoral degree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carraher did not respond to our request for comment when we reached out via LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cerchione, a professor at the University of Naples, Parthenope, similarly lists his affiliation with the <em>Academy of Strategic Management Journal </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberto-cerchione-21888267/?originalSubdomain=it">on his LinkedIn profile</a>. Cerchione did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is published by Allied Business Academies, a company that has been flagged for <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/dementia-conference-fraud-1.3941354">fake conferences</a> and <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201709/20/01-5134920-fraudes-fausses-revues-scientifiques-faux-congres.php">journals</a>, as reported by <em>CBC News</em> and <em>La Presse</em>.

                Neuroscience is chasing the complexity of social behavior, yet we have not answered the simplest question in the chain: How does a brain know “who is who”?
