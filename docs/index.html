<p>For the past eight years, an education researcher in Spain has been waging an unsuccessful battle – including legal action – to quash a retraction she argues should never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515000718?via%3Dihub">Her paper</a>, about the use of digital tools in early childhood education, was pulled by <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>just months after it was published in 2015. According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515001414">retraction notice</a>, the article was submitted for publication while it was still under review at another journal, violating editorial policies against duplicate submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to the researcher, <a href="https://produccioncientifica.usal.es/investigadores/56264/detalle">Elena Ramírez Orellana</a> of the University of Salamanca, her paper had already been rejected by the first journal before it was sent to the other. She had the documents to prove it, she said, but that didn’t matter.</p>



<span id="more-127860"></span>



<p>&#8220;We have never been able to reverse the status of the article,&#8221; she told Retraction Watch by email, adding that she had taken the case to court. &#8220;What I have learned throughout this process is that evidence related to scientific evaluation is worth far less than private conversations between editors.&#8221;</p>



<p>It all began in 2012, when Ramírez Orellana and her colleagues submitted their manuscript to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Culture+and+Education%2FCultura+y+Educaci%C3%B3n"><em>Culture and Education/Cultura y Educación</em></a>, a bilingual journal published at the time by Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje and later by Taylor &amp; Francis. The paper was rejected based on two reviews, one positive and one negative. The authors appealed, Ramírez Orellana said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We requested a third referee and the journal agreed. However, the status of the paper, which was rejected, never changed. In December 2012, we reminded the editors of the issue of the third referee, and they said OK, there had been a misunderstanding and they would look into it. The status of the paper remained the same, rejected. We never received any further communication about the third referee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In support of her claims, Ramírez Orellana shared extensive documentation with Retraction Watch, including <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rejected-Cultura-y-Educacion-2012.pdf">screenshots from the editorial management platform</a> (in Spanish).</p>



<p>Two years passed. Then, in December 2014, the researchers submitted their manuscript to <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>, assuming it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere at <em>Culture and Education</em>. They had added &#8220;new tables and figures, new methodology, new references,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana said. They also had rewritten it in English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after <em>Computers &amp; Education</em> published the paper, titled &#8220;Analysis of classroom practices with an ICT resource in early childhood education,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana fired off a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-proposito-del-articulo-CE-16428-50834.pdf">fateful email</a> (in Spanish) telling <em>Culture and Education</em> it could stop looking for a third reviewer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will never regret it enough,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I was really angry about the way our work had been treated in <em>Culture and Education</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her message, in turn, caused then-editor of <em>Culture and Education</em> Liliana Tolchinsky to email <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>. According to Ramírez Orellana, Tolchinsky’s email read, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am contacting you in relation to the paper &#8220;Analysis of Classroom Practices with an ICT Resource in Early Childhood Education&#8221; by Elena Ramírez, Jorge Martín -Domínguez, Begoña Orgaz and Isabel Cañedo that was recently accepted for publication in Computers &amp; Education. I regret to inform you that the above mentioned paper was submitted to your journal in December 2014 while it was under review in Cultura y Educación /Culture and Education a bilingual Journal published by Taylor and Francis. The authors did not communicate to Cultura y Educación that they were submitting the paper to another journal. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s when <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>decided to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We kept trying to reverse the decision, but it was impossible,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She hired lawyers who contacted Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje. On Oct. 30, 2015, the foundation’s director of publications told the editors of <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/email.pdf">an email</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an in-depth assessment of the article’s situation, and after having consulted with all parts involved (authors, Editor of Cultura y Educación and Board of Trustees of Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje), who are all in agreement with the content of this communication, the journal Cultura y Educación considers the above mentioned article rejected prior to the date in which it was first submitted to Computers &amp; Education.</p>



<p>In view of this consideration on behalf of our journal, the policy regarding dual submissions would not have been violated. We thus courteously invite you to reconsider your decision of retracting the article from your publication.</p>



<p>All parts involved would also like to offer our apologies for any inconveniences.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>, Chin-Chung Tsai of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei, who was among the recipients of the email, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson from Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors of the article retracted from Computers &amp; Education submitted the manuscript to the journal, Culture &amp; Education, published by T&amp;F, in April 2012.  </p>



<p>The manuscript submitted to Culture &amp; Education was rejected by the journal in June 2012. We were informed by the Editor of Culture &amp; Education that the authors appealed the decision to reject, and the manuscript was sent to an additional reviewer in 2013. The authors submitted the manuscript – in English – to Computers &amp; Education in December 2014.  It was subsequently peer-reviewed and accepted in March 2015.  Following acceptance by Computers &amp; Education, the authors contacted the editor of Culture &amp; Education to withdraw their manuscript, and the Editor of Culture &amp; Education contacted the Editor of Computers &amp; Education to alert them to the dual submission.    </p>



<p>It is the policy of Computers &amp; Education that manuscripts submitted to the journal are not under consideration elsewhere, and the editor decided to retract the article following the information on the dual submissions received from Culture &amp; Education.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson did not respond to a question about why the journal had not acted on the 2015 email from Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.</p>



<p>In 2016, Ramírez Orellana said, she filed a lawsuit against Tolchinsky, Begoña Gros Salvat, another editor at <em>Culture and Education</em>, and Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>So far, the results have always been against me, but I am continuing with it because I hope to eventually take the case to the European courts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje declined to comment. Neither Tolchinsky nor Gros Salvat responded to our emails.</p>

                <p>Note: cOAlition S published the following announcement on its website on Wednesday, September 13th.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, in partnership with<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/"> Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, are delighted to announce the establishment of a multi-stakeholder working group, tasked to identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing.</p>



<p>Following an open <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/moving-away-from-apcs/">call</a> for applicants, we received over 60 high-quality applications. After a thorough review process, with a focus on ensuring that the group represents a diverse range of stakeholders who are committed to supporting a more equitable publishing business model, we are pleased to announce that the following organisations have been invited to join the group.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="521" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Beyond-article-based-charges_-image-2-1024x521.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21577" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Beyond-article-based-charges_-image-2-1024x521.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Beyond-article-based-charges_-image-2-300x153.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Beyond-article-based-charges_-image-2-768x391.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Beyond-article-based-charges_-image-2.png 1353w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>*Beyond article-based charges: list of working group members</p>



<p>The three co-organisers &ndash; cOAlition S (Robert Kiley), Jisc (Anna Vernon) and PLOS (Roheena Anand) &ndash; will also sit on this group and act as Chair on a rotating basis.</p>



<p><strong>About the group</strong></p>



<p> In the original call we had initially aimed to appoint up to 12 members, split roughly equally across the three stakeholder of funders, libraries/library consortia and publishers. However, given the strength of the submitted applications, our final selection resulted in three representatives from funders, five from publishers, and six from libraries/library consortia. While we acknowledge that the stakeholders are not equally represented, we firmly believe that the group is well-balanced and fully capable of delivering on its objectives.</p>



<p>We also sought to ensure global diversity in our selection process, and we are pleased to note that our group includes representatives from Asia, Latin America, as well as North America, Europe and the UK.</p>



<p>The first meeting is scheduled for the 14 September. As and when outputs are created and approved by the group, these will be openly shared.</p>



<p>We would like to conclude by thanking all those organisations who applied to join this working group. Given the breadth of experience and knowledge demonstrated in these applications, we may well reach out to some of them in the future, either to invite them to specific meetings or to request early feedback on any proposals which we will develop.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/opportunities-for-wearable-technology-in-parkinson-s-disease">Opportunities for Wearable Technology in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>A recent study in Nature has found that wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson’s disease years before clinical diagnosis</em></p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are continuing to rise in frequency. The personal and societal impact of these diseases also continues to grow, with Parkinson’s disease (PD) incidence increasing from 2.5 million people worldwide in 1990 to 6.1 million in 2016, an increase which could not wholly be explained by an ageing population. </p>

<p>Resultingly. there is a growing necessity for earlier symptom detection to provide the opportunity to slow, stop and ultimately reverse, the declining slope of neurodegeneration in PD. However, a key challenge in developing new treatments is that as the disease becomes clinically apparent, pathology is often quite advanced and difficult to reverse. Early diagnosis offers the opportunity for early intervention.</p>

<p>The prognostic capacity of wearable devices is an area of active investigation in a range of neurological conditions. Improved ability to predict disease trajectory, and early identification of impairment enable the discovery of potential early markers of PD. </p>

<p>In particular, wearable devices containing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are a promising evaluation tool for neurological symptoms, as they enable researchers to view changes in an individual’s ability to move their body. An IMU is contained within a wearable device and used to measure velocity, orientation, and gravitational force, which in turn can provide detailed information on movement. An accelerometer measures acceleration from inertia (i.e., movement from a resting baseline), and can be particularly suited to evaluating movement disorders such as PD. </p>

<p>A recent study published in Nature used data from over 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank (a national prospective study, collecting data on over half a million individuals aged 40-69 since 2006, with follow-up monitoring of their clinical status) to explore if accelerometery data was a suitable marker for prodromal PD (ie., the early signs and symptoms before a disease becomes clinically apparent). The paper also aims to establish the ability of accelerometery to discriminate between those with and without a diagnosis of PD and its specificity compared to other diagnostic markers. </p>


<p><strong>Accelerometery data as a predictor for Parkinson’s Disease</strong></p>

<p>153 participants in the study had a confirmed clinical diagnosis of PD. Using machine learning models trained on accelerometery data, the researchers found that accelerometers were the best modality to predict if an individual had a PD diagnosis, outperforming models using data on genetics, lifestyle, blood biomarkers, or prodromal clinical signs.</p>

<p>Crucially, accelerometery models also outperformed other models in their ability to distinguish prodromal PD (n = 11) up to 7 years before a diagnosis was made. Accelerometery data enabled identification of cases with greater certainty than models using data from known prodromal markers: genetics, lifestyle, blood biomarkers, prodromal clinical signs or all these modalities combined. </p>

<p>In both prodromal and clinically diagnosed cases of PD, accelerometery data indicated a reduction in daytime levels of activity compared to age and sex matched controls. This reduction began several years before a clinical diagnosis was made, and levels of activity continued to decline as the disease progressed. This reduction in acceleration both before and following diagnosis was specific to subjects affected by PD; no other disease was associated with this reduction, demonstrating its potential as a disease-specific marker. </p>


<p><strong>Implication of these findings</strong></p>

<p>Early detection of PD provides the opportunity for early intervention, for example through inviting patients to participate in clinical trials of neuroprotective treatments. Identifying those at greater risk of developing PD, and any other condition, remains a priority for preventative medicine. Accelerometery offers a minimally invasive, low burden and relatively inexpensive alternative to blood-based, genetic, or imaging biomarkers, and has the potential to be a scalable screening option for prodromal disease. Importantly, a key draw of an accelerometer is the passive collection of real-world data. The majority of us use devices containing accelerometers every day and wrist-worn health activity monitors are becoming more affordable and widely used. Accessing the data from these devices is a valuable alternative option in accelerometer-based population screening.</p>

<p>This study provides evidence that with only a week of real-world data collection an accelerometer has predictive value for several years. Short assessment periods reduce the amount of data needed, and the associated resources required to collected and process it, whilst providing sufficient data to screen large numbers of individuals with minimal participation burden. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-male-palm-cockatoos-drumsticks">Wild male palm cockatoos rock out with custom drumsticks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like teenage Romeos toting sticker-plastered guitar cases, male palm cockatoos show that romancing a crush with a love song isn’t just about music — it’s also about style.</p>



<p>Wild palm cockatoos (<em>Probosciger aterrimus</em>) <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.1271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">craft bespoke instruments for musical mating rituals</a> according to their individual tastes, researchers report September 13 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </em>Some males were drumstick devotees, others made a mix of drumsticks and seed pod instruments, and one unorthodox male marched to the beat of his own pods — he made almost no drumsticks at all. These individual touches have more to do with personal preference than with available materials, the team found, hinting that these rockin’ cockatoos’ mates might prize creativity or individuality.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video from 2017 shows wild male palm cockatoos keeping a drumbeat during mating displays. New research by the same team now shows the birds’ choice of instruments is as individualized as their musical style.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Adding distinctive touches to their instruments is not “a routine that is always the same in every animal,” says cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, who was not involved in the research. “There is some element of innovation to it.”</p>





<p>If humans were birds, we might be something like parrots. Like us and our primate cousins, parrots have big, clever brains, complex social lives and extended childhoods spent learning from their parents.</p>



<p>Unlike primates, most parrots aren’t known to use tools in the wild. And “most parrots that have been studied using tools have been studied in captivity,” Auersperg says. For instance, her team found that wild-caught Goffin’s cockatoos (<em>Cacatua goffiniana</em>) held temporarily in a research aviary, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">wielded sophisticated toolkits for foraging</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>2/10/23</em>).</p>



<p>Wild palm cockatoos are a fabulous and fascinating exception. These striking, endangered birds live in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea, and they craft and use tools not to find food, but to find a mate — a rarity that stands out even in primate company.</p>



<p>A male palm cockatoo puts on a musical mating display from trees in his territory. He <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/male-cockatoos-have-beat">sings, twirls and drums rhythmically against the tree, often using a percussion instrument</a>, a stick or seed pod, clutched in his left foot (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/28/17</em>). As part of the display, he crafts the instrument himself and the female watches as he snaps off tree branches and whittles them just so. Add in the birds’ dramatic black and red plumage and tall, spiked crests and you’ve got perhaps the closest nature can come to a rock concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those tapping displays actually have all the hallmarks of human music using instruments,” says conservation biologist Rob Heinsohn of the Australian National University in Canberra. “And the males all have their own drumming signatures. Some like to do it really slowly, some go very quickly, and then others throw in little flourishes.”</p>



<p>Heinsohn and his colleagues wanted to see if these rocker birds express their singular style through their instruments, too.</p>



<p>Over two years, the researchers wandered Australia’s Kutini-Payamu National Park and surrounding Aboriginal lands listening for the calls of displaying male cockatoos. This led the team to 70 display trees, where the scientists collected a total of 227 drumsticks and 29 seed pod instruments discarded by the birds. Like a musician smashing a guitar at the end of a concert, male cockatoos toss their instruments to the ground after a display.</p>



<p>Comparing instruments discarded by 12 individual cockatoos revealed what the researchers interpret as evidence for individual preference in their instrument designs. Drumstick length varied more from bird to bird than would be expected by random chance. Some preferred short and stubby drumsticks, while others made longer, thinner ones.</p>



<p>“Each one has developed his own idea as to what makes a special drumstick,&#8221; says Heinsohn. There are many “different ways of getting it right — of being a good artist, both in their musical performance, but also in the crafting of these tools,” he says. “I think being really individual and being creative and being out there on your own is part of what the females are looking for.”</p>





<p>While musical instruments are practically universal across human cultures, and we frequently incorporate flashy objects into our romance rituals, other animals rarely use tools for either music or mating displays. Scientists also rarely find evidence for individual creative choices among nonhuman toolmakers.</p>



<p>This makes palm cockatoos triply fascinating: With their signature styles in music and craftsmanship, these feathered flirts are a good reminder that humanity isn’t always as special as it seems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/12/interesting-papers-on-recent-neuroscience-methods/">Interesting papers on recent neuroscience methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>Find below three interesting methods papers relevant for neuroscience. All three of them are, in my opinion, worth a quick read.</p>



<p><strong>Acoustic cameras to localize ultrasound vocalization of mice</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.86126">Sterling et al. (2023)</a> from the lab of Bernhard Englitz addressed the problem how to localize ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) from rodents, in particular mice. The localization of USVs and their reliable attribution to a specific mouse can be challenging, especially when mice are interacting snout-to-snout. The authors managed to perform sound localization with a precision of less than 5 mm (91% of USVs correctly assigned). How do they achieve this?</p>



<p>The authors combined two complementary approaches. In a first approach, they used an “acoustic camera” formed by an 8&#215;8 array of 64 ultrasound microphones (<a href="https://sorama.eu/products/cam64">https://sorama.eu/products/cam64</a>). This approach provided spatially precise localization but was less reliable for high frequencies. In a second approach, they used an array of only 4 but high-quality ultrasound microphones (<a href="https://www.avisoft.com/">https://www.avisoft.com/</a>). Figure supplement 1-1 nicely compares the noise spectra of these two microphone types. The second approach was more important to detect USV events, while the “acoustic camera” approach was essential for localization of the detected events. A nice methods paper!</p>



<p><strong>Glyoxal fixation for improved antibody staining</strong></p>



<p>In this study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf7084">Konno et al. (2023)</a> from the lab of Masahiko Watanabe refined and tested an alternative protocol for immunohistochemistry (IHC), following up on a study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695709">Richter et al. (2018)</a>. The authors replaced the standard fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, PFA) by a different solution (glyoxal) and find that this modified fixation protocol enables improved diffusion of and labeling with antibodies, including antibodies against important proteins such as synaptic adhesion molecules, receptor proteins and ion channels.</p>



<p>The authors mention a few caveats in the Discussion: Glyoxal fixation improved signal for certain antibodies but not for all, without an indication why this could be the case. The sample seemed to be less than hard and fixed for glyoxal than for PFA fixation. Moreover, they report that “ultrastructural images of neurons and synapses” were more strongly compromised by glyoxal fixation compared to PFA fixation. This last comment seems interesting, since <a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695709">Richter et al. (2018)</a> in their original publication on glyoxal fixation stated that ultrastructure was better conserved in glyoxal than in PFA. I’m curious whether glyoxal might become the new standard for IHC during the next decade!</p>



<p><strong>Near-infrared co-illumination protects fluorophores</strong></p>



<p>Fluorescence occurs when fluorophore molecules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">transition into an excited state</a> and, during the relaxation process into the ground state, release a photon. This process can go awry when the molecule transitions from the excited state into a dark (triplet) state or other non-desired states where the molecule is stuck (photobleaching) or which result in chemical reactions that generate oxidative stress (phototoxicity). As an experimentalist, it is essential to find the balance between (a) as much power as necessary (to be able to observe the structures of interest) and (b) as little power as possible (to prevent bleaching and toxicity).</p>



<p>In a surprising study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01893-7">Ludvikova et al. (2023)</a> find that near-infrared (NIR) light prevents photobleaching and phototoxicity. The authors performed imaging of standard fluorescent proteins (EGFP) in cell culture using one-photon widefield microscopy with an excitation wavelength of around 470 nm. They find that co-illumination with NIR light (approx. 900 nm) reduced bleaching induced by 470 nm. It is not fully clear from the study why NIR co-illumination prevents transitioning into triplet states, but the evidence that this indeed happens seems very convincing.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how this can be generalized to different illumination intensities and patterns, e.g., to confocal or light-sheet microscopy. And it poses the intriguing question whether two-photon microscopy of green fluorophores, which typically uses a wavelength in the NIR (around 920 nm), also takes advantage of this protective effect. For two-photon microscopy, illumination already occurs at around 900 nm, so it could be that the same photons that induce fluorescence also protect from bleaching/toxicity. It seems however challenging to test this hypothesis experimentally. As a sidenote, I’m reminded of my own experiments (reported in <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">this blog post</a>) where I found that long-lived dark triplet states seemed to be less relevant at 920 nm than predicted from experiments performed at 800 nm. I’m hoping that follow-up studies will further dissect the NIR co-illumination effect and study its relevance for other imaging modalities, especially confocal and light-sheet imaging!</p>

<p>Today is a very big day for Retraction Watch and The Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit. Bear with me while I explain, starting with some history.</p>



<p>When Adam Marcus and I <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2010/08/03/why-write-a-blog-about-retractions/">launched Retraction Watch in 2010</a>, we envisioned it as a journalism blog that would break stories no one else was covering, and examine whether scientific correction mechanisms were robust. And for some time, that’s just what it was. Our traffic and visibility grew quite quickly, but the team didn’t. It was years before we even had an intern.</p>



<p>Things changed in 2014 and 2015. Three philanthropies – the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/15/retraction-watch-growing-thanks-400000-grant-macarthur-foundation/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/03/new-300000-grant-marks-the-fifth-anniversary-of-retraction-watch/">Arnold Foundation</a> (now Arnold Ventures), and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/06/thank-helmsley-charitable-trust-325000-grant-renewal-will-help-us-build-sustainable-future/">Helmsley Trust</a> – approached us with some version of “We think what you’re doing is important. How can we help?”</p>



<span id="more-127849"></span>



<p>Around that time we realized the world lacked a comprehensive database of retractions. We saw how many were missing from sources researchers used, whether PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, or others – including Crossref, more about which I will say in a moment. We were cataloging them in spreadsheets ourselves, but couldn’t keep up.</p>



<p>The three foundations all agreed to support our work, not just the journalism, but to create what became The Retraction Watch Database, officially <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty">launched in 2018</a>. Part of that funding was a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/03/helmsley-trust-helps-retraction-watch-chart-its-future-with-new-130000-grant/">grant to create a strategic plan for sustainability and growth</a>. One of the pillars of that plan was licensing the Database to organizations – commercial and nonprofit – who could use it in products that would help researchers know when what they were reading had been retracted, among other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those license fees – along with other income, particularly individual donations and a subcontract from a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) – have kept Retraction Watch and The Center for Scientific Integrity running for several years. We are deeply grateful for the support and show of confidence they represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we also always wanted to make the Database available to as many people as possible, whether or not they had access to tools that licensed it, if we could find a financial model that did not rely on such fees. (We always provided the data free of charge to scholars studying retractions and related phenomena.)</p>



<p><strong>Fast forward to today. We’re thrilled to announce that <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9">Crossref has acquired The Retraction Watch Database</a> and will make it completely open and freely available. </strong></p>



<p>For those of you unfamiliar, here’s how <a href="http://crossref.org">Crossref</a> describes itself: “Crossref makes research objects easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse. We’re a not-for-profit membership organization that exists to make scholarly communications better.” They are indeed the ideal home for the Database, and the perfect collaborator: A nonprofit organization that shares our mission and has a highly successful track record of building tools and resources that make research more efficient.</p>



<p><strong>But there’s more.</strong> As part of our agreement with them, and to recognize the clear value of what Retraction Watch has created, Crossref has paid us an acquisition fee that is roughly equivalent to half of our annual budget. They will also pay us an annual fee, initially for five years, to continue to maintain and update the database. That fee covers the salary of our research director, Alison Abritis, as well as a new deputy for Alison who starts next week.</p>



<p>That means we have achieved sustainability – the highest priority goal for any nonprofit – for the database side of our operation. And the acquisition fee provides important unrestricted reserves that allow for breathing room and the potential for growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which brings me back to the journalism side of the house. Retraction Watch has, with the exception of about a year of its 13-year-existence, been a volunteer activity for me and Adam. It will remain that way. But our new and consistent funding stream means that I will be able to devote a lot of the time that I spent working on the Database – including negotiating data use agreements – on growing Retraction Watch itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">generous grant from the WoodNext Foundation</a>, we now have two reporter-editors on staff. We know there are far more stories than two people – plus me and Adam as part-time high-level editors and directors – can tell. For a brief&nbsp; period of time while all of our grants were in place, we had as many as five salaried journalists. I’d love to get back to that level of staffing, and will be working on fundraising and bringing in more revenue in the coming months and years. If that moves you to support us now, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/support-retraction-watch/">please do</a>.</p>



<p>Thank you to Crossref, to those who have licensed our data, and to everyone who has supported us financially and otherwise over the past 13 years. We’re here for the long haul, and we’re grateful that you’ll be with us too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emma-rotor-filipino-math-teacher-wwii-weapons-fuse">Filipino math teacher Emma Rotor helped develop crucial WWII weapons tech</a></h4>

              
                <p>As an amateur historian studying Philippine-American history in Washington, D.C., I’ve long been familiar with the story of Arturo Rotor and Emma Unson Rotor.</p>



<p>The couple moved from the Philippines to Baltimore in 1941 for graduate studies, but World War II disrupted their plans. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese invaded the Philippines, occupying it for three years. The Philippine Commonwealth Government (the Philippines had not yet gained independence from the United States) escaped to Washington in May 1942; Arturo joined the government in exile soon after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Arturo, who became secretary to the Philippine president and secretary to the Commonwealth cabinet, was something of a Renaissance man. He was an accomplished medical doctor and professor, a prize-winning writer, a classically trained pianist and an orchid enthusiast. Both Rotor syndrome and an orchid variety (<em>Vanda merrillii var. rotorii</em>) are named for him. He was a man “surrounded by myth,” cultural historians Edilberto Alegre and Doreen Fernandez wrote in 1984.</p>



<p>In contrast, his wife Emma was seen as a supportive, background presence. “Emma Unson Rotor sat quietly by [then] made an occasional comment, illustrating the supportive, companionable intelligence with which she had seen master short story craftsman Dr. Arturo Rotor through his long and shining career,” Fernandez wrote in an article describing an oral history project focused on Filipino writers. In the postwar period, Arturo and Emma lived back in the Philippines. Arturo remained a public figure, active in medical and literary circles, while Emma taught math at Assumption College, a private school in Makati.</p>

<p>But Emma Rotor was not only a devoted wife and math teacher. While living in the United States, she conducted groundbreaking weapons research.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the fuze changed warfare</h4>



<p>In late 2021, I read an article by Ma. Isabel Ongpin published in the <em>Manila Times</em> claiming that <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/15/opinion/columns/dr-arturo-b-rotor-and-emma-unson-rotor-filipino-lives-worth-remembering/1818446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Rotor was involved in weapons research</a> during the war. I was astonished. “Mrs. Rotor was a teacher of higher mathematics, a subject I stayed away from, knowing my non-quantitative mind,” Ongpin wrote. “But I had her in geography, and she was great. Mrs. Rotor as a mathematician had worked in the Manhattan Project, the secret project that produced the atomic bomb.” I reached out immediately to Ongpin to ask for any reference material she might have that documented Emma Rotor’s time with the Manhattan Project. She replied that it was simply known by everyone who studied at Assumption College, where Emma taught until the 1980s.</p>



<p>After searching through archival material for several months, I found no evidence that Emma was involved in the Manhattan Project. But Emma was indeed part of another weapons research program, arguably just as consequential. She became a key member of a government division that developed an early version of the proximity fuze, the mechanism that makes a shell or bomb detonate when it gets close to its target rather than on impact.</p>



<p>Before the proximity fuze, bombs were known to be inefficient, detonating prematurely and away from their intended targets. An often mentioned and telling statistic is that it took 20,000 shells to take down one aircraft during the London Blitz. First used in June 1943 to bring down a Japanese aircraft, the proximity fuze, which relied on radar technology, was used in major battles in Europe and Asia. In June 1944, the fuze enabled the British to take down nearly 80 percent of German V-1 “buzz bombs.”&nbsp; The fuze was, according to the War Department, “one of the outstanding scientific developments of World War II” and “second only to the atomic bomb.”</p>



<p>First headed by the British in the 1930s, proximity fuze research was later largely led by the U.S. government. The National Research Defense Committee assigned the task of developing fuzes “for non-rotating (e.g., fin-stabilized) munitions such as bombs, rockets and mortar shells,” to the Ordnance Development Division at the National Bureau of Standards, or NBS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The work on rotating projectiles was assigned to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution and to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emma Rotor worked on the fuze</h4>



<p>Emma Rotor first came to the United States in October 1941, at the age of 28, a few months after Arturo moved to Baltimore to begin his studies of allergies and medical history at John Hopkins. She had planned to study physics there while on leave from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, where she was a mathematics instructor. The war interrupted those plans. She was undeterred, however, and worked briefly as stenographer at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore.</p>





<p>“Oh I was not discouraged,” she said in 1942 in an interview with the Baltimore <em>Evening Sun</em>. “Did I not see in the papers long columns of advertisements — girls wanted, no experience, good salaries? Well, I can work, can’t I?” Though cut off from their families, “we had to learn not to worry, not to think about the things we could not change,” she said. As Emma talked, the article said, “[h]er face is rich with smiles that soften the features and round out the contours.” She is telling a story that is not happy, it continued, “except in that she makes it so.”</p>



<p>In January 1944, Arturo having already joined the Philippine government in exile, Emma joined the Ordnance Development Division, led by radio engineer pioneer Harry Diamond, at NBS, now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Hired as a physicist in a “war time appointment,” she was tasked with supporting “experimental investigations connected with the development of new ordnance devices,” including the “design, construction and testing of mechanical, electrical and radio devices,” according to her appointment letter, which I tracked down with the help of independent researcher Emma Prince, based in St. Louis.</p>



<p>Keith Martin, a librarian at NIST, who I exchanged email messages with, estimates a total of 155 staff members in the division at the time, including those not involved in proximity fuze research, and about 31 in Emma’s section.</p>



<p>She was promoted in less than a year. And in March 1945, her supervisor, physicist William B. McLean, gave her an “excellent” performance rating. “Regardless of grade, Mrs. Rotor is one of the most valuable individuals in the present project,” McLean wrote.</p>



<p>During her time with NBS, which ended in 1947, Emma wrote several scientific papers or coauthored them with colleagues, including Albert G. Hoyem, a physics professor at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who later became a senior official of the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake in California. Her work on “Air travel required for release of arming cover” and on “Measurement of dynamic propeller unbalance” are cited in the 1946 summary report of the Ordnance Development Division’s work on the proximity fuze, titled “<a href="https://archive.org/details/radioproximityfu01elle/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio Proximity Fuzes for Fin-Stabilized Missiles</a>.”</p>



<p>“Evaluation of the toss technique” (which she authored with Hoyem) reports the results of tests to map out trajectories of bombs. The paper appears in a collected volume of scientific articles on “<a href="https://archive.org/details/bombrockettorped00unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb, Rocket, and Torpedo Tossing</a>” published in 1946 that also credits Emma “not only for the contributions mentioned above but also for her diligent supervision of the review and assembly of the final manuscript.” She appears to be the only woman among the authors.</p>



<p>NIST’s museum features a proximity fuze and a fin-stabilized missile that, as Martin wrote via email, “she, and others, had a hand in developing.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emma Rotor’s legacy</h4>



<p>Arturo died in 1988 and Emma in 1998. Arturo and Emma never had children of their own, but a niece, Delia Unson, and a grandniece, Ria Unson, remember Emma fondly. “Tita Emma was an amazing teacher,” Delia Unson, a retired clinical psychologist, recalls. “She could teach anyone and get them to love or at least like math. I met some of her students and found that they loved her!” Emma thought math was easy, Delia Unson says, “because you didn&#8217;t have to remember a lot. As long as one remembered the basic formulas and laws.” </p>



<p>Ria Unson remembers spending many afternoons when she was young at Emma’s house. “She was an accepting, nonjudgmental person,” Ria Unson says. A visual artist, Ria Unson has been keeping alive her memories of Emma through her art.</p>



<p>I asked Ria Unson if she thought Emma would have been comfortable with an article highlighting her role in weapons research. She paused. “I don’t think she looked for the spotlight,” Ria Unson said. “She just did what was asked.”</p>



<p>It is clear, however, that Emma didn’t talk openly with her family about this aspect of her life. A couple of family members did think briefly that she might have been part of the Manhattan Project. “Tita, did you work on the bomb?” Ria Unson recalls her father asking Emma likely at a family gathering decades ago. No, Emma replied, a faint smile. “I worked on the fuze.”</p>



<p>No one understood what she meant then, Delia Unson and Ria Unson said, until I showed them a few months ago her work on the proximity fuze. “That was so like her,” Ria Unson said, thinking of that moment at the family gathering. “She wanted people to know but didn’t want people to know.”</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv users may be experiencing email disruption due to a DDOS attack. Over the past few days, a small number of users issued over a million email change requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These requests originated from over 200 IP addresses – almost all owned by an ISP for a particular province in China. The confirmation emails for this volume of requests overwhelmed our email service. As a result, many arXiv users may not have received their daily emails. And other users may not have received their confirmation emails for registering accounts, or legitimate email change requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are taking measures to mitigate this attack, including temporarily blocking certain IP ranges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, this may mean some legitimate users will be unable to access arXiv until this issue is resolved. We will shortly be reaching out to the abuse desk of the affected ISP for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv operates with a very small development and operations staff. We’re really not equipped to combat DDOS attacks and must rely on the goodwill of the world community in order to continue offering our services.</span></p>
<p>We apologize to any arXiv users that have been affected by this disruption.</p>
<p>We will continue monitoring the situation and update the community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/highest-elevation-mammal-mouse-rodent">The world’s highest-dwelling mammal isn’t the only rodent at extreme elevation</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a series of expeditions along the spine of the Andes Mountains, a team of high-climbing researchers has found mammalian life scampering through some of Earth’s harshest environments.</p>



<p>From 2020 to 2022, evolutionary biologist Jay Storz and colleagues trekked to the peaks of 21 volcanoes in South America. They’ve seen plumes of gas billowing from rocky vents, endured ferocious winds and subfreezing temperatures, and spent nights camping nearly 6,000 meters above the sea. “It&#8217;s really hard to exaggerate how inhospitable these super high elevation environments are,” says Storz, of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>





<p>The austere landscapes look like something you might see on Mars, he says — not the kind of places you’d expect to see wildlife. But for some mammals, such extreme locales are home. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.22.554215v1?ct=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple species of rodents live at or near the high-altitude peaks of Andean volcanoes</a>, well above where alpine herbs, dwarf shrubs and other plants can grow, Storz and his colleagues report in a paper posted August 23 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Finding mammalian life above the vegetation line is “pretty unique and incredible, because what do they eat?” asks Jonathan Velotta, a biologist at the University of Denver who studies how animals adapt to extreme environments. He thinks Storz’s new work could change how scientists think about where life exists. It “suggests that animals live higher than we thought was possible,” Velotta says.</p>



<p>Storz and his colleagues are no strangers to altitudinous adventures. Three years ago, the researchers reported the world-record holder for highest-dwelling mammal. They found the animal, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-american-mouse-world-highest-dwelling-mammal">a yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse</a>, on the summit of Volcán Llullaillaco at an altitude of 6,739 meters, more than three quarters the height of Mount Everest <em>(SN: 7/29/20)</em>.</p>



<p>But the scientists wondered if finding that mouse meant more mammals actually lived at extreme elevations — or if spotting it was just a fluke. The team embarked on a series of elevational surveys — the broadest ever conducted — over a wider geographic area, catching small mammals from the coastline of northern Chile to the crest of the Andean mountain chain. Researchers have performed other surveys at different high-altitude sites, Velotta says, but the areas Storz’s team explored are higher, more remote and require more specialized training and equipment. “It takes mountaineering expertise to do what they do,” Velotta says.</p>



<p>Trips can last three weeks or more, and Storz’s team packs everything they’ll need in a couple of pickup trucks. Their destinations are so remote, there’s typically no opportunity to resupply. They’ll bring food, fuel, water, ice axes, crampons, climbing rope and hundreds of live traps. The team will start catching mice at low altitudes, then work their way up, acclimatizing to higher elevations along the way. Eventually, the researchers will set up base camp at around 5,000 meters above sea level, and sometimes a second camp even higher.</p>

<p>Oxygen levels drop as elevation rises; at base camp and beyond, the researchers may be breathing about half the amount of oxygen they would at sea level. That makes it hard to sleep and hard to do science, says Guillermo D’Elía, an evolutionary biologist at Austral University of Chile. “Everything gets slower,” he says. At sea level, he can set twenty traps in 20 or 30 minutes. At altitude, it takes him about double that time.</p>



<p>Dealing with the lack of oxygen gets easier after a few days, Storz says, but the expeditions’ hardships underscore just how difficult it is to survive in cold, low oxygen conditions. “We’re experiencing the same kind of environmental challenges that our study animals are.”</p>



<p>On his team’s latest trips, the researchers found species of mice that take second through fifth place for highest elevational record for mammals.</p>



<p>Though their work focuses on small mammals, D’Elía says, there’s so much more to explore. He’s seen wandering lizards, insects, subterranean rodents called tuco-tucos and puma tracks near high-altitude hot springs. Rabbitlike viscacha hop along the volcanoes’ rocky slopes, and on one memorable trip, Storz saw a pack South American ostriches rush by. “They look so prehistoric,” Storz says, like velociraptors. Add in the volcanic vistas and you’ve got something straight out of <em>The Land Before Time</em>, he says.</p>





<p>The team’s expeditions have given him a new appreciation for the capacity of animals to survive in unimaginably harsh conditions. “Even in these hostile environments,” Storz says, “life finds a way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-atmosphere-meteor-lightning-space">Flashes in Venus’ atmosphere might be meteors, not lightning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Occasional flashes light up Venus’ shroud of clouds. Previous analyses have hinted that the bursts of light could be lightning in the hellish world’s atmosphere. But a new study suggests most of the flashes may be nothing more than the brief yet brilliant blazes of meteors.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">upcoming missions planned for Venus</a>, scientists are eager to figure out the light’s origin (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). If the flashes are lightning, the electrical phenomenon could pose risks to future probes dropping through the Venusian atmosphere or carried by balloons for extended periods in the planet’s clouds, says Claire Blaske, a planetary scientist now at Stanford University. Small meteors that burn up in the atmosphere, however, wouldn’t pose much of a danger.</p>





<p>Previous landers on Venus have often detected electromagnetic static similar to the type picked up on AM radio and caused by lightning during thunderstorms on Earth, Blaske says. And orbiters and Earth-based telescopes have discerned brief, bright flashes in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But the static and optical flashes have never been detected simultaneously, Blaske says. And, notes Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study, “it’s not clear there is the potential for lightning on Venus” given how little is known about the dynamics of its atmosphere.</p>



<p>Blaske, then at Arizona State University in Tempe, and her colleagues wondered whether meteors could be masquerading as lightning on Venus. Two surveys counted the flashes of light: one by a telescope on Arizona’s Mount Bigelow and one by instruments aboard Japan’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japanese-spacecraft-reaches-venus-five-years-late">Akatsuki orbiter</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/15</em>).</p>



<p>Given that data, there are probably <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JE007914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 10,000 and 100,000 of these flashes each year</a>, the researchers report in the September <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em><em>: </em><em>Planets.</em></p>



<p>That may seem like too many flashes to all be caused by meteors. After all, Venus is a slightly smaller cosmic target than Earth. But meteors there will be substantially brighter — and thus more noticeable — because they are traveling faster on average: The space rocks zip through Venus’ atmosphere at about 25 kilometers per second, compared with 20.3 kilometers per second for meteoroids entering Earth’s atmosphere. In part, that’s because Venus is traveling around the sun faster than Earth is.</p>



<p>Overall, these factors and others led Blaske and her colleagues to conclude that meteors could be numerous enough to account for most, if not all, of the flashes expected to occur in Venus’ atmosphere.</p>



<p>The team’s analysis “is convincing and does a nice job of establishing a plausible explanation for these flashes,” Byrne says. Future observations that simultaneously measure the flashes and electromagnetic static on Venus could help resolve the mystery. But other big questions remain. For example, it’s unknown whether Venus might experience a form of lightning, or other type of electrical discharge, in its carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere that isn’t accompanied by flashes of light but could still pose a risk to probes.</p>

For one it does not adequately convey the relation between culture and biology. It is time we admit the insufficiency of the positivist project; we should not tie our hopes of explanation too tightly to the experimental paradigms we develop to operationalize prevalent metaphors of mind (Koch, 1999; Danziger, 2008). </p><p>Joseph Henrich’s reflections on the cultural context of empirical research further suggest that the majority of our findings reflect a very small WEIRD sample of the human population. Lack of context obscures the significance and meaning of research results. Empirical psychology ought to foreground historical and cultural context so that in addition to deriving descriptive principles of mechanism, psychologists can discursively approach the phenomena as part of our broader cultural projects. </p><p>Drawing from historical and anthropological forms of analysis will allow psychology to better encapsulate how the mind emerges from and reflects back onto its particular cultural context. </p><h2>History and context can expand empirical psychology</h2><p>An interdisciplinary psychology must posit explanation at multiple levels, from description of the mechanics of receptor function to the discursive space of identity. Mixing these distinct layers of explanation would allow the mind sciences to express the phenomenological reality of the contextual setting of individual minds. <em>Anthropology</em> is designed to secure such stories and will help us describe what epistemic use psychology fulfills in a given locale. For example, psychology is used in the West to assess pathology and provide therapeutic interventions for mental suffering. </p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;It is time we admit the insufficiency of the positivist project.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>If tradition is the self-encounter of the human mind, horizon is the vantage point of knowing the relative significance of a finite position.&nbsp;<em>History</em>&nbsp;then allows for a broader understanding of the reflexive links between knowledge and practice. As Gadamer (2004) surmised, we understand the&nbsp;<em>horizon</em>&nbsp;of the questions we ask by regaining concepts from the past in a way that includes our own comprehension of them. Deployment of psychology in concordance with an historical anthropology enriches our understanding of the symbolic sphere we inhabit. According to Roger Smith (2019: 17), “Historical knowledge contributes narrative, and the understanding of narrative is fundamental to the notion of being human; human self-knowledge and action are mutually constitutive, or, belief changes a person and what a person does changes belief.”&nbsp;</p><p>We also know from history that many causes are best characterized as chaotic or through complexity theory due uncertainty, the interdependency of variables, and the contingent nature of agency (Gaddis, 2002). The historical method of developing narratives seems to be crucial to our imaginative appraisals of truth and knowledge and should be considered in its own regard as a shaping influence upon the nature of belief and explanation in psychology. Observation, imaginative sense-making, and perspective-taking are themselves sources of knowledge rather than artifacts in the scientific process (Osbeck, 2019).</p><p>Models should allow for variability, design limitations, and failure rates. Heuristics should be understood as pragmatic applications that we substitute for deductive knowledge (Wimsatt, 1976). Our theories should be so robust and valid that failure of replication does not threaten the foundation of the field. To counteract these crises, psychologists can develop familiarity with levels of analysis above and below the brain and the person. In this way, we can develop generative models which are open to inter-field integration.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Making psychology a more reflexive human science would bestow a sense of scope and context.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>It is time empirical psychology adds historical and anthropological methodology so that in addition to descriptive principles of mechanism and verificationism a new generation of psychologists will approach the mind with a view to more discursive, contextualized, and empathetic explanation. Some community psychology is already moving in this direction, but we also need laboratory and theoretical research to adopt this approach. Making psychology a more reflexive human science would bestow a sense of scope and context and allow for more effective communication with humanists and natural scientists.&nbsp;</p><p>Exciting frontier work that integrates types of explanation are being undertaken in the study of affect, pain management, and the gut-brain axis. Such work expands and investigates the embeddedness and multilevel integration of mind and body. Focusing on such phenomena has the potential to unify subjective/mental and objective/material aspects of mind because it concerns the precise relations between bodily mechanisms and enculturated conscious experience. Using anthropology, we can see healing as the pragmatic goal of such work in the historical context of a shift from dualism to monism. Through a more thorough understanding of our mythological frames, we can better understand the motivations of the unique form of shared understanding that is psychological explanation.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/793053287/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/793053287/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f08%2fGabriel-OUPBlog-Image-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/rising-seas-eroding-beaches-and-fewer-fish-in-africa/">Rising seas, eroding beaches, and fewer fish in Africa</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/antonina-a-sixth-century-military-wife/">Antonina: a sixth-century military wife</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/the-turn-to-domestic-accountability-in-the-shadow-of-international-criminal-tribunals/">The turn to domestic accountability in the shadow of international criminal tribunals</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324005896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossings</a><br><em>Ben Goldfarb<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Nearly 65 million kilometers of roadway crisscross the Earth — enough to encircle the planet more than 1,600 times — and that number will likely double by 2050. These roads have intruded into even the most remote corners of the world, and that has come at a cost: Vehicles are responsible for a staggering number of animal deaths. For instance, 1 million vertebrates are thought to die daily in collisions in the United States alone. Roads also kill indirectly, in part by fracturing migration routes and degrading pristine habitat.</p>





<p>In <em>Crossings</em>, journalist Ben Goldfarb delves into the burgeoning field of road ecology and introduces the impassioned, sometimes eccentric scientists who invite us to perceive our roads as animals do to better understand the ecological impacts. Goldfarb journeys alongside these researchers as they bike through Montana and wrestle anteaters in Brazil, squint at roadkill and rhapsodize about the design quirks that engineers can leverage to attract animals to safe overpasses and culverts. Road ecology, many of its proponents say, is a win-win: Building dedicated wildlife crossings, for example, is relatively cheap compared with other infrastructure projects, and minimizing collisions between drivers and animals preserves lives and lowers insurance premiums.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Goldfarb about roads and how to minimize their harm. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How did you get interested in road ecology? It seems very different from your <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/got-environmental-problem-beavers-could-be-solution">previous book on beavers</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb: </strong>The origins of this book date back to 2013, when I was on a reporting trip about habitat connectivity. I caught wind of wildlife crossings on Highway 93 in northern Montana, and I ended up taking a tour of them with Marcel Huijser, a wonderful road ecologist at the Western Transportation Institute in Montana.</p>



<p>The most powerful moment of that tour was when we moved to the one big wildlife overpass on Highway 93. The sun was going down on this beautiful October evening, and it was just incredibly inspiring to be on top of this piece of infrastructure that humans had built for wild animals. We do so much on this planet to make animals’ lives more difficult, and as a conservation journalist, it felt like a form of ecological empathy manifested as a science.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You dedicate a lot of the book to small animals like reptiles, amphibians, insects and fish. Is that where the science led you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> It’s where the field of road ecology is going in a lot of ways. A lot of the early history is focused on deer because that’s what safety-oriented engineers worry about. But as the field has evolved [to become more focused on conservation than human safety], it’s gotten more concerned with less charismatic, less dangerous organisms. They are important to think of because in some ways they’re the taxa most harmed by roads.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How has this book changed your perceptions of roads?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> One of the biggest takeaways is just how deleterious road noise pollution is. When you read the literature about the health effects and the ecological effects of road noise, you realize that it’s truly one of the great unsung public health crises of our time. It’s elevating our cortisol levels, raising our blood pressure, and making us more susceptible to cardiac disease and stroke.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>You make a lot of comparisons between roads and climate change and the actions that are needed to address them.</strong></p>





<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> The climate movement has evolved a lot over the last decade away from individual blaming and towards indicting larger corporate power structures. The same holds true in the world of road ecology. Most of us have had the experience of hitting wild animals. I’ve killed animals, unfortunately, and I always feel incredibly guilty about it and complicit in this car culture. But car culture is the product of this very intensive marketing campaign that the whole automotive industrial complex has waged.</p>



<p>Instead of blaming drivers for roadkill, the real answers are these larger systemic solutions. Maybe that’s modifying infrastructure to build more wildlife crossings to make highways permeable; maybe it means improved mass transit systems.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>You end the book talking about how roads have been leveraged as a tool of oppression against Black and brown communities. Why was it important to include that aspect?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> The parallels between the ways that roads impact ecological communities and the ways they impact human communities are striking. Highways are forces of division in both ecosystems and cities, and we humans fall victim to cars, just as wild animals do. But I also wanted to recognize that we’re not all harmed equally — roads, especially urban freeways, have been very deliberately weaponized against communities of color throughout the last century. And that’s still happening today.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You quote an early U.S. Forest Service employee as saying “roads are such final and irretrievable facts,” yet the book argues that roads can be made into “visitors” in a landscape.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> We have the capacity to change them. The Forest Service, one of the world’s largest road managers, is decommissioning thousands of roads, recognizing that they still have harmful ecological effects. On the other end of the spectrum, you have places like Syracuse, where an urban freeway was punched through the middle of the city, deliberately wiping out a Black neighborhood. This old viaduct will be torn down in recognition of the disproportionate harms that it inflicted on people of color.</p>



<p>It’s remarkable to think that everything from tiny dirt roads to this enormous urban freeway are being unmade. Our roads aren’t necessarily fatal, permanent mistakes after all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cake-cutting-math-problem-fairness-envy">Here’s why mathematicians are so interested in cake cutting</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ariel Procaccia has thought a lot about how to cut cake over the last 15 years. That’s partly because the Harvard computer scientist has three children who among them have celebrated more than two dozen birthdays. He knows what it’s like to stand with a knife before a layered masterpiece, frosted with buttercream and chocolate curls, while pressed on all sides by small partygoers who instinctively recognize when someone else gets a better slice.</p>



<p>But it’s also because much of Procaccia’s work focuses on exploring the mathematical rules for dividing stuff up. One way to do that is to think abstractly about dessert. For more than 75 years, he and other researchers trying to formalize fairness have been asking the deceptively simple question: What methods for cutting a cake guarantee that everyone who shows up to the party is happy with what they get?</p>





<p>The answers reach far beyond birthday parties. Cake-cutting contemplation is part of a sprawling mathematical subfield focused on the fair division of resources. It has spurred a raft of algorithms informing how to allocate food among hungry communities, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029890.1999.12005142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to split rent</a> or chores among roommates, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematician-answers-supreme-court-plea">how to draw boundaries for fair voting districts</a> and more. A mathematical problem at its heart, cake cutting connects rigorous reasoning to questions of human preferences and real-world issues, and so attracts not only mathematicians, but also computer scientists, economists, social scientists and legal experts. Questions of fairness (and unfairness) are decidedly universal. Of course, so is dessert. “It’s this very elegant model in which you can really distill what fairness is, and reason about it,” Procaccia says.</p>



<p>The cake, says Steven Brams, a game theorist and political scientist at New York University, is a metaphor for any divisible good, like land or time or limited resources. When cake-cutting insights are applied to settling international disputes, he says, “we are potentially helping the world find solutions.”</p>



<p>Experts have come up with cake-cutting algorithms — the mathematical rules for describing how to cut a cake fairly — many times and in many guises. (The approaches almost always focus on rectangular cakes. The related but more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cutting-pie-no-piece-cake">“pie-cutting” problem</a> addresses circular desserts or pizza.) The easiest rules reveal how to fairly share a cake between two people: One person cuts the cake into two pieces that they believe to be equal in value, and the other person picks first. Each eater receives a piece that they feel is at least as valuable as the other’s, if not better. Reports of this fair division strategy date back to ancient Greece.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>You can argue that fairness, or the lack thereof, is one of the most important problems in the world today.</p><cite>Steven Brams</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In the 1940s, mathematicians began taking serious interest in a mathematical approach to fairness, using cake cutting as an access point. They started exploring how to fairly share among three people, since I-cut-you-choose is a two-player game. That led to looking for ways to extend those algorithms to arbitrarily large numbers of people, and to asking more nuanced questions, like what is fairness exactly, and how do you prove it?</p>



<p>Cake cutting is easy to formulate and easy to relate to, says game theorist Bettina Klaus of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, who studies fairness in real-world situations like school choice allocation and equal access to housing. “But at the same time, the problem is mathematically interesting and challenging because of its complexity once the number of agents to share the cake grows.”</p>



<p>Recent years have brought progress in identifying the fewest number of cuts needed for a given number of people, as well as the maximum number of cuts, which can get ridiculously high but at least shows that cake cutting is finite. And new variations on the question keep emerging. What if you <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divide a cake for multiple groups of people</a> instead of individuals? Or, as explored in a paper published last year, what if cake eaters <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490486.3538321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lie about their preferences</a>? And what if you’re divvying up something that comes in discrete, indivisible pieces, like unopened Halloween candies, instead? By focusing on precise definitions and new scenarios, mathematicians have found new applications and kept cake cutting at the forefront of investigations into fairness.</p>



<p>“You can argue that fairness, or the lack thereof, is one of the most important problems in the world today,” says Brams, who over four decades has published hundreds of works on cake cutting or fairness more generally. “And we’re looking at the theoretical foundations of fairness.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recipes for fair cake cutting</h4>



<p>Documented experiments in finding fair ways to split stuff up go way back, at least to Hesiod’s poem <em>Theogony</em>, written some 2,700 years ago. In one story in the poem, gods and mortals clashed in Mecone, a mythical Greek city. As a sacrifice to appease the gods, Prometheus, who was both a god and humankind’s greatest benefactor, divided a recently slaughtered ox into two piles, one containing unappealing bare bones covered with a layer of fat and the other containing the desirable meat concealed beneath an unappealing section of stomach. Prometheus invited Zeus to take his pick. Zeus, seduced by the shiny fat, chose the unappetizing bones.</p>





<p>In this ancient story, Prometheus infuses the classic I-cut-you-choose strategy — the simplest version of cake cutting — with deception. But when I-cut-you-choose is executed in pursuit of fairness, it should guarantee the satisfaction of everyone involved.</p>



<p>The outcome is proportional, meaning that each player feels like their slice represents a fair share of the total. So for two players, a player would value their own slice at 1/2; for three, a fair share would be 1/3. (And for some arbitrary n number of cake eaters, a fair share would be 1/n.) If the cake is the same throughout, proportionality is equivalent to all the slices being the same size.</p>

<p>You probably already know how to fairly share cake between two people. It’s the simplest approach to fairly cutting cake and is often called the “divider-chooser” method.</p>

<p>But cake cutting isn’t an interesting mathematical problem if the cake is all the same. Ordinary division and a kitchen scale could readily separate a slab of uniform chocolate sponge into any number of proportional pieces. The problem becomes more complicated if you assume that the cake is heterogeneous — if it’s unevenly frosted, for example, or includes sections of varying flavors and toppings.</p>



<p>A maraschino cherry–lover might choose the smallest slice and feel satisfied if they get the cake’s only cherry. In this case, what mathematicians call the “serendipity of disagreement” gives rise to rich math. The most interesting math arises when there are differing opinions.</p>



<p>A two-person I-cut-you-choose scenario still works here. The divider divides the cake into two pieces of equal value in their view and will be happy with either; the chooser chooses their preferred piece. But increase the number of cake eaters, each with particular preferences, and there’s no easy solution.</p>



<p>Hugo Steinhaus of the University of Warsaw was one of the first mathematicians to dive into this complexity. During World War II, as questions of fair division of land were playing out on a large and violent scale, Steinhaus developed a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified I-cut-you-choose strategy</a> for three players. It came to be called the lone-divider method.</p>



<p>In this approach, one person, let’s call her Alice, cuts the cake into three pieces that she values equally (each at 1/3 of the total). Then a second person, Bob, indicates which of the pieces would be acceptable to him. If he approves at least two pieces, then the third person, Carla, can take any piece she wants, followed by Bob (who has at least one acceptable piece available). Alice gets the one that’s left.</p>



<p>But if either Bob or Carla disapprove of the same piece, then that piece goes to Alice (who valued all pieces equally). The remaining two pieces (which Bob and Carla must value at 2/3 or more of the total) are recombined and shared between Bob and Carla using I-cut-you-choose.</p>



<p>Steinhaus described this algorithm in a short paper published in 1948 in <em>Econometrica</em>. It represented one of the first rigorous investigations in the field of cake cutting. “The rule for the first partner,” Steinhaus wrote, “allows him to cut the object — it may be a cake — as he pleases.”</p>



<p>Steinhaus’ method worked for only three eaters, but in the same paper, he reported that two colleagues had developed an algorithm that could achieve proportionality for any number of cake eaters. The method is known as the last-diminisher method, and it goes like this: One person cuts off a piece of cake they deem to represent a fair share and passes that piece along to the next person. Each remaining player has a chance to either trim the cake (if they think it represents more than a proportional share) or pass (if they think it’s proportionally fair or less than fair). Once everyone has had a chance to trim, or “diminish” the slice, the last person who trimmed gets the piece and exits the game.</p>



<p>The trim is then recombined with the remaining cake, and the process begins again with the remaining players. When only two players are left, they use I-cut-you-choose.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How the “last-diminisher” method works</h3>



<p>Sharing cake among three people is harder. In the “last-diminisher” method, three people — Alice, Bob and Carla — each believe they are getting a piece that they value at 1/3 of the total. Mathematicians call that “proportionality,” but whoever exits the game first could still be envious of someone else’s piece.</p>

<p>Brams has called the last-diminisher method an elegant solution, and it guarantees that everyone judges their own piece to be at least as valuable as a fair share. But it’s not perfect because it doesn’t take envy into account. In both the lone-divider and last-diminisher approaches, a person who exits the game early may end up coveting a piece that is cut later in the game — even though they thought their piece was proportional. These algorithms are not what mathematicians call “envy-free,” which is another way to think about fairness.</p>



<p>There is another practical limitation to the last-diminisher method: With enough players, the cake that remains in later rounds might end up broken apart by a lot of slicing — or even reduced to crumbs. It’s easy to see how a partygoer might not value that as highly as a whole piece.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can cake cutting be free of envy?</h4>



<p>Since the debut of the last-diminisher method, cake cutting has fueled a small but mighty body of serious mathematics.</p>



<p>The 1960s brought a major step forward when mathematicians John Conway and John Selfridge, independently of each other, came up with a new cutting algorithm for three people. Unlike the work by Steinhaus and colleagues, the new recipe achieved both perceived proportionality and avoided any envy among the recipients.</p>



<p>An envy-free solution, in which no one covets another person’s piece, is easy to achieve, points out computer scientist Haris Aziz of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Just throw the entire cake away. “If you don’t give anything to anybody, that’s envy-free,” he says.</p>



<p>But if the cake lands in the rubbish bin, no one is happy. In Conway’s and Selfridge’s more pleasing scheme, Alice first divides the cake into three pieces she believes are of equal value. Then, Bob can trim one piece — at most — to create a two-way tie for the most valuable. (The trimmings are set aside.) Carla is left to choose among the three. Then the order reverses, and if Carla didn’t choose the trimmed piece, Bob takes it. Alice gets the one that remains. The eaters then turn to the trimmings, following a similar iterative protocol of cutting, trimming and choosing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to divide cake with no envy</h3>



<p>In a version of cake cutting for three people, each person — Alice, Bob and Carla — are guaranteed to feel that their piece represents 1/3 the total value of the cake. The method, named for John Selfridge and John Conway, also ensures that none of the cake eaters will be envious of another person’s piece. The Selfridge-Conway procedure has been extended for any number people, but the cutting can last a very long time.</p>

<p>Yet for decades more, an envy-free cake-cutting solution for any arbitrary number of eaters remained elusive. In the late 1980s, on his PBS television show <em>For All Practical Purposes: Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics</em>, mathematician Sol Garfunkel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS73L5YMZ_E&amp;list=PL9n195Q8MdMgGACoKTurcoXhB7xh7rbss&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured the unsolved cake-cutting problem</a> and related questions of fair division.</p>



<p>But the problem wouldn’t go unsolved for much longer. In 1995, Brams at NYU and Alan&nbsp;D. Taylor of Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., devised <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new procedure that cuts cake for four people</a> with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/formulas-fairness">no one envying anyone else</a>. “That was considered a breakthrough of sorts,” Brams says. It built on the “trimming” approach of Conway and Selfridge, running a similar procedure on all possible pairs of cake eaters. Brams and Taylor described how the procedure could be extended to any number of people.</p>



<p>The approach still had limitations. There was no guarantee of how many cuts it might take. “We showed in general that you could require three cuts or 3 million cuts,” Brams says. Or many, many more.</p>



<p>A few years later, mathematicians Jack Robertson and William Webb of Washington State University in Pullman described a useful computation model that could be used to analyze how many steps, including cuts and evaluations, are required by an algorithm. Its calculations confirmed, for example, that no maximum number of cuts could be predicted for any algorithm known at that time that divided cake proportionally and without envy for any arbitrary number of players.</p>



<p>Over the next few decades, many mathematicians came to wonder whether an upper bound for envy-free cake cutting even existed. If not, in theory, cake cutting could go on forever. What’s more, Procaccia says, no one had figured out the minimum, either.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>What mathematicians call the “serendipity of disagreement” gives rise to rich math.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is cake cutting infinite?</h4>



<p>Procaccia never actually set out to study cake cutting. In 2008, he was teaching a course on the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence. One day, walking home after delivering a lecture on resource allocation and the Robertson-Webb model, he realized how he could find a lower bound — a minimum number of steps, including cuts — for envy-free cake cutting for any number of people. The lower bound he found was somewhere around n² steps, where n is the number of cake eaters.</p>



<p>That would lead to his first paper on cake. Procaccia has a knack for giving mathematical papers catchy titles. The lower-bound paper, published in 2009, was titled “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1661445.1661484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thou shalt covet thy neighbor’s cake</a>.” In 2010, he coauthored one called “<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/aaai10/02/AAAI10-137.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth, justice, and cake cutting</a>,” which introduced the question of truthfulness — in addition to guaranteeing proportionality and removing envy. If a person hides their preferences during the cutting, someone may end up with an unequal share. It’s “mathematically fascinating,” Procaccia says.</p>



<p>As Procaccia continued in the field, he began thinking more about useful algorithms that could put insights from cake cutting — and the theory of fair division in general — to good use. One example: dividing rent.</p>



<p>The easiest way, of course, is to divide the total due by the number of inhabitants. But that ignores the “serendipity of disagreement.” One person might want a window, another might prefer the bigger closet. In 2014, Procaccia and colleagues designed a web-based tool called Spliddit that collected users’ preferences and produced mathematically fair ways to divide anything, from rent among roommates to possessions among divorcees.</p>



<p>The biggest recent breakthrough in cake cutting, Procaccia says, came from Aziz and computer scientist Simon Mackenzie, based in Sydney, who determined an upper bound on envy-free, proportional cake cutting. First, in 2015, the pair tackled the problem of how to share cake among four people. By borrowing ideas from Conway and Selfridge and from Brams and Taylor, the team devised an algorithm that produced an upper bound of 203&nbsp;steps, which could include almost as many cuts. That’s a lot but not too unreasonable.</p>



<p>A year later, the team extended the approach to an arbitrary number of people, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7782956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting an algorithm with a finite number of cuts</a> for envy-free, proportional cake cutting. It was a potentially astronomical number of cuts, but it was finite — answering a long-standing question in the field.</p>



<p>Cake cutting for n people, Aziz and Mackenzie reported, could require as many as n^n^n^n^n^n operations. That’s a totally unreasonable number. The maximum number of steps for five people would be around 2 x 10<sup>2,180</sup>. That means five people cutting the cake billions of times per second for 100 trillion years might barely be getting started.</p>



<p>However, Aziz says the algorithm can be adapted to a more reasonable, though still really big upper bound if the partygoers, for example, allow for a little cake to be left over. And it’s still possible that mathematicians could bring that upper bound lower in the future.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The cake-cutting problem endures</h4>



<p>Explorations into the question of how to fairly cut a cake aren’t over. Inspired by Procaccia’s 2010 paper on truthfulness, computer scientist Biaoshuai Tao of Shanghai Jiao Tong University investigated what happens <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07387.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you try to account for dishonest cake eaters</a>. “If everyone knows how the cake is allocated, then I should get more if I tell the truth,” he says.</p>



<p>But in some cases, dishonesty can yield an advantage. If Alice and Bob were to divide a cake, and Alice knew that Bob always preferred chocolate, she might knowingly divide the cake unequally so the smaller piece contained more chocolate. Then Bob would choose according to his preference, and Alice would get the larger piece.</p>



<p>In his work, presented in July 2022 at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Economics and Computation, in Boulder, Colo., Tao found that truthfulness and proportionality are incompatible, making it impossible to construct a cake-cutting algorithm that strictly guarantees truthfulness, proportionality and no envy.</p>



<p>Practical applications for cake cutting also continue to abound. Klaus, in Lausanne, points to school choice as an example.</p>



<p>A district with limited seats in certain schools has to balance the school board priorities — scores on entrance exams or geographic distribution, for example — with the preferences of parents to try to find a proportional solution with a fair value. “In the past, schools were just assigned … without asking people what they want,” Klaus says. “The school choice comes from the fact that the preferences of the parents or the kids would be taken into account.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Over time, cake cutting has evolved into a kind of mathematical sandbox, a constructive playground that brings together abstract proofs and intuitive applications.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And there are plenty of other real-world applications for questions of fair division. Brams has used ideas from cake cutting to study fair voting procedures. (To elect their leaders, at least four scientific societies, including the Mathematical Association of America, adopted an algorithm developed by him.)</p>



<p>Procaccia has applied fair division algorithms to model food allocation. Aziz is exploring applications ranging from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00879.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to divvy up chores</a> or other tasks that can’t be divided to how to best schedule doctors’ shifts in hospitals.</p>



<p>Others are studying fair allocation of goods that can’t be cleanly divided. After a divorce, for instance, former partners might come to agreement on a fair split only if some items are taken out of consideration. These investigations include approaches that are close to envy-free if not mathematically perfect.</p>



<p>Even after decades of investigation, cake cutting isn’t like a simple jigsaw puzzle with a well-defined solution. Instead, over time, it has evolved into a kind of mathematical sandbox, a constructive playground that brings together abstract proofs and intuitive applications. The more researchers explore it, the more there is to explore.</p>



<p>“I’m interested in it now not only because it’s beautiful in math,” Tao says, “but I still believe there’s a lot to be done.”</p>

<p>The publisher Frontiers has retracted nearly 40 papers across multiple journals linked to “the unethical practice of buying or selling authorship on research papers,” according to a <a href="https://blog.frontiersin.org/2023/09/04/frontiers-implements-new-policy-to-counter-authorship-for-sale/">press release</a> posted to a company website Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release also states Frontiers is adopting new policies to prevent the sale of authorships on papers it publishes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230829052027/https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics">old policy</a> simply stated that “Requests to modify the author list after submission should be made to the editorial office using the authorship change form.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, such requests “will only be granted under exceptional circumstances and after in-depth assessment by the Frontiers’ research integrity unit,” according to the release. The publisher will also keep track of the requests “to identify suspicious patterns and trends.”</p>



<span id="more-127841"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics#changes-in-authorship">new policy</a> also states that Frontiers will deny authorship changes requested after acceptance as a rule, and:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1285036/full">notice</a> for the <em>Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology paper</em>, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2021.775309/full">Optimizing sgRNA to improve CRISPR/Cas9 knockout efficiency: special focus on human and animal cell</a>,” states that the authors “do not agree to this retraction.” Neither corresponding author immediately responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shomali reached out to us separately regarding the entry in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">database</a> for his <em>Frontiers in Immunology</em> paper, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.839945/full">Dysregulation of Survivin-Targeting microRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases: New Perspectives for Novel Therapies</a>,” one of three of his articles that the publisher pulled on Monday. (We had mistakenly listed it as a “research paper” rather than a “review article,” which we corrected at his request.)</p>



<p>According to an email the publisher sent the authors in June, which Shomali shared with us, Frontiers had decided to retract the paper after “concerns were brought to our attention from the German Cancer Research Center regarding the authorship of the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The email included a draft retraction notice, which specified that “the German Cancer Research Center contacted the editorial office stating that the author Mostafa Jarahian is not an employee.” Jarahian has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shomali told us he had sent the following objection to the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I, the first author, on behalf of the authors, declare that there has never been any author contribution discrepancies in our article; nor has been posted In mysterious websites, PubPeer, etc, as well as the authorship and the order of the authors was the one that was submitted for the first time and remained unchanged during the whole peer-review process; to ensure, you can check the history of the journal. Besides, the APC of our article was paid by Dr. Marwah Suliman Maashi not DKFZ (as mentioned in acknowledgment section of article); therefore, DKFZ has not the right to complain about our article about affiliation of Mostafa Jarahian. Since the APC has been paid personally and there is no author contribution discrepancies in our article, you can address the possible minor concern by changing the affiliation of Dr. Jarahian to “Former DKFZ employee” and revoke your decision to retract and make a correction. Otherwise, I don’t see any rationale to retract our article; if so please give a reasonable explanation for your decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He further told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Actually, Mostafa Jarahian was working at DKFZ from 2004 until mid-2020 and published articles in prestigious journals such as Nature with DKFZ affiliation (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SBRj4H4AAAAJ&amp;hl=de). He used his affiliation In later articles as he did so without any biased purposes, but DKFZ informed the journal that it should not be. The article mentioned above is part of my PhD thesis; as I explained, there has never been any authorship change during whole review process and the APC was paid be second author not DKFZ, so there is no rationale to retract my article instead the affiliation can be changed to publish a correction. We complained about this matter to DOAJ, OASPA, and Thomson Reuters and looking forward to hearing from them. Since the article is a part of my PhD thesis and our institution monitors the retraction watch database and makes decisions based on it, I would sincerely ask you to please exclude my article from your database as an exceptional subject. My article has been retracted for an author’s affiliation who was working at for nearly 20 years. It is completely unfair to retract an article for such a minor error.</p>

<p>Two cancer researchers who formerly worked at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City published 12 papers with fake data that amounts to research misconduct, according to findings from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found that <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-dannenberg-andrew">Andrew Dannenberg</a> “engaged in research misconduct by recklessly reporting falsified and/or fabricated data” in the papers, and <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-subbaramaiah-kotha">Kotha Subbaramaiah</a> “reused Western blot images from the same source and falsely relabeled them to represent different proteins and/or experimental results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published findings for both scientists include the same extensive list of duplicated images in a dozen papers, all retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127834"></span>



<p>Dannenberg’s <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDannenberg%252c%2bAndrew%2bJ">retraction count</a> reached 20 last June, when <em>Cancer Prevention Research</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/03/former-weill-cornell-cancer-researcher-up-to-20-retractions-investigations-findings-are-with-feds/">retracted nine of his articles</a> at once. Subbaramaiah was a coauthor on all of the papers, and has 18 retractions <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKotha%2bSubbaramaiah">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported last year, Dannenberg and Subbaramaiah retired from Weill Cornell in late 2020 and early 2021. Dannenberg had received approximately $8 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health since 1995; Subbaramaiah received more than $1 million between 2005 and 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our story on the retractions, Dannenberg’s lawyer, Elizabeth McEvoy at the Boston firm Hinkley Allen, sent us this statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Dannenberg did not generate the problematic data nor prepare the figures necessitating retraction of any of the nine articles you reference; those data were prepared by another investigator, who is referenced in two of the Retraction Notices. At the time of publication, Dr. Dannenberg believed those data were valid and reliable and only came to learn more recently of concerns pertaining to those data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McAvoy has not yet responded to our request for comment on ORI’s findings. [See update at the end of this post.] However, the latest action suggests investigators were not satisfied Dannenberg was an innocent bystander in his colleague’s deception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subbaramaiah declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings state that Dannenberg agreed to have his research supervised for seven years – an unusually long term. Subbaramaiah agreed to “exclude himself” from federal contracting or receiving other government funding for the same length of time.</p>



<p>Update, 9/7/23, 2000 UTC: McEvoy sent us this statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fraudulent data in the retracted papers were generated&nbsp;and prepared&nbsp;by a faculty member in Dr. Dannenberg’s former laboratory,&nbsp;not by Dr. Dannenberg.&nbsp; Dr. Dannenberg believed the data produced in each of the implicated papers/grants were accurate and reliable when they were submitted.&nbsp; Dr. Dannenberg would never have published the data had he suspected or known that the data were manipulated or fabricated.&nbsp; Although Dr. Dannenberg believes he was careful and thorough in supervising data generation in his lab, he&nbsp;has reached a settlement with the Office of Research Integrity to allow him to continue&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp;his scientific endeavors in PHS-funded science&nbsp;and avoid the time and burden of further litigation.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grow-human-kidney-pig-embryo">Scientists grow humanized kidneys in pig embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have successfully grown kidneys made of mostly human cells inside pig embryos — taking researchers yet another step down the long road toward generating viable human organs for transplant.</p>



<p>The results, reported September 7 in <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2023.08.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mark the first time</a> a solid humanized organ, one with both human and animal cells, has been grown inside another species.</p>



<p>“This is a considerable progress in human-animal chimerism,” says Tao Tan, a cell biologist at the Kunming University of Science and Technology in China, who helped create the first chimeric <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human-monkey embryo</a> in 2021 but was not involved in the current study.</p>





<p>In the United States alone, more than 100,000 people <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently sit on an organ transplant waiting list</a>. A vast majority of those people need a kidney transplant. To meet this demand for life-saving organ transplants, scientists have been pursuing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-cells-grown-rats-cure-diabetes-mice">new methods to grow organs</a> and tissues in animals (<em>SN: 1/26/17</em>).</p>



<p>Advances in the last few years include <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31752-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing rat organs in mice</a> (and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vice versa</a>) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00693-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanized skeletal muscle</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0373-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endothelial tissue</a> in pigs. But significant hurdles remain, due in part to how challenging it is for human cells to thrive inside a foreign host. Human induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, which function as a sort of “starter kit” for growing many kinds of human tissue, often die when introduced into animals because the species’ cells have different physiological needs.</p>



<p>Stem cell biologist Liangxue Lai, of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China, and his team spent more than five years refining their methods to enhance the human stem cells’ survivability.</p>



<p>While the pig embryos were still just single cells, the team used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to edit out two genes necessary for kidney development. That created a niche in which the human iPSCs, once injected into the space, could develop into kidney cells. The human stem cells were also tweaked to have especially active genes that dampen apoptosis, or cell death, to keep the cells alive long enough to gain a foothold and begin forming the kidney.</p>



<p>More than 1,800 embryos were then transferred into surrogate sows, of which five were harvested for study within the first 28 days. All five had normal kidneys consistent with their level of development, and the organs contained 50 percent to 60 percent human-derived cells. That’s the highest percentage of human cells yet observed in any organ grown inside a pig, Tan says. Given more time, there’s no indication that the kidneys wouldn’t continue to grow and develop normally, possibly with the human cells increasingly edging out the pig cells, the researchers say.</p>

Wang <em>et al</em>/<em>Cell Stem Cell</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The study is “an important and interesting step,” says <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/massimo-mangiola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massimo Mangiola</a>, a transplant immunologist at New York University Langone Health who was not involved in the research. But it’s still many years out from fully functional xenotransplants, he notes.</p>



<p>While the stem cells did differentiate into several cell types, including kidney tubular cells and developmental tissue, the human kidney has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-021-00156-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 70 unique cell types</a> that scientists will need to recapitulate. And until researchers can create an organ that is 100 percent human, it’s likely that such transplants will prompt rejection.</p>



<p>In addition, a few iPSCs erroneously differentiated into neural cells in the brains and spinal cords of the embryos. Mangiola says that the cells appear to be random, unlike the kidney cells, making him think they’re not likely to result in animals with human brains — which would <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26078/chapter/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an ethical quandary</a>.</p>



<p>To avoid such ethical issues, Lai says that moving forward the team will knock out genes that orchestrate the stem cells’ differentiation into neurons — as well as into germline cells, eggs and sperm, which pass genetic information on to offspring. The team is also pursuing growing other human organ precursors in pigs as well, including the heart and pancreas.</p>





<p>“We feel that we have accomplished a milestone in the field, but this is only the first step, and many challenges remain,” Lai says. “We are optimistic that with time and effort we may be able to overcome these challenges too.”</p>

                <p>At PLOS, we are working to extend simple, free, and community-driven preprint options to each of the diverse research communities we serve. We believe that <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">posting preprints</a> empowers authors to take control of their scientific communications, disseminating results sooner and more broadly. At the same time preprinting serves the larger research community, contributing to a more efficient, more robust, and more equitable scientific record.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we made major progress in our efforts to increase access to preprinting when we partnered with <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a> to offer facilitated preprint posting in the fields of earth and planetary science. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">Since January 31st</a>, authors submitting to any of our three earth science-related journals have had the option to forward their manuscript to EarthArXiv with just a few clicks. And they have!</p>



<p>At <em>PLOS Climate</em>, 33% of published authors who submitted after the partnership went into effect chose to post a preprint using the integration. For <em>PLOS Water</em> authors that number is 47%. Six months after the launch of the integration, EarthArXiv preprints associated with PLOS submissions have already received more than 7,100 views and 3,900 downloads on the platform. This success follows in the footsteps of longstanding partnerships with the servers <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">medRxiv</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited to see how preprint posting rates continue to grow in the future. For now, you can learn more about the exciting work coming out of PLOS&rsquo; newest journals, and the preprint integration with EarthArXiv, in our <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/08/interview-with-the-authors-of-daily-stream-temperature-predictions/">interview with <em>PLOS Water</em> authors</a> Jared Siegel, Aimee Fullerton, Alyssa FitzGerald, Damon Holzer, and Chris Jordan on the Latitude blog.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-funga-flora-fauna-conservation-ecosystem">When discussing flora and fauna, don’t forget ‘funga’</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fungi. They grow between toes, on bread and in the shower. But the organisms also produce food and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-treat-depression-mushrooms-psychedelic">medicine </a>and act as ecosystem maids by decomposing dead matter — benefits that are sometimes overlooked (<em>SN: 11/17/20)</em>. That’s why the Fungi Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to fungi education and conservation, advocates for adding “funga” to the popular phrase “flora and fauna.”</p>



<p>The mushrooming movement is also backed by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwdGlnLIiFF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which in August called</a> for the addition of “a third ‘F’ — funga — to address the planetary challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.” More than 20 countries already use the term, including Australia, Iceland and Brazil.</p>





<p>Historically, fungi have been left out of most conservation discussions and plans, says mycologist Giuliana Furci, founder of the Fungi Foundation, which was created in Chile and is now based in the United States. While flora refers to an area’s plant diversity and fauna its animal diversity, fungi don’t fit into either category. “Fungi didn’t have a way in,” Furci says. “It’s about time they get this recognition.”</p>



<p>Whether a soil mold or a mushroom on a log, fungi face the same threats as other kingdoms of life, including habitat loss and climate change. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List includes more than 200 species of fungi that are either threatened or endangered. Fungi also form essential relationships with other organisms, like gut bacteria or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-microbes-climate-young-trees">the roots of plants</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/23)</em>. That means it is paramount that fungi are considered in conservation policies, Furci says. She and two other mycologists <a href="https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/BF03449441#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coined the term funga in 2018</a> in <em>IMA Fungus</em>. Mycota, the ancient Greek word for mushroom, would have been more accurate, but funga seemed catchier, Furci says.</p>



<p>The phrase has the potential to take off widely, says mycologist Catherine Gehring of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Using funga along with flora and fauna will be particularly powerful in nonscientist circles where the phrase could encourage interest in fungi among policymakers and the public, she says.</p>



<p>“[Fungi] are super valuable,” Gehring says. “It’s great to see the movement is gaining traction.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-bird-dinosaur-long-legs-fossil">This newfound birdlike dinosaur had surprisingly long legs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early birdlike dinosaurs are thought to have lived lofty lives up in the trees. But a newly discovered creature had surprisingly long legs that may have made for a life on the run.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06513-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leggy birdlike dino</a> (<em>Fujianvenator prodigiosus</em>) lived about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, researchers report September 6 in <em>Nature</em>. That’s around the same time as its distant cousin <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-had-wings-made-flapping-not-just-gliding"><em>Archaeopteryx</em></a>, one of the earliest known birds (<em>SN: 3/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>“It looks quite similar to <em>Archaeopteryx</em> … except the legs,” says paleontologist Min Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “<em>Fujianvenator</em> has really, really long legs.”</p>





<p>Wang and colleagues identified the creature as one of the earliest known avialans — a group that split off from the rest of dinosaurs and eventually became birds. The first avialans are key characters in the bird origin story. But little is known about them, Wang says, due to the scant diversity of fossils found.</p>

<p>Early avialans discovered so far, including <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, are generally short-limbed, apparently equipped for moving through the trees. Pheasant-sized <em>F. prodigiosus’</em> lower leg bones were twice as long as its thigh bones, a trait not found among the other known birdlike dinosaurs.</p>



<p>Entombed amid mudstones and shales in what is now southeastern China, the creature’s bones were discovered alongside fossils of aquatic and semiaquatic species. Those clues indicate that <em>F. prodigiosus</em> inhabited a swamplike environment. It probably dashed after prey like today’s ostriches or waded through water like a primitive crane, Wang says.</p>



<p>The first avialans weren’t all tree dwellers, he says. “It’s not the full picture.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/environmental-dna-leaf-swab-technique-biodiversity">A new DNA leaf swab technique could revolutionize how we monitor biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just a few swabs from a handful of leaves can say a lot about what animals are roaming in the area.</p>



<p>Two dozen leaf swabs from plants in Uganda’s Kibale National Park revealed <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00813-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a stunningly accurate genetic picture of the park’s vertebrate diversity</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 21 <em>Current Biology</em>. The swabs picked up environmental DNA, or eDNA, shed from 52 animals, 30 of which could be identified to the species level. The quick and easy technique is a potentially revolutionary way to monitor biodiversity.</p>





<p>“The fact that they could just swab a few leaves like that and get that many species is really kind of cool and remarkable,” says Julie Lockwood, a biologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>While we often picture DNA sitting safe and snug inside of cells, the truth is that particles of the genetic material are loose all over the environment. This eDNA often collects in “pools” in bodies of water or on surfaces like tree bark. Finding and analyzing eDNA can reveal what species are in an area — even those that are hard to spot.</p>



<p>Jan Gogarten, a biologist at the University of Greifswald in Germany, wanted to compare his eDNA source — flies that pick up DNA from dead animals and feces — with that of biologist Christina Lynggaard, who collects eDNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">from the air</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>). The two set out to compare their respective techniques in Kibale, but setting up the necessary air filters was time-consuming, so after collecting his flies, Gogarten decided to swab some nearby leaves while he waited.</p>



<p>“It was not something that we had planned before,” says Lynggaard, of the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>All the swabbing in the study, done across three areas of the park, took 72 minutes in total—an average of three minutes per swab. For comparison, Lynggaard ran air filters to collect eDNA for <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01690-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a minimum of 30 minutes</a> each in a prior study, not including time to set up and clean the apparatus. The researchers then brought the swabs back to Denmark for analysis.</p>



<p>The eDNA turned up many charismatic birds and mammals that are known to live in the park, including the great blue turaco (<em>Corythaeola cristata</em>) and the African bush elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana)</em>, but there were a few surprises too.</p>



<p>Colin Chapman, another collaborator on the project and a biologist at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, Canada, “has been working in the forest for 30-something years,” Gogarten says, “and he had bird species on the list that he hadn&#8217;t seen before,” but have been spotted in the park by others. “There’s a lot out there that we just don’t see” that can be revealed with eDNA.</p>



<p>What’s more, the swabs are more convenient to travel with compared with other sampling devices. Lockwood, for example, samples eDNA from plant surfaces <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using paint rollers</a>. With the smaller swabs, she says, “you can just use established forensic techniques to save the swabs and get them out of the field and take them back to the lab.”</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protecting-half-planet-climate-change-save-species">biodiversity declining in many areas around the globe</a>, sampling eDNA using techniques like leaf swabs “allows us a revolutionary step forward in our ability to document those changes and respond to them,” Lockwood says (<em>SN: 9/4/20</em>). “There&#8217;s not one tool for gathering the eDNA and processing everything that works in every case. So the more tools we have, the better off we are.”</p>



<p>Gogarten and Lynggaard hope that others will take their swabbing technique and run with it. Because the method “can be used by nonscientists,” Lynggaard says, “people interested in citizen science could … help researchers fight this biodiversity loss that we&#8217;re having worldwide.” </p>





<p>For example, schoolchildren armed with swabs, Gogarten says, could sample leaves in their backyards and produce a picture of their own area’s biodiversity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-holes-rare-jwst">Active supermassive black holes may be rarer than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fewer supermassive black holes may undergo growth spurts than astronomers had suspected.</p>



<p>Every known large galaxy hosts a gargantuan black hole at its center. Some of those behemoths experience bursts of beefing up, during which time they blaze brightly. But recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned up far fewer of these active black holes than expected</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>If confirmed, the finding raises questions about how some supermassive black holes got to be so big and what, if any, impact they have on the galaxies they inhabit.</p>





<p>Huge black holes, such as the one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-black-hole-active">at the center of the Milky Way</a>, tend to be pretty quiet (<em>SN: 6/28/23</em>). But occasionally, a surge of interstellar detritus rains down upon them — often following a collision with another galaxy — creating what’s called an active galactic nucleus, or AGN. Here, the heart of the host galaxy emits copious amounts of light at all wavelengths as the influx of material swirling around the black hole heats up. An AGN can not only outshine their host galaxies, but they are also the brightest persistent sources of light in the universe.</p>



<p>In 2017, astronomer Allison Kirkpatrick of the University of Kansas in Lawrence and colleagues predicted that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa911d#apjaa911ds3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JWST’s infrared eyes would find lots of these active black holes</a> based on observations from other, less sensitive, space-based infrared telescopes. In the new study, Kirkpatrick and her team turned JWST toward a well-studied strip of sky where, in 2008, the Spitzer Space Telescope had <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/525273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found infrared signatures of active galactic nuclei in nearly a third of the 19 galaxies</a> it studied.</p>



<p>Those galaxies, seen as they were around the peak of cosmic star formation roughly 10 billion years ago, were all relatively bright and massive. JWST is much more sensitive than Spitzer, so it’s capable of spotting fainter, more average-sized galaxies at the same epoch — ones more comparable in size to the Milky Way. And yet, out of the nearly 500 galaxies that JWST spotted, all observed for the first time, just 6 percent appear to contain active galactic nuclei, the team reports.</p>



<p>“We are actually probing a new population” of galaxies, says Tonima Tasnim Ananna, an astronomer at Wayne State University in Detroit, who was not involved with the study. The new data come from the far reaches of the universe, a region now more accessible than ever before thanks to JWST.</p>



<p>The new-to-us galaxies appear to be filled with interstellar dust. So it is possible, Kirkpatrick says, that fast-growing black holes are hiding in these distant dusty galaxies, and researchers just don’t have the technical capabilities to identify them yet.</p>



<p>If there really aren’t as many of these fast-growing black holes as once thought, it would throw astronomers’ understanding of black hole and galaxy formation for a loop. Supermassive black holes can weigh as much as several million — or even several billion — suns. The AGN phase is thought to be an important step for gathering so much mass.</p>



<p>“Maybe all galaxies don’t go through this active phase, [and] their black holes grow pretty slowly,” Kirkpatrick says. This would mean that some supermassive black holes would need to have started out relatively hefty, rather than growing up from comparably tiny objects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And an active black hole doesn’t just grow quickly in isolation. It also affects its host galaxy. “It gets really, really hot” in an AGN, Kirkpatrick says. That can make it harder for the host galaxy to form stars, which need relatively cool gas to get started.</p>



<p>And the radiation pressure around a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole can be powerful enough to launch winds “like a trillion hurricanes just ripping through your galaxy,” Kirkpatrick says. These winds could, in turn, make things too unstable near the galaxy’s center for planets to form that are capable of sustaining life, she says. But if many black holes aren’t going through an AGN phase, they may not be influencing their host galaxies all that much.</p>



<p>Another explanation for the apparent dearth of active black holes in the new JWST data is that many supermassive black holes could grow up through periodic, short bursts of activity. In that case, they would have influenced the galaxy around them — but such bursts would be virtually undetectable.</p>





<p>If the black holes “just flicker on and off for short time periods,” Kirkpatrick says, “you&#8217;re never going to find these things. You&#8217;re never going to be able to understand how the black holes are growing.”</p>



<p>More answers could be coming soon: Kirkpatrick is planning to use JWST again in January to conduct an even larger search. Instead of the nearly 500 galaxies used in this study, she says, “I&#8217;m going to have probably 4,000 galaxies to look at now.”</p>

                <p><strong>Transferable skills make STEM graduates highly employable outside research settings, but how do you identify those that are specific to you? Abi Parsons reflects on the importance of making time for personal development during your PhD. </strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_e7abb3a0b339403e8c5405633fefffad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Photo by Alvaro Reyes on Unsplash." ></figure><p>During the course of your PhD, it is easy to identify which laboratory techniques you’ve learnt. We are explicitly trained on these by more senior scientists and, usually, it’s clear if you have successfully followed a protocol or not. Progress isn't always as clear for ‘transferable’ skills and wider career development. Taking time to identify the transferable skills that you have developed during your studies is something we should all do. As well as helping you to tailor your CV and nail job interviews, this exercise can also serve as a reminder that a PhD is so much more than a training in lab work.</p>

<p>Think about an average day in the lab. You likely arrive with an idea of what needs to be done that day, and how that work fits into the wider project. This is a classic example of effective <strong>project management. </strong>The down-time or incubation periods between experiments are often spent planning out the next steps. Many of us run experiments in tandem, making clever use of those calmer moments to maximise how much we can get done in a day. Being able to view your PhD as a large project with individual experiments making up pieces of the puzzle trains us in good time management and organisation. As we progress, these skills become second nature to us, so it should be unsurprising that PhD students make very good project managers.</p>

<p>A near-universal experience of PhD students is explaining your research to a non-expert audience. This doesn’t have to mean holding events at science festivals or doing school visits, it’s also talking about your work with family and friends who may not have a scientific background. Within my own family, breaking down my research into accessible terms is a skill that naturally developed and, in doing so, massively improved my <strong>communication </strong>skills. This comes in handy when attending conferences, giving me the opportunity to discuss my research with other scientists from a basic to an expert level.  Adapting communication styles depending on the circumstance is a skill that is highly prized outside of a research career.</p>
<p>Many PhD students are also involved in teaching throughout their program, a job in which effective communication is essential. This could be through informal support of undergraduate or placement students undertaking short projects in the lab, or by working part time as practical class demonstrators. Through such roles, PhD students get further experience in communication and <strong>leadership</strong>. Assisting a group of new students through their first laboratory classes is a rewarding, but challenging, experience. Balancing this kind of paid work with our own research is also another example of good time and project management.</p>

<p>Since the start of my PhD I have constantly been <strong>problem solving</strong>. This includes academic challenges, piecing together the science of my project and overcoming logistical obstacles. No doubt at some point during your PhD you’ve had an experiment planned only for an antibody not to work, a piece of equipment to break or some other bout of scientific misfortune to occur. Unfortunately, this is all part of the process. Rather than giving up when faced with these obstacles, PhD students must adapt, plan a slightly different experiment and move the project forward. These conditions can be difficult but allow us to develop some pretty strong resilience in the process.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my PhD so far, it’s clear that my transferable skills are just as important and useful as my scientific training. A PhD really does teach you more than just lab skills, but with so much focus on the science it is easy to overlook our personal development. To identify those applicable to you, walk through a standard day and reflect on all those moments you are not actively doing lab work. What are you doing? Has it become easier with time? If so, that’s a skill you’ve developed through experience. Write them down, list clear examples of using them, and reflect on how you came to develop them. You’ll quickly realise that your scientific skills aren't the only thing you’ve developed in your PhD.</p><hr><p>This article was written by Abi Parsons and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p>Now, after two paper retractions and plagiarism allegations, there’s a haze of suspicion around Dias, and some physicists are worried that outsiders might suspect that the entire field is in disarray. “The big risk is that this whole thing … sheds a negative light on this field,” says theoretical physicist Lilia Boeri.</p>





<p>But other research on high-temperature superconductors is solid, many researchers say. Multiple groups have replicated key results, and theoretical calculations agree with real-world experiments. Physicists are investigating new classes of superconductors and confirming theoretical predictions. The hope is that such gradual advances will eventually lead scientists to a more practical superconductor.</p>



<p>“The sad thing is that there is a lot of nice work going on in the field but this [controversy] has taken so much attention,” says Boeri, of the Sapienza University of Rome.</p>



<p>To further shore up the scientific legitimacy of their claims, scientists are now developing new ways to identify superconductivity, debating what standards should be met before one can claim to have achieved superconductivity, and discussing new norms around sharing data.</p>



<p>The work, scientists say, could help researchers stave off any future questionable claims of superconductivity, which aren’t uncommon in physics. “We all recognize that our field is in danger of being written off by the wider scientific community because of all of the false positives,” says theoretical physicist Peter Hirschfeld of the University of Florida in Gainesville.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Controversy surrounding Dias’ superconductivity claims keeps growing</h4>



<p>With the power to conduct electricity without resistance, superconductors promise to transform modern technology — if they can be made to function at temperatures and pressures fit for everyday use. This tantalizing possibility fuels hype to levels uncommon in the typically esoteric realm of physics research.</p>



<p>The first eye-popping superconductivity claim from Dias’ group came in 2020. While most superconductors must be cooled to very cold temperatures to function, a material of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">remained superconducting up to 15° Celsius</a> (59° Fahrenheit), he and colleagues reported in <em>Nature </em>(<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>That material, like many of the highest-temperature superconductors, had to be squeezed to high pressure, meaning it was not feasible for practical use. Still, it was purportedly the first demonstration of a long-sought room-temperature superconductor.</p>



<p>But after other scientists raised doubts about the data and methods, <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">retracted the paper</a>, against the protestations of Dias and the other authors (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>In March, Dias’ team countered with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-scrutiny">an even bigger claim</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/23</em>). A material made of lutetium, nitrogen and hydrogen superconducts at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">room temperature and under pressures much closer to atmospheric pressure</a>, they reported in <em>Nature</em>.</p>

Adam Fenster/University of Rochester</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, skeptics delved into Dias’ history, alleging <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread plagiarism in his Ph.D. thesis</a>, according to an analysis reported in a news article in <em>Science</em>. The digging also <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.016401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagged a 2021 paper</a> that Dias coauthored in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, or <em>PRL</em>, unrelated to the two <em>Nature</em> papers on superconductivity. An investigation by <em>PRL </em>found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02401-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of data fabrication</a>, <em>Nature </em>reported in July. With the agreement of all the authors but Dias, <em>PRL </em><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.079902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted the paper</a> on August 15.</p>



<p>Asked about the retraction, Dias asserted in an email that “there has been no data fabrication, data manipulation or any other scientific misconduct in connection with our work.”</p>





<p>Dias is now under investigation by the University of Rochester, a university spokesperson said.</p>



<p>Amid all this controversy, outsiders might imagine that the entire field is fishy, says physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. “But in fact, it’s completely not so, because other people … are doing really good, great and very well-confirmed [work].”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Reproducibility is key for high-temperature superconductors</h4>



<p>High-pressure physics is highly specialized, and experiments that succeed in one laboratory can be challenging to replicate elsewhere. But consensus has gradually formed around several record-breaking superconductors.</p>



<p>The research centers around hydrogen-rich materials known as hydrides. This choice was inspired by a prediction that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pressure-make-metallic-hydrogen">pure hydrogen would become a superconducting metal</a> when squeezed to extreme pressure (<em>SN: 8/10/16</em>). Since those pressures proved difficult to reach, scientists added other elements to hydrogen in hopes of lowering the pressure needed.</p>



<p>The first major success was a compound of sulfur and hydrogen, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-big-stride-superconductivity">broke the record at the time for the highest-temperature superconductor</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>). It <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconducts up to around 203 kelvins</a> (−70° C), Eremets and colleagues reported in <em>Nature </em>in 2015. Then, in 2018, scientists crowned the current record holder (discounting Dias’ work), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">a compound of lanthanum and hydrogen</a>, which superconducts up to about −20° C (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>In both cases, multiple groups have confirmed the results. And theoretical calculations agree that the materials are superconducting at these high temperatures. Even so, both superconductors require a squeeze more than a million times the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere, limiting their practical usefulness. Other high-temperature superconductors, such as yttrium hydride, have also been replicated by multiple groups.</p>



<p>In contrast, physicists have struggled to conclusively reproduce the Dias group’s lutetium superconductor, or to come up with a convincing theoretical explanation for it. Coupled with the previous retractions, that leaves many researchers doubtful. “I absolutely do not trust any results of this group,” says physicist Dmitrii Semenok of the Center for High Pressure Science &amp; Technology Advanced Research in Beijing.</p>



<p>In an email, Dias waved away concerns, writing that “if&nbsp;people are struggling to replicate my work, that’s not surprising — not everyone will be able to do what took me years to accomplish.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">New superconducting materials make their debut</h4>



<p>In the light of the retractions and failed replications, many physicists think other developments in the field are more worthy of their attention.</p>



<p>One hot topic is ternary hydrides, materials in which hydrogen is combined with two additional elements instead of just one. By exploring the many possible combinations of elements in the periodic table, physicists hope to find new superconductors that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-pressure-physics-electricity">work at lower pressures and higher temperatures</a> than the hydrides studied so far (<em>SN: 3/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>In June, scientists reported the first example of a ternary hydride with a brand-new structure of atoms, never seen in previous binary hydrides. Made of lanthanum, beryllium and hydrogen, the material was <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.266001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconducting up to about 100 kelvins</a> (about −173° C), researchers report in a paper published in <em>PRL.</em> That’s not a record by any means. But the material requires less pressure than some other hydrides, says physicist Yanming Ma of Jilin University in Changchun, China. “We have the first example. Then later on, maybe people [will] build on our work.”</p>



<p>In another recent development, physicists tied up a decade-old loose end. A superconductor predicted in 2012, calcium hydride, was finally produced, two independent teams reported in 2022 <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.167001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in <em>PRL</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30454-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>. This was the first hydride superconductor predicted with a “clathrate” structure, in which the hydrogen atoms form a cage around another type of atom.</p>



<p>This clathrate structure has since been found in other high-temperature superconductors, including the accepted record holder, lanthanum hydride. The discovery of calcium hydride “is a really nice success,” says theoretical physicist Eva Zurek of the University at Buffalo in New York. “Examples like this go counter to saying … that the whole field is doing crappy work.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="492" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3.jpg" alt="A chemical diagram shows lanthanum atoms in blue and a beryllium atom in red surrounded by a cage of hydrogen atoms in light blue." class="wp-image-3130890" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-529x383.jpg 529w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-622x450.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-257x186.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130890">Most hydrogen-rich superconductors that scientists have discovered are made from hydrogen with the addition of one other element, what’s called a binary hydride.

Here, lanthanum atoms (blue) and a beryllium atom (red) are surrounded by a cage of hydrogen atoms (light blue).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130890">G. Liu/Jilin University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So far, hydrides still require a hefty squeeze to superconduct. “It’s very difficult to lower the pressure of these … hydrides to ambient conditions,” says theoretical physicist Hanyu Liu of Jilin University.</p>



<p>Some physicists are going beyond hydrogen. Physicist Timothy Strobel is swapping in other light elements. He’s studying clathrates made not with hydrogen but with boron and carbon — the fifth and sixth elements on the periodic table.</p>



<p>In such materials, “we would expect moderately high-temperature superconductivity, but not as high as hydrogen,” says Strobel, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>But that trade-off may be worth it. With such materials, scientists hope to find structures sturdy enough to persist at atmospheric pressure. It’s similar to carbon’s most flashy form, diamond, which forms under pressure but remains intact once that pressure is released. In a paper published in January in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, Zurek, Strobel and colleagues predict that <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c10089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some flavors of these materials could be superconductors</a> at temperatures up to 88 kelvins (about –185° Celsius ) under atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>That might seem low in comparison to the high-pressure hydrides. But temperatures above 77 kelvins (about −196° C), the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, are more easily achievable in practical use, because costly liquid helium isn’t required for coolant. In contrast, high pressures are currently prohibitive for practical purposes. Reaching ambient pressure may be more important than room temperature, Strobel argues.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Physicists want to raise the bar for claiming superconductivity</h4>



<p>In parallel to investigating new superconductors, high-pressure physicists are also discussing how to avoid controversies in their field in the future.</p>



<p>Some are calling for more sharing of raw data, with the intent of making claims easier to check and experiments easier to replicate. Semenok, for example, posts raw data online for most of his papers. Other physicists in the field find the idea appealing. “This really should be standard for major journals,” Eremets says. “In our age, why not?”</p>



<p>While Dias’ group provided data associated with their lutetium superconductor paper in <em>Nature</em>, that hasn’t satisfied other scientists. “In my mind, basically none of the data that’s been uploaded is raw data,” says physicist James Hamlin&nbsp;of the University of Florida in Gainesville. “Raw data is a data file that was created by your measurement software on the day of the measurement and then not touched after that point.” The Dias team’s data doesn’t fit that bill, Hamlin says.</p>



<p>Physicists are also working to strengthen the evidence for superconductivity in their materials. It’s not all about resistance, or lack thereof. Superconductors exhibit other hallmarks. One telltale sign is the Meissner effect, in which a material expels magnetic fields. This and other effects can help confirm that the superconductivity is real.</p>



<p>But high-pressure experiments involve mere specks of material squeezed between two diamonds. Making clear measurements of the Meissner effect and other hallmarks of superconductivity can be difficult under such conditions.</p>



<p>So scientists are coming up with additional ways to confirm superconductivity. For example, when certain types of superconductors are exposed to a magnetic field and the magnetic field is later switched off, a residual magnetic field remains trapped within the superconductor. In a June paper in <em>Nature Physics</em>, Eremets and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02089-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measurements of trapped magnetic fields</a> in both the sulfur and lanthanum hydrides, further solidifying the case for their superconductivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="271" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2.jpg" alt="A gloved hand points to a diamond anvil cell in a lab." class="wp-image-3130893" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2-330x132.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130893">To create new superconductors under high pressure, researchers squeeze materials inside diamond anvil cells like the one shown, which was used by physicist Mikhail Eremets and colleagues. Special techniques are needed to demonstrate conclusive signs of superconductivity in the tiny amounts of material contained within such cells.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130893">Stephen Bilenky</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some physicists are also calling for a set of criteria that scientists would be expected to meet before claiming to have found a new superconductor. “There should be some general standard of what one should prove to claim superconductivity,” Boeri says.</p>



<p>Besides measuring a dramatic drop in resistivity, Hirschfeld suggests requiring other markers of superconductivity, such as showing that a magnetic field lowers the temperature below which a material becomes a superconductor. Several other measurements would be required for the scientific community to accept the result, with the results confirmed by independent groups.</p>



<p>Despite efforts to bolster superconductor research, spurious claims of room-temperature superconductivity will probably be challenging to eliminate. “It’s not something rare; it happens from time to time,” Semenok says. The allure of the room-temperature superconductor looms large. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Case in point — a purported room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor called LK-99, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported prior to peer review</a> at arXiv.org in July, went viral on social media. Further scientific investigation <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/room-temperature-superconductor-lk-99-fails-replication-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon mostly debunked</a> the claim.</p>



<p>As for Dias, his lutetium-based superconductor still stands in the scientific record — for now. After researchers raised concerns about the paper, <em>Nature </em>began looking into it. “We are currently assessing concerns that have been raised with us, but we cannot discuss the specifics of those concerns relating to any particular paper while such post-publication assessments are underway,” a spokesperson for&nbsp;<em>Nature </em>said.</p>



<p>The paper now bears a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautionary editor’s note</a>. The reliability of the paper’s data, it says, is in question.</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University who <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resigned following scrutiny</a> of his published papers and an <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">institutional research misconduct investigation</a>, has retracted a third paper, this one from <em>Cell</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last week, Tessier-Lavigne <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">retracted two articles from <em>Science</em></a> that had been published in 2001.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Cell</em> paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400808041">A Ligand-Gated Association between Cytoplasmic Domains of UNC5 and DCC Family Receptors Converts Netrin-Induced Growth Cone Attraction to Repulsion</a>, was published in 1999.

<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423009133">retraction notice</a> was posted Monday. It states:</p>



<span id="more-127825"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the authors.</p>



<p>In 2015, we, the authors, consulted with <em>Cell</em> editors about issues that had been brought to our attention about this paper, specifically image splicing in Figures 3C, 5A, 5B, and 7B–7D and duplication of blank blots in Figure 7C. <em>Cell</em> declined to publish a Correction at that time because in 1999, when the paper was published, the journal did not have policies prohibiting unmarked image splicing and because, for the duplication, there was insufficient information to determine intent, and the impact of the duplication on the paper’s conclusions was limited. In 2022, when new concerns were raised, <em>Cell</em> posted an Editorial Expression of Concern (<em>Cell</em> 186, 230 [2023], https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.019) while an institutional investigation was conducted. The investigation is complete and has revealed further issues including manipulation of data-containing portions of Western blot images in Figures 3A–3C, 7A, 7B, and 7D, undermining confidence in the paper’s conclusions (https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf). As a result, we are retracting the paper. We regret the impact of these issues on the scientific community.</p>



<p>Two of the authors, K. Hong and M. Nishiyama, could not be contacted to sign this retraction. E. Stein declined to sign the retraction.</p>

<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “issues” the authors discussed with the <em>Cell</em> editors in 2015 were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/250D42FBB7D7298E704BFD6CD8B22A#1">flagged</a> by anonymous PubPeer users, as also happened with the <em>Science</em> papers retracted last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stanford’s investigation of the allegations, spurred by <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/stanford-presidents-research-under-investigation-for-scientific-misconduct-university-admits-mistakes/">reporting in the student newspaper</a>, determined four of Tessier-Lavigne’s papers contained “apparent manipulation of research data by others,” but Tessier-Lavigne was not responsible.&nbsp;<br>In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/news/message-stanford-community">statement</a> posted to his lab website on July 19, the same day as Stanford’s report was published, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to retract the <em>Science</em> and <em>Cell</em> articles and was in touch with <em>Nature</em> about a “thorough correction” to a 2004 paper.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bone-marrow-skull-alzheimers-ms-diseases">Bone marrow in the skull could be used to monitor Alzheimer’s, MS and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cells hidden in the skull may point to a way to detect, diagnose and treat inflamed brains.</p>



<p>A detailed look at the skull reveals that bone marrow cells there change and are recruited to the brain after injury, possibly traveling through tiny channels connecting the skull and the outer protective layer of the brain. Paired with the discovery that inflammation in the skull is disease-specific, these new findings collectively suggest the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0213-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skull’s marrow could serve as a target to track and potentially treat neurological disorders</a> involving brain inflammation, researchers report August 9 in <em>Cell</em>.</p>





<p>Immune cells that infiltrate the central nervous system during many diseases and neuronal injury can wreak havoc by flooding the brain with damaging molecules. This influx of immune cells causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-helps-disease-causing-immune-cells-invade-ms-patient-brains">can contribute to diseases like multiple sclerosis</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). Detecting and dampening this reaction has been an extensive field of research.</p>



<p>With this new work, the skull, “something that has been considered as just protective, suddenly becomes a very active site of interaction with the brain, not only responding to brain diseases, but also changing itself in response to brain diseases,” says Gerd Meyer zu Hörste, a neurologist at University of Münster in Germany who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Ali Ertürk of the Helmholtz Center in Munich and colleagues discovered this potential role for the skull while probing the idea that the cells in skull marrow might behave differently from those in other bones. Ertürk&#8217;s team compared the genetic activity of cells in mice skull marrow, and the proteins those cells made, with those in the rodent’s humerus, femur and four other bones, along with the meninges, the protective membranes between the skull and the brain.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Cells in the skull, particularly a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, differed from those in other bones but were similar to those in the meninges, the team found. And brain injury widened those differences. In mice with stroke symptoms, the activity in skull cells of genes related to cell migration and inflammation was higher than in other bone cells, suggesting that the cells respond to whatever is happening in the brain.</p>



<p>In another experiment, Ertürk and colleagues compared the profile of proteins in human skull cells with those in the pelvis or the vertebra. Skull marrow cells presented brain proteins while the other bones did not. “This tells us that the communication is two-way,” Ertürk says.</p>



<p>Those discoveries seemed important, but only if the skull and brain had a way to send cells back and forth. A few years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-tunnels-immune-cells-brain-injuries">observed connecting “tunnels” between the skull and the meninges in mice and humans</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/18</em>). More recently, another team showed that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf7844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune cells from the skull were actually getting into the brains</a> of mice, an observation made again in the new study.</p>



<p>To get a better look at the human tunnels, the team used a technique that makes tissue transparent, along with 3-D imaging, to inspect the bone and tissue of people who had died. That revealed a clear path to connect the skull and meninges, something “never been imaged in that much detail in humans before,” says Meyer zu Hörste.</p>



<p>The study “shows the connections very beautifully,” he says, “but how functionally relevant they are still needs to be studied.”</p>



<p>The team did track the location and levels of neuroinflammation in the skulls of people who have Alzheimer’s disease, stroke or multiple sclerosis using PET imaging. The pattern of skull inflammation was different with each disease. For example, in people with MS, there was a huge inflammation signal at the base of the skull, which was not present in people with stroke or Alzheimer’s.</p>





<p>“The inflammatory signature was moving depending on the nature of the neurological disorder,” says Ilgin Kolabas, a neuroscientist in Ertürk’s lab. The signal even increased in specific regions in the skulls of people with Alzheimer’s, a possible sign of the progression of the disease.</p>



<p>Because these signals might be mirroring what is happening in the brain, they could serve as a proxy for neuroinflammation, Kolabas says. The team anticipates these findings could help with both diagnosis and treatment of stroke, Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders using less invasive methods than spinal taps or other alternatives.</p>



<p>But the technology is still not sufficiently advanced for that yet; future studies need to address whether skull inflammation can actually be measured and targeted to attack brain diseases, Meyer zu Hörste says. “There is a lot of work left to be done.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adult-coral-frozen-survive-climate-change">Adult corals have been safely frozen and revived for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like something out of science fiction, small colonies of mature corals have been safely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40500-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frozen and revived</a> for the first time, though more work will be needed to ensure their long-term survival, researchers report August 23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Freezing chunks of living corals for safekeeping — or cryopreserving them — could save them from extinction as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">the oceans heat up</a> and acidify from human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 8/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers had already cryopreserved and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-larvae-survive-being-frozen-and-thawed-first-time">revived coral larvae</a> with success (<em>SN: 10/26/18)</em>. But larvae are accessible only when corals spawn, so just a few nights each year, says marine scientist Liza Roger of Arizona State University in Tempe. “That’s putting a lot of eggs in one basket.” What’s worse, she says, coral reproduction is struggling, and fewer larvae are surviving, thanks to warming seas.</p>





<p>With larvae collection becoming more difficult, one solution is to cryopreserve mature coral colonies, which are available year-round. If humans can reverse climate warming, preserved adult corals could help rebuild reef ecosystems in more hospitable seas. But larger specimens are harder to cryopreserve; it’s more difficult to prevent ice formation, which damages tissues somewhat like pipes cracking in the winter.</p>



<p>Thermodynamicist Matthew Powell-Palm of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station and his team experimented with freezing pea-sized pieces of a common Hawaiian finger coral, an anthozoan called <em>Porites compressa</em>. Using menthol and light, the researchers first removed microbes that could interfere with preservation. Next, the fragments were sealed within rigid metal chambers filled with a special chemical solution that partially dehydrated the corals and helped mitigate ice growth, then plunged into liquid nitrogen.</p>



<p>Amid the roughly –200° C temperatures, bathed in chemicals and restrained by the stubborn chamber walls, the remaining water in the corals solidified into a glassy form — or vitrified — without expanding into ice crystals. At such frigid conditions, Powell-Palm says, metabolic reactions and other life-driving processes “crawl to such an infinitesimally slow pace, you could preserve [living specimens] for hundreds, possibly thousands of years.”</p>



<p>But the real test came next. After a couple minutes spent in cryopreservation, the corals were pulled from the nippy nitrogen and put through a careful, 24-hour thawing and recovery routine. Then, the researchers measured how much oxygen the thawed corals were consuming. One day after thawing, the corals were alive and well.</p>



<p>The results are promising, but the team’s work isn’t finished, Roger says. As things stand, a few days after thawing, the corals were still so stressed out from the cryopreservation process, they were overrun and killed by bacteria they normally live in harmony with. The next steps should be to help the revived reef builders survive in the long-term, she says.</p>



<p>Powell-Palm is optimistic. Applying the right antibiotics, he says, could help the brave coral crumbs thrive in whatever new world they’re revived in.</p>

<p>Elsevier journals are retracting eight studies after learning that one of the authors on the papers was “fictitious” – as in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">similar case</a> we reported on recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ostensible author, Toshiyuki Bangi, was listed as affiliated with the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The eight studies, which were cited a collective 47 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, were published in three different journals — <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>, the <em>Journal of Building Engineering</em>, and <em>Case Studies in Construction Materials</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061822020621?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a> is the same for each paper, and states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127818"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following a complaint made by the Office of Research Integrity of the National Technical University (NTU) of Singapore, an investigation determined that the co-author “Toshiyuki Bangi” is fictitious; the name and affiliation were added to the paper by the corresponding author. NTU is in no way involved in this deception and the fictitious author was assigned a hotmail.com email address.</p>



<p>Manipulation of authorship is a serious violation of publication ethics that distorts the research record and draws all aspects of the work into question.</p>



<p>The corresponding author has admitted the deceit and understands the need for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author for all of the papers is Cong Zhang, a researcher in the School of Environmental and Civil Engineering at Jiangnan University in China. He did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The practice of listing “gift” or “honorary” authors, who have made little or no notable contribution to a paper, is sometimes an attempt to boost the reputation or prestige of research. Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">recently reported</a> on another case where this included inventing the entire identity of a researcher at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roderick Wayland Bates, NTU’s research integrity officer and an associate professor of chemistry, chemical engineering, and biotechnology at the institution, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I understand that this fictitious author was added to the paper as they thought that having an author from a well known University would improve the paper&#8217;s chances in the review process. As a reviewer myself, I am not influenced by addresses, but some people might be. The review system, despite its limitations, is the process that ensures the quality of academic publications. That is why it has to be protected from attempted abuse such as this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bates said he found out about the retraction from the university library, which heard about Bangi from a person in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, where Bangi supposedly worked. Bates said he isn’t sure how people think they can get away with adding fictional authors, since that person’s supposed colleagues are bound to notice and ask who the person is.</p>



<p>In addition to not having a university email, no profile for Bangi appears in NTU’s <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/faculty-directory?searchFaculty=&amp;interests=all&amp;page=1">faculty directory</a>. Attempts by Retraction Watch to contact Bangi at his listed email address yielded no response.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As indicated within the Retraction Notice, the paper was retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) following a complaint received on 1 March 2023. The EIC wrote to the corresponding author and on the 3 March 2023, the author acknowledged the need for retraction.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mike C. Forde, the Editor-in-Chief of Construction and Building Materials, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm that this paper was retracted by Construction and Building Materials with a notice explaining why the paper was retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Editors-in-Chief of the other two journals did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though Elsevier, as well as the publishing arm of the American Society of Civil Engineers, have retracted all articles published in their journals that included Bangi’s name, other journals with papers that list Bangi as an author remain unmarked — for instance, <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2022/7615616/">“Influence of Distribution Modulus on the Compressive Strength of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete with Coarse Aggregate (UHPC-CA)</a> in the journal <em>Advances in Civil Engineering</em>.&nbsp;</p>
