              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-soil-nutrients-rice-farming">Martian soil may have all the nutrients rice needs</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — Martian dirt may have all the necessary <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2990.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nutrients for growing rice</a>, one of humankind’s most important foods, planetary scientist Abhilash Ramachandran reported March 13 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. However, the plant may need a bit of help to survive amid perchlorate, a chemical that can be toxic to plants and has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-farming-harder-martian-regolith-soil">detected on Mars’ surface</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>“We want to send humans to Mars … but we cannot take everything there. It&#8217;s going to be expensive,” says Ramachandran, of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Growing rice there would be ideal, because it’s easy to prepare, he says. “You just peel off the husk and start boiling.”</p>





<p>Ramachandran and his colleagues grew rice plants in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103508002017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martian soil simulant</a> made of Mojave Desert basalt. They also grew rice in pure potting mix as well as several mixtures of the potting mix and soil simulant. All pots were watered once or twice a day.</p>



<p>Rice plants did grow in the synthetic Mars dirt, the team found. However, the plants developed slighter shoots and wispier roots than the plants that sprouted from the potting mix and hybrid soils. Even replacing just 25 percent of the simulant with potting mix helped heaps, they found.</p>



<p>The researchers also tried growing rice in soil with added perchlorate. They sourced one wild rice variety and two cultivars with a genetic mutation — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">modified for resilience</a> against environmental stressors like drought — and grew them in Mars-like dirt with and without perchlorate (<em>SN: 9/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>No rice plants grew amid a concentration of 3 grams of perchlorate per kilogram of soil. But when the concentration was just 1 gram per kilogram, one of the mutant lines grew both a shoot and a root, while the wild variety managed to grow a root.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that by tinkering with the successful mutant’s modified gene, <em>SnRK1a</em>, humans might eventually be able to develop a rice cultivar suitable for Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Oceans may be shrinking </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/earth-sciences-142"><em>Science News</em></a>, March 10, 1973</p>



<p>The oceans of the world may be gradually shrinking, leaking slowly away into the Earth’s mantle…. Although the oceans are constantly being slowly augmented by water carried up from Earth’s interior by volcanic activity … some process such as sea-floor spreading seems to be letting the water seep away more rapidly than it is replaced.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists traced the ocean’s leak to subduction zones, areas where tectonic plates collide and the heavier of the two sinks into the mantle. It’s still unclear how much water has cycled between the deep ocean and mantle through the ages. A 2019 analysis suggests that sea levels have <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GC008232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped by an average of up to 130 meters</a> over the last 230 million years, in part due to Pangea’s breakup creating new subduction zones. Meanwhile, molten rock that bubbles up from the mantle as continents drift apart may <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920121001734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“rain” water back into the ocean</a>, scientists reported in 2022. But since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-deep-interior-holds-vast-reservoir-water">Earth’s mantle can hold more water</a> as it cools (<em>SN: 6/13/14</em>), the oceans&#8217; mass might shrink by 20 percent every billion years.</p>

<p>Public attention to the use of animals in research is on the rise, and with good reason. As scientists, we have a responsibility to avoid using animals in our work whenever possible. Not only does this prevent needless suffering and waste of resources, it also leads to better science, because findings from animal experiments often fail to hold up in humans. If studies can be conducted ethically with human subjects, tissues, or organs, they should not use animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On paper, some journals appear to clear this bar. In reality, however, they fall short of carrying out their ethical responsibility: We see many examples, especially in journals in the nutrition field, of published research that was conducted in animals but could have been carried out in humans or using human-relevant methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/14/2852/htm">recent study</a> fed monkeys Western- and Mediterranean-style diets to produce information about the diets’ effects on human mood and behavior. Another <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/12/4350/htm">experiment</a> used pigs to evaluate how diets rich in fruits and vegetables can improve human microbiome health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should give pause to the National Library of Medicine (NLM). When deciding if a journal merits inclusion in MEDLINE, the leading bibliographic database for life sciences, NLM may <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_journal_selection.html">look at</a> whether the journal’s ethical policies align with best practices and how well individual articles adhere to those policies.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126716"></span>



<p>Consider the journal <em>Nutrients</em>, which published the studies cited above. In our view, it has a particularly bad record of accepting studies with egregious violations of ethical norms when it comes to experiments on animals. <em>Nutrients</em>’<em> </em>own<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/instructions#ethics"> guidelines</a> require the “replacement of animals by alternatives wherever possible.” However, the journal, and others like it, continuously publishes research using animals to study human nutrition when alternatives exist – and better ones at that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is onene more example: The manufacturer of a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/904">saffron-based nutrition supplement</a> explored the spice&#8217;s purported mood-boosting properties. But rather than administering the supplement to volunteers and tracking their depressive symptoms with validated instruments, as other researchers have done, the manufacturer force-fed it to mice via gavage and dropped the animals in water tanks to conduct forced swim tests as a measure of their mood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was approved by an institutional ethics committee, but we believe the journal’s ethics guidelines should still have blocked the article from being accepted. Ethics-committee approval is irrelevant to the question of whether such an experiment met the journal’s explicit guidelines for the use of animals in research.</p>



<p>In 2022, <em>Nutrients</em> published more than 4,000 research papers, and just under 800 of those (roughly 20%) used live animals. After spending more than a year investigating the journal, we find that most, if not all, of these studies could have been conducted with humans or human-relevant alternatives. This would not only have spared tens of thousands of animal lives, but would also have provided clinically meaningful data rather than results of uncertain relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Nutrients</em>, which is published by MDPI and indexed for MEDLINE, has a history of editorial problems. In 2018, the journal saw <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/open-access-editors-resign-after-alleged-pressure-publish-mediocre-papers">10 of its senior editors resign</a>, including the editor-in-chief, over alleged pressure to accept &#8220;mediocre&#8221; papers. The change in leadership and the ethical failings we have identified both warrant a fresh look at the journal&#8217;s participation in MEDLINE per the database&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_policies.html#reeval">policy for reexamination</a>.</p>



<p>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, along with the support of more than 700 physicians and health care professionals, brought these issues to the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/wxbqpxpmfk/letter-to-nutrients-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">journal</a>, publisher, MEDLINE staff, the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/zffv527vcn/letter-to-nlm-medline-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">National Library of Medicine</a>, and the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (the federal advisory committee that recommends journals for inclusion in MEDLINE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, insufficient action has been taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time after time, <em>Nutrients</em> claims its editorial office and ethics committee “checked the articles themselves to confirm that they contained ethics statements that are in accordance with the journal policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, MEDLINE “has independently verified that all articles you have brought to its attention include statements indicating that the studies were reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But ethics-committee approval is not sufficient to meet the journal’s stated ethical guidelines. We believe journals should take their ethical guidelines seriously, just as NLM should live up to its vetting function.</p>



<p>The continued retort by the National Institutes of Health is that we should direct our concerns to the publisher, which we have already done repeatedly to little apparent effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open-access, pay-to-publish journals become increasingly prevalent, we need to consider the financial motives of these publishers. MDPI, which publishes <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals">420 journals</a>, charges thousands of dollars for each published article, creating a deterrent to meticulously screen submissions for evidence of ethical misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to sustain research integrity, MEDLINE should make its reevaluation process transparent. Setting up a system for scientists to see why and how often journals are reevaluated and creating a platform where journals can be submitted for reevaluation could help boost confidence in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As scientists, we are often left leaning on the trust of bibliographic databases to know if a publication is trustworthy. If MEDLINE fails to enforce its rules, it is not only the journals that lose their credibility; MEDLINE’s credibility suffers in the process as does that of the body of scientific literature upon which we depend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If editors, publishers, and the NLM are not willing to take corrective action, we are left wondering whom the scientific community can depend on to uphold scientific accountability. Failing to abide by ethical standards in the literature is, in our opinion, leading to a research-integrity crisis.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh will talk about his recent work on &quot;Survey of Sentiment Analysis models leveraging transformers along with other NLP techniques to enrich word vectors for classification&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In recent years, the development of large language models (LLMs) such as the
GPT series has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) research,
rendering many specialized models obsolete. Rather than focusing on individual
tasks, researchers are now prioritizing the creation of general-purpose
language understanding systems capable of performing multiple tasks.
Competitive evaluation criteria, such as the Glue score, are being used to
evaluate these models. However, due to the limited resources of many
universities, they are unable to undertake such research and instead continue
to work on text classification tasks. Sentiment analysis is a popular text
classification task, and researchers are now incorporating transformers and
other techniques to improve performance on sentiment analysis datasets. In this
journal club meeting, we will discuss various models that leverage transformers
and other techniques to enhance sentiment analysis performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">Earth’s inner core may be more complex than researchers thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s heart may have a secret chamber. The planet’s inner core isn’t just a solid ball of nickel and iron, researchers say, but contains two layers of its own: a distinct central region nestled within an outer shell.</p>



<p>Scientists say they have confirmed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36074-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the existence of this innermost inner core</a> using a type of previously undescribed seismic wave that not only travels through Earth’s core but also bounces back and forth through the interior, collecting invaluable data about the core’s structure along the way.</p>





<p>Focusing on earthquakes of magnitude 6 or larger that struck in the last decade, the researchers combined data on these quakes that were collected at seismic stations around the world. Combining these signals made it possible to detect even very faint reflections of the seismic waves. Of the 200 or so quakes analyzed, 16 events spawned seismic waves that detectably bounced through the inner core multiple times.</p>



<p>The origin, structure and fate of Earth’s core is of intense interest because the core generates the planet’s magnetic field, which shields the Earth from charged particles ejected by the sun and helps keep the planet’s denizens safe from too much radiation.</p>



<p>“Understanding how the magnetic field evolves is extremely important for the life on Earth’s surface,” says Hrvoje Tkalčić, a seismologist at the Australian National University in Canberra.</p>



<p>The entire core, about 6,600 kilometers across, consists of two main parts: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">a liquid outer core and a solid inner core</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/23</em>). As iron-rich fluid circulates in the outer core, some of the material cools and crystallizes, sinking to form a solid center. That interplay generates Earth’s magnetic field.</p>



<p>When this swirling dance first began isn’t certain, but some studies suggest it was as recent as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field">565 million years ago</a>, just a fraction of Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-long life span (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>). That dance has faltered from time to time, its stuttering steps preserved in tiny magnetic grains in rocks. These data suggest the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-magnetic-field-reversal-mass-extinctions-environment-crisis">planet’s magnetic poles have flip-flopped</a> many times over the years, temporarily weakening the magnetic field (<em>SN: 2/18/21</em>). As more and more crystals cool, the dance will eventually slow and stop, shutting off the planet’s magnetic field millions or billions of years from now.</p>



<p>Different types and structures of minerals, as well as different amounts of liquid in the subsurface, can change the speed of seismic waves traveling through Earth, offering clues to the makeup of the interior. In 2002, researchers noted that seismic waves traveling through the innermost part of Earth <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.172508499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move slightly slower in one direction</a> relative to the planet’s poles than in other directions. That suggests there’s some oddity there — a difference in crystal structure, perhaps. That hidden heart, the team suggested, might be a kind of fossil: a long-preserved remnant of the core’s early formation.</p>



<p>Since that observation, Tkalčić and others have pored over seismic data, finding independent lines of evidence that help support the idea of an innermost inner core. The reverberating seismic waves, described February 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, also show a slowdown, and are the strongest evidence yet that this hidden heart exists.</p>





<p>Using that seismic data, Tkalčić and seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm, also of the Australian National University, estimate that this inner heart is roughly 600 kilometers across, or about half the diameter of the full inner core. And the pair was able to assess the direction of the slowest waves at about 50 degrees relative to the Earth’s rotation axis, providing more insight into the region.</p>



<p>The exact source of the wave slowdown isn’t clear, Tkalčić says. The phenomenon might be related to the structure of the iron crystals, which may be packed together differently farther into the center. Or it could be from a different crystal alignment caused by some long-ago global event that changed how inner core crystals solidified out of the outer core.</p>



<p>The inner core holds many other mysteries too. Lighter elements present in small amounts in the core — hydrogen, carbon, oxygen — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">may flow around the solid iron in a liquidlike “superionic” state</a>, further complicating the seismic picture (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>By identifying and reporting seismic waves that bounced back and forth through the planet’s interior multiple times, the researchers have made an invaluable contribution that will help researchers study the core in new ways, says seismologist Paul Richards of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.</p>



<p>Still, the team’s interpretation of the inner core’s structure from those waves “is probably more iffy,” says Richards, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p>One reason for this uncertainty is that as the waves bounce back and forth, they can become weaker and more difficult to see in the data, he says. “Many further observations will help decide” what these new data can reveal about the heart of the planet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-parasite-nematodes">Static electricity helps parasitic nematodes glom onto victims</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> — Some species of parasitic roundworms can catapult themselves high into the air to latch onto fruit flies and other insects. Experiments now reveal that leaping <em>Steinernema carpocapsae</em> nematodes take advantage of a secret weapon that makes them particularly effective in their pursuit of victims: static electricity.</p>



<p>Flying insects <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-swarms-electric-charge-static-electricity-storm-clouds-honeybees">build up electric charge</a> as they move through the air (<em>SN: 10/31/22</em>). It’s the same effect that causes electricity to collect on droplets of mist in clouds, and ultimately leads to lightning.</p>



<p>Individual insects can accumulate charges of 100 volts or so, biomechanics researcher Víctor Ortega Jiménez of the University of Maine in Orono reported March 6 at the American Physical Society meeting. When nematodes leap, the <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/B08.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charge on a passing insect attracts the parasites</a> like lint to a staticky sweater.</p>

Those charges create static electricity that pulls parasitic nematodes toward the insect, new research reveals. The arrows show the direction the nematodes move; colors indicate relative speed with blue for slower and red for faster.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122797">Víctor M. Ortega Jiménez</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To test the effect of electric charge, Ortega Jiménez and colleagues mounted dead fruit flies on wires and placed them near a surface covered in nematodes. With no charge on a fly, only nematodes that happened to jump in the direction of the insect landed on target, as expected. When researchers applied an electric charge to a suspended fruit fly, even nematodes that initially headed in the wrong direction were caught up in the electric field and pulled onto the fly.</p>



<p>Ortega Jiménez has also studied electric force effects on spider webs. When charged insects neared a web, “the silk is attracted directly to the insects,” he says. That made him wonder whether leaping nematodes rely on those forces as well.</p>





<p>Researchers have long considered the effect of fluids and air flow on insects and other tiny creatures. But only recently have they added electricity to the mix, Ortega Jiménez says. “We need to know how animals actually are dealing with these forces at this scale.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some teeny-tiny parasitic roundworms called nematodes have an unerring ability to leap high into the air to land on fruit flies and other living prey. It turns out that the prey unwittingly give the nematodes a hand, new research shows. By simply moving, a fly builds up an electric charge. Like static electric cling, that charge can pull a nematode in. In this experiment, researchers applied an electric charge to a pinned-in-place fly. A speck of a nematode (left) cartwheeled into the air and then headed straight for the fly.</figcaption></figure>

<p>In June of 2020, officials from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of San Francisco and the University of California, San Francisco, sent a letter to the journal <em>Oncogene</em> with the findings of an investigation of scientific misconduct: A paper the journal had published in 2007 contained “falsified data,” and the officials recommended the journal “assess this paper for retraction.”</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UCSF-PRA-023-024-3.3.23.pdf">2020 letter</a> – which we obtained through a public records request – was the second time the institutions had alerted the journal. As the officials stated, a previous&nbsp; investigation had found issues in the 2007 paper, and UCSF-VA had communicated “earlier evidence that this same paper had data fabrication and/or falsification constituting research misconduct” to the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">in 2017</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even though the journal has been notified after the last investigation and not taken action,” the 2020 letter stated, “they should be notified again because additional research misconduct has been found.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, a journal staffer was in the midst of discussing the issues in the article with Rajivir Dahiya, the corresponding author and then director of UCSF’s Urology Research Center with an appointment at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126713"></span>



<p>As we’ve reported previously, Dahiya, who retired in 2020 and is now a professor emeritus of urology, has had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/08/professor-emeritus-loses-fourth-paper-after-ucsf-va-investigation-five-years-after-other-retractions/">four papers retracted</a> after UCSF and the VA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">sent letters</a> to journal editors saying that an investigation had found “fabrication or falsification of data” in the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2020 letter from UCSF-VA officials confirms that the institutions conducted two investigations that found research misconduct, although neither inquiry could determine who was responsible for the faked data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judging from Dahiya’s correspondence with <em>Oncogene</em>, the letter also appears to have been a decisive factor for the journal’s editors. After receiving it, they moved forward with retracting the paper in question, despite the researcher’s objections. The emails also indicate the journal has been investigating another paper of Dahiya’s since at least 2019, with no resolution yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retracted paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1210572">Knockdown of astrocyte-elevated gene-1 inhibits prostate cancer progression through upregulation of FOXO3a activity</a>,” was pulled last October, and has been cited nearly 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The major problem was that this paper is about 16 years old and the investigation started in 2016,” Dahiya told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the investigation committee asked for the original data, the authors couldn’t provide them. The first author who did the experiments had left for another institution, and Dahiya’s lab had moved. The lab’s notebooks had been stored in a centralized location, he said, and the VA/UCSF discarded the materials after the National Institutes of Health’s mandated five year data retention period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya blamed the retractions on the VA/UCSF not keeping the old notebooks:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All the journals that published our papers did not have any problems with the data. But the VA/UCSF committee members forced these journals to retract our papers. It is strange that on one hand VA/UCSF discarded our original research data notebooks and on the other hand they blamed us that we did not have original data and thus we falsified the data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems <em>Oncogene</em>’s editors did have questions about the data, according to Dahiya’s emails with the journal that he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dahiya-Fwd_-Two-Oncogene-articles-under-investigation-Rajvir-Dahiya-UCSF-_-VAMC-san-Francisco.pdf">shared with Retraction Watch</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2019, Dahiya sent a journal staffer new data from experiments he and his coauthors had repeated in response to questions about the 2007 paper. “The results are consistent with the results given in Paper and thus does not change the results or the conclusion of the paper,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months later, in May 2020, the staffer responded with “sincere apologies for not getting back to you sooner” and several detailed questions from the editors about the new data compared to the original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some of the new figures, the editors pointed out that the result “goes against what is written in the original paper.” Other figures were “not that convincing and as clear as the original ones.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya sent a point-by-point response 10 days later. He concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe that your editorial members will find our responses satisfactory and resolve these issues.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next email from the journal, which came a week later, indicated the editor still had some questions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unless sufficient responses can be made to the editors questions, it is likely that the next course of action will be to retract this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After a few weeks, during which Dahiya wrote that he could not go into the lab “due to COVID-19 lockdown and protests,” he sent additional data and responses to the editors’ comments. On July 20, 2020, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are highly grateful to the editorial board members for giving us a chance to address the concerns. We have really worked very hard and sincerely put all efforts to address each and every comment and generated new data using all appropriate controls. We hope that these responses are satisfactory to the reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly a year later, Dahiya heard back from the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sincere apologies for the time taken to get back to you regarding the below response you sent to the latest round of comments from the editors.</p>



<p>Just prior to receipt of your last email, we received a report from the Investigation Committee on Scientific Misconduct of the Veterans Affair Medical Center, San Francisco, and the University of California San Francisco, which concludes that that [sic] several figures are the result of fabrication or falsification. Following receipt of this report the Editors propose that your paper be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email included a draft of the retraction note that was later published.&nbsp; It stated that each author would need to communicate whether or not they agreed with the retraction. Dahiya responded on July 8, 2021:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have carried out a series of experiments during the last two years to address all the concerns raised by the UCSF / VA investigation committee. All the original data was submitted to your journal and all concerns were addressed. Now under the pressure of UCSF/VA committee, the Editor has decided to retract our paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We (all authors) do not agree with the decision to retract our article by the Editors-in-Chief.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-022-02501-9">retraction notice</a> appeared online more than a year later, in October 2022, and referenced the committee’s findings “that Figures 2b, 4b, 4c, 5a and 5c are the results of fabrication or falsification of data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had drawn attention to those figures in the paper as far back as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B690D4F3DBFD14CC77EEB2BADEB615#1">December 2013</a>, but none of the authors responded on the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The recent letter from the VA/UCSF to <em>Oncogene</em>, dated June 30, 2020, stated that the investigation committee had found falsified data in figures 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5c. The committee concluded “that falsification occurred because the same bands were used to represent different experimental conditions,” and that the “nature of this manipulation makes it unlikely to have occurred by error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter also noted that the committee “could not determine who was responsible for the falsification of data,” and that none of the original data was available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a passage that echoed the investigation report, the letter detailed Dahiya’s defense of the paper, which the committee did not find convincing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The senior author, Dr. Rajvir Dahiya, “provided line scans of the analysis given to him by the first author of the published figures” Dr. Noboyuki Kikuno. The Committee reported that “Dr. Dahiya has corresponded with first author, Dr. Kikuno, and claims he has forwarded the densitometry readings of the published blots, not the original data and is convinced that the bands are different.” However, the “Investigation Committee does not accept the densitometry as valid but rather finds the forensic analyses (Exhibit 1, pp. 2, 3) more compelling.” Therefore, the Committee did not make a definitive determination of who was responsible for the falsification of data that constitutes Research Misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The VA/UCSF officials concluded with their recommendation to retract the paper, and reiterated the findings sent to the journal in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the 2020 letter’s statement that the journal had “not taken action” after the 2017 letter, a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Oncogene</em>, told us that the editors of the journal and the research integrity group had launched an investigation in response:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, the investigation took somewhat longer than anticipated to complete. For context, while we appreciate that delays can be frustrating, there are a variety of reasons why our investigations can sometimes take longer to complete. When looking into issues, we may need to consult external experts, liaise with author institutions or COPE, or wait for authors to confer with their colleagues, prepare responses and, where appropriate, provide additional materials. Analysing raw data or assessing other evidence, which may require technical translations, can also be a lengthy process.</p>



<p>While we endeavour to proceed with investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, these factors, among others, can mean that it is not possible to update our readers as quickly as we would prefer.</p>



<p>Once we had completed our investigation and considered all options, we concluded that retracting the paper was the appropriate course of action to take.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The investigation into another of Dahiya’s papers at <em>Oncogene</em>, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1208811">Promoter CpG hypomethylation and transcription factor EGR1 hyperactivate heparanase expression in bladder cancer</a>,” is taking even longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article was published in 2005, and has been cited 74 times. <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B389C0A0760C29F0AAE17063A168C7#1">In 2013</a>, a PubPeer commenter pointed out “many similarities” between two panels of figure 6a in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya’s emails with the journal included one with new data and a response to the observation that bands in the 2005 paper’s figure 6 “are similar with different exposures,” which he sent on Sept. 18, 2019. He later sent the new data and responses to comments on the 2007 paper in the same thread, with the subject line “Two Oncogene articles under investigation.” None of the journal’s responses we saw seem to address the 2005 paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Springer Nature spokesperson confirmed that the investigation into the 2005 paper, which remains intact without an editor’s note of any kind, “is still ongoing.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/pic-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Does high-risk pregnancy impact fathers/partners as well?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The transition to fatherhood significantly impacts men&#8217;s mental health and well-being. This is further compounded in the context of fatherhood and high-risk pregnancy (HRP), which remains a significantly under-researched area. The experience of impending parenthood is usually met with some angst but typically more excitement and joy. This joy can be shattered in the context of HRP for both mother and father. This impact is felt in similar but different ways and while research in the area of HRP more broadly remains limited, research specifically on fathers and HRP is rare. Thus, our study addressed the need to explore fathers&#8217; experiences as it relates to HRP by specifically using a scoping review methodology.</span></p>
<h4>What led you to study the impact of high-risk pregnancy on fathers?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">HRP has a negative psychological impact on both parents. For men, this period is also associated with severe stress-related symptoms, including being at an increased risk for the onset of mental health problems including, but not limited to, anxiety and depression. This means that fathers are also in need of support, particularly in the context of their role being perceived as only carer and supporter to their partners. This research is also linked to a larger study focusing on the experiences of fathers and HRP using an ethnographic, grounded theory approach. </span></p>
<h4>How does a high-risk pregnancy affect fathers?</h4>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, this research provides a greater understanding of the needs of fathers and what structures, interventions, and policies should be put in place to ensure that fathers feel both part of and supported throughout the pregnancy journey, especially a high-risk one.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through our research, we found that fathers are negatively impacted by a HRP through the way in which they are treated by healthcare professionals. This impact is felt in the lack of information that fathers are provided as well as a lack of figurative and literal spaces in the hospital environments for fathers to occupy. Fathers often reported that healthcare professionals tended to only inform mothers of the various treatment plans, prognosis of the treatment and conditions experienced by both mother and baby, thereby excluding fathers from the treatment process altogether and invalidating his presence, experience and contribution towards the family unit as a whole. Additionally, we noted that fathers tended to undergo a process of redefining their identity and the roles they envisioned in terms of what it means to be a “father.” This was experienced in fulfilling both a supportive function in the hospital and a single parent role at home, ensuring that older children were seen to and the household continued to function. All of these changes and uncertainties ultimately led to fathers experiencing a range of mental health challenges.</span></p>
<h4>How would a focus on fathers improve outcomes for mother, father, and baby?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05422-x">Our study</a> demonstrated that providing fathers with greater emotional and practical support has a direct impact on the aid they are able to provide for their child(ren) and partner. A lack of felt support increases mental health challenges which precipitates long-term effects on fathers. This in turn is felt by the mother and child(ren). A key finding from our study in this regard is the need for a family-centered approach by hospitals and healthcare providers in treating the family as a complete and functional unit. </span></p>
<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research is important because it acknowledges and highlights the alienation experienced by fathers and the difficulties that they encounter as a result of this alienation by healthcare professionals through a lack of information provided to them. Ultimately, this research provides a greater understanding of the needs of fathers and what structures, interventions, and policies should be put in place to ensure that fathers feel both part of and supported throughout the pregnancy journey, especially a high-risk one.</span></p>
<h4>What most surprised or excited you?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was surprising to see how little research has focused on fatherhood in the context of HRP. This is notwithstanding the limited research that has focused on mothers’ experiences as it relates to HRP. The more significant finding was that fathers experienced a range of mental health-related challenges that remain unstated or out of focus. In essence, the focus on the involved father is a pertinent debate currently, while fathers are navigating the disjunction between the involved father, traditional constructs of masculinity and the medical spaces where they are not always welcomed or supported.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity">Maternal deaths in the U.S. keep climbing</a></h4>

              
                <p>An increasing number of U.S. women are dying during pregnancy or soon after giving birth, according to the latest data on the maternal mortality rate.</p>



<p>In 2021, there were <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births</a>, compared with 23.8 per 100,000 in 2020 and 20.1 in 2019, the National Center for Health Statistics reports March 16. The <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/us-maternal-mortality-crisis-continues-worsen-international-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. rate greatly exceeds</a> those of other high-income countries. The total number of U.S. maternal deaths rose from 861 in 2020 to 1,205 in 2021.</p>





<p>There remains a wide disparity in the maternal mortality rate for Black women, at 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with white women, at 26.6 per 100,000. Many social determinants of health underlie this gap, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915910/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences in the quality of care</a> that Black women receive before, during and after pregnancy.</p>



<p>The NCHS report doesn’t discuss the reasons behind the increase for 2021. But <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths</a> in 2020 and 2021, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in October. The pandemic also contributed to the mortality disparity between Black and white women, the GAO found, worsening existing structural inequities that lead to such issues as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">barriers to getting health care</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Growing rates</h3>



<p>The U.S. maternal mortality rate has risen overall since 2018. The highest rate is among non-Hispanic Black women compared with Hispanic women and non-Hispanic white women.</p>

<p>The maternal deaths captured by the NCHS report are those that occur during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy, “from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management.” These causes include hemorrhaging, infections and high blood pressure disorders such as eclampsia.</p>



<p>The report excludes deaths after 42 days and up to the first year after birth. But <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/erase-mm/data-mmrc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 percent of pregnancy-related deaths</a> occur during this period, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in September, from an analysis of the years 2017 to 2019.</p>





<p>“We really do need to be able to care for our new moms beyond that six-week period,” says maternal fetal medicine specialist Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, Chair of the Obstetrics, Gynecology &amp; Reproductive Sciences Department at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.</p>



<p>One effort to expand coverage in the year after birth is through Medicaid insurance, which paid for 42 percent of U.S. births in 2020. States have the option to extend coverage from up to 60 days after birth to a full year through a provision of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.</p>



<p>The maternal mortality rate also excludes maternal deaths due to homicide. In 2018 and 2019, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134264/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homicide was the leading cause of death</a> during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy, responsible for more than twice as many deaths as causes like hemorrhaging, researchers reported in <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> in 2021. Studies have found that in the majority of these homicide cases, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8961681/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an intimate partner is the killer</a>, most often using a gun. Pregnant women are at higher risk of homicide than nonpregnant women of reproductive age.</p>



<p>Suicide is also a leading cause of death during pregnancy and one year after birth, but isn&#8217;t captured in the maternal mortality rate.</p>



<p>There have been improvements in managing pregnancy complications like hemorrhaging and blood pressure disorders, Gyamfi-Bannerman says. Implementing care bundles, which are akin to medical checklists, for these and other complications <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020520/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can reduce maternal mortality</a>.</p>



<p>But since gun violence and poor maternal mental health “are also leading to maternal mortality,” Gyamfi-Bannerman says, addressing these issues is crucial too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-venus-erupting-decades-old-nasa">A volcano on Venus was spotted erupting in decades-old images</a></h4>

              
                <p>Venus has active volcanism. A new analysis of decades-old images reveals the first definitive sign of a volcano erupting on the hellish planet next door.</p>



<p>NASA’s Magellan spacecraft observed the volcano Maat Mons twice between 1990 and 1992. Sometime in the 243 Earth days between each observation, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm7735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the volcanic vent appears to have morphed</a> from a 2.2-square-kilometer circle to a 4-square-kilometer blob. That change indicates that <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/1061.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an eruption had occurred</a>, researchers report online March 15 in <em>Science </em>and at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas.</p>





<p>“This world is not quiet, not quiescent, not dead,” says planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>Venus is about the same size and mass as Earth so it should have a similar amount of internal heat. And that heat must escape somehow. Scientists have long thought that Venus should be volcanically active. “We’ve just never had something we can point to. And now we do,” Byrne says. He’s also confident that volcanoes on Venus can still erupt now.</p>



<p>“There’s no way you have a planet that big that was doing something 30 years ago and stopped,” he says. “It’s definitely still active today.”</p>



<p>Planetary scientist Robert Herrick spotted the change after painstakingly poring through images of the Venusian regions considered most likely to be volcanically active. “This was a needle-in-a-haystack search with no guarantee that the needle exists,” says Herrick, of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</p>

<p>Much circumstantial evidence for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-erupting">eruptions</a> on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-mounts-active-volcanoes-venus">Venus</a> has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lava-may-be-flowing-venus-volcano">been reported</a> over the decades (<em>SN: 10/22/10; SN: 6/19/15; SN: 10/18/16)</em>. But it has been difficult to tell whether any particular change was due to real geology on the ground, or just a mirage. Many reported differences have turned out just to be due to Magellan’s differing viewing angles over successive orbits around Venus.</p>



<p>“Fundamentally, looking at these images is very hard,” says radar scientist Scott Hensley of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “It’s not like people have not looked [for active volcanism]. People have been looking over the years.”</p>





<p>Still, the vent’s change in the images alone was not enough to convince Hensley and Herrick that they were seeing evidence for active volcanism. So, Hensley ran more than 100 computer simulations of what Maat Mons would have looked like to Magellan under different imaging conditions. “None of them ever looked like [the 4-square-kilometer blob] on the second cycle,” Hensley says. The change must be real, he concluded.</p>



<p>The volcano’s change in shape suggests that it probably didn’t explosively explode like Washington’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-st-helens-cold-hearted-volcano">Mount St. Helens</a> did in 1980, Byrne says (<em>SN: 11/1/16</em>). Instead, the eruption was probably more like the long, slow lava drainage from Hawaii’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-explosive-things-2018-eruption-taught-us-about-kilauea">Kilauea volcano in 2018</a>, only bigger, he says (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>The finding gives scientists an idea of what to expect — and some new ideas for research — when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">upcoming missions return to Venus</a> (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). In the late 2020s or early 2030s, NASA plans to launch VERITAS, a satellite that will map the whole planet from space, and EnVision, which will take high-resolution satellite images of targeted regions.</p>



<p>“The cool part is it means that Venus is volcanically active now. In these upcoming missions, we are going to see things happening,” Herrick said in his March 15 talk. “We already had plans to try and look for new things and changes with time in both of those missions … we now know that that’s a valuable thing to do.”</p>



<p>This work is awe-inspiring, said planetary scientist Darby Dyar of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Ma., who was not involved in the new work. “Everybody in this room should be salivating over the features we’re going to see” in images from future missions.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>.&nbsp; The awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked last year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their work. Last week we featured <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">Open Science Atlas</a>. Today we hear about the Ape Research Index from Elisa Bandini and Sofia Forss from the University of Zurich. You can watch a video <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/recipients-and-finalists/recipients-2022/ape-research-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and/or read more below.</p>



<p>Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, are the primary comparative models for researchers working on a variety of human evolutionary questions. If you try typing in the keywords &lsquo;chimpanzee&rsquo;, &lsquo;model&rsquo; and &lsquo;human&rsquo; into google scholar, you will get 27,200,200 pages of results in less than a second (Rolian &amp; Carvalho, 2018), demonstrating the importance of chimpanzees as models across scientific disciplines. Our research lies at the intersection of various fields, including primatology, archaeology, and cultural evolution. To generate insight into the evolution of human and non-human primate cognition and behaviour, we often extrapolate findings from experimental studies with captive apes (in particular, chimpanzees), using these extant primates also as comparative models for early hominins. Generalizing findings from one or two populations of captive chimpanzees to the whole species, and then using these data as basis for a range of questions on human and non-human primate evolution is common practice in the field. However, it was whilst running some of our studies with captive chimpanzees that we realized that this approach is very problematic, for several reasons.</p>



<p>Firstly, we started noticing that despite our best attempts to match the environmental conditions during testing (one of the important benefits of testing in captivity is being able to control the environment more than when testing wild individuals), we were observing a huge amount of inter-individual variation in performance in the problem-solving tasks we provided to the chimpanzees, both within and across populations. We are not the only ones to have noticed variations in performance in captive chimpanzees, yet these differences are often treated more as &acute;noise&acute; in the data, and only reported anecdotally. Although easily ignored, these differences in performance in research tasks most likely provide key information on chimpanzee cognition and may jeopardize the generalizability of studies from certain populations of captive chimpanzees. Whilst the role of the environment, genetics and developmental processes in chimpanzee cognition and behaviour is relatively well-understood, one factor that is rarely taken into account is the effect of previous experience. Yet, how previous experience shapes our own behaviour and cognition is a well-researched area in the field of human psychology. As chimpanzees are so closely related to us, we hypothesize that previous experience also influences chimpanzee performance in research tasks. In particular, we argue that the more experience a chimpanzee has in experiments, the better they will perform in subsequent tasks.</p>



<p>If our hypothesis is found to be true, this would have huge repercussions across disciplines that generalize findings from captive chimpanzee populations to generate hypotheses on both non-human and human primate cognition. The current approach in the field is problematic also because of the centralization of captive chimpanzee research, as the majority of studies with captive chimpanzees are carried-out at a handful of institutions around the world. These zoos and sanctuaries have a long-standing reputation for research and attract a steady stream of funding and researchers to test the chimpanzees they house. This has resulted in some populations of captive chimpanzees building up a lifetime of almost daily testing sessions and a huge body of experience in research tasks. Therefore, if we find that previous experience does have an effect on current chimpanzee cognition and behaviour, then we would have to completely reconsider studies that extrapolate data from these intensively studied chimpanzee populations to the whole species, as they might not be reliable representative of the abilities of the species.</p>



<p>Our project, The Ape Research Index (ARI), will investigate this open question by carrying out a meta-analysis of the existing literature to identify the levels of research experience of chimpanzees currently living at institutions around the globe, and correlate their experience levels with their performance in these tasks. Our second objective will be to identify the groups with the highest levels of experience and the ones with the lowest, and directly test both groups with the same test batteries (with tasks novel to both groups), to examine whether previous experience has an effect on their ability to solve new tasks across cognitive domains. Lastly, we will place all this data into a completely open-access database (ARI), which will allow researchers to check the level of previous experience of different captive chimpanzee populations in order to identify the most appropriate sample for their particular research question. This approach will greatly increase the reliability and robustness of comparative cognition studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-planet-collision-earth-plate-tectonics">A moon-forming cataclysm could have also triggered Earth’s plate tectonics</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — Vestiges of a moon-forming cataclysm could have kick-started plate tectonics on Earth.</p>



<p>The leading explanation for the origin of the moon proposes that a Mars-sized planet, dubbed Theia, struck the nascent Earth, ejecting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-moon-formation-space-doughnut">a cloud of debris</a> into space that later coalesced into a satellite (<em>SN: 3/2/18</em>). New computer simulations suggest that purported remains of Theia deep inside the planet <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2723.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have also triggered the onset of subduction</a>, a hallmark of modern plate tectonics, geodynamicist Qian Yuan of Caltech reported March 13 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.</p>





<p>The story offers a cohesive explanation for how Earth gained both its moon and its moving tectonic plates, and it could aid in the search for other Earthlike worlds. But others caution that it’s much too early to say that this is, in fact, what happened.</p>



<p>Of all the worlds yet discovered, ours is the only one confirmed to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">plate tectonics</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). For <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-may-have-started-earlier-than-we-thought">billions of years</a>, Earth’s creeping plates have spread, collided and plunged beneath one another, birthing and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">splitting continents</a>, uplifting mountain ranges and widening oceans (<em>SN: 4/22/20, SN: 1/11/17</em>). But all this reshaping has also erased most of the clues to the planet’s early history, including how and when plate tectonics first began.</p>



<p>Many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">hypotheses</a> have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-eroded-glaciers-may-have-kick-started-plate-tectonics">proposed</a> to explain the initiation of subduction, a tectonic process in which one plate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sinking-melting-ancient-tectonic-plate-may-fuel-yellowstones-supervolcano">slides under another</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/22; SN: 6/5/19; SN: 1/2/18</em>). Yuan and his colleagues chose to focus on two continent-sized blobs of material in Earth’s lower mantle known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earth-birth-linger-45-billion-years-later">large low-shear velocity provinces</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). These are regions through which seismic waves are known to move anomalously slow. Researchers had previously proposed these regions could have formed from old, subducted plates<em>.</em> But in 2021, Yuan and colleagues alternatively proposed that the mysterious masses could be the dense, sunken <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1980.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of Theia</a>.</p>



<p>Building off that previous work, the researchers used computers to simulate how Theia’s impact, and its lingering remains, would impact the flow of rock inside the Earth.</p>



<p>They found that once these hot alien blobs had sunk to the bottom of the mantle, they could have compelled large plumes of warm rock to upwell and wedge into Earth’s rigid outer layer. As upwelling continued to feed into the risen plumes, they would have ballooned and pushed slabs of Earth’s surface beneath them, triggering subduction about 200 million years after the moon formed.</p>



<p>While the simulations suggest the large low-shear velocity provinces could have had a hand in starting subduction, it’s not yet clear whether these masses came from Theia. “The features … are a fairly recent discovery,” says geodynamicist Laurent Montési of the University of Maryland in College Park. “They’re very fascinating structures, with a very unknown origin.” As such, he says, it’s too early to say that Theia triggered plate tectonics.</p>



<p>“It’s provoking. This material down there is something special,” Montési says of the large low-shear velocity provinces. “But whether it has to be originally extraterrestrial, I don’t think the case is made.”</p>





<p>However, if confirmed, the explanation could have implications that reach beyond our solar system. “If you have a large moon, you likely have a large impactor,” Yuan said. Scientists have yet to confirm the discovery of such an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler">exomoon</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). But keeping an eye out, Yuan said, could help us uncover another world as tectonically active as our own.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-wolf-fish-unusual-deep-sea-ecosystem">A ‘fire wolf’ fish could expand what we know about one unusual deep-sea ecosystem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica sits a deep-sea chimera of an ecosystem. Jacó Scar is a methane seep, where the gas escapes from sediment into the seawater, but the seep isn’t cold like the others found before it. Instead, geochemical activity gives the Scar lukewarm water that enables organisms from both traditionally colder seeps and scalding hot hydrothermal vents to call it home.</p>



<p>One resident of the Scar is a <a href="https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5230.1.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly identified species of small, purplish fish called an eelpout</a>, described for the first time on January 19 in <em>Zootaxa</em>. This fish is the first vertebrate species found at the Scar and could help scientists understand how the unique ecosystem developed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Jacó Scar was discovered during exploration of a known field of methane seeps off the Costa Rican coast and named for the nearby town of Jacó. It is “a really diverse place” with many different organisms living in various microhabitats, says Lisa Levin, a marine ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.</p>



<p>Levin was on one of the first expeditions to the Scar but wasn’t involved in the new study. She recalls the team finding and collecting one of the fish during this early excursion, but the researchers didn’t recognize it as a new species.</p>



<p>Several more specimens were snagged during later submersible dives. Charlotte Seid, an invertebrate biologist at Scripps who is working on a checklist of organisms found at the Costa Rican seeps, brought the fishy finds to ichthyologist Ben Frable, also of Scripps, for formal identification.</p>



<p>Frable says he knew the fish was an eelpout. They look exactly as one would expect based on their name: like frowning eels, though they aren’t true eels. But he was having trouble determining what type. Eelpouts are a diverse family of fish comprised of nearly 300 species that can be found all over the world at various ocean depths.</p>



<p>Because the physical differences between species can be subtle, they are “kind of a tricky group” to identify, Frable says. “I just was not really getting anywhere.” So the team turned to eelpout expert Peter Rask Møller of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, sending him X-rays, pictures and eventually one of the fish specimens.</p>



<p>Møller narrowed the enigmatic eelpout to the genus <em>Pyrolycus</em>, meaning “fire wolf.” Turns out, the tool, called a dichotomous key, that Frable had been using to identify the specimens was outdated, made before <em>Pyrolycus </em>was described in 2002. “I did not know that genus existed,” Frable says.</p>



<p>Because the other two known <em>Pyrolycus </em>species live far away in the western Pacific and have different physical features, the team dubbed the mystery fish <em>P. jaco </em>— a new species.</p>



<p>The first eelpouts most likely evolved in cold waters, Frable says, but many have since made their home in the scalding waters of hydrothermal vents. Of the 24 known fish species that live only at hydrothermal vents, “13 of them are eelpouts,” Frable says.</p>

Frable and C. Seid/Scripps Institution of Oceanography</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new finding raises questions about how the known <em>Pyrolycus </em>species came to live so far apart. It may have to do with the fact that methane seeps are more common than previously thought on the ocean floor, and if some are lukewarm like Jacó Scar, the new species could have used them as refuges while moving east.</p>



<p>And by comparing <em>P. jaco</em> to its vent-living relatives, researchers may be able to figure out how it adapted to live in the tepid waters of the Scar — which may provide clues to how other species living there did too.</p>





<p>The eelpout is part of a medley of other species that form Jacó Scar’s composite ecosystem, along with, for example, clams typically found at cold seeps and bacteria found at hydrothermal vents. Jacó Scar is a “mixing bowl” of species found in other parts of the world, Seid says. Figuring out how this eclectic bunch interacts “is part of the fun.”</p>

                "Many of us probably share the following intuitions: to keep up with the ever-growing amount of literature, researchers have to specialize more and more; this reduces the potentially fruitful exchange between specialist bubbles. And: a growing number of political, economic, and societal decisions are made based on science. However, science gives guidance only; it does not make decisions for us. Given the participatory nature of democratic societies, we all need to understand what science generally – not only science from one’s own field of expertise – actually tells us about climate change, future energy systems, COVID-19, multiresistant bacteria, loss of biodiversity, etc.

But would researchers or stakeholders read the original papers in fields beyond their own expertise? Many wouldn’t – and they’d miss the information. The value of press releases, newspapers, and popular science magazines, on the other hand, is limited . These aim at being comprehensible to broader audiences and, to this end, refrain from presenting the full complexity and limitations of the actual findings.

The conceptual gap between these types of document is usually large. An article that falls within that gap, however, might offer an appropriate balance of simplicity and complexity for researchers with different specializations, policymakers, decision-makers, funders, early career scientists, journalists, educated generalists – in short, for those less likely to read the original research but who have an in-depth interest in the science presented.

I’d therefore like to suggest that this gap is a place in its own right that deserves additional coverage...."

<p>A government expert committee in Pakistan last year cleared a university vice-chancellor of plagiarism charges based on inconsistent claims of ignorance, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee, which was convened by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), also appears to have flouted rules that would have held the vice-chancellor responsible even if he had no knowledge of any plagiarism committed by work under his supervision. HEC funds and oversees higher education in Pakistan.</p>



<p>&#8220;This sends the wrong message to the academic community and undermines the credibility of the HEC,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/farukh-iqbal-0bb3663a/?originalSubdomain=au">Farukh Iqbal</a>, who brought the charges, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The case seemed simple enough at first. But it has since spiraled into a saga that may reveal as much about the value of political muscle in Pakistan as it does about academic dishonesty.</p>



<span id="more-126697"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In October 2020, Iqbal was working toward a PhD in chemical engineering at RMIT University in Australia when <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/27/vice-chancellor-of-university-in-pakistan-loses-paper-for-plagiarizing-from-a-thesis/">he noticed</a> a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">paper</a> in the journal <em>Fuel</em> that looked <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jctb.6408">familiar</a>. The authors, it turned out, had lifted heavily from Iqbal&#8217;s 2017 <a href="http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/id/eprint/21973/">master&#8217;s thesis</a>, as we reported in 2021.</p>



<p>Iqbal complained to both the HEC and <em>Fuel</em>. The journal investigated and found that Iqbal’s work had indeed been plagiarized. It <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236122006457">pulled the paper</a> in June 2021. (The retraction notice mistakenly refers to a PhD thesis.)</p>



<p>That same month, however, the first author of the retracted paper, Vice-chancellor <a href="https://kfueit.edu.pk/vision-of-new-vice-chancellor">Muhammad Suleman Tahir</a> of Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, in Rahim Yar Khan, returned fire. In a long-winded email to RMIT, he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original-Complaint-email-from-Professor-Tahir-.pdf">accused Iqbal</a> of plagiarizing from a 2019 <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ZahidMasood17/final-ms-presentationpptx">master&#8217;s thesis</a> by a student that Tahir had supervised. He also expressed frustration at <em>Fuel</em>&#8216;s &#8220;one-sided decision&#8221; to retract &#8220;our paper.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tahir and his coauthors also brought a 500 million rupee (~$2,800,000USD) <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/court-filings.pdf">defamation suit</a> against his accuser. As we reported last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/02/vice-chancellor-in-pakistan-sues-researcher-whose-work-he-plagiarized-and-says-he-was-the-victim/">they argued</a> that Iqbal&#8217;s “ugly campaign” had “irreparably injured … [the] credit, character, reputation and health” of the plaintiffs, who have suffered “indescribable isolation, persecution, mental torture, humiliation and material loss” in the process.</p>



<p>After looking into Tahir&#8217;s allegations, RMIT <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RMIT-letter.pdf">concluded</a> that it was indeed Iqbal, and not the vice-chancellor, who was the victim of plagiarism. </p>



<p>In Pakistan, however, HEC officials viewed matters differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Response-to-Iqbals-complaint-on-Citizen-Portal.pdf">response</a> from early 2021 to Iqbal&#8217;s complaint stated, &#8220;Dear citizen, text of your repeated complaint lacks quantitative facts, rather it reflects your personal grievance with the accused. The mentioned paper have [sic] been looked into with closed look by the plagiarism standing committee and your claim is not found true, anywhere!&#8221;</p>



<p>Iqbal complained several more times, as he explained in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/My-reply-to-Hec-investigation-with-all-documents.pdf">submission to the HEC</a>. In the end, the HEC convened an expert committee to review the case, and in February 2022 the committee issued <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Vice-Chancellor-KFUEIT-Rahim-Yar-Khan.pdf">its report</a>. In a written statement to the committee, the report said, the vice-chancellor had explained that &#8220;he was not aware of the [now-retracted] publication and his name was added without his consent.&#8221; </p>



<p>In fact, Tahir was the one who approached <em>Fuel</em> and asked for the retraction, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The committee found nothing contrary to what [Tahir] has presented in his letter / written statement. Therefore, he was not found responsible for the publication of the alleged plagiarized paper,&#8221; the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It added, however, that the source of the data in the <em>Fuel</em> paper was the thesis submitted by Tahir&#8217;s student Numair Manzoor, and that Manzoor&#8217;s thesis was &#8220;completely plagiarized as claimed by Mr. Farukh Iqbal.&#8221; But that was of no import for the complaint against the vice-chancellor, the committee found, and it recommended &#8220;no penalty against him.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his complaint, Iqbal also cited regulations that <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HEC-upholds-decision.pdf">had been reaffirmed</a> by the HEC in 2017. According to this statute, if a master&#8217;s thesis was found to be plagiarized, the supervisor would &#8220;also be held responsible for this act and will be blacklisted for five (05) years,” and &#8220;disciplinary action against such supervisor should also be initiated by the respective university.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iqbal knew that even a cursory look at the evidence showed that Tahir had been well aware of the <em>Fuel</em> paper and had in fact opposed its retraction, as Tahir himself had explained in his email to RMIT. Tahir had also acknowledged his authorship in the defamation suit against Iqbal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iqbal also bristled at the claim that the vice-chancellor had been the one to request the retraction of the <em>Fuel</em> paper. Not only did it contradict Tahir’s email to RMIT, Iqbal also had an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Elsevier-email.pdf">email from Elsevier</a>, the journal&#8217;s publisher, in which it shared with him the &#8220;great news&#8221; of the retraction and thanked him for his patience with the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tahir has not faced any sanctions, as far as Retraction Watch is aware. Neither he nor the HEC responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Iqbal, who says the experience contributed to his decision to leave his PhD studies, filed <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Appeal.pdf">an appeal</a> to the HEC in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gmail-Review-Appeal-Against-the-Decision-of-HEC-Experts-Committee-bearing-No.-Ref_-3-1-268-P_QAD_HEC_2022_216-dated-February-28-2022-under-Section-13-of-HEC-Plagiarism-Policy.pdf">March 2022</a>. He was told the expert committee would make a decision <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HEC-letter-dated-20.04.2022.pdf">within 60 days</a>. </p>



<p>Almost a year later, he has still not heard back.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">Why experts recommend ditching racial labels in genetic studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Race should no longer be used to describe populations in most genetics studies, a panel of experts says.</p>



<p>Using race and ethnicity to describe study participants gives the mistaken impression that humans can be divided into distinct groups. Such labels have been used to stigmatize groups of people, but <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not explain biological and genetic diversity</a>, the panel convened by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said in a report on March 14.</p>





<p>In particular, the term Caucasian should no longer be used, the committee recommends. The term, coined in the 18th century by German scientist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach to describe what he determined was the most beautiful skull in his collection, carries the false notion of white superiority, the panel says.</p>



<p>Worse, the moniker “has also acquired today the connotation of being an objective scientific term, and that’s what really led the committee to take objection with it,” says Ann Morning, a sociologist at New York University and a member of the committee that wrote the report. “It tends to reinforce this erroneous belief that racial categories are somehow objective and natural characterizations of human biological difference. We felt that it was a term that … should go into the dustbin of history.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the term “black race” shouldn’t be used because it implies that Black people are a distinct group, or race, that can be objectively defined, the panel says.</p>



<p>Racial definitions are problematic “because not only are they stigmatizing, they are historically wrong,” says Ambroise Wonkam, a medical geneticist at Johns Hopkins University and president of the African Society of Human Genetics. Race is often used as a proxy for genetic diversity. But “race cannot be used to capture diversity at all. Race doesn&#8217;t exist. There is only one race, the human race,” says Wonkam, who was not involved with the National Academies’ panel.</p>



<p>Race might be used in some studies to determine how genetic and social factors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racial-bias-race-us-patient-medical-notes-chart-records">contribute to health disparities</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/22</em>), but beyond that race has no real value in genetic research, Wonkam adds.</p>



<p>Researchers could use other identifiers, including geographical ancestry, to define groups of people in the study, Wonkam says. But those definitions need to be precise.</p>



<p>For instance, some researchers group Africans by language groups. But a Bantu-speaking person from Tanzania or Nigeria where malaria is endemic would have a much higher genetic risk of sickle cell disease than a Bantu-speaking person whose ancestors are from South Africa, where malaria has not existed for at least 1,000 years. (Changes in genes that make hemoglobin can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sickle-cell-may-blunt-not-stop-malaria">protect against malaria</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/11</em>), but cause life-threatening sickle cell disease.)</p>





<p>Genetic studies also have to account for movements of people and mixture between multiple groups, Wonkam says. And labeling must be consistent for all groups in the study, he says. Current studies sometimes compare continent-wide racial groups, such as Asian, with national groups, such as French or Finnish, and ethnic groups, such as Hispanic.</p>



<h4>An argument for keeping race in rare cases</h4>



<p>Removing race as a descriptor may be helpful for some groups, such as people of African descent, says Joseph Yracheta, a health disparities researcher and the executive director of the Native BioData Consortium, headquartered on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in South Dakota. “I understand why they want to get rid of race science for themselves, because in their case it’s been used to deny them services,” he says.</p>



<p>But Native Americans’ story is different, says Yracheta, who was not part of the panel. Native Americans’ unique evolutionary history have made them a valuable resource for genetics research. A small starting population and many thousands of years of isolation from humans outside the Americas have given Native Americans and Indigenous people in Polynesia and Australia some genetic features that may make it easier for researchers to find variants that contribute to health or disease, he says. “We’re the Rosetta stone for the rest of the planet.”</p>



<p>Native Americans “need to be protected, because not only are our numbers small, but we keep having things taken away from us since 1492. We don’t want this to be another casualty of colonialism.” Removing the label of Indigenous or Native American may erode tribal sovereignty and control over genetic data, he says.</p>



<p>The panel does recommend that genetic researchers should clearly state why they used a particular descriptor and should involve study populations in making decisions about which labels to use.</p>



<p>That community input is essential, Yracheta says. The recommendations have no legal or regulatory weight. So he worries that this lack of teeth may allow researchers to ignore the wishes of study participants without fear of penalty.</p>



<h4>Still seeking diversity in research participants</h4>



<p>Genetics research has suffered from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">lack of diversity</a> of participants (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). To counteract the disparities, U.S. government regulations require researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health to collect data on the race and ethnicity of study participants. But because those racial categories are too broad and don’t consider the social and environmental conditions that may affect health, the labels are not helpful in most genetic analyses, the panel concluded.</p>



<p>Removing racial labels won’t hamper diversity efforts, as researchers will still seek out people from different backgrounds to participate in studies, says Brendan Lee, who is president of the American Society of Human Genetics. But taking race out of the equation should encourage researchers to think more carefully about the type of data they are collecting and how it might be used to support or refute racism, says Lee, a medical geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not part of the panel.</p>



<p>The report offers decision-making tools for determining what descriptors are appropriate for particular types of studies. But “while it is a framework, it is not a recipe where in every study we do A, B and C,” Lee says.</p>



<p>Researchers probably won’t instantly adopt the new practices, Lee says. “It is a process that will take time. I don’t think it is something we can expect in one week or one evening that we’ll all change over to this, but it is a very important first step.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rover-bread-crumbs-hansel-gretel-technology">A trick inspired by Hansel and Gretel could help rovers explore other worlds</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the classic fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel dropped bread crumbs while walking through a treacherous forest so they wouldn’t lose their way. Rovers may one day use a similar trick to traverse other planets without losing their data.</p>



<p>Typically, if a rover permanently loses communication during a mission, all the information that it has gathered is lost. To avoid this, researchers suggest using a multi-rover system in which a smaller rover piggybacks on a larger “mother rover.” The smaller rover would then venture into any especially uncertain territory, such as a cave or lava tubes, deploying sensors the size of an AirPods case like bread crumbs as it goes.</p>





<p>The sensors could then communicate with each other via a wireless network and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117723001187?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funnel any collected data back to the mother rover</a>, theoretical physicist Wolfgang Fink and colleagues propose February 11 in <em>Advances in Space Research</em>. As proof of concept, the team built prototype sensors that communicate via Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>It’s not that the smaller rover would be following the “bread crumbs” back the way it came. Instead, “we use [the sensors] for the data to find its way communication-wise out of the cave to the mother rover,” says Fink, of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>The technology could also be useful here on Earth, especially after a natural disaster such as an earthquake. A rover could be sent with the deployable sensors into rubble where it’s too dangerous for people to perform <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/designing-robots-help-disaster">search-and-rescue missions</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/14</em>).</p>



<p>The bread crumb–like communication network could allow researchers to “cater to the essence of scientific exploration,” Fink says, by allowing rovers to overcome some of the constraints posed by tricky terrain. “To get to the real exciting science, you most of the time have to go to exotic places, hard-to-get-to places.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mice-anxiety-brain-heart-emotion">In mice, anxiety isn’t all in the head. It can start in the heart</a></h4>

              
                <p>When you’re stressed and anxious, you might feel your heart race. Is your heart racing because you’re afraid? Or does your speeding heart itself contribute to your anxiety? Both could be true, a new study in mice suggests.</p>



<p>By artificially increasing the heart rates of mice, scientists were able to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05748-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase anxiety-like behaviors</a> — ones that the team then calmed by turning off a particular part of the brain. The study, published in the March 9 <em>Nature</em>, shows that in high-risk contexts, a racing heart could go to your head and increase anxiety. The findings could offer a new angle for studying and, potentially, treating anxiety disorders.</p>





<p>The idea that body sensations might contribute to emotions in the brain goes back at least to one of the founders of psychology, William James, says Karl Deisseroth, a neuroscientist at Stanford University. In James’ 1890 book <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>, he put forward the idea that emotion follows what the body experiences. “We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble,” James wrote.</p>



<p>The brain certainly can sense internal body signals, a phenomenon called interoception. But whether those sensations — like a racing heart — can contribute to emotion is difficult to prove, says Anna Beyeler, a neuroscientist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Bordeaux. She studies brain circuitry related to emotion and wrote a commentary on the new study but was not involved in the research. “I&#8217;m sure a lot of people have thought of doing these experiments, but no one really had the tools,” she says.</p>



<p>Deisseroth has spent his career developing those tools. He is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-neuroscience-optogenetics-nerve-cells-light">one of the scientists who developed</a> optogenetics — a technique that uses viruses to modify the genes of specific cells to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-1">respond to bursts of light</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/21</em>; <em>SN: 1/15/10</em>). Scientists can use the flip of a light switch to activate or suppress the activity of those cells.</p>

<p>In the new study, Deisseroth and his colleagues used a light attached to a tiny vest over a mouse’s genetically engineered heart to change the animal’s heart rate. When the light was off, a mouse’s heart pumped at about 600 beats per minute. But when the team turned on a light that flashed at 900 beats per minutes, the mouse’s heartbeat followed suit. “It’s a nice reasonable acceleration, [one a mouse] would encounter in a time of stress or fear,” Deisseroth explains.</p>



<p>When the mice felt their hearts racing, they showed anxiety-like behavior. In risky scenarios — like open areas where a little mouse might be someone’s lunch — the rodents slunk along the walls and lurked in darker corners. When pressing a lever for water that could sometimes be coupled with a mild shock, mice with normal heart rates still pressed without hesitation. But mice with racing hearts decided they’d rather go thirsty.</p>



<p>“Everybody was expecting that, but it&#8217;s the first time that it has been clearly demonstrated,” Beyeler says.</p>





<p>The researchers also scanned the animals’ brains to find areas that might be processing the increased heart rate. One of the biggest signals, Deisseroth says, came from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/uncertainty-stressful-not-always-bad-thing">posterior insula</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/16</em>). “The insula was interesting because it&#8217;s highly connected with interoceptive circuitry,” he explains. “When we saw that signal, [our] interest was definitely piqued.”</p>



<p>Using more optogenetics, the team reduced activity in the posterior insula, which decreased the mice’s anxiety-like behaviors. The animals’ hearts still raced, but they behaved more normally, spending some time in open areas of mazes and pressing levers for water without fear.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video shows a mouse’s heart beating normally. Then, when a light is switched and flickers at a speedy tempo, the heart follows the rhythm and starts to race.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&nbsp;A lot of people are very excited about the work, says Wen Chen, the branch chief of basic medicine research for complementary and integrative health at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health in Bethesda, Md. “No matter what kind of meetings I go into, in the last two days, everybody brought up this paper,” says Chen, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>The next step, Deisseroth says, is to look at other parts of the body that might affect anxiety. “We can feel it in our gut sometimes, or we can feel it in our neck or shoulders,” he says. Using optogenetics to tense a mouse’s muscles, or give them tummy butterflies, might reveal other pathways that produce fearful or anxiety-like behaviors.</p>



<p>Understanding the link between heart and head could eventually factor into how doctors treat panic and anxiety, Beyeler says. But the path between the lab and the clinic, she notes, is much more convoluted than that of the heart to the head.</p>

The meeting also featured a look at our platform from the perspective of affiliate journals, presented by Marcel LaFlamme, Open Research Manager at the&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Library of Science</a>&nbsp;(PLOS). LaFlamme originally trained as a cultural anthropologist &ndash; during his postdoc, he studied how scientific organizations can promote open science and collaboration. As LaFlamme told us, PLOS is &ldquo;increasingly thinking about how to advance open science beyond the published article.&rdquo; We discussed how peer reviewed preprints can contribute to this goal, the different uses (and users) of peer review, automated reviewing and more.</p>



<p><strong>Could you tell us a bit about the pros and cons of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;from the perspective of affiliate journals?</strong></p>



<p>One of the advantages of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;from PLOS&rsquo;s perspective is efficiency. We&rsquo;re always asking ourselves: How can we provide better service to authors? How do we make that time from submission through decision to publication quicker? This is something that authors tell us is really important and that Review Commons helps us to achieve. Decreasing the burden on the reviewer pool is a second thing that benefits both journals and the scientific community; trying to cut down on those endless cycles of resubmission is something that we think is good for science. One fewer request that our reviewers are getting from a PLOS journal frees up capacity elsewhere in the reviewer pool to do other things.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Trying to cut down on those endless cycles of resubmission is something that we think is good for science.</p><cite>Marcel LaFlamme</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Those are the two concrete advantages of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>, in the here and now. I think a third advantage, one that is still coming into being, is the way that&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;begins to decouple evaluation from publication or dissemination of research. That&rsquo;s something that we are increasingly talking about at PLOS: what does it mean to decouple those functions and to configure them in different ways?</p>



<p>At the Janelia meeting, I also talked a little bit about challenges for editors. The big take-away was that an editor is not an editor is not an editor. We really need to understand editor concerns and challenges in the context of the editorial model and workflow of the journal that they work on. I think the PLOS portfolio is a good place to look at that because we have journals that are edited in quite different ways: by professional staff editors, by active researchers who are serving as editors-in-chief, and &ndash; for PLOS ONE &ndash; by Associate Editors who are researchers and who may serve as handling editor for just one paper a year. We are really paying attention to the differences in those positionalities and the different concerns that may emerge from those viewpoints.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think there are additional ways that PLOS could contribute to&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>?</strong></p>



<p>We are very open to thinking about what that looks like. There&rsquo;s one conversation that affiliate journals are having around the reviewer pool. To date, EMBO Press has anchored the initial review process for&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>. This leverages the excellent reviewer pool that EMBO has at its disposal, but it also incorporates the limitations of scope of EMBO (or any other single publisher). So, there&rsquo;s a conversation about how to broaden that initial reviewer pool to access different types of expertise and whether PLOS could have role in that.</p>



<p>There are broader questions, too. If we are starting to think about peer review as a service&mdash;which I think is one way we can talk about&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;&mdash; then we might also ask, to whom is it a service? So far,&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;has been a service to authors on the one hand, to have this refereed preprint, but then also a service to the affiliate journals. At PLOS we think these two pieces are valuable but would also ask: who else might peer review as a service be directed towards? Could that be funders? Could that be institutions? The exact form that this takes and how PLOS or&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;fits into it&hellip; I think we&rsquo;re still in the early days of figuring that out. But&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;has posed a very important question by offering peer review as a service and cinching it up with existing editorial processes, which is something that not all preprint review services have been as successful at doing to date.</p>



<p><strong>Do different editors assess the quality of reviews in different ways, and what does this say about how we should assess the quality of peer review overall?</strong></p>



<p>As we see more of this decoupling of dissemination and evaluation, we may be asking peer review to do new things. We may be asking it to contextualize research for non-expert audiences who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read a manuscript and draw the same or similar conclusions as the expert reviewers. In a world where peer review is not only being used to make an up-or-down editorial decision but also to contextualize work that exists in public and is there for people to engage with, then I think what quality looks like &mdash; if that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re asking peer review to do &mdash; is a bit different from what it looked like in that legacy context.</p>



<p><strong>As we ask peer review to do more and more things, should we also be looking at new ways to recognize the work of reviewers?</strong></p>



<p>Another way to ask that question is: should outputs other than published articles and big grants count toward research assessment and the development of scientific careers? I think the answer to that is definitely yes. One thing that PLOS is increasingly interested in from a policy perspective is how existing systems of research assessment that overvalue the research article and the big grant can serve as a structural barrier to open science. This is something that we are thinking about as an organization: how do we enable evidence-based decision making about how research assessment can change to properly reward and credit a broader range of research outputs?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Should outputs other than published articles and big grants count toward research assessment and the development of scientific careers? I think the answer to that is definitely yes.</p><cite>Marcel LaFlamme</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Peer review is one piece of that but sharing data and other outputs fall into this category as well. How you do this, how you credit reviews, is hard. There&rsquo;s one approach that is about counting and weighting the number of reviews and how much different sorts of review should count. There is another approach that is about making the reviews themselves visible and enabling different kinds of assessment, both qualitative and scalable, machine-driven assessment of the text of the reviews themselves. PLOS has taken the latter approach for some time, by giving our authors and reviewers the option to make reviews public and to share reviewer identities. I think these forms of sharing, in and of themselves, are not reward or credit, but they may be a precondition for a proper system of reward or credit.</p>



<p><strong>Can peer review be automated?</strong></p>



<p>At PLOS we are interested in the complementarity of expert human peer review and automated approaches. Last year there was a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6" target="_blank">commentary published</a>&nbsp;on the question &ldquo;is the future of peer review automated?&rdquo; &ndash; a very provocative title. The conclusion of the piece&mdash;and its authors included folks who are building software and who have a stake in the answer to that question being &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &mdash; was that a complementary approach is what we need. The technology is nowhere near the point where the application of human judgment could be sidelined. But automation can be used to check compliance with guidelines and checklists, or to detect the presence of&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related research outputs</a>; these are things that machine scoring can likely do better than a human editor who is doing them for a high volume of manuscripts, day in and day out.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262047876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Particle</a><br><em>Alan Chodos and James Riordon</em><br><em>MIT Press, $32.95</em></p>



<p>We live in a sea of neutrinos. Every second, trillions of them pass through our bodies. They come from the sun, nuclear reactors, collisions of cosmic rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere, even the Big Bang. Among fundamental particles, only photons are more numerous. Yet because neutrinos barely interact with matter, they are notoriously difficult to detect.</p>



<p>The existence of the neutrino was first proposed in the 1930s and then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutrino-now-detected">verified in the 1950s</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/54</em>). Decades later, much about the neutrino — named in part because it has no electric charge — remains a mystery, including how many varieties of neutrinos exist, how much mass they have, where that mass comes from and whether they have any magnetic properties.</p>





<p>These mysteries are at the heart of <em>Ghost Particle</em> by physicist Alan Chodos and science journalist James Riordon. The book is an informative, easy-to-follow introduction to the perplexing particle. Chodos and Riordon guide readers through how the neutrino was discovered, what we know — and don’t know — about it, and the ongoing and future experiments that (fingers crossed) will provide the answers.</p>



<p>It’s not just neutrino physicists who await those answers. Neutrinos, Riordon says, “are incredibly important both for understanding the universe and our existence in it.” Unmasking the neutrino could be key to unlocking the nature of dark matter, for instance. Or it could clear up the universe’s matter conundrum: The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter, the oppositely charged counterparts of electrons, protons and so on. When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other. So in theory, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">the universe today should be empty</a> — yet it’s not (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). It’s filled with matter and, for some reason, very little antimatter.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Riordon, a frequent contributor to the magazine, about these puzzles and how neutrinos could act as a tool to observe the cosmos or even see into our own planet. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>In the first chapter, you list eight unanswered questions about neutrinos. Which is the most pressing to answer?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>Whether they’re their own antiparticles is probably one of the grandest. The proposal that neutrinos are their own antiparticles is an elegant solution to all sorts of problems, including the existence of this residue of matter we live in. Another one is figuring out how neutrinos fit in the standard model [of particle physics]. It’s one of the most successful theories there is, but it can’t explain the fact that neutrinos have mass.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why is now a good time to write a book about neutrinos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>All of these questions about neutrinos are sort of coming to a head right now — the hints that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, the issues of neutrinos not quite fitting the standard model, whether there are sterile neutrinos [a hypothetical neutrino that is a candidate for dark matter]. In the next few years, a decade or so, there will be a lot of experiments that will [help answer these questions,] and the resolution either way will be exciting.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Neutrinos could also be used to help scientists observe a range of phenomena. What are some of the most interesting questions neutrinos could help with?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>There are some observations that simply have to be done with neutrinos, that there are no other technological alternatives for. There’s a problem with using light-based telescopes to look back in history. We have this really amazing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">James Webb Space Telescope</a> that can see really far back in history. But at some point, when you go far enough back, the universe is basically opaque to light; you can’t see into it. Once we narrow down how to detect and how to measure the cosmic neutrino background [neutrinos that formed less than a second after the Big Bang], it will be a way to look back at the very beginning. Other than with gravitational waves, you can’t see back that far with anything else. So it’ll give us sort of a telescope back to the beginning of the universe.</p>



<p>The other thing is, when a supernova happens, all kinds of really cool stuff happens inside, and you can see it with neutrinos because neutrinos come out immediately in a burst. We call it the “cosmic neutrino bomb,” but you can track the supernova as it’s going along. With light, it takes a while for it to get out [of the stellar explosion]. We’re due for a [nearby] supernova. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready">We haven’t had one since 1987</a>. It was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">last visible supernova in the sky</a> and was a boon for research. Now that we have neutrino detectors around the world, this next one is going to be even better [for research], even more exciting.</p>



<p>And if we develop better instrumentation, we could use neutrinos to understand what’s going on in the center of the Earth. There’s no other way that you could probe the center of the Earth. We use seismic waves, but the resolution is really low. So we could resolve a lot of questions about what the planet is made of with neutrinos.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Do you have a favorite “character” in the story of neutrinos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>I’m certainly very fond of my grandfather Clyde Cowan [he and Frederick Reines were the first physicists to detect neutrinos]. But Reines is a riveting character. He was poetic. He was a singer. He really was this creative force. I mentioned [in the book] that they put this “SNEWS” sign on their detector for “supernova early warning system,” which sort of echoed the ballistic missile early warning systems at the time [during the Cold War]. That’s so ripe.</p>

<p>Wise, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">scientific sleuth</a> whose work has resulted in more than 850 retractions, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5DF81DBD003F4F486E79992F0285D7#1">posted a comment</a> on PubPeer with a screenshot of the advertisement and contacted the publisher of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months later, the article, “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6641/ac7b9f">Potential application of AlP nanosheet semiconductor in the detection of toxic phosgene, thiophosgene, and formaldehyde gases</a>,” has been retracted. It had appeared in <em>Semiconductor Science and Technology</em>, an IOP Publishing title, and has been <a href="https://badge.dimensions.ai/details/id/pub.1148910846/citations">cited once</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the authorship broker says he has left the business.</p>



<span id="more-126685"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6641/acb597">retraction notice</a> cited Wise’s PubPeer post, and detailed the publisher’s conclusion:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>that there is sufficient evidence to hand that supports several author positions were purchased. During this investigation, the journal became aware of additional concerns relating to this article, which includes portions of previously published works [1, 2] by different authors being drawn upon without sufficient attribution, and further indications that demonstrate the article was created, manipulated, and/or sold by a commercial entity.</p>



<p>Despite numerous attempts to receive further information, the journal has not received any conclusive evidence from the authors that refutes the concerns raised, including any materials that demonstrate the research was conceptualised and drafted by the author group. The evidence gathered by IOP Publishing to date considerably reduces confidence in the work, to the extent that IOP Publishing has made the decision to retract the work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Hamzah Kzar, the paper’s corresponding author whose affiliation is listed as the veterinary medicine college at Al-Qasim Green University in Iraq, but haven’t heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Wise told us that the time it took IOP to retract the paper “seems reasonable when the authors have to have the chance to explain themselves,” but also said that the retraction “highlights how scientific publishing doesn’t appear to have a response yet to systematic abuse of the publishing process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Wise noted, Maria Jade Catalan Opulencia, one of the authors of the retracted paper whose affiliation is listed as the college of business administration at Ajman University in the United Arab Emirates, “suddenly published over 50 papers last year, despite having barely published before, and many of them have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=maria+opulencia">matching Facebook adverts on Pubpeer</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulencia is listed as a coauthor on <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dOpulencia%252c%2bMaria%2bJade%2bCatalan">three additional retracted papers</a> about cancer biology, fuel cells, and nanoelectronics for which Wise <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/624D9180023576F8DE5F68BF4CC7E7#2">identified</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87471B463BB5315515BF7FA37C183D#2">authorships</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F04D5D1085384DCDEC0AD77244FA1E#1">for sale</a>. Her most recent paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=DUuqJDAAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=DUuqJDAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">on Google Scholar</a> indicates it was published in <em>Linguistica Antverpiensa</em>, a Belgian linguistics journal that we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">previously reported</a> had been targeted by hijackers attempting to sneak paper mill manuscripts into databases like Scopus under the auspices of a legitimate journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wise told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am pretty sure that all of her articles from last year had authorship sold, but as it stands every single one will have to have an individual investigation lasting months. Surely publishers should investigate all her articles, without someone needing to find a matching advert, email the editor and hope for a response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Opulencia has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Wise also noted that Salim Kallel, who had posted the advertisement about the recently retracted paper, had continued sharing “call[s] for co-authorship!!” on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069291131516">public Facebook page</a> until as recently as the end of February, though he had stopped including enough specific information for Wise to find the published papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted Kallel via the WhatsApp number listed on his recent ads and asked about his posts. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All information is confidential and I don&#8217;t have the right to disclose any information about my clients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kallel also said he had stopped posting recently because “I don&#8217;t work more with that.” He has a new baby to take care of, he told us, and doesn’t expect to go back to the business.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-trek-chaco-canyon-hauled-logs">Two scientists’ trek showed how people of Chaco Canyon may have hauled logs</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the morning sun peeked through the trees, Rodger Kram readied himself for the coming marathon. But not the kind he used to run.</p>



<p>Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, stood next to undergrad James Wilson at the end of a rural dirt road. Each donned a strap of nylon webbing onto his head. Attached to the bottom of their straps — called tumplines — a log rested horizontally across the duo’s lower backs.</p>





<p>The pair was about to embark on a 25-kilometer trek to replicate how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chaco-canyons-ancient-civilization-continues-puzzle">ancient people of Chaco Canyon</a> may have transported timber around 1,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/17/17</em>). By the end of the day, their successful journey suggested that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.103876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have taken just a few days for three people with tumplines to carry a full-size timber to Chaco</a>, Kram, Wilson and colleagues reported on February 22 in the <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Located in the northwest corner of New Mexico, Chaco Canyon is home to grand structures built between A.D. 850 and 1200. Multistoried stone buildings called great houses had roofs with timber beams about 5 meters long and 22 centimeters in diameter. The site contained at least 200,000 timbers of this size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1.jpg" alt="A photo of the ruins of a great house in the Chaco Culture National Historical Park." class="wp-image-3122506" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122506">The ruins of this great house in Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico are part of Pueblo Bonito, a complex considered the center of Chacoan society.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122506">John Elk III/The Image Bank/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But the wood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/isotopes-reveal-sources-ancient-timbers">came from forests more than 75 kilometers away</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/01</em>). Load-pulling animals and wheels weren’t there at the time, and the timbers don’t appear to have been dragged. Scientists are puzzled by how the ancient people, ancestors of modern-day Diné and Pueblo peoples, moved the large timbers.</p>



<p>A 1986 study suggested that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/prehistoric-longdistance-transport-of-construction-beams-chaco-canyon-new-mexico/7E9FBAE6AE3F055D58746D1A707947F0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each log used as a beam had a mass of 275 kilograms</a>. But Kram suspected this number couldn’t be correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, he cut a section of a tree outside of his house — ponderosa pine, the same species used in Chaco — and weighed it on his bathroom scale. He then extrapolated that a 5-meter-long timber would be closer to 90 kilograms. This revelation led to a 2022 study <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00231940.2022.2102841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalculating the masses of the Chaco Canyon timbers as between 85 and 140 kilograms</a>.</p>



<p>“As soon as we figured out that the weight was reasonable, I wanted to carry them,” Kram says.</p>



<p>He and Wilson proposed that tumplines could have been used to transport the timbers. These head straps have been found on every inhabited continent and are thought to have been used since at least around 2,000 years ago. They are still widely used to carry heavy loads, such as by professional porters in Nepal. A tumpline is placed on the crown of the head — to be in line with the cervical spine — with the attached cargo resting on the small of the back.</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that the people of Chaco used tumplines to haul timbers, there is proof that they used them to transport other items, like water vessels.</p>



<p>To see if tumpline timber transportation was humanly possible, Kram and Wilson trained for three months during the summer of 2020, gradually increasing their load weight and walk duration. Strangers who passed by couldn’t hide their confusion.</p>





<p>On the final day, the pair walked 25 kilometers while carrying a ponderosa pine that had been air-dried, which is how the people of Chaco may have prepared timbers. The 60-kilogram log was 2.5 meters long and 24 centimeters in diameter. The entire trek took almost 10 hours, and the weight of the full timber only slightly slowed the duo’s pace.</p>



<p>“I felt happy at the end that it was proved feasible, and that the 132-pound log we shared was off our necks,” says Wilson, now a medical student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. But “I never really doubted that we could do it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bee-honeybees-waggle-dance-communicate-lessons-learn-hive">Honeybees waggle to communicate. But to do it well, they need dance lessons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a castaway test setup, groups of young honeybees figuring out how to forage on their own start waggle dancing spontaneously — but badly.</p>



<p>Waggling matters. A honeybee’s rump-shimmy runs and turning loops encode clues that help her colony mates fly to food she has found, sometimes kilometers away. However, five&nbsp; colonies in the new test had no older sisters or half-sisters around as role models for getting the dance moves right.</p>



<p>Still, dances improved in some ways as the youngsters wiggled and looped day after day, reports behavioral ecologist James Nieh of the University of California, San Diego. But when waggling the clues for distance information, <em>Apis mellifera</em> without role models never did match the timing and coding in normal colonies where young bees practiced with older foragers before doing the main waggle themselves.</p>





<p>The youngsters-only colonies thus show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade1702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social learning, or the lack of it, matters for communicating by dance</a> among honeybees, Nieh and an international team of colleagues say in the March 10 <em>Science</em>. Bee waggle dancing, a sort of language, turns out to be both innate and learned, like songbird or human communication.</p>



<p>The dance may appear simple in a diagram, but executing it on expanses of honeycomb cells gets challenging. Bees are “running forward at over one body length per second in the pitch black trying to keep the correct angle, surrounded by hundreds of bees that are crowding them,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Beekeepers and biologists know that some kinds of bees can learn from others of their kind — some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/score-bumblebees-football-insect-social-learning">bumblebees even tried soccer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/17</em>). But when it comes to waggle dancing, “I think people have assumed it’s genetic,” Nieh says. That would make this fancy footwork more like the chatty but innate communications of cuttlefish color change, for instance. The lab bee-castaway experiments instead show a nonhuman example of “social learning for sophisticated communication,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Testing for social learning took some elaborate beekeeping. At an apiary research center in Kunming, China, researchers put thousands of nearly grown-up honeybees (at what’s called the purple-eyed pupae stage) into incubators and then collected the brand-new winged adults when they emerged.</p>



<p>These youngsters went into five weirdly populated colonies of same-age worker newbies. Each colony got a queen, who would lay eggs but not leave the colony to forage. Food had to come from the young workforce, with no older, experienced foragers buzzing in and dancing the locations of flowers.</p>



<p>In waggle dancing, foraging bees have to master not only the moves but the obstacles of the honeycomb dance floor. A cell may be empty. “It’s just the edges to hang on to…. It would be easy to stumble,” Nieh says. Unlike commercial hives with manufactured uniform honeycomb cells, natural combs “are very irregular,” he says. “Along the edges, they get a bit crazy and rough.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A honeybee that brings home food to her colony does a looping, waggling dance that tells her colony mates how to find the source. In the center, a bee with a green dot on her back is doing her first waggle dance as other bees crowd around. She’s already gotten to follow along with dances by other experienced foragers, so she makes fairly regular figure eights. Bees that don’t have such mentors don’t nail the dance moves as well, a new study shows.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dances on these treacherous surfaces encode the food’s direction in the angle a dancer waggles across the comb (measured relative to gravity). Duration of waggling bout gives a clue on how far away the bonanza is.</p>





<p>The five colonies of castaways were left to figure out dancing on their own, in contrast to five other colonies in the apiary with a natural mix. Early in the experiments, researchers recorded and analyzed the first dances of five bees from each hive.</p>



<p>Even in the mixed-age hives, the dancers didn’t get the angle perfect every time. The extremes in a set of six waggle runs might differ by a bit more than 30 degrees. The castaway hives, though, had far more trouble at first. Two of the five castaway dancers’ angles veered more than 50 degrees apart, and one poor bee strayed more than 60 degrees in six repeats.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Waggle dancing lets honeybees share news about where to find food. The honeybee marked with a purple dot that’s making irregular figure eight loops in the center did not have older, experienced foragers around to lead her in practice dances. As a result, her first dance is rough and other bees seem to be colliding with her as much as following her. A study comparing bees with and without dance mentors suggests that this sophisticated communication is a mix of innate and learned behavior.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the castaways got more experience, they got better though. Repeating the test with the same marked bees a few weeks later near the end of their lives found them angling about as well as dancers in a normal hive.</p>



<p>What the castaways didn’t change much were dance features that encode distance to food. Researchers had set up the hives so that all would have the same experience of flying the distance to a feeder. Yet castaway bees persisted in dancing as if it were farther.</p>



<p>They gave more rump wags per waggle run (closer to five wags) than bees from mixed-age hives (more like 3.5 wags). The youngsters also took longer on each run.</p>



<p>Evidence like this foraging study is “indeed accumulating for the importance of learning (whether individual or social) in the complex behaviors of bees,” insect ecophysiologist Tamar Keasar of the University of Haifa in Israel says in an email. In her own work, she sees bees learning to extract food from complicated flowers. Bees aren’t, after all, just little automatons with wings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkey-stone-flakes-ancient-hominid-tools">Some monkeys accidentally make stone flakes that resemble ancient hominid tools</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeys in southern Thailand use rocks to pound open oil palm nuts, inadvertently shattering stone pieces off their makeshift nutcrackers. These flakes resemble some sharp-edged stone tools presumed to have been created on purpose by ancient hominids, researchers say.</p>



<p>Thailand’s long-tailed macaques (<em>Macaca fascicularis</em>) produce shards that could easily be mistaken for stone flakes previously found at 17 East African hominid sites dating from about 3.3 million to 1.56 million years ago, say archaeologist Tomos Proffitt and colleagues. The finding suggests that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient hominids may sometimes have created the stone flakes by accident</a> while using rocks to smash nuts, bones or other objects, the scientists report March 10 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Previous research has already shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-monkeys-throw-curve-stone-tool-makings-origins">rock-wielding capuchin monkeys in Brazil</a> unwittingly produce hominid-like stone flakes (<em>SN: 10/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Observations of rock bashing by these two monkey species undermine a long-standing assumption that hominids must have intentionally made certain ancient stone flakes, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested">some of the earliest known examples of tools</a>, Proffitt says (<em>SN: 6/3/19</em>). It’s time to reevaluate how such determinations are made, he contends.</p>



<p>Proffitt’s group identified 219 complete and fragmented stone flakes at 40 macaque nut-cracking sites on the island where the monkeys live. The team also found rocks showing damage consistent with having been used either as pounding implements or pounding platforms.</p>

Adv.</em> 2023, Technological Primates Research Group/Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some differences do exist between macaque and hominid stone flakes, says Proffitt, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. For instance, many macaque flakes display battering damage on only one side, versus frequent two-sided damage on hominid artifacts.</p>



<p>Such clues may help archaeologists develop guidelines for estimating whether ancient hominids made stone flakes on purpose or by accident, Proffitt suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammogram-dense-breast-cancer">My mammogram revealed I have dense breasts. What does that mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a mammogram, you may have gotten a letter in the mail that starts something like this: “Your mammogram indicates that you have dense breast tissue.” When I got that letter, I wasn’t sure what it meant for me or what, if anything, I should do about it. Off the letter went to a stack of other “nonurgent” mail to think about later.</p>



<p>Later has turned into now. That’s because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/10/2023-04550/mammography-quality-standards-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new rule on breast density notifications</a>, part of an update to mammography regulations. Published March 10, the rule makes these letters a nationwide requirement and standardizes the information conveyed in them. Previously, 38 states notified people with dense breasts or provided information about breast density after a mammogram. The new rule, which goes into effect September 10, 2024, means everyone who has had a mammogram will be informed whether their breasts are dense or not.</p>





<p>Why do people need to know this? If you just want the take-home message, here it is: Having dense breasts modestly increases the risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer. But breast density is just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2737316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one factor among others to be considered</a> when figuring out a person’s overall risk. Having dense breasts doesn’t mean you will get breast cancer, and not having dense breasts doesn’t mean you’re in the clear.</p>



<p>Ideally, receiving a notification about breast density would prompt a detailed discussion about breast cancer risk with a doctor. This column can’t replace that. But read on if you’d like to learn more about dense breasts and why the focus on them is a bit of a blunt instrument.</p>



<h4>What are dense breasts?</h4>



<p>Breasts are made up of different kinds of tissue: glandular tissue, which produces milk and directs it to the nipple, plus connective (fibrous) tissue and fatty tissue. Dense breasts have more glandular and connective tissue than fatty tissue.</p>



<p>Having dense breasts “isn’t abnormal,” says internist and epidemiologist Joann Elmore at UCLA. Dense breasts are common too: Around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579740/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent of women ages 40 to 79 in the United States have them</a>, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2019.</p>



<p>A radiologist visually assesses the density of breast tissue from a mammogram. The two non-dense classifications are “almost entirely fatty” and “scattered areas of fibroglandular density,” which means mainly fatty tissue with some areas of dense tissue. Around 8 and 46 percent of U.S. women ages 40 to 79 have those two classifications, respectively.</p>



<p>The two dense categories are “heterogeneously dense” and “extremely dense,” with an estimated 40 percent and 6 percent of U.S. women 40 to 79 in those categories, respectively. The two dense categories are usually lumped together and called “dense breasts.” Under the new FDA rule, that’s how notification letters will be written: that the person’s breast tissue is “dense” or “not dense.”</p>

<p>One more thing: Breast density can change. For example, older women tend to have less dense breasts than younger women. And sometimes a person will be switched from “dense” to “not dense” or vice versa, depending on the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e18772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiologist reading the mammogram</a> and deciding between the “scattered areas of density” and “heterogeneously dense” categories.</p>



<h4>OK, so why do I need to know if I have dense breasts?</h4>





<p>Dense breasts pose two problems. First, on a mammogram, glandular and connective tissue show up as white — which is how tumors or other abnormal breast tissue look too. So dense tissue could hide the very things a radiologist is looking for.</p>



<p>One measure of how well a mammogram works is sensitivity, the proportion of tumors detected by the mammogram out of all the diagnosed tumors (whether found by mammogram or not). An analysis of mammograms from a Dutch screening program found that for those with nearly all fatty tissue, sensitivity was 86 percent, and for scattered areas of density, it was 78 percent. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitivity continued to drop</a> with greater density: 70 percent for heterogeneously dense breasts and 61 percent for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017.</p>



<p>Second, dense tissue itself contributes to cancer risk. This may be related to the greater amount of glandular tissue in dense breasts. “Breast cancers almost always develop in the glandular tissue,” says Priscilla Slanetz, a breast radiologist at Boston Medical Center.</p>



<h4>How much do dense breasts increase the risk of a breast cancer diagnosis?</h4>



<p>Modestly. Dense breasts “elevate you above the average person a little bit,” Slanetz says. An average person is someone with no known risk factors for developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers compared the risk of developing breast cancer in those with dense breasts with the most common non-dense category, scattered areas of density. Premenopausal women with heterogeneously dense breasts are at <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/29/10/2048/124441/Breast-Cancer-Population-Attributable-Risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 to 1.8 times greater risk of developing breast cancer</a>, depending on race and ethnicity. Those with extremely dense breasts are at 1.8 to 2.4 times greater risk. For postmenopausal women, the risk was 1.3 to 1.6 times higher for heterogeneously dense breasts and 1.5 to 2 times higher for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another way to try to explain the risk, from a hypothetical case study of a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47-year-old woman who has heterogeneously dense breasts</a> and no family history of breast cancer. Among 1,000 women like the one in the case study with heterogeneously dense breasts, an estimated 20 will develop breast cancer in the following 10 years. That’s compared with 13 of 1,000 like the case study woman but with the most common non-dense category.</p>



<p>It’s also important to know that breast density is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/104/16/1218/910763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not associated with a higher risk of dying</a> from breast cancer, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2012. The analysis of more than 9,000 women with breast cancer suggests that what contributes to developing cancer differs from what affects the risk of dying from breast cancer. A different group of researchers also reported in 2018 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5885304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no association between breast density and breast cancer death</a>.</p>



<h4>What other factors should I be aware of regarding breast cancer risk?</h4>



<p>Dense breasts are just one part of the risk picture. The two most significant risk factors for developing breast cancer are being female and increasing age, Slanetz says.</p>



<p>About 1 in 8, or 13 percent, of cisgender women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. An estimated <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">297,790 new cases of breast cancer in women</a> are expected in 2023. Males <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/men-with-breast-cancer-have-lower-survival-rates-than-women">account for less than 1 in 100 cases</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>). And risk goes up as birthdays do: On average, while <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/risk-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 65 women starting at age 40</a> will develop breast cancer in the next 10 years, 1 in 24 women starting at age 70 will, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>



<p>There are also racial disparities in breast cancer risk. Despite having a slightly lower incidence of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent higher risk of death</a>: 28 per 100,000 Black women die of breast cancer in the United States compared with 20 per 100,000 white women. Black women are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6941147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age</a>, have more aggressive disease and are diagnosed at a later stage of cancer, all of which contribute to a poorer prognosis. Inequities in <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/EDBK_319929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to cancer therapies</a> and surgical treatment contribute to the disparity.</p>



<p>There is less breast cancer data for transgender men and women. Researchers have found that transgender men have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower rates of breast cancer</a> than cisgender women, which appears to be related to the surgical removal of breasts and the use of testosterone. Transgender women have a reduced risk of breast cancer compared with cisgender women due to less exposure to the hormone estrogen over their lives, although estrogen therapy can increase the risk.</p>



<p>Among the factors that greatly increase the risk of developing breast cancer are the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations. About 7 in 10 carriers of one of the mutations will have breast cancer by the age of 80. Women who received radiation therapy to the chest as children are also at high risk. These two groups have specific breast cancer screening recommendations.</p>



<p>Online breast cancer risk calculators can help doctors estimate a person’s risk. After adding up their risk factors, people are considered high risk if they have a 20 percent or greater chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. The American College of Radiology recommends that mammograms <a href="https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(17)31524-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin at age 30 for those</a> at high risk, supplemented with breast magnetic resonance imaging. The ACR also recommends that Black women be evaluated for breast cancer risk no later than the age of 30.</p>



<p>People with dense breasts — as well as those without, and anyone who is at average risk or a bit above average — should still get screening mammograms, doctors say. Medical organizations have some variation in their <a href="https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/16/11/article-p1398.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screening recommendations</a> regarding what age to begin and whether to get mammograms annually or every other year.</p>



<h4>What should I do if I have dense breasts?</h4>



<p>There aren’t recommendations specific to dense breasts to guide people or their doctors. People should have information about their breast density, says Ilana Richman, a general internist at the Yale School of Medicine. “But it is an open question what to do with that information,” she says, because of the lack of guidelines.</p>



<p>Some states’ notifications have suggested people with dense breasts might benefit from supplemental screening with a different imaging technology, such as MRI or ultrasound. With the new FDA rule, notifications will say that in some people with dense tissue, adding other imaging tests may help find cancer. However, density alone isn’t enough to bump someone up to the high risk category and a need for supplemental screening, says Karla Kerlikowske, a primary care physician and clinical epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There’s a lot of people that have dense breasts who are actually at low risk of breast cancer,” she says.</p>



<p>Ideally, a dense breast notification would lead to a discussion with a doctor about different breast cancer risks, to understand a person&#8217;s overall risk. But the limited time allotted to primary care visits in the United States is an obstacle. “We don’t have a system that allows enough time for that nuanced discussion,” says Christina Chapman, a radiation oncologist and health equity researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>



<p>Plus, that conversation should happen with people who have nondense breasts too, who could still be at high risk. “The focus on breast density in some ways just distracts from the idea that risk is multidimensional,” Richman says.</p>



<p>Many women who develop breast cancer don’t have any apparent risk factors, Slanetz says, which is why screening mammograms are important. “We screen [everyone] because we have to.”</p>

<h4>For good measure</h4>



<p><em>Cutting carbon dioxide emissions to curb climate change and reach net-zero is possible but not easy, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">The road to net-zero</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>A report by Princeton U­niversity’s Net-Zero America project, released in 2021, estimates that wind and solar power production needs to roughly quadruple by 2030 to achieve the United States’ goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, <strong>Witze</strong> reported. In the most ambitious scenario, “wind turbines would cover an area the size of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and O­klahoma combined,” she wrote.</p>





<p>Reader <strong>Mary Sweeney </strong>noted that, while technically correct, the statement quoted above could be misleading. “What the Princeton report actually states is that the visual footprint of the turbines would be equivalent to the combined areas of the states listed above. In other words, that figure for land use was reached by considering the very large area from which the very tall turbines would be visible,” <strong>Sweeney</strong> wrote. The actual land use would be only a tiny fraction of the visual footprint.</p>



<h4>Disappearing act</h4>



<p><em>A glass frog hides nearly all of its red blood cells in the liver while it sleeps, upping the animal’s transparency,<strong> Susan Milius</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">Glass frogs make their blood vanish</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Len Yaeger</strong> wondered what criteria the researchers used to determine transparency in the frogs.</p>



<p>Biologists think about transparency a bit differently from physicists, says <strong>Jesse Delia</strong> of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “If the individual tissues are transmitting over 90 percent of light, they’re — as far as biology goes — relatively perfectly transparent,” he says. Glass frogs’ green dorsal skin “gives them sort of a diffuse transmittance, like the filtered light if you were to look up at the tree canopy on a sunny day.”</p>





<p>What’s more, the translucence of glass frog skin appears across a continuum. The clearest see-through skin is on the belly, which helps explain why it took <strong>Delia</strong> some years to notice the cell-hiding phenomenon in sleeping frogs. <strong>Delia</strong> had often seen the frogs sleep in the wild, their less-translucent backs facing outward as the frogs clung to leaves. “It wasn’t until I saw them sleeping in captivity on glass that I could actually see their bellies,” he says. From there, “you can see straight in to their organs.”</p>



<p>Since the frogs can pack their red blood cells together without forming clots, reader <strong>Mara Chen-Goldberg</strong> wondered, could the discovery aid research into blood clot treatments for humans?</p>



<p>Many people are asking the same question, <strong>Delia</strong> says. The frogs seem to somehow inhibit the typical vertebrate blood-clotting process. “But at this point, we don’t know whether that mechanism would be directly translatable to human medicine,” he says.</p>



<h4>Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">A cunning fox catches fish, stunning researchers</a>” (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 4</em>) incorrectly stated that fishing in foxes had not been observed before. While the study featured in the story describes the first record of a red fox fishing, a 1991 study published in <em>Polar Research</em> had previously reported fishing in arctic foxes in Greenland. This incorrect fact also appeared in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/these-are-our-favorite-animal-stories-of-2022">a year-end roundup</a> in <em>Science News</em>’ December 17, 2022 &amp; D­ecember 31, 2022 issue.</p>
