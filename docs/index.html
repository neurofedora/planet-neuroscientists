              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-neuroscience-behind-imagination">The Neuroscience Behind Imagination</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the visualisation and construction of narratives in our minds to the recall of familiar objects, imagination is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. By bridging historical theories with contemporary neuroscience, we can understand the phenomenon of imagination, identifying the brain regions and networks involved and their intricate interactions. This exploration promises a deeper insight into the nature of imagination and its significance.</p>
<h3>Historical Perspectives on Imagination</h3>
<p>In ancient Greece, Plato conceptualised the world in two realms—'being' and 'becoming.' Within this framework, imagination manifests in two forms: 'being' imagination, involving perfect and unchanging ideas, and 'becoming' imagination, linked to personal experiences and beliefs. Plato's ideas lay the foundation for understanding the various facets of imagination. His theories introduce the notion of mental visual imagery formed through past experiences and knowledge, but also recognise the influence of our personal beliefs and “inner world.” Philosopher Immanuel Kant expanded on these ideas, proposing that imagination is not just limited to the representation of objects but also aesthetics, morality, and cognition.</p>

<p>Examining these historical theories reveals the complex and abstract nature of imagination, with ideas of mental visual imagery, and the impact it has on our experiences in life. The recognition of imagination taking place in our brains then sets the stage for exploring the concept from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. </p>
<h3>Neural networks and brain regions</h3>
<p>In 1980, Kosslyn introduced the 'quasi-pictorial' theory, suggesting that mental imagery involves imperfect representations, or 'quasi' pictures, constructed in a specific brain locus known as the "visual buffer." This theory highlights the overlap between the visual buffer and the brain's visual system, emphasising key brain structures like retinotopic maps and the occipital cortex. While these early investigations shed light on mental visual imagery, recent research also suggests alternative systems involved in imagination.</p>
<h4>Imagery neural system</h4>
<p>For instance, Agnati and colleagues (2013) distinguish between imagery and imagination, with the former using neural structures already engaged in established functions (e.g., the motor system) and the latter creating entirely new mental images from the "inner world." Their theory suggests the tinkering of existing perceptual information to form imaginative ideas, utilising existing functional modules within the brain. These functional modules are suggested to reorganise and reassemble themselves in a variety of ways to result in the creation of new mental ideas, which are also being shaped by our inner world. The default mode network (DMN), a network active during passive rest, may also play a role in imagining future events. </p>

<p>They also dive into the possible involvement of mirror neurons in mental imagery and, therefore, imagination. When an animal observes another animal acting, mirror neurons activate to replicate that action in the brain as a form of mental visual imagery. Their involvement in imagination, however, is suggested by the fact that some are active even without sensory input. The authors suggest that the perceived motor activity is a new image created from the “inner world” of an animal, rendering the process more creative than just representing an image physically seen in the brain. Overall, imagination is proposed to be a more creative process of developing new ideas, while mental imagery is just a clear representation following perception.</p>
<h4>The Hippocampus, Episodic Memory, and the 'Imagination Network'</h4>
<p>In an fMRI study, Addis <em>et al.</em> (2007) discovered right hippocampal engagement in tasks related to "future event construction," indicating an overlap with systems engaged in episodic memory. Hassabis <em>et al.</em> (2007) further identified such brain regions using an fMRI paradigm when investigating the neural basis of episodic memory. Participants were asked to imagine made-up experiences, and the researchers determined which brain regions may be involved in the process of generating the scene and visualising the spatial context. They found activation across brain regions like the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex. From these findings, they suggest that scene construction makes use of processes seen in both episodic memory and imagination. They also suggest that more brain regions may also be recruited into this network to support processes like episodic memory.</p>
<h3>Imagination as Dreaming</h3>
<p>Imagination extends into different states of consciousness, particularly during sleep. When we are asleep, we often experience mental imagery and creativity in the form of dreams. Our dreams can include a mixture of past experiences and influences from our inner world to produce a unique story that we do not experience when we are awake. Vyshedskiy (2019) investigated the mechanism of imagination when dreaming, contrasting it to the mechanism of imagination when we are awake. He found that, when awake, the internal imagery in our minds is controlled by the lateral prefrontal cortex. He theorised that because this area is in charge of our executive control, the functions of reasoning and strategising can be used to pull together different memories into new combinations, forming our imagined stories.</p>

<p>When looking into the dreaming that occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, he found that the lateral prefrontal cortex was inactive while the posterior cortex was active. He suggested that if the usual executive control function was inactive during this time, then the novel combinations being formed in the posterior cortex would now be unexpected and ultimately different from the usual, allowing us to imagine in a way that is not possible when awake. He deemed dreaming to be a bottom-up mechanism and the imagination built by the lateral prefrontal cortex to be a top-down mechanism.</p>
<h4>Prefrontal synthesis</h4>
<p>In line with this, Vyshedskiy proposes top-down mechanisms of imagination involving the spatial combination of objects stored in memory. The Hebbian model of ‘neurons that fire together, wire together', also known as 'binding by synchrony,' is used to explain the creation of novel conscious perceptions. The Hebbian rule describes the perception of objects that we have previous knowledge of, but Vyshedskiy proposes that it can also apply to novel perception. </p>

<p>Neuronal ensembles that code the sensory components of objects exist in the posterior cortex of our brains and are active when we recall an object we have seen. Ensembles that encode each sensory component are activated in synchrony, allowing us to consciously perceive the full object. To produce novel objects in our imagination, he suggests that ensembles that do not relate to each other begin to fire in synchrony, building up a new conscious perception. When the synchronisation is driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex, this is named ‘pre-frontal synthesis.' When this process is driven from the back, however, this is now dreaming or hallucination. There is not much experimental evidence to directly support this theory, however. </p>

<p>Further ideas proposed include the existence of modifiers in our brains. When we recall an object we know, like a book, we can imagine that book in different colours. Vyshedskiy states that by doing this, we are modifying which neuronal ensembles are being activated for the simulation of the object. Furthermore, we can imagine something like a lamp with a missing bulb. In this way, we are now performing desynchronisation - the ensemble that encoded a specific component is no longer firing with the rest to produce the gap in our imagery.</p>
<h4>Bottom-Up Mechanisms of Imagination</h4>
<p>During REM sleep, communication between the neocortex and hippocampus is disrupted by high levels of acetylcholine. Vyshedskiy suggests that the waves specific to REM sleep lead to neuronal ensembles activating spontaneously, resulting in imagination. Dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area may also be involved in increasing or decreasing the intensity of our dreams at this stage. When the ensembles activate in synchrony, a whole and novel image is formed; if they activate asynchronously, separate objects are perceived. If ensembles that are completely different from each other activate in synchrony and by accident, then they will appear as a “novel hybrid object.” Through these suggested mechanisms, the number of hybrid and novel images that can be perceived during REM sleep is unlimited. Direct evidence, however, is needed to provide support for these theories.</p>
<h3>Imagination Beyond Memory and Visualisation</h3>
<p>Through these studies, we can begin to see the depth of imagination; however, the topics explored only cover it as a form of creating images in our minds. Is there a role beyond that? For example, it could help us empathise with and act kindly towards others, adding value to these situations. Referencing evidence of memory, imagination, and empathy interacting with each other, Gaesser (2013) aimed to promote research in the direction of looking at how imagination can influence empathy.</p>

<p>As we have previously discussed with future episodic memory, memory can play a role in imagining the future. This involves the use of already-stored memories being reassembled to form new imaginative situations. This ability may help simulate different versions of the future and test them out to help us plan our next actions by seeing how our behaviour might play out. If this is true, then imagination may have a role beyond just visualising objects and spatial memory; it may also have the adaptive function of helping us plan out the future and see the possible value of different behaviours.</p>

<p>Moreover, Gaesser examined work showing that participants whose minds simulated an experience repetitively in their minds were more likely to have these imagined experiences. The neural basis for these effects is not yet well established, but there is a suggested role for the precuneus.</p>
<h3>Conclusions and Future Directions</h3>
<p>Overall, imagination emerges as a multifaceted phenomenon, weaving through historical perspectives, early neuroscience theories, and contemporary research. From the distinctions between mental imagery and imagination to the exploration of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, the complexity of the topic becomes apparent. While hypotheses abound, direct research is essential to validate these theories and deepen our understanding of the neural basis of imagination. Understanding this is crucial - not only for unravelling the intricacies of memory but also for comprehending human behaviour and decision-making as we navigate the dynamic interplay between simulation and reality.</p>

                <p>The All of Us Research Program, whose mission is to &#8220;to accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care for all of us&#8221;, recently published a flagship paper in Nature on &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genomic Data in the All of Us Research Program</a>&#8220;. This is a review of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x/figures/2">Figure 2 from the paper</a> (referred to below as AoURFig2).</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The first U.S. Census that commenced on August 2, 1790 included a record of the race of individuals. It used three categories: &#8220;free whites&#8221;, &#8220;all other free persons&#8221;, and &#8220;slaves&#8221;. Since that time, racial categories as defined for the U.S. Census have been a recurring controversial topic, with <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/race/MREAD_1790_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">categories changing many times over the years</a>. The category &#8220;Mulatto&#8221;, which was introduced in 1850, shockingly remained in place until 1930. Mulatto, which comes from the Spanish word for mule (the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey), was used for multiracial individuals of African and European descent. In the most recent decennial census in 2020, the race categories used were determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and were &#8220;White&#8221;, &#8220;Black or African American&#8221;, &#8220;American Indian or Alaska Native&#8221;, &#8220;Asian&#8221;, &#8220;Native Hawaiian&#8221; or &#8220;Other Pacific Islander&#8221;, and a sixth category &#8220;Some Other Race&#8221; for people who do not identify with any of the aforementioned five races. Separately, the 2020 census included standards for ethnicity which were first introduced in 1977 as part of <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/populations/bridged-race/directive15.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMB Directive No. 15</a>. Two ethnicity categories were introduced: &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; and &#8220;Not Hispanic or Latino&#8221;. The OMB was specific that race and ethnicity are distinct concepts: an ethnically Hispanic or Latino person can be of any race.</p>

<p>While race and ethnicity are social constructs, ancestry is defined in terms of geography, genealogy, or genetics. The relationship between these three types of ancestry is complex, and can be nonintuitive. <a href="https://gcbias.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graham Coop</a> has a great series of blog posts illustrating the subtleties around the different types of ancestry. For example, in &#8220;<a href="https://gcbias.org/2013/11/11/how-does-your-number-of-genetic-ancestors-grow-back-over-time/">How many genetic ancestors do I have?</a>&#8221; he illustrates the distinction between the number of genetic vs. genealogical ancestors: </p>

<p>AoURFig2 utilizes the concept of genetic ancestry groups. These do not have a precise accepted definition, but analysis of how the term is used reveals that genetic ancestries labels such as &#8220;European&#8221; are based on genetic similarity between present day individuals. This is explained carefully and clearly in an important paper by Coop: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genetic similarity versus genetic ancestry groups in as sample descriptors in human genetics</a>.</p>



<p>In AoURFig2 the ancestry groups used are &#8220;African&#8221;, &#8220;East Asian&#8221;, &#8220;South Asian&#8221;, &#8220;West Asian&#8221;, &#8220;European&#8221; and &#8220;American&#8221;. In their Methods section, the authors claim these are based on labels used for the Human Genome Diversity Project, and 1000 Genomes, which specifically they explain in the methods are: African, East Asian, European, Middle Eastern, Latino/admixed American and South Asian (in the figure legend they have renamed &#8220;Latino/admixed American&#8221; as &#8220;American&#8221; and &#8220;Middle Eastern&#8221; as &#8220;West Asian&#8221;). For each of these labels, obtained via self identified race and ethnicity by participants in the 1000 genomes project, the authors collated their genetic data to obtain genetic ancestry groups. Inherent in these groupings is an assumption of homogeneity, which is of course not true, because the individuals may vary in their genetics and their self identified race and ethnicity may be based on genealogy or geography, which could be at odds with their genetic relatedness to other individuals in their artificially constructed &#8220;genetic ancestry group&#8221;.

<p>In summary, there are three notions crucial to understanding AoURFig2: race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry, each of which is distinct from the others. Individuals who self identify with a particular ethnicity, for example Hispanic or Latino, can self identify with any race. Individuals self identifying with a specific race, e.g. &#8220;Black or African American&#8221; can be genetically related to a different extent with the six groups of genetic ancestry, and a genetic ancestry group is neither a race nor an ethnicity, but rather a genetic average computed over a set of (mostly genetically similar but also somewhat arbitrarily defined) individuals. </p>



<p>AoURFig2 is shown below. In the following sections we discuss each of the panels in detail.</p>

<p><strong>The figure legend</strong></p>



<p>We begin with the figure legend, which lists Race, Ethnicity and Ancestry. Race and Ethnicity refer to the self identified race choices for participants (based on the OMB categories). Ancestry refers to the genetic ancestry groups discussed above. While these three concepts are distinct, the Ancestry colors are the same as some of the Race and Ethnicity colors:</p>

<p>This is problematic because the coloring suggests a 1-1 identification between certain races and ethnicities, and genetic ancestry groups. In reality, there is no such clear cut relationship, as shown in the admixture panels in AoURFig2 (more on this below). Ideally, the distinct nature of the concepts of race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry, would be represented by distinct color palettes. The authors may have been confused on this point, because in the paper they write &#8220;Of the participants with genomic data in All of Us, 45.92% self-identified as a non-European race or ethnicity.&#8221;&nbsp;This makes no sense, because none of the race categories are &#8220;European&#8221;, and &#8220;European&#8221; is also not an ethnicity category. Therefore &#8220;non-European&#8221; does not make sense as either a race or ethnicity category. The authors seem to have assumed that White = European as indicated by their color scheme, and therefore &#8220;non-European race&#8221; is non-&#8220;White&#8221;. But by that logic &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; = &#8220;American&#8221; would mean that &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; is not &#8220;European&#8221; which implies that &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; is not White, contradicting the specific definition of race and ethnicity categories by the OMB. An individual&#8217;s ethnic self identification is independent of their race self identification, and someone may self identify as White and Hispanic or Latino. Clearly the authors would benefit from reading <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the NASEM report on the use of population descriptors in genetics and genomics research</a> and the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/nih-style-guide/race-national-origin">NIH style guide on race and national origin</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The ancestry analysis</strong></p>



<p>Panel c) of AoURFig2 presents an ancestry analysis consisting of running a program called Rye on to assign, to each individual, a fraction of each of the genetic ancestry groups. The panel with its subfigures is shown below:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>There are several problems with this figure. First, it has no x- or y- axes. The caption describes it as showing &#8220;Proportion of genetic ancestry per individual in six distinct and coherent ancestry groups defined by Human Genome Diversity Project and 1000 Genomes samples&#8221; from which it can be inferred that each row in each panel corresponds to an individual, and the horizontal axis divides an interval (width of the plot) into proportions of the six ancestry groups. In principle the panels could be in the transpose, with columns corresponding to individuals, but a clue that this is not the case is, for example, the ancestry assignment for Black or African American individuals, presumably none of which turn out to have an assignment 100% to European. That&#8217;s just a guess though. It&#8217;s best to label axes.</p>



<p>A second problem with the figure is that the height of each panel is the same, thereby not reflecting the number of individuals of each self-reported race and ethnicity. For instance, there are only 237 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander individuals versus 125,843 Whites. The numbers are there, but the height of the panels suggest otherwise. Below is a bar plot showing the number of people self identifying with each race in the data used for panel c) of AoURFig2:<br></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The All of Us Research Program (henceforth referred to as All of Us) lists as a <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/about/diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</a> goal:&nbsp;&#8220;Health care is more effective when people from all backgrounds are part of health research.&nbsp;<em>All of Us</em>&nbsp;is committed to recruiting a diverse participant pool that includes members of groups that have been left out of research in the past.&#8221; That is an admirable goal, and while All of Us is to be commended on the relatively large number of self identifying Black or African American participants recruited in comparison to previous cohorts, it&#8217;s worth noting that in this analysis White still wins (by a lot).</p>



<p>A third problem with the figure is the placement of the &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; ethnicity in the middle of panels assigning ancestry groups to individuals by race. As discussed previously, self identification of ethnicity is orthogonal to race. There is therefore ambiguity in the figure, namely it is unclear whether some of the individuals represented in the Hispanic or Latino plot appear in other panels corresponding to race. The juxtaposition of an ethnicity category with race categories also muddles the distinction between the two.</p>



<p>The ancestry analysis is based on a program called <a href="https://github.com/healthdisparities/rye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rye</a>, which was published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/8/e44/7079633">Conley et al., 2023</a>. The point of Rye is runtime performance: unlike previous tools, the software scales to UK Biobank sized projects. Indeed, it&#8217;s runtime performance is impressive when compared to the standard in the field, the program <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1655.short">ADMIXTURE</a>:</p>

<p>However, while Rye is faster than ADMIXTURE, its results differ considerably from those of ADMIXTURE, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5 of the paper:</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t benchmarked these programs myself, but geneticists have some experience with ADMIXTURE which was published in 2009 and has been cited more than 7,000 times. The Rye program, from two groups associated with All of Us, has been cited twice (both times by the authors of Rye who are members of the All of Us consortium; one of the two citations is the paper being discussed here). Of course, one shouldn&#8217;t judge the quality of a paper by the number of citations. A paper cited twice could be describing a method superior to a paper cited more than 7,000 times. But I was discomfited by the repeated appearance of a p-value = 0 in the paper (see below for one example among many). It reminded me of <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/pondering-p-values-for-breakfast/">pondering p-values before breakfast</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="923" data-attachment-id="15048" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/all-of-us-failed/image-13-2/" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png" data-orig-size="1300,1172" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-13" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=490" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-15048" srcset="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=1024 1024w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=150 150w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=300 300w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png?w=768 768w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Also R<sup>2</sup> is the wrong measure here. The correct assessment is to examine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_correlation_coefficient">concordance correlation coefficient</a>. Finally, and importantly, the Rye paper describes results based on inference not with the high-dimensional datatypes but rather a projection to the first 20 principal components. Notably the All of Us paper, and in particular the results reported in AoURFig2, use 16 principal components. There is no justification provided for the use of 16 principal components, no description of how results may differ when using 20 principal components, nor is there a general analysis describing robustness of results to this parameter.</p>



<p>In any case, setting aside feelings of being left Rye and dry and taking the admixture results at face value, it is evident that individuals self reporting ethnicity as &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; are highly admixed between European and American (the latter label meaning Latino/Admixed American). This stands in contrast to the coloring scheme chosen, with Hispanic or Latino colored purely &#8220;American&#8221; implying individuals self identifying with that ethnicity are not European. It also is at odds with the UMAP displays in panels a) and b) of AoURFig2.</p>



<p><strong>UMAP nonsense</strong></p>



<p>The AoURFig2 presents two UMAP figures, shown below. The UMAP is the same in both figures; in the top subplot (a) it is colored by race, and in the bottom subplot (b) it is colored by ethnicity.</p>

<p>The first thing to note about this plot is that it has axes when it shouldn&#8217;t. There is no meaning to UMAP 1 and UMAP 2, and the tick marks (-20, -10, 0, 10, 20) on the y axis and (-10, 0, 10, 20) on the x-axis are meaningless because UMAP arbitrarily distorts distances. Somehow the authors managed to put axes on plots which shouldn&#8217;t have them, and omitted axes on plots that should. Furthermore, by virtue of plotting points by color resulting in an overlay of one color over another, it&#8217;s difficult to see mixture of colors where it exists. <a href="https://x.com/lpachter/status/1692310130229166172?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This can be very misleading</a> as to the nature of the data.</p>



<p>More concerning than the axes (which really just show that the authors don&#8217;t understand UMAP), are the plots themselves. The UMAP transform distorts distances, and in particular, as a result of this distortion, is terrible at representing admixture. The following illustrative example was constructed by <a href="https://x.com/SashaGusevPosts/status/1760156864229122428?s=20">Sasha Gusev</a>: </p>

<p>But one doesn&#8217;t have to examine simulations to see the issue. This problem is evident in panel c) of AoURFig2. Consider, for example, the Hispanic or Latino ancestry assignments shown below: </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The admixture stands in start contrast to the UMAP in b), which suggests that the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is almost completely disjoint from European (which the authors identify with White via the color scheme). This shows that UMAP can and does collapse admixed individuals onto populations, while creating a hallucination of separation where it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>I recently published a paper with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tara-chari-6387722a8/">Tara Char</a>i on UMAP titled &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011288">The specious art of single-cell genomics</a>&#8220;. It methodically examines UMAP and shows that the transform distorts distances, local structure (via different definitions), and global structure (again via several definitions). There is no theory associated to the UMAP method. No guarantees of performance of any kind. No understanding of what it is doing, or why. Our paper is one of several demonstrating these shortcomings of the UMAP heuristic (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471223002090">Wang, Sontag and Lauffenberger, 2023</a>). It is therefore unclear to me why the All of Us consortium chose to use UMAP, especially considering that they (in particular one of the authors of Rye and a member of the All of Us consortium) were <a href="https://x.com/lpachter/status/1632829539310260226?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned of the shortcomings of UMAP a year ago</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Scientific racism</strong></p>



<p>The misuse of the concepts of race, ethnicity and genetic ancestry, and the misrepresentation of genetic data to create a false narrative, is a serious matter. I say this because such misrepresentations have been linked to terror. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Buffalo_shooting">Buffalo terrorist</a> who murdered 10 black people in a racist rampage in 2022 wrote that </p>

<p>This plot is eerily similar to one made by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/20/new-york-times-signs-contract-writer-razib-khan-then-dumps-him/">Razib Khan</a>, in which he used the term &#8220;Quadroon-Jews&#8221; (Khan&#8217;s figure was <a href="https://www.unz.com/gnxp/how-ashkenazi-jewish-are-you/">published in the Unz Review</a>, which is a website published by far-right activist and holocaust denier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Unz">Ron Unz</a>).

<p>These plots show the projection of genotypes to two dimensions via principal component analysis (PCA), a procedure that unlike UMAP provides an image that is interpretable. The two-dimensional PCA projections maximize the retained variance in the data. However PCA, and its associated interpretability, is not a panacea. While theory provides an understanding of the PCA projection, and therefore <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the limitations of interpretability of the projection</a>, the potential for misuse makes it imperative to include with such plots the rationale for showing them, and appropriate caveats. One of the main reasons not to use UMAP is that it is impossible to explain what the heuristic transform achieves and what it doesn&#8217;t, since there is no understanding of the properties of the transform, only empirical evidence that it can and does routinely fail to achieve what it claims to do.</p>



<p>The pseudoscientific belief that humans can be genetically separated into distinct racial groups is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism">scientific racism</a>. Such pseudoscience, and its spawn of racist policy, has roots in many places, but it must be acknowledged that some of them are in academia. A few years ago I wrote about the <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/">depravity</a> of <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/the-perfect-human-is-puerto-rican/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Watson&#8217;s scientific racism</a>, but while his (scientific) racism has been publicly documented due to his fame, scientific racism is omnipresent and frequently overlooked. The ideas that the Buffalo terrorist and that Watson promulgated are reinforced by sloppy use of terms such as &#8220;race&#8221; and &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; in academia, along with misrepresentations of the genetic similarity between individuals. Many of the concepts in population genetics today are problematic. Coop&#8217;s eloquent critique of genetic ancestry groups is but one example. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/223/3/iyad002/7006477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The concept of admixture is also rooted in racism and relies on unscientific notions of purity</a>. With this in mind, I believe it is insufficient to merely relegate AoURFig2 to <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Broman&#8217;s list of worst graphs</a>. The numerous implications of AoURFig2, among them the authors&#8217; claim that individuals identifying ethnically as Hispanic or Latino are genetically not European and therefore not racially White (see section on ancestry analysis above for an explanation of why this is incorrect), are scientific racism. The All of Us authors should therefore immediately post a correction to AoURFig2 that includes a clarification of its purpose, and corrections to the text so the paper properly utilizes terms such as race, ethnicity and ancestry. All of us need to work harder to sharpen the rigor in human genetics, and to develop sound ways to interpret and represent genetic data.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgment</strong></p>

<p>For the past 14 years, a cardiac surgeon in Italy has been trying to blow the whistle on a study written by his former colleagues that has been the subject of several investigations – with two of them finding problems with the data. And despite defeating three defamation lawsuits, two&nbsp; which were brought by authors of the paper, he&#8217;s not giving up yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2006 paper, <a href="https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(06)00308-4/fulltext">‘Relationship between atrial histopathology and atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery’</a>, written by several of cardiac surgeon Vittorio Mantovani’s colleagues at the Ospedale di Circolo in Varese, was published in the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery</em>. To date, the paper – which has been cited 57 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – has been investigated by at least two institutions as well as the journal. None have resulted in a retraction, despite one university finding that only a little more than half of the patients in the dataset could be matched unambiguously with biopsy samples. One university is also waiting on the journal to act before it considers reopening its own investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Mantovani, the red flags started appearing in 2010, when he came across a minor discrepancy between two other papers written by him and his colleagues. He thought it was odd that in one dataset, patients were identified by name, but in the other, they were identified using numbers. </p>



<span id="more-128817"></span>



<p>Mantovani asked Giuseppe Cozzi, an author of the 2006 paper and first author of both of the other papers, for a list of the patients’ names. He received no reply, and Cozzi has not responded to our request for comment on this story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantovani says Cozzi not answering a “simple question” led to him losing confidence in his colleagues and their published work. He made efforts to have the 2006 paper investigated by the institutions involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings of the first institutional investigation into the paper came from Umeå University in 2012 – where lead author of the paper, Giovanni Mariscalco, had completed the study as part of his PhD thesis. Their report, written in Swedish and Italian, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Umea-Investigation.pdf">found several inconsistencies in the dataset</a>, but ultimately concluded that there were no reasons to suspect scientific dishonesty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things had taken a turn for the worse in the Varese hospital once Mantovani voiced his skepticism of his colleagues’ published work. In a complaint to police,<strong> </strong>he accused his colleagues of workplace harassment. They were cleared of the charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantovani was also sued for defamation by two of the paper’s authors — Mariscalco and Andrea Sala, plus a third from Cesare Beghi, the head of cardiac surgery at Varese hospital. He won <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20230715-assoluzione-vs-Beghi.pdf">all</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassazione-Sala.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassazione-Mariscalco.pdf">cases</a>. Beghi has not responded to requests for comment, and Sala could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Being honest is expensive,” Mantovani said. “But what is the alternative?”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Part of Umeå’s investigation relied on the hospital in Varese verifying the authenticity of the data. In response to questions from the university, Cesare Beghi, the head of cardiac surgery at the hospital, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Beghi-Letters.pdf">wrote two letters verifying that the data was accurate</a>, and effectively put an end to the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the police involvement in the previous allegations at the hospital, they had been wiretapping conversations among the staff.<strong> </strong>Police wiretaps from November 2012 – which the University of Insubria would later include in an appendix to an investigation report – revealed that the letters Beghi wrote were drafted with Mariscalco, the lead author of the 2006 paper and one of the subjects of Umeå’s inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in September 2017, the University of Insubria – the home institution for several of the paper’s authors – published the results of its own investigation into the paper. It found that the paper was not randomized as it had claimed, that only 41 patients out of the 70 could be matched unambiguously with each biopsy slide, and that eight patients were enrolled before the approval of the ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uv94fM8ks8U3IjvTnrdi3S6JUOqjnp1U/view?usp=sharing">final report</a> of the investigation, Mariscalco told the investigators he had requested the folders with the collected data from the hospital, but the folders were found empty. Sala, one of the coauthors, told the committee that the patients were not randomized to protect their health. The report concluded that the committee had “doubts as to the collection of the data and the complete correctness of the research analysis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Mariscalco wrote that he was neither the principal investigator nor the one responsible for data histological storage, documentation or analysis. “I must point out that the overarching evidence around the study and its conclusions have never been questioned by the several investigations that have taken place,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He adds: “Despite some discrepancy across different datasets have been raised, these were largely anticipated in view of the temporal gap (more than 15 years) between the period when the study was conducted and the time when the clarifications were requested.”</p>



<p>In October 2017, Insubria sent the translated copy of its findings to Umeå University and then-editor of the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,</em> Richard D. Weisel, who declined to comment for this story. The journal has not taken any visible action on the paper.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Umeå University revisited the issue in 2018 and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Begaranomprovning-FS2.7.2-10-18.pdf">according to a letter (in Swedish)</a> written by the University’s legal representative, Chatarina Larson, and Patrik Danielson, the dean of the faculty of medicine, they decided not to act on the findings of Insubria’s investigation. They wrote that if the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery </em>took action against the article, Umeå University would have reason to review the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Larson explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…in Swedish Administrative Law (1985:223) (today Swedish Administrative Law (2017:900)); A Swedish authority may change a decision it has pronounced if it is incorrect. But regardless of such incorrectness it is not allowed to change such a decision if the decision by its nature is favorable to any individual party. In such case it must not be changed to that individual´s disadvantage, unless the inaccuracy is due to the party having provided incorrect or misleading information…</p>



<p>Umeå University is an administrative authority of the state of Sweden and obliged to comply with Swedish law. According to the clause of the Swedish Administrative law referred to above Umeå University was not allowed to reconsider the matter from 2012 unless its former decision was found to be incorrect &#8211; and if so &#8211; the incorrect decision was based upon incorrect or misleading information deliberately provided by the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Umeå University’s decision from 2012 was a decision by its nature favorable to the party concern. The Italian report did not draw any conclusions in the matter of whether the data inconsistencies were intentional or negligent. Thus, there were no circumstances that showed that Umeå University&#8217;s decision in that regard was incorrect.</p>



<p>In other words there was no legal possibilities, or obligations, for the university to reconsider its earlier decision in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Danielson, Umeå University contacted the journal to ask whether they would take action based on the findings of the investigation and received no response. Mantovani himself has contacted the journal several times to follow up on whether they would be taking action on the paper, and says he has received no reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, the current editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, </em>G. Alexander Patterson, wrote that he hadn’t been aware of the issue until our email in January and consulted the previous editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said that the journal’s ethics committee did an internal investigation “with appropriate due diligence”, and decided not to retract. “I understand that the matter was also before the Italian courts,” he wrote. “We are not aware of their deliberations or decisions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no indication of the internal or external investigations into the paper on the journal’s website. “Maybe they have a good reason not to retract the paper or not to put a notice of warning,” Mantovani says. “The rest of the scientific world should know that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his response to our questions, Mariscalco wrote that the paper had been subject to several investigations, including a UK investigation he declined to share, which “cleared me from any allegations, including research misconduct.” He then threatened to sue if we published a story about this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given those evidence, and given the long list of attacks around the same matters I have been subjected over the years, I will consider harassment and defamation any article that reports these incredibly old allegations without giving great relevance to the conclusions of all the following investigations that have cleared my name from any allegations/charges. Please be advised that I could pursue legal actions to the appropriate Authorities to protect my reputation, and this may include seeking damages for the harm caused.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Deepak Panday will talk about his paper &quot;CEPS: An Open Access MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Background: We developed CEPS as an open access MATLAB® GUI (graphical user interface) for
the analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS), and demonstrate
its use with an example data set that shows the effects of paced breathing (PB) on
variability of heart, pulse and respiration rates. CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to
be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography),
postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience
sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on
vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme
for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses
on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature,
together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over
those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently
included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-
processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding
dimension m and time delay τ (‘tau’) where required. The software is freely available
under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial
users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity
and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per
minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain
measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during
paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data
visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for
clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools. The aim is to
strengthen collaboration between clinicians and the biomedical community, as demonstrated
here by using CEPS to analyse various physiological responses to paced breathing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-trees-irreplaceable-habitats-mountain-pines">Ancient trees’ gnarled, twisted shapes provide irreplaceable habitats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s oldest, knotted and scarred pine trees are a boon for forest life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These old mountain pines (<em>Pinus uncinata</em>) offer food and shelter for lichens and insects not just because they’re old, but also <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317866121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of what’s allowed them to grow so old in the first place</a>, researchers report February 5 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.&nbsp;The findings highlight the broader importance of big, old trees, and suggest threats to their survival from development, fire or climate change could deliver irreparable harm in certain ecosystems.</p>



<p>Old growth trees <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-african-baobabs-are-dying-and-no-one-knows-why">continue to decline</a> around the world (<em>SN</em>: 6/18/18).&nbsp;In Europe, the remaining patches of forest with plentiful old trees constitute just 0.7 percent (or just under 3.5 million acres) of the continent’s forested area. This paper and others like it “are really good, because they show how important old growth is,” says Joseph Birch, an ecologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing who wasn’t involved with the research.&nbsp;This line of work serves as a reminder that we need to have a long-term perspective on old growth trees. “We need to be managing and conserving the forests that we have now, even if they&#8217;re younger, so that our descendants in a few hundred or even thousand years can have more old growth on the landscape,” Birch says.</p>

<p>While the pines’ old age, potentially hundreds of years old, was intriguing to plant physiologist Sergi Munné-Bosch and ecophysiologist Ot Pasques, both at the University of Barcelona, they have also been curious how aging and tree decay affect the broader forest ecosystem, with different life and decay stages providing differing habitat needs to plant, animal and lichen species.</p>



<p>Prior studies tended to look at how individual trees aged. So Munné-Bosch and Pasques decided up the ante. They studied young, adult and extremely old mountain pines in five different areas of the Spanish Pyrenees mountains. The duo calculated the trees’ ages based on tree trunk girth. (The two traits are correlated, eliminating the need to bore a sample out of the trunk to count tree rings). The team also weighed and measured needles, buds and shoots, analyzed the trees’ tissues for biochemicals linked to stress, decay and growth and noted age-related physical traits in the trees — such as exposed roots, fissured bark and lightning scars. Data on other species living in or on the trees were also recorded.</p>



<p>The results show that the oldest trees no longer spend a lot of energy on reproduction, ramping down the production of cones and buds, slowing their growth considerably and prioritizing stress tolerance and long-term durability. Ancient trees also allow parts of their bodies to die and decay alongside living sections. These are adaptations for staying alive hundreds of years, and they make the oldest trees knotted, scarred and full of large, dead sections, which are exploited by other forest life.</p>



<p>Ant colonies and plants like mountain houseleek (<em>Sempervivum montanum</em>) live in these dead and decaying sections. Trees with biochemical changes associated with decline and decay also tended to host more lichen, and the bigger, older trees had a higher diversity of lichen living on them. “Lichens look for very specific microhabitats for survival in high mountains,” Munné-Bosch says. Wolf lichen (<em>Letharia vulpina</em>), for instance, is rare in this part of Europe, and when the team encountered it, it was growing mostly on ancient pines.</p>

<p>Younger pines, which don’t have the unique physical and physiological features of ancient trees, can’t support forest life like ancient trees do. This makes ancient trees’ ecological role “irreplaceable,” Munné-Bosch says.</p>



<p>“For a lot of people who work with old trees, this is something that we intuitively knew. But it hadn’t necessarily been presented in this way and with such a compelling body of evidence to support it,” Birch says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results are only for a single tree species, he notes. In giant sequoias, which live thousands of years, aging doesn’t cause the tree to contort in shape as dramatically as the stunted mountain pines that grow at high elevations, so ancient sequoias’ influence on biodiversity might look different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Branching out to study other tree species is the team’s next step, Munné-Bosch says.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using CT scans and bone histology analysis, researchers examined the remains of three theropod species, suggesting new insights into the paleopathologies for non-tetanuran theropods.  Among the specimens studied, several anomalies were uncovered, including fused vertebrae indicative of congenital disorders and signs of inflammatory arthritis. In one specimen, a theropod exhibited irregular bone formation in its tibia, presenting a rare indication of disease in a weight-bearing bone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the exact causes of these ancient afflictions remain uncertain, the study provides a glimpse into the health challenges faced by theropods and offers valuable clues about their evolutionary adaptations. By improving our understanding of paleopathology and unravelling the secrets buried within fossilized remains, researchers continue to piece together the fascinating history of prehistoric life on Earth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Navigating the complex landscape of ethics in healthcare is no easy feat, especially when it comes to addressing the diverse moral perspectives over what ‘good care’ actually involves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although clinical ethics support (CES) instruments play an important role in aiding healthcare professionals and organisations, current tools fail to adequately address the complexities of moral pluralism and intersectional aspects of diversity and social justice issues. However, a recent study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> showcases the recently developed Diversity Compass, designed to address this gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Developed through participatory methods, the Diversity Compass offers a groundbreaking approach to navigating complex moral dilemmas in healthcare settings. By providing practical guidance tailored to the diverse needs of patients and stakeholders, this innovative instrument empowers healthcare professionals to make ethically sound decisions that respect the values and rights of all individuals. With the Diversity Compass at their disposal, healthcare teams can chart a course toward greater inclusivity, understanding, and ethical excellence in patient care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recognition of domestic violence experiences in men, young people, and children has long been overlooked, leaving a critical gap in support services. Whilst initiatives such as IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety) have made strides in addressing the needs of women experiencing domestic violence, there is a growing need to extend this support to other vulnerable populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IRIS+ is an intervention developed to specifically cater to the needs of men and children/young people experiencing domestic violence, without diminishing the support and responses of affected women. In a study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Primary Care</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers evaluate the feasibility of implementing the adapted IRIS+ intervention in England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The IRIS+ intervention includes several components, including clinical training for primary care teams, a direct referral pathway for patients to advocate editors, individualized advocacy support, and referral to specialized group programs. The results demonstrated the accessibility and feasibility of the IRIS+ intervention, marking a significant step forward in addressing domestic violence across diverse demographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the findings are promising, they also underscore the need for further research to explore the implementation of IRIS+ on a larger scale. By advocating for inclusive and tailored interventions like IRIS+, we can begin to  address the gap in domestic violence identification and support, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender or age, receive the care and assistance they need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The golden takin (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Burdorcas taxicolor bedfordi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) &#8211; a species native to the Qin Mountains of China &#8211; faces an uncertain future due to the profound impacts of human activity on its habitat. Human encroachment has led to extensive habitat fragmentation and the construction of roads, severely disrupting the natural landscape and threatening the survival of the species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Zoology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers utilized next-generation sequencing techniques on golden takin muscle samples collected across three geographical locations (Niubeliang, Zhouzhi, and Foping) in order to assess the population genetic diversity. The findings revealed inbreeding within the population and low levels of genetic diversity, largely attributed to the habitat fragmentation caused by human interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic diversity is crucial in order for species to adapt to changing environmental conditions and avoid the detrimental effects of inbreeding. With the environment continuing to evolve rapidly due to ongoing human activities, urgent conservation efforts are imperative to safeguard the future of the golden takin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research highlights the importance of implementing innovative conservation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation and bolster genetic diversity.  The authors propose several conservation initiatives, including the construction of ecological corridors to connect the existing meadow habitats, supporting genetic exchange with different populations. Implementing tourism management measures could also help to reduce the impact of human disturbance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By prioritizing these efforts, we can strive to ensure the long-term survival and resilience of this endangered species in its natural habitat.</span></p>

<p>When the American Society of Anesthesiologists last October announced the receipt of a $2.5 million donation from a drug company – “to advance education and innovation for our members”&nbsp; – the news could have been dismissed with a shrug. After all, such gifts from industry to medical societies are commonplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes this case noteworthy is that until the donation, the ASA and the drug maker, Pacira BioSciences, were better known as adversaries embroiled in a bitter lawsuit over <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00604-3/abstract">three articles</a> about the company’s flagship product the society had published in 2021 in its main scientific journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers, which questioned the effectiveness of Exparel, an anesthetic intended for the treatment of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and other procedures. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/14/drug-company-withdraws-court-motion-requesting-retraction-of-papers-critical-of-its-painkiller/">we reported in May 2021</a>, as part of a larger suit against the ASA, Pacira demanded in legal filings that the ASA and its journal, <em>Anesthesiology</em>, retract the papers, which it considered libelous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company didn’t hold that stance long, however. We wrote then:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128797"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The company asked the court for a preliminary injunction to retract two papers and an editorial about Exparel that Anesthesiology published in February. But on May 7,&nbsp; Pacira withdrew the motion, about a week after the ASA filed its own motion calling for a quick hearing on the merits of the company’s motion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also noted at the time ASA was taking a hard line against Pacira. The society said then:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Although Pacira started this lawsuit, ASA will not shy away from refuting Pacira’s claims and from exposing the important issues with Pacira’s controversial drug.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pacira may have backed down from its demands for retraction, but it didn’t quit the case – even after the the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCOURTS-njd-2_21-cv-09264">ruled in February 2022</a> the drug maker “fail[ed] to state a claim for trade libel against any defendant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacira appealed that decision. And lost again, in March 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Praising the appellate court’s ruling, the ASA issued a statement quoting its then-president, Michael Champeau:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This affirmation of the district court’s dismissal is an important victory for ASA as well as for the scientific process and free speech. … This decision makes clear that pharmaceutical companies are not free to intimidate the scientific process by filing meritless lawsuits.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What a difference seven months makes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023, the ASA posted a <a href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2023/10/asa-announces-new-industry-supporter-pacira-biosciences">press release</a> highlighting Pacira’s beneficence. The statement reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As an Industry Supporter, Pacira is helping to establish a strong, mutually beneficial relationship with the anesthesiology community, strengthen collaboration between physician anesthesiologists and industry, and add to the value the Society provides to patients and the public, while providing invaluable year-round support of ASA programs and priorities related to non-opioid alternatives and postsurgical care.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release does not mention the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Evan Kharasch, the top editor of <em>Anesthesiology</em> when the Exparel case began and a named defendant in Pacira’s initial suit, told us he had “no knowledge other than the ASA press releases” of the circumstances around Pacira’s donation to ASA and would not speak to its propriety. However, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m pleased and grateful that the ASA chose to defend the journal and the authors in this case.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kharasch, who wrote an article for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00604-3/abstract"><em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em></a> this month about the lawsuit’s implication for academic freedom, added the fact the company lost its suit “speaks to the fact that courtrooms are not the place to debate science.”&nbsp;<br />Pacira did not respond to a request for an interview. But a <a href="https://investor.pacira.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-society-anesthesiologists-announces-new-industry">joint press release</a> with ASA, dated Oct. 12, 2023, quotes Dave Stack, the CEO and board chair of the company, saying:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Pacira is pleased to support ASA and we look forward to collaborating in our efforts to improve patient outcomes through opioid-minimizing strategies. … Our organizations share a common interest in advancing education and innovation for the anesthesia community and the patients we serve. We believe that working together, Pacira and the ASA can effect significant change in the best interest of patients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release notes Pacira’s grant puts it in rarified company:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Launched in 2010, ASA’s Industry Supporter Program is limited to 10 organizations at any time. Participation is intended for companies who want to stand apart by showcasing high-level commitment to the education of physician anesthesiologists, the anesthesia care team and advancement of the specialty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ASA president Ronald L. Harter told Retraction Watch that “the grant is not related to the lawsuit, which concluded long before the grant was ever discussed.” &nbsp;(The lawsuit concluded at the end of March 2023. The grant was announced in October 2023.)</p>



<p>Harter continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have moved forward and are pleased with the grant from Pacira to advance the medical specialty of anesthesiology and the perioperative, pain medicine and critical care our members provide; facilitate best-in-class clinician education; and improve patient care.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Harter declined to say exactly how much the legal fees totaled, but said they “were substantially in excess of the grant amount. As noted, the two are unrelated.”</p>



<p>James Eisenach, an author of one of the Exparel papers and a named defendant in the Pacira suit, declined to comment on the donation. However, Eisenach praised ASA for paying for the legal defenses of himself and the other defendants, and called the outcome of the case: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>a resounding success for science. … I was really pleased; I think it’s precedent-setting.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But word of the donation has displeased some anesthesiologists, who did not want to be identified because of their connections with the ASA. One person familiar with Pacira’s gift called the payment “blood money,” adding: “I question the ethics” of the arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another leading anesthesiologist told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The larger academic community was appalled by the implications of the Pacira legal maneuvers that challenged academic freedom of journals and societies, not to mention individual authors.&nbsp; So the strong defense by ASA and the fact that ASA prevailed was a major win.&nbsp; I was not happy to see this current bit of news. If it had been up to me,&nbsp; I would have told them exactly where to deposit their donation!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Asked about these concerns, Harter said<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We recognize that it’s possible there are varying opinions across our membership of 57,000, but we believe that in general our members are looking forward to the progress that can be made through this support and understand the importance of working together with industry to achieve critical goals such as enhancing care and optimizing patient outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Cancer drugs by computer</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/searching-cancer-drugs-computer"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 23, 1974</p>



<p>Chemists often need to sort a large number of compounds according to whether or not they possess a given property.… [Researchers] have been working on a technique of getting computers to teach themselves how to solve such problems. The most recent experiments indicate that the technique [based on pattern recognition] may be useful in finding cancer drugs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Modern computers can do more than sift through known compounds. With advanced artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-crowdsources-data-speed-drug-discovery">computers are helping scientists</a> design novel molecules and predict how those compounds will react with proteins in the body, possibly leading to new cancer treatments (<em>SN: 10/18/18</em>). The technology is promising but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03172-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still in its early days</a>. Ultimately, most drug candidates will still falter in people, some scientists caution. In 2021, the international biotech company Exscientia launched the <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/exscientia-to-start-world-first-clinical-trials-of-ai-designed-immuno-oncology-drug/?cf-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trial of an AI-developed cancer drug</a>. But the company <a href="https://endpts.com/exscientia-ends-cancer-study-as-it-focuses-on-other-trials-of-ai-driven-drug-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelved the drug</a> in 2023 after it proved to be ineffective. Other AI cancer drugs are in various stages of testing.</p>

                <p><strong>Have you entered the New Year with renewed motivation and a spring in your step, or has the pressure to reflect and set goals completely overwhelmed you? Sara Zsadanyi shares her recommendations for taking another year of research in your stride. Maintain a healthy working environment, find a work-life balance, and remain productive and organised! </strong></p>

<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_0b00447bea1c4263b8405a846ab80067~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_800,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>Ah, the new year. A moment of excitement and passion. We’re all busy making resolutions, with a vision of a ‘New Me’ who, by December, is going to be running 10K every weekend, reading a book a week, publishing 5 articles in high-quality journals, and who somehow also has the time to juggle all of life’s responsibilities. But how many of us stop to think and reflect on the last year? In 2023, I heard about so many students experiencing burnout, PIs and professors who were considering whether the long slog to tenure was worth it, and I, myself, felt the pressure mount until I had to take a step back and re-evaluate whether sacrificing my own health was worth finishing my doctorate more quickly.</p>

<p>It's about time we give our resolutions an overhaul. We need to think about who we were last year, and whether the systems (or The System) are fostering a healthy, balanced approach to research. Here are some practical strategies to combat overwork, boost productivity, and foster a healthier mindset that you might want to think about.</p>
<h4>	1. Find Your Working Hours</h4><p>You’ve probably heard it before, but I’ll say it again: you are a person <em>before</em> you are a researcher. In this fast-paced world of research, it’s easy to get caught in the trap of working long hours and never fully switching off from your research ideas. </p>

<p>Establishing clear work hours, and sticking to them, can help create a healthier work-life balance. Make it a habit to switch off your computer at a set time each day, giving yourself the much-needed mental, and physical, break to recharge. This means, if you’ve said you’re going to switch off at 5PM, you’re not going to respond to your supervisor’s 10PM email, under any circumstances! Treat it <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/telework-and-the-french-right-to-disconnect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">,,<u>like the French do</u></a> - you have the right to disconnect!</p>

<p>Understanding your peak productivity hours is a crucial part of this. Identify the time of day when you're most focused and energetic, and make sure you use that time for your most important tasks. If you’re able to come in at ‘weird’ hours which align with your night-owl lifestyle, take advantage of it! If you don’t have that flexibility at work, try to identify hours within the 9-to-5 within which you can reserve menial tasks, like responding to emails, for the time when your brain is tired. Little tweaks to align your work with your natural rhythm will go a long way!</p>
<h4>	2. Take Regular Breaks</h4><p>A tired mind is not the optimal condition for productive and interesting work. Something else we need to normalise in our working environment is taking breaks, because, in reality, nobody can work for 4 hours straight on intense, information heavy work, like writing or data analysis. Schedule regular breaks to rest your eyes and let your mind wander; don’t just switch from the computer or bench to your phone! Make sure that you move away from your desk: grab a cup of tea or coffee and a workmate – so you can spread this good habit – and head outside to chat about anything, <em>anything, </em>but your work, for five minutes. Or go out for a ten-minute walk around the block with your favourite music playing, letting your brain chew on ideas subconsciously. When you come back, you should feel refreshed enough to tackle your research again, with fresh eyes. </p>
<h4>	3. Lead by Example </h4><p>Fostering a healthy working environment is the responsibility of all workers, at any stage. It is important to set the right example for others around us. This is especially true when those in earlier stages are first-generation students or researchers, as your lab may be their very first insight into research life. For example, if I come into the lab every weekend, or I work 10 hours per day, my master's students are going to pick up on this. I may not have bragged about my working hours, or said that I expect them to do the same, but because of the power imbalance and hierarchical nature of academia, they will feel an underlying pressure to impress you by replicating what you do. Also, ensure you call unhealthy working habits out; if you are leading a research group, and a postdoc is bragging about staying in until midnight in front of your masters students, be very clear that this is not something that you encourage within the lab.</p>
<h4>	4. Prioritise Openness and Honesty</h4><p>Embracing openness and honesty about the difficulties we face in academia helps us to get the help we need, and helps others to feel less alone. If we can establish a workplace culture where we discuss difficulties and support each other, this can make the research journey less daunting. Sometimes, simply sharing your experiences with others might help them to reconsider the way they approach their own work!</p>
<h4>	5. Break Projects Down into Smaller Tasks</h4><p>One major problem with the work we do in research is that many of our projects, whether they are papers, experiments, or theses, take months from start to finish. If you’ve ever had the experience of sitting in front of your blank page, wondering what to write or where to start, you know exactly how it feels to be at the beginning of a project wondering <em>how on earth</em> you’ll get to the end of it. That’s why we have to take these projects and break them down into many bite-sized pieces. </p>

<p>This can work on a macro and a micro level. For example, when starting a new project, write down all of the main steps you need to take, such as ‘Experiment 1’, ‘Data Analysis’ and ‘Write article to send to journal’. Within each of these main steps, there are bite-sized pieces, such as preparing materials for your experiment, or writing a limitations paragraph. As you begin a main step, jotting down the smallest possible steps within it might help you to see that this large project is more manageable if you can just get one or two tasks done every day.</p>

<p>The same can be said for viewing your whole year. Long-term goals can be exceptionally overwhelming, difficult to set, and many of us don’t check in with them throughout the year to ensure that we are on track. Think instead of 3-month goals, 1-month goals, or even weekly goals that align with your larger objectives. This will help you to monitor your progress more frequently, and it should feed into creating your bite-sized tasks.</p>
<h4>	6. Make a Daily Commitment</h4><p>The last, and most important, habit I’m bringing into this new year is a daily commitment. Now, this changes all the time. Right now, for example, I’m in a heavy writing phase, and so I have a daily commitment to myself that the first 30 minutes of my work day is focused writing time. Consistency is so important in research. We can get distracted, or be asked to re-prioritise to help with something else in the lab, and end up disconnecting from our own work for weeks at a time. We need to carve out a set amount of time in our day that cannot be interrupted by other tasks, whether that’s five minutes or two hours. A little bit of time each day on the tasks that move our research forward is far more productive than cramming all of our work into one week.</p>


<p>Implementing these strategies can pave the way for a healthier work environment, increased productivity, and a more positive outlook on your journey through research. As you embark on this new chapter, remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant transformations over time. And finally, remember that, just because the new year has come and gone, doesn’t mean that you can’t make positive changes to the way you work starting now.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-neutron-star-supernova-1987a-nasa">JWST spies hints of a neutron star left behind by supernova 1987A</a></h4>

              
                <p>Within the dusty cloud left behind by supernova 1987A, the most famous stellar explosion in modern history, astronomers have found compelling evidence for a long-sought neutron star.</p>



<p>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has spied <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj5796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indirect hints of a powerful source of X-rays</a> — likely some type of neutron star — coming from the core of the supernova remnant, researchers report February 22 in <em>Science</em>. The findings are part of a 37-year-old quest to determine what happened in the aftermath of the closest supernova in nearly 400 years and could provide insights into how a neutron star behaves mere decades after its birth.</p>



<p>“Supernova 1987A is truly a unique laboratory to study supernovas,” astronomer Patrick Kavanagh said February 17 in a news conference at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Denver. It’s “the gift that keeps on giving, with new observations continually yielding new discoveries,” said Kavanagh, of Maynooth University in Ireland.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1987, telescopes around the world <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">got a front-row seat</a> to a spectacular supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a companion galaxy to the Milky Way (<em>SN: 2/8/17</em>). Such explosions occur when a star at least eight times the mass of the sun dies. Located at the astronomically close distance of 160,000 light-years, supernova 1987A, as it came to be known, was visible with the naked eye in the night sky for months afterward. The energetic explosion generated tremendous amounts of neutrinos, a handful of which ended up in detectors on Earth. It was the first time such ghostly particles had been seen coming from beyond the solar system.</p>



<p>Since then, scientists have wondered whether the iron core of the blue supergiant star that led to 1987A collapsed into an ultradense neutron star or shrank all the way down to a black hole. The fact that neutrinos escaped the event favors the neutron star possibility, but whatever was left behind has yet to be spotted. That’s partly because the original star’s outer layers, now traveling away from the explosion at 10,000 kilometers per second, create a thick haze of dust that obscures the area.</p>



<p>Infrared light travels through dust more easily than other wavelengths. So the infrared eyes of the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, are well suited to peering into the cloud surrounding 1987A. With JWST, Kavanagh and his colleagues captured light containing signatures indicating the presence of argon and sulfur in the dusty central region. Tellingly, these elements had been ionized, meaning that some of their electrons had been stripped away.</p>



<p>“You need a source of high-energy [X-rays] in order to create these ions,” says coauthor Claes Fransson, an astronomer at Stockholm University. “The question is: ‘What is giving rise to this ionization?’”</p>



<p>The team believes there are two possibilities. Supernova 1987A could have left behind a pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star that generates powerful beams of radiation, much like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsars-cosmic-rays-high-energy-universe-particles-light">the one found in the much closer Crab Nebula</a>, the remnant of a nearly 1,000-year-old supernova (<em>SN: 5/23/22</em>). Alternatively, the X-rays could be coming from an ordinary neutron star, whose newborn surface would blaze at a million degrees Celsius.</p>



<p>“This is some of the strongest indirect evidence suggesting the presence of a neutron star,” says Aravind Pazhayath Ravi, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the work. While it’s not yet a direct detection, it <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab4b46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complements previous data</a> gathered by instruments such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, he says.</p>



<p>If researchers can directly capture light from the neutron star, they will be able to compare older neutron stars elsewhere in the cosmos to one seen shortly after its birth, giving astronomers insight into the interior structure of such exotic objects. For that, the clouds surrounding 1987A’s remnant will probably have to thin out a bit more, an event expected in roughly the next 10 years or so, Ravi says.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s eventually going to happen that we&#8217;ll have the photograph of the youngest ever observed neutron star,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-odysseus-moon-landing">The first U.S. lunar lander since 1972 touches down on the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a nail-biting descent, the United States took one small step back to the surface of the moon.</p>



<p>A spindly robotic lander named Odysseus — designed and built by a private U.S. company — touched down near the moon’s south pole at about 6:23 p.m. Eastern time. The probe, which is carrying six NASA payloads plus a few other odds and ends, is the first U.S. vehicle to perform a controlled descent to the lunar soil since<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/moonstruck"> Apollo 17</a> landed in 1972.</p>



<p>“I know this was a nail-biter but we are on the surface and we are transmitting and welcome to the moon,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said during a live NASA broadcast of the touchdown. &#8220;Houston, Odysseus has found its new home.”</p>



<p>Data collected after the touchdown suggests the lander ended up tipped on its side as it sat on the lunar surface with its solar arrays deployed and its battery charged to 100 percent, Altemus said during a NASA news conference February 23. The team believes the spacecraft might have caught some of its landing gear on the ground or possibly in a crevice, tipping the lander gently over, where it came to rest on a rock.</p>



<p>Houston-based private company Intuitive Machines is overseeing the mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on February 15. Odysseus’ destination was a flat region near the Malapert A crater, about 300 kilometers from the moon’s south pole. The spot is near one of several potential landing sites for future NASA astronauts.</p>



<p>Engineers had to deal with several unexpected problems during the landing attempt, most prominently the fact that the spacecraft’s laser range finder, part of its autonomous landing system, stopped functioning. Mission planners decided to stay in orbit for an extra two hours and then were able to use two backup lasers that were part of a NASA payload to complete the descent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What we can confirm without a doubt is that our equipment is on the moon and we are transmitting,” mission director Tim Crain, chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines said shortly after touchdown. Communication with the spacecraft was patchy, and it was unclear immediately what shape it was in. </p>



<p>Odysseus, which stands about 4 meters tall and 1.5 meters wide, is hauling a half dozen NASA instruments designed to demonstrate equipment for future landings and better understand the environment near the south pole in service of planned astronaut missions. The payloads will test precision landing technologies, try out a new way of knowing how much lander fuel is left, investigate the radio environment near the moon’s surface, and plop a set of retroreflectors on the ground that will serve as a permanent location marker.</p>



<p>Though NASA is the company’s main customer, the space agency’s instruments aren’t the only passengers. Payloads from several private companies and groups are along for the ride as well. They include a camera designed by students and faculty at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. The camera was to be jettisoned from the lander about 30 meters above the surface to capture the first images of a lunar touchdown from outside the incoming spacecraft. And Odysseus is delivering the first art installation on the moon: A cube of 125 miniature sculptures that commemorate human curiosity.</p>



<p>“We couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled,” says Steve Durst, director of the International Lunar Observatory, a private company based in Kamuela, Hawaii, that sent a small telescope as one of the payloads on Odysseus. The telescope, named ILO-X, expects to take scientific images of the Milky Way from the lunar surface that will be used by researchers to study our galaxy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sculptural art installation was on a panel on the lander that is facing toward the ground. But most of the payloads are on the sides of the lander that are facing up, the team said, and the instruments appear to be operational and able to send information back to Earth. Because of the difficulties in landing, though, the Embry-Riddle–built camera wasn’t deployed during the descent as planned. Engineers are still hopeful that they’ll be able to fire it away from the spacecraft and take images at a later date.</p>



<p>The Intuitive Machines venture is part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, wherein the agency hires companies to scout the moon in support of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china"> the Artemis lunar program</a> (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>). Under Artemis, NASA aims to reestablish a human presence on the moon, with the first crewed landing no earlier than late 2026.</p>



<p>It’s been more than 50 years since astronaut Eugene Cernan left the last U.S. footprints on the moon. In recent years,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-chandrayaan-moon-landing"> a string of robotic landing attempts have been made</a> by private companies and countries alike, though most failed (<em>SN: 8/23/23</em>). The landing by Odysseus today has moved the United States closer to its next giant leap in space exploration.</p>



<p>“Today, for the first time in more than a half century, the U.S. has returned to the moon,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson during the NASA broadcast. “Today is a day that shows the power and promise of NASA&#8217;s commercial partnerships. Congratulations to everyone involved in this great and daring quest.”</p>



<p>Intuitive Machines expects that the lander will remain operational for another nine to 10 days before the region that it’s in passes into the cold lunar night, which lasts two weeks. Odysseus is solar-powered and won’t be able to charge its batteries enough to keep the spacecraft warm for that long. Most of the vehicle’s electronics will have a hard time with the plunging temperatures and aren’t expected to survive, though engineers will check once Odysseus is back in daylight.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re gonna bring a tear to my eye,” Crain said when asked about the prospect of Odysseus&#8217; demise during the Feb. 23 NASA briefing. But he was also jubilant when reflecting about his team’s accomplishments. </p>



<p>“To look at the moon every night now and know that we have new hardware there that we had a hand in building, it really was a magical, magical day,” he said.</p>

<p>A paper that led to hopes that Microsoft might one day build a quantum computer has “shortcomings” that do not rise to the level of misconduct, according to an expert panel convened by the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav3392">paper</a>, originally published in March 2020 in <em>Science</em>, earned an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/29/science-majorana-paper-earns-an-expression-of-concern/">expression of concern in 2021</a> following critiques of the work from two researchers, Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik. This week, <em>Science</em> editor in chief Holden Thorp replaced the expression of concern with an editor’s note referring to a new report from a panel of experts at the University of Copenhagen, saying&nbsp; “we are alerting readers to this report while we await a formal decision on the matter from the Danish Committee on Research Misconduct.”</p>



<p>The panel’<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10647080">s report</a>, dated Feb. 15, 2024, describes several of what it calls “shortcomings” but says “the excluded data did not undermine the paper’s main conclusions.” They also conclude the authors did not engage in “gross negligence” or scientific misconduct.</p>



<p>The last author of the <em>Science</em> paper, Charles Marcus, of the University of Washington, in Seattle, and the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, told Retraction Watch he and his colleagues followed the recommendations by posting: </p>



<span id="more-128791"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>a statement as a note added, elaborating on experimental details and additional data sets that previously did not pass the selection criteria. We have followed these recommendations and uploaded the documents to the Zenodo repository (<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10676715">https://zenodo.org/records/10676715</a>, which can also be accessed as Ref. [81] in the original paper. A summary of that note added is this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zb0mzsfvlgriuxq2rqlin/Cover-Letter.pdf?rlkey=or5humdmt5zkr8am0cm2n7sgx&amp;dl=0">MEMO</a>, which includes a summary of key points. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marcus, who along with his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Exhibit-12-Letter-of-3-December-2023-from-attorney-Kjeldsen-to-PC.pdf">hired an attorney</a> to respond to the Practice Committee, which had commissioned the expert report, also said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We hope that the Science editors will also accept the recommendations of the [expert panel].</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Marcus whether he agreed with the report’s statement that &#8220;the authors should have been more forthright and explicit with readers and with referees in describing their success rate in fabricating devices that showed simple tunneling characteristics and had MZM behavior and, by flagging alternatives and uncertainties, more evenhanded in their discussion of interpretations.” He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The quote you mention is not part of the conclusions. It was part of a longer commentary and taken out of context.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Frolov and Mourik told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are pleased that Science forced the University of Copenhagen to conduct a more extensive investigation into this Microsoft/University of Copenhagen paper than the Niels Bohr Institute previously did <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/29/science-majorana-paper-earns-an-expression-of-concern/">when it resoundingly exonerated the authors</a>. As we predicted, the new committee found more data from many more devices than the Niels Bohr Department Chair admitted existed in his inquiry, none in our view replicating the claimed Majorana discovery.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, despite these unambiguous findings, the new committee (three of the four members of which had what we regard as conflicts of interest in the case) did not find the courage to recommend retraction, instead making the argument that everyone inflates their work to get into Science. It is unfortunate to see such cynicism and it is not fair to the editors who were told this was a big breakthrough. In our assessment, the claims in this paper amount to falsification and have been thoroughly debunked not only through our analysis, through separate publications in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05382-w">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abf1513">Science</a>, but through the analysis in this new report as well. We stand by the original criticism we <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/6344447">posted on Zenodo in 2022</a> that the authors’ additional data not shown in the paper disproves their claim of a Majorana signal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next up: The University of Copenhagen’s Practice Committee has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PC-Letter-21-Dec-2023.pdf">notified</a> the Danish Committee on Research Misconduct (DCRM) that it intends to decide on the case “on its own, unless the DCRM decides to call in the case for decision as a matter of research misconduct.”</p>



<p>A <em>Nature </em>paper on the same subject – sometimes referred to as a ‘Majorana’ particle – was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/08/authors-retract-nature-majorana-paper-apologize-for-insufficient-scientific-rigour/">retracted in 2021</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2024/02/22/women-in-mathematics-a-case-study/">Women in mathematics – a case study</a></h4>

              
                <p>The following describes harassment experienced by a woman who is a professor of mathematics, whose words I&#8217;m posting here (anonymously and with names changed) with her permission. </p>



<p>=============</p>



<p>In November 2023, I visited a Mathematics Department at a respected research university in the USA at the invitation of a professor (I will be calling him Zacharia) who works there. We initially met at a conference where we were both invited as plenary speakers by my former colleague and collaborator Mung. Zacharia appeared to be very interested in my talk and to share my research interests. However, the visit turned out to be uncomfortable and ultimately unproductive from a scientific or networking standpoint.</p>



<p>During my visit, I persistently felt like a prey&nbsp;that is&nbsp;being pursued.&nbsp;In my detailed account below, I write about the insistence from my host, the continuous balancing on confrontation at the risk of displeasing him, the tension and the going against my wishes when I clearly and repeatedly indicated that all I wanted was to discuss&nbsp;mathematics.</p>



<p>Following the visit, feeling disheartened and upset, I reached out to Mung for moral support. We had previously discussed the situation of women in mathematics,&nbsp;and I hoped to share my recent experience as a concrete example.&nbsp;His answer and lack of support was not what I expected. It&nbsp;was particularly surprising to me given our history of collaboration and what I thought was a friendship.</p>



<p>Below, I include the email I sent to Mung as well as his response. I believe this exchange sheds light on the realities that women in mathematics face, despite the ubiquitous rhetoric of support for diversity in the STEM fields, the need to combat bias, to raise awareness, to address harassment, maintain professional atmosphere, etc. etc.</p>



<p>This was not the first time I found myself in such a situation, and it always left me feeling drained and disheartened, and questioning whether I should leave academia. When I was younger I blamed myself and agonized if there might have been anything in me that prompted the unwanted behavior: maybe I smile too much, maybe I am too enthusiastic, maybe I should not wear a skirt (and I only wear the below the knee skirts). But now I am older and I know that it was not my fault at all. Still, despite my secure professional position, the aftermath of the visit left me drained and depressed. As I wrote to Mung, the visit basically incapacitated me for three days after my return. And, the lack of support from him, whom I considered a friend, doubled the distress.</p>



<p><strong>I wish to make this correspondence public so that other women who have similar experiences know that they are not alone and that it is not just “their fault”.</strong></p>



<p>For my own protection, I have edited out or changed personal details such as names, university names, and specific fields of mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong>&nbsp;Me<br><strong>Sent:</strong>&nbsp;Monday, November 2023 10:18 PM<br><strong>To:</strong>&nbsp;Prof Mung</p>



<p>Dear Mung,</p>



<p>I hope you are doing well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to give you an account of my visit to Zacharia in the University of Pella last week. This is going to be a long email. In the past, we talked about my situation, also in the general context of women in mathematics, so my account below is meant as a quite concrete example of what I was trying to explain to you before.</p>



<p>Best wishes,</p>



<p>Anna</p>



<p>========</p>



<p>On November 9-10 I visited the math department of the University of Pella to give a seminar, by the invitation of Zacharia. The visit was so awful that if I could have foreseen even a part of it, I wouldn’t have accepted to come. Let me start by saying that I was really looking forward to that visit. I thought that Pella is a great department with many very good [field of math] experts whom I was hoping to meet. I cancelled my two classes in [my university], revamped my talk slides, and did some preliminary calculations about a possible approach to [a concrete research project] hoping to discuss and try to establish a collaboration with Zacharia. I also looked through Zacharia&#8217;s published papers which convinced me that he is an expert on [a particular topic related to that project].</p>



<p>On Wednesday, I took an evening flight and arrived to Pella at approx 8:30pm. In our prior email exchanges, Zacharia insisted on picking me up from the airport. I was arriving late, and it is a 40min drive one way, so I wrote him that I am perfectly comfortable with taking a taxi to my hotel and then we meet in his office the next morning. But he really insisted. So, I thought that he is just friendly and polite and agreed. But after he picked me up, the weirdness begun: he told me that we go and visit places then at night &#8211; he brought me to a sightseeing spot to look at some lake, drove to show me “nice houses” around, then downtown to see “interesting architecture”. It was completely dark and cold and past midnight in my time zone. He made me leave the car each time and walk with him despite I was repeatedly saying that all I wanted is just to go to my hotel and retire for the night. He completely disregarded my requests and was set on “entertaining me” in a pushy way, claiming that I am “young” and for sure not “this much tired” and that he knows that I will love the view, and that it is just for “a moment” etc. Well, each “moment” was another 30 minutes. He almost brought me to a fancy-looking restaurant “just to eat a little” but then I protested strongly and he dropped it. Along the way he kept telling me how many plans he has for us for these coming two days, including taking a boat ride, hiking (he will bring me the hiking shoes), going to restaurants with a panoramic view and downtown and “just wherever I want”. I said that all I want is to discuss math, to which he playfully replied that we may discuss and exchange ideas while doing all these other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we arrived at the hotel it was past 11pm. I did not feel comfortable that he definitely leaned to see my room number, but I did not want to be confrontational as I have just arrived and he is my host and colleague and I really want to discuss math with him. We said goodbye and agreed to meet in the hotel lobby the next day at 10am; I suggested that I come directly to his office but again he didn’t want that.</p>



<p>Thursday was my talk day. Before I describe the day, let me anticipate that the audience at my talk turned out to be minimal: Zacharia, one other faculty (not in my field of maths), two random grad students and one undergraduate. Nobody followed&nbsp;what I was talking about, or showed any interest so it felt like lecturing to a wall. Earlier, when I asked Zacharia about my itinerary and whom I am meeting during my visit, his answer was “you can do whatever you want”. So I checked the seminar list for that day and found one other talk which looked interesting. Zacharia clearly tried to discourage me from attending it because “we have to go to a restaurant downtown”.</p>



<p>In the morning that day I basically forced Zacharia to talk math and I presented my calculations regarding the [project I envisioned] on the board, explained the angle of approach and asked if he was interested in working on this together. He seemed surprised and sort of teased me that “I work too much”. He said “yes of course we will write a paper together” and we talked, but without depth or interest on his side, just superficial and general. We then went for lunch &#8211; he again wanted to drive somewhere but I convinced him that we just go to a cafeteria on campus. During that lunch I felt uncomfortable because all he wanted to talk about was gossips about other mathematicians, listing names of people and asking “who is good” and “who is not good” in my opinion, and what is my connection with them.</p>



<p>After my talk he refused to talk math again,&nbsp;&nbsp;as he wanted to take me out to dinner. We drove to some restaurant and he said we wait there 1.5 hrs to be seated, so we can &#8220;spend time together&#8221;. I refused&nbsp;and pushed him that we eat in my hotel’s restaurant. At that time it already started weighing heavily on me that I had to fight with him all the time because otherwise who knows where he will be bringing me and at what time. At the dinner, consistently with what I felt before, he was just gathering information about me: bombarding me with questions about my family, and if I have friends and who they are (he asked me to show him a photo of a girl friend of mine on my phone, out of the blue), and if I really “love” shopping or hiking or sleeping, what kind of movies make me “excited” and so on. He kept calling me “poor Anna”, touching my arm repeatedly etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was miserable because of my talk, and all this pushing and insisting and essentially no math. To add to the injury, after the dinner he wanted to walk me to my hotel room, on the basis that he is interested to see it because he did not know if they had a microwave for guests. He even took the elevator with me to my floor but at that point I asserted myself and just said good night. He again insisted that he comes to pick me up the following morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Friday he was late for our meeting in the hotel lobby. When he arrived, he asked “what are we doing and where are we driving that day”. He was displeased when I told him that I wanted to go to the office. He teased me as before that “all he sees in me is just work” to which I then very clearly replied that indeed this is a professional visit and that I am busy with many things, so in as much as I am happy to discuss math with him, in case he prefers to do something else then this is completely fine with me and I will just go to the office or stay at the hotel and work on my own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We went to his office but that day “discussion” went bad. He was like upset and uninterested, spoke with a raised voice. I also felt he was condescending to me and attacking in mathematics, not listening to what I had to say, cutting me all the time and asking random and irrelevant questions &#8211; he has no clue about [a particular technique that I know well] but acted as if he knew it. I was patiently answering for some longer time but then asked if I please could show him the calculations that I prepared. Then it was bad &#8211; at some point he yelled at me that “if you just do calculations extending other people’s results then when nobody comes to your talk then don’t complain and take it”. What?? He also said some other things implying that he has quite low opinion on everything I am working on (though I am sure that he has no clue what it is). It was unpleasant and insulting. Still, to clear the air, I agreed to go to lunch and again all he wanted to talk about was what I think about other mathematicians and do I know this or that person.</p>



<p>After lunch I stayed in my office for one hour as I had an&nbsp;online meeting. Then he came for me and I managed to show him some calculations on the board; I felt that he sort of “gave up” and was just staring at me, without being involved. Finally, he said that surely I must be tired because it is quite late so let’s go to dinner &#8211; it was 5pm then and I remembered how he had no problem dragging me around at 10pm two days before, no question about my tiredness then. Since I was worried that again we will drive who knows where, during my online meeting I checked that there was a restaurant 10 min from my hotel. I told Zacharia that I really wanted to go there and I called and made a reservation myself.</p>



<p>Dinner was homeomorphic to lunches and the dinner before. Afterwards he wanted to go for a walk around the restaurant and I really had no force to fight with him so we went, including looking at shops and buying things in the supermarket. He wanted to bring me to the airport the following morning but I firmly refused and said I will take Uber. He finally did not fight with me on that.</p>



<p>Overall, I hated every minute of my visit. It was utmost unprofessional and disrespectful to me as a mathematician. I was thinking to confront Zacharia and suggest that in the future he hires an escort service instead of being cheap and using the departmental money to bring himself a companion on the pretense of inviting her to give a talk. In the effect, that visit made me so depressed that I was unable to do anything for three days after my return to [my university]. The last time when I felt that way was while visiting [another mathematician] &#8211; the insistence, the constant balancing on confrontation at the risk of displeasing my host, the dragging me in his car to places he chose, on account of “me going to love them” when I clearly indicated that I don&#8217;t. Only that [that person] was brilliant and happy to talk math all the time. He also respected me as a mathematician and when I told him a theorem while driving in his car, or walking or in a restaurant, he would listen attentively, make smart comments, ask questions and give me literature tips. He would also introduce me to people and bring them to my talk.</p>



<p>My visit with Zacharia on the other hand, was a complete waste of time from every angle.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you shared your experience with me but will not make any comments. I treasure my friendship with you and also with Zacharia. Both of you are my collaborators whom I admire profoundly, and in a small group of people I can call friends at both the personal and professional levels.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Author: </strong>Anne G&auml;rtner is a postdoctoral researcher in personality psychology at the TUD <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en">Dresden University of Technology.</a> She is principal investigator in the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 940 (&ldquo;Volition and Cognitive Control&rdquo;) and representative for junior scientists in the Executive Committee of the German Psychological Society (DGPs). She received her PhD in 2019 at the TUD Dresden University of Technology. In her research, she uses neuroimaging and neurobiological methods to improve our understanding on how people perceive and regulate emotions. Furthermore, her work aims to enhance transparency, credibility, and reproducibility of psychological science by studying how to reform research assessment towards quality evaluation.</p>

<p>In recent years, a consensus emerged in the scientific community that evaluating scientific performance solely based on quantitative indicators (such as number of publications, number of first authorships, <em>h</em>-index, journal impact factors) is inadequate. The shift towards prioritizing research quality, transparency, robustness, and reproducibility is evident in initiatives like the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a>) and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (<a href="https://coara.eu/">CoARA</a>).</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, hiring and promotion procedures at universities as well as funding decisions still heavily favor easily measurable quantitative indicators over assessing scientific work&rsquo;s quality. A survey within the German Psychological Society highlights the disproportionate emphasis on publication numbers and funding, neglecting crucial quality criteria (Abele-Brehm &amp; B&uuml;hner, 2016).</p>



<p>Relying solely on quantity in assessing scientific performance is problematic due to its questionable validity (Brembs et al., 2013; Dougherty &amp; Horne, 2022; Kepes et al., 2022; Opthof, 1997). For example, research has shown that the correlation between journal rank (as measured via journal impact factors) and the methodological quality of papers published in a journal is low or even negative (Brembs, 2018). Moreover, academia is a competitive work environment, and incentives in hiring and promotion processes can influence individuals to prioritize prolific publishing over crucial aspects like research transparency and leadership skills. These incentive systems can have undesirable effects on the entire science system, especially without effective mechanisms for quality control and self-correction (Vazire &amp; Holcombe, 2022).</p>



<p><a href="https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/ifap/differentielle-psychologie/die-professur/Mitarbeiter/dipl-psych-anne-gaertner">Dr. Anne G&auml;rtner</a>, psychologist and neuroscientist at Dresden University of Technology, aims to shift hiring and promotion procedures from a focus on research quantity to a robust consideration of research quality. She was awarded the <a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/award-winners-finalists">2023 Early Career Award by the Einstein Foundation Berlin</a> and advocates for incentivizing quality in research through the Responsible Research Assessment Initiative. She plans to establish criteria incorporating qualitative aspects such as integrity, transparency, robustness, and methodological rigor using a scoring system (G&auml;rtner et al., 2022; Sch&ouml;nbrodt et al., 2022). For example: Are all research data and materials documented in FAIR format and open accessible? Are statistical analyses accompanied by comprehensible meta-data and code that is publicly available? Can the research be replicated and independently verified? Was the research pre-registered and the methodology disclosed before publication? Do formulated theories adhere to the principles of formal logic?</p>



<p>Collaborating since 2020, the initiative published their proposal in several articles and received more than 40 commentaries from the academic community in response. Since then, the endeavor has turned into a community-driven effort, with multiple bottom-up working groups to work on field-specific expansion sets. The next goal of the initiative is to conduct interviews with experts and various stakeholders to refine the criteria and foster the way to their application in appointment procedures. Furthermore, the initiative is currently developing an online tool that integrates qualitative assessment with the responsible use of quantitative indicators to support hiring and promotion committees (see <a href="https://nicebread.github.io/RESQUE/">here</a> for more information).</p>



<p>While the focus lies currently on research output assessment, Anne G&auml;rtner&rsquo;s long-term vision is to develop a more comprehensive set of metrics that also covers the remaining types of academic contributions commonly evaluated in hiring and promotion procedures: teaching quality, leadership skills, academic governance, and social impact. The shift away from metrics of publication quantity in hiring and promotion procedures could ultimately become a blueprint for the entire academic system and, for example, be transferred to the distribution of research funding, scholarships, and awards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Prioritizing quality in research requires a fundamental change in the incentives of the academic system.&rdquo;</em></p><cite>Anne G&auml;rtner, Postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet?set_language=en">Faculty of Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en">Dresden University of Technology</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There is a dilemma faced by young scientists to either stick to the old system and publish as many papers as possible &ndash; or invest time and effort in producing high-quality research, which in turn negatively impacts the quantity, and thus, the career. Anne G&auml;rtner hopes the project fosters a future where increased publication signifies more high-quality and valuable research.</p>



<p><em>&ldquo;I hope that our project contributes to a future where we&rsquo;ll see not just more research being published every year, but more high-quality and high-value research.&rdquo;</em>, says Anne G&auml;rtner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/syphilis-surging-united-states">The United States was on course to eliminate syphilis. Now it’s surging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Once on the path to eliminating syphilis, the United States has reversed course, with cases of the infectious disease surging.</p>



<p>From a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/archive/2004SurveillanceAll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low of under 32,000 cases in 2000</a>, the number of people with syphilis has rocketed to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/infographic-html.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 207,000 in 2022</a>, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in January. That’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/tables/20.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62 cases per 100,000 people</a>.</p>



<p>The crisis is hitting pregnant people and babies especially hard. The maternal rate for syphilis during pregnancy rose from 87 per 100,000 births in 2016 to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db496.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">280 per 100,000 births in 2022</a>, the CDC reported on February 13. Without treatment, pregnant people can pass a syphilis infection to the fetus. That can cause congenital syphilis and lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, severe health problems after birth or the infant’s death. More than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,700 babies were born with syphilis</a> in 2022, roughly ten times the number in 2012.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="#syphilis_info" data-type="internal" data-id="#syphilis_info">More information: The stages, testing and treatment of syphilis</a></h5>
</div>



<p>Testing is a crucial step in finding cases. Syphilis is “the great pretender,” says Allison Agwu, a pediatric and adult infectious disease clinician and researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “It can look like a bunch of other things.” The disease moves through several stages, at times featuring symptoms common to other conditions and at other times having no symptoms.</p>



<p>People can get tested — usually with a blood test — by their primary care provider or at a public health clinic or an urgent care facility, for example. With syphilis rates so high, Agwu would like to see testing for syphilis destigmatized and become easier to discuss as part of a regular medical checkup. “If you have been sexually active ever, you should have a syphilis test,” she says.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Agwu about the surge in cases and what needs to be done better to prevent syphilis. The interview was edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What are some of the factors behind the rise in syphilis cases in the United States?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agwu</strong>: It’s multifactorial. Syphilis is oftentimes asymptomatic, so people can have it for years and not know they have it — they missed the signs when it was symptomatic. We have a whole <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9890672/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health infrastructure imploding</a> with decreased access and funding. The impact is magnified in communities that have the least access to begin with and that are relying on those clinics or places that funding is being pulled from. There is stigma. There have been medicine shortages.</p>



<p>The infrastructure [built] to control syphilis — almost eliminating the disease a few decades ago — has really collapsed. We’re at this perfect storm for increases in syphilis and, as a result, congenital syphilis as well.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Where are there missed opportunities in testing for syphilis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agwu</strong>: I’ve been in the infectious disease field for a long time. We’ve had the 80-year woman who comes in and she’s confused or disoriented. That’s neurosyphilis [a complication of syphilis that impacts the brain and nervous system], from never being treated for a syphilis infection. We all should be thinking about syphilis, particularly with the rates that we’re seeing. Healthcare providers should just test people.</p>



<p>There’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing in early pregnancy</a>. If someone is diagnosed with syphilis, they should be treated in pregnancy. This is one of the times you absolutely need to treat them to avert transmission to the baby. I think part of the challenge with syphilis in pregnancy — actually, all sexually transmitted infections in pregnancy — is that oftentimes there are people that society thinks of as sexual beings and those that we do not. I’ve talked to pregnant women who say, well I got my testing, but there was not a conversation about how I can stay negative. So the counseling around staying negative, I think we may miss that.</p>



<p>We certainly have had scenarios where the baby comes, and the mom or the birthing parent has had no prenatal care. [In that case] we’re testing at delivery.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rising maternal syphilis rates</h3>



<p>The maternal syphilis rate, the number of live births to women with syphilis per 100,000 live births, increased for all groups from 2016 to 2022. The biggest jump — 783 percent — occurred among American Indian and Alaska Native women giving birth.</p>

	>
	</iframe></div>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What needs to happen to bring syphilis cases back down?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agwu</strong>: It’s education, and not in a way to scare people, but just: This is what you can have and the different ways you can get it, and here’s how you can test for it, here’s where you can test for it.</p>



<p>We need to normalize sexuality and sexual exploration and not vilify it. We need to destigmatize the diagnosis so people are more likely to then tell their partners, so their partners can also get tested and treated. Instead of having someone prove that they need to have additional testing, how about we just test people —  instead of creating a stigma around, well do you need to get tested again. Acknowledging that people are sexual beings, even when they’re pregnant.</p>



<p>COVID-19 really highlighted the problems we were having with our public health infrastructure. We need to think about how we can effectively provide sexual health care and give testing, prevention, treatment all in a way that is packaged in a positive light. Take it out of the dark.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="syphilis_info">The stages, testing and treatment of syphilis</h3>



<p>Syphilis — caused by the bacteria <em>Treponema pallidum</em> — is described in terms of stages.</p>



<p>In the first stage, the only sign is one or several sores at the site a person was infected, such as on the penis, around the vagina, in the anus or mouth. The sores are usually painless and remain for three to six weeks. During the second stage, people can have a rash, headaches, fever, muscle aches or fatigue.</p>



<p>Once those symptoms pass, a person can be asymptomatic for years. But some people progress to a fourth, potentially fatal stage, which damages many organs, including the brain, nerves and heart.</p>



<p>The guideline for <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/syphilis-infection-nonpregnant-adults-adolescents-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asymptomatic adolescents and adults</a> is to test those who have been sexually active and are at increased risk, which includes people who have an HIV infection or other sexually transmitted infections and men who have sex with men. The recommendation for <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/syphilis-infection-in-pregnancy-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pregnant people is to test for syphilis as early</a> as possible, ideally during their first prenatal visit.</p>



<p>Syphilis is treated with a shot of a special formulation of penicillin. There has been a shortage of the drug, which is the only effective treatment during pregnancy. Nonpregnant people can also take the oral antibiotic doxycycline for treatment.</p>

Conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia stand as major contributors to disability and mortality in affluent and under-resourced nations alike. Currently affecting over 55 million individuals, their prevalence is expected increase significantly by 2050—especially in less developed countries, where risk factors are most impactful and mainstream clinical approaches least developed.</p><h2><strong>Language research in the fight against neurodegeneration</strong></h2><p>Against this background, researchers from various fields are searching for new, affordable, and scalable digital innovations to facilitate diagnosis and other clinical tasks across the globe. Speech and language assessments have emerged as crucial tools, offering robust insights for detecting, characterizing, and monitoring these diseases. For instance, individuals with Alzheimer’s often struggle with word retrieval, experience difficulties in constructing grammatically complex sentences, and exhibit challenges in understanding or expressing figurative language. These linguistic deficits appear in early and preclinical disease stages, differentiate Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, allow predicting the onset of core symptoms, and even capture brain anomalies that typify the disorder.</p><p>These clinical applications can be boosted through artificial intelligence tools. New digital technologies allow capturing specific alterations in recorded or written language samples in a non-invasive, patient-friendly, and cost-effective way. Such is the type of solution required to reduce clinical disparities across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Multicentric research initiatives, large grants from leading funding agencies, and science-based companies are spearheading exciting projects to validate and expand this novel framework. However, a critical challenge looms large: the lack of linguistic diversity in the field threatens its scalability and undermines its potential for more equitable testing worldwide.</p><h2><strong>Disorders of language vs. disorders of languages</strong></h2><p>The field is marked with inequities. Less than 0.5% of the world’s 7,000 languages have received any attention in this research field. Also, although English is spoken by roughly 17% of the world’s population, it accounts for nearly 70% of all published studies on speech and language in neurodegeneration. Moreover, large language models and feature extraction tools are available for only a handful of languages. Of course, none of this would be a major issue if links between language anomalies and brain dysfunctions were universal across the world’s languages—if that were the case, we could rely on the abundant findings from English and apply them to patients worldwide, irrespective of their language. Unfortunately, the reality is much more complicated.</p><p>As it happens, cross-linguistic differences deeply influence the presentation of speech and language symptoms, challenging the universality of existing diagnostic criteria and candidate disease markers. For instance, a sentence production study showed that Italian-speaking persons with Alzheimer’s could be identified by their tendency to omit subjects, a phenomenon notably absent in their English-speaking counterparts. The distinction lies in the inherent structure of the languages. Unlike English, Italian allows deducing sentence subjects from verb conjugations (the Italian verb &#8216;camminiamo&#8217; inherently implies a first-person plural subject, whereas the English verb &#8216;walk&#8217; requires a preceding &#8216;we&#8217; to convey the same meaning). More strikingly, linguistic anomalies may be diametrically opposed between languages. For example, research on Alzheimer’s shows that different pronouns (words like ‘I’, ‘their’, ‘ours’) tend to be overused among English-speaking patients and underused in Bengali-speaking patients—relative to healthy speakers of the same languages. This, too, likely reflects differences between both languages, as Bengali grammar includes many more (and morphologically more complex) pronouns than English. Succinctly, the linguistic markers that may signal a given disease among speakers of one language may not be relevant among speakers of another language.</p><h2><strong>Taking action</strong></h2><p>These findings underscore the need to consider language diversity when examining the linguistic impact of neurodegenerative conditions. Such is the call we raised in our recent article in <em>Brain </em>(García et al., 2023). Researchers must broaden the representation of languages, incorporating diverse linguistic communities to identify shared and distinguishing properties. Multicentric collaborations, harmonized protocols, and cross-linguistic tools must be forged for a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of neurodegeneration across regions and cultures. The path forward requires overcoming core challenges, such as establishing robust pipelines for comparing outcomes across languages, disentangling linguistic and non-linguistic sources of heterogeneity, and securing funds for language research across underrepresented regions. Ideally, local-global connections should be prioritized to integrate country-specific needs and resources with leading worldwide trends.</p><p>Promisingly, strategic efforts are being made in this direction. Consider, for example, the International Network for Cross-Linguistic Research on Brain Health (Include). Supported with initial funds from the Global Brain Health Institute, the Alzheimer’s Association, and the Alzheimer’s Society, Include aims to foster trans-regionally equitable approaches to language-based neurodegeneration research. The network has grown continually since its launch in November 2022. It now has over 140 members spanning 80 centers sites across 30 countries. Five network-wide projects are being run, targeting diverse phenomena across multiple languages in large cohorts of persons with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and frontotemporal dementia variants. Include is also leading awareness-raising actions, such as the Language Diversity and Brain Health webinar series, hosted in collaboration with the Bilingualism, Languages, and Literacy Special Interest Group of the Alzheimer’s Association’s Diversity and Disparities Professional Interest Area. Initiatives like these can make a difference towards fairer language-based research on brain dysfunctions.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>Speech and language assessments hold a valuable key to unlocking generalizable insights on neurodegeneration. To harness their full potential, however, we must bridge the linguistic gap in research, embracing more diverse samples and more inclusive practices. These actions are vital to ensure that valuable tools for equitable brain health assessments do not turn into a new source of global inequity.</p><p><sub><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.canva.com/p/studioroman/">Studioroman</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEMQNK-MhM-senior-man-patient-complaining-on-headache-to-young-positive-woman-doctor/">Canva</a>.</em></sub></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/871944884/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/871944884/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f02%2fGarcia-blog-post-feature-image--480x185.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/871944884/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/a-four-forked-etymology-curfew/">A four-forked etymology: curfew</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/indian-summer-and-other-curious-idioms/">&#8220;Indian summer&#8221; and other curious idioms</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/intractable-words/">Intractable words</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>A paper on green innovation that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/05/no-data-no-problem-undisclosed-tinkering-in-excel-behind-economics-paper/">drew sharp rebuke</a> for using questionable and undisclosed methods to replace missing data will be retracted, its publisher told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Previous work by one of the authors, a professor of economics in Sweden, is also facing scrutiny, according to another publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported earlier this month, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a> of Jönköping University mended a dataset full of gaps by liberally applying Excel’s autofill function and copying data between countries – operations other experts described as “horrendous” and “beyond concern.”</p>



<p>Heshmati and his coauthor, Mike Tsionas, a professor of economics at Lancaster University in the UK who<a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news/article/mike-tsionas"> died recently</a>, made no mention of missing data or how they dealt with them in their 2023 article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">Green innovations and patents in OECD countries</a>.” Instead, the paper gave the impression of a complete dataset. One economist argued in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/21/how-not-to-deal-with-missing-data-an-economists-take-on-a-controversial-study/">guest post</a> on our site that there was “no justification” for such lack of disclosure.</p>



<span id="more-128786"></span>



<p>Elsevier, in whose <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em> the study appeared, moved quickly on the new information. A spokesperson for the publisher told us yesterday: “We have investigated the paper and can confirm that it will be retracted.”</p>



<p>We first contacted Heshmati after a PhD student tipped us off about his dubious research practices. The student had obtained Heshmati’s dataset, which, along with email correspondence between the professor and the student, revealed how Heshmati had approached the numerous missing observations in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we presented Heshmati with the criticism leveled against him, the researcher stood by his methods, but said they should have been “acknowledged and explained.” He had missed doing so “unintentionally in the writing stage of the paper,” he said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">It’s a mistake Heshmati has made twice, it turns out. In 2020, he and two colleagues published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-020-01986-1">a paper</a> in <em>Empirical Economics</em>, a Springer Nature title, that bore strong resemblance to the 2023 article and relied on the same patched-up dataset. The article mentioned neither the data gaps nor the Excel operations.</p>



<p>The 2020 paper, “Green innovations and patenting renewable energy technologies,” has been cited 23 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. We are now looking into the matter carefully following an established procedure and in line with best-practice COPE guidance. We would be happy to provide an update when we have completed our investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we reached out to Heshmati about the 2020 paper, he told us he used the same data as in the later article, but with some “differences in the way the variables are defined and transformed.” As such, he said, the description of the data was similar between the two papers:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The first paper is cited in the second paper. Journal of Cleaner Production has strict control of similarity rate and decline [sic] papers with high rate of similarity regardless of their authors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heshmati also said he was “disappointed” by Retraction Watch’s “approach and clearly implied false accusations”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As you well know, I was open to supporting [the PhD student who contacted Heshmati], after exchanging some e-mail [I] sent him a zoom link and had a long zoom meeting with him explaining the reason of imputation of missing observations and their benefits and harms. I shared the data with him where all imputed points are highlighted in yellow color to allow future replacement. I have been all the way open, honest, and willing to share information without fear of negative publicity. I still believe that I did right and would use the technique again on same data but with deleting years and countries with high frequency of missing values and produce sensitivity analysis of the result with full and restricted sample.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://economics.emory.edu/people/faculty/biography/maasoumi-esfandiar.html">Esfandiar Maasoumi</a>, a professor of economics at Emory University in Atlanta and first author of the 2020 paper, said he believed Heshmati to be “honest and reliable,” but denied involvement in and knowledge of the data imputation. He told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I take data accuracy and transparency very seriously. I did not have any hand in data and code/implementation parts of the paper, and relied on my coauthors for these components. I regard my coauthor, Dr. Heshmati, as very honest and reliable and well informed. I would reject any implication that he has intentionally done anything improper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Maasoumi also characterized Retraction Watch’s coverage of Heshmati’s research as “sensational” and “rather uninformed” and said we jumped to conclusions about intentions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The criticism of lack of reporting should be placed on both authors and journals that do not allow or accommodate full descriptions of work in scarce journal pages. I noted that Dr. Heshmati had willingly, and openly engaged with [the PhD student who approached Heshmati about the missing data] and completely cooperated with him/her. This is clear indication of his good and honest intentions. Personally, my experience with other authors for the last 50 years is that it is next to impossible to get data, code, and meaningful correspondence with authors of papers, published or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He elaborated, quoting experts we spoke with:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any reader of your work here, and generally, would note that the central, key message, is &#8221; dishonesty&#8221;, or &#8221; cheating&#8221; as you put it and imply it very strongly. Given that those implications are categorically false, will you write a retraction, a correction, and contact the same sources immediately?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heshmati did hand over his data to the PhD student, if grudgingly.</p>



<p>“I have the excel data file but do not distribute it as I may update and use it again in research,” Heshmati wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch. “Now I have teaching and a busy schedule, but if your intension [sic] is to learn I may show you the file.”</p>



<p>The student vowed not to share the spreadsheet with others – a promise he later broke after realizing just how appalling Heshmati’s methods were. So much of the data had been filled in by Heshmati it felt to the student like “fabrication” warranting a retraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sekazi-mtingwa-physics-accelerator-service">Physicist Sekazi Mtingwa considers himself an apostle of science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask physicist Sekazi Mtingwa how he ended up where he is today, and he’ll start with his grandmother’s deeply religious home. Growing up there in Atlanta, young Mtingwa somehow got the idea that he was the second coming of Christ.</p>



<p>“I believed that for years,” Mtingwa recalls with a laugh. That only changed after a Sunday school lesson as a schoolboy. It was about Jesus sacrificing himself for murderers and thieves. “I looked around the room, and all these bad boys in my class, I couldn&#8217;t give my life for any of them&nbsp;— let alone murderers,” he says.</p>



<p>That was it for the Jesus plan, Mtingwa says. But his desire to serve humankind never waned. Today, says Mtingwa, who remains religious, “I like to think of myself as an apostle of science.”</p>



<p>Apostle of science gets close to the essence of Mtingwa’s career. Over the decades, he’s had many professional titles. As an accelerator and particle physicist, Mtingwa is nationally recognized for his work building accelerators and for developing the theory of how particles scatter when they’re squeezed into high-energy beams. But he’s also a nuclear policy expert, mentor, administrator, activist and founder of dozens of organizations in the United States and abroad dedicated to creating new opportunities in science for people who have been historically kept at its margins.</p>



<p>“People&#8217;s everyday lives are impacted and improved by his efforts,” says Robbin Chapman, one of Mtingwa’s mentees who is now associate dean for diversity, inclusion and belonging at Harvard Kennedy School. That impact is expansive, says Chapman, “whether it&#8217;s the actual research, whether it&#8217;s the teaching or whether it’s the networks he&#8217;s bringing together across countries and continents.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new theory and a new name</h2>



<p>Born in 1949, Mtingwa attended segregated schools in Georgia. Back then, he had a different name —&nbsp;Michael Von Sawyer. Other kids teased him for the name, he says, calling him a “mad German scientist.” Having given up on being Jesus, Mtingwa says, “I had to look for another career.” All that jeering got him thinking it might be science.</p>

<p>Mtingwa devoured books about science at the local library and concocted a project that won him first place in botany at Georgia’s state science fair. It was the first year that the contest was racially integrated. His science fair prize included a box of science books. A few were on general relativity. And with that, his interest in physics ignited.</p>



<p>As an undergraduate at MIT, Mtingwa studied physics and mathematics and learned to channel his ambition to serve others into activism. It was the “turbulent 1960s,” Mtingwa says, and the campus zeitgeist crackled with the energy of the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam War protests. He got involved in student groups advocating for racial equity, was a founding member of MIT’s Black Students’ Union, and, along with other students, he participated in <a href="https://medium.com/bamit-review/reflections-of-an-mit-student-activist-a52c72406f36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a takeover of a faculty lounge</a>.</p>



<p>“That really drove into me the need to serve,” he says. “But I always had this philosophy that you can’t serve until you first take care of yourself — better yourself, get your education, establish your career.” After that, he believes, one can start to reach out to help individual people and, eventually, build systems that go beyond individuals to the world.</p>



<p>After MIT, Mtingwa earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University working on high-energy particle physics. It was during that time that Mtingwa, a Pan-Africanist, chose his name with the help of a fellow graduate student from Tanzania. Shortly after graduating, he joined other Black physicists&nbsp;to found the <a href="https://nsbp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Society of Black Physicists</a> in 1977. He’d met several of his cofounders at MIT, which he describes as having been a kind of hub for Black physicists.</p>



<p>But Mtingwa says his academic career nearly ended just a few years later. After two postdocs, he struggled to find a job even as his white colleagues seemed to float up the academic ladder. A Ford Fellowship he received in 1980 saved him, he says, sending him to <a href="https://www.fnal.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fermilab</a>, a leading particle physics laboratory in Batavia, Ill., for a year.</p>

<p>That year snowballed into seven, during which he and theoretical physicist James Bjorken <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/140304/files/p115.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed the theory of intrabeam scattering</a> — which describes how charged particles spread out when packed together into high-energy beams. In particle accelerators, which create high-energy beams and often use them to smash particles together or into other targets, this spreading can hurt performance if it’s not properly accounted for. The theory Mtingwa helped develop has been put to work in the design of particle accelerators across the world, from small synchrotrons used to generate intense light for chemistry and biology experiments to the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Hadron Collider</a> at CERN, near Geneva.</p>



<p>“Any accelerator physicist knows about the Bjorken-Mtingwa theory,” says accelerator physicist Mark Palmer of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y. “This has had a very, very deep impact on broad portions of the scientific endeavors that depend on accelerator performance with very-high-energy beams.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Opening science to others</h2>



<p>Mtingwa continued his work on the theoretical physics of particle accelerators. But he also started to build them.</p>



<p>At Fermilab, he helped design systems for producing and collecting antiprotons — the antimatter counterpart to protons — so they could be accelerated into beams. Colliding streams of protons and antiprotons in Fermilab’s Tevatron accelerator ultimately revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/last-evidence-top-quark">the existence of the top quark</a>, a fundamental particle. Not only is the top quark an essential piece of the standard model of particle physics, but its large mass is also useful for testing the model.</p>

<p>And at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argonne National Laboratory</a> in Illinois, Mtingwa worked out the <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pfb/article-abstract/2/6/1376/941835/Demonstration-of-electron-beam-self-focusing-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theoretical underpinnings of plasma wakefield accelerators</a> — a type of particle accelerator that speeds up particles using pulsing waves of plasma, which Argonne scientists experimentally demonstrated for the first time in 1988.</p>



<p>In 1991, after years working at some of the top national laboratories, Mtingwa made a decision that he says baffled his colleagues: He became a professor at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, a historically Black university that, back then, didn’t have a graduate program in physics at all.</p>



<p>“I had at Fermilab and at Argonne worked with students — high school and college — for the summer. And I had gotten interested in surrounding myself with the young, African American students to try to be able to make a difference,” Mtingwa says.</p>



<p>Mtingwa had taken care of himself. Now, he wanted to start taking care of others.</p>



<p>At North Carolina A&amp;T, Mtingwa established a master’s program in physics and laid the groundwork for new Ph.D. programs. Over his many years teaching at North Carolina A&amp;T, Morgan State University, Harvard and his alma mater MIT, he mentored countless people, including Chapman — who now mentors students herself.</p>



<p>“He really captured what I realized is the essence of supporting anyone, but particularly scholars of color as they are moving through their academic careers,” she says. Rather than seeing life and work as separate things, Mtingwa taught Chapman to see them as part of one ecosystem of excellence. “He&#8217;s a systems thinker,” she says, with a keen eye for how people fit into their full context and what that means for how they work.</p>



<p>Today, Mtingwa is in what he describes as “that third stage” of serving the world: building institutions. When he talks about this stage, his stories focus on “we” more than “I,” to the point that it becomes hard keep track of which “we” he’s talking about. Over his long career, he’s built, nurtured and then carefully entrusted to others a dozen or so programs, institutions and nonprofits.</p>

<p>Mtingwa helped found not only the National Society of Black Physicists, but also the <a href="https://hispanicphysicists.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Society of Hispanic Physicists</a> and the <a href="https://www.africanphysicalsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">African Physical Society</a>, among several other professional organizations in the United States and abroad, with a focus on places where scientific infrastructure and opportunities are more limited. He is actively leading efforts in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia to train scientists to use synchrotron light sources — small particle accelerators that generate intense light that are vital for many types of research in chemistry and biology — and build synchrotron light source facilities.</p>



<p>The point, Mtingwa says, is to create more opportunities for more people in science. He’d like to see a day without discrimination, when anyone’s scientific careers could flourish — no matter who or where they are.</p>



<p>“I realized I wasn&#8217;t Jesus Christ,” Mtingwa says. “But I was put on Earth to serve mankind, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to do now – to be of service.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/metabolism-disruption-intestinal-malrotation-frogs">Messed-up metabolism during development may lead guts to coil the wrong way</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inside the African clawed frog, intestines grow just like humans’: neatly coiled counterclockwise. Experiments now show how that process can go awry.</p>



<p>Interfering with tadpoles’ metabolism leads to a chain of cellular disruptions that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.202020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes their intestines to grow in the wrong direction</a>, researchers from North Carolina State University in Raleigh report February 19 in <em>Development</em>. Their findings offer new insight into how a similar birth anomaly in humans, known as intestinal malrotation, may occur.</p>



<p>“Anything that illuminates how we could protect the embryo and the fetus early in development and prevent any type of congenital abnormalities is to me fascinating, and it’s exciting,” says Mehul Raval, a pediatric surgeon at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago who was not affiliated with this study.</p>



<p>Intestinal malrotation happens in as many as 1 in 500 human babies, the study’s authors say. But because malrotation can go undetected for a long time, it’s possible there are even more cases, Raval says. It’s most often detected when the gut gets so twisted it leads to obstructions or blocks blood flow.</p>



<p>“Think of the intestine as a garden hose,” says Nanette Nascone-Yoder, a developmental biologist at N.C. State. “You have to pay careful attention as you wind it up to avoid kinks and knots.”</p>



<p>Malrotation can happen in conjunction with other anomalies, but there’s no known cause, says Janice Taylor, a pediatric surgeon at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Nascone-Yoder and colleagues turned to frog embryos because the animals’ intestines are long and looping, like those in humans. Plus, the embryos develop outside of their mothers’ body and are transparent, so their growth is easy to monitor.</p>



<p>In frogs — and in people — the intestine typically winds counterclockwise as it develops. This happens early in a tadpole’s development, roughly between the third and fourth day. The researchers exposed <em>Xenopus laevis </em>embryos to atrazine, a common herbicide and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atrazines-path-cancer-possibly-clarified">known hormone disruptor in humans</a>, both before and during this stage of development (<em>SN: 1/21/15</em>). They found that many of the frogs’ intestines coiled clockwise — the wrong direction.</p>

<p>In further tests, the researchers found that atrazine disrupted the metabolism of the tadpoles, creating a domino effect that prevented the complete conversion of glucose to energy. “We can infer that [this reaction] inhibits the ability of cells to arrange in the growing intestine,” Nascone-Yoder says. In the case of the frogs, their intestines not only coiled clockwise but also were too stunted to fill the space they ordinarily would.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean atrazine is causing intestinal malrotation in humans. In fact, the researchers used levels of atrazine that were 1,000 times higher than what’s normally found in the environment. But it does mean that metabolic disruption may play a role. “It&#8217;s possible that either an environmental [effect] or some sort of genetic defect, like an inborn error of metabolism, for example, could subtly affect the lengthening of the GI tract in humans as well,” Nascone-Yoder says.</p>



<p>The researchers also found increased levels of damaging molecules called free radicals in tadpoles exposed to the herbicide. In excess, these free radicals can harm processes that help grow intestines. But they can be combated with antioxidants, so when the tadpoles were treated with antioxidants before being exposed to the herbicide, over half of the tadpoles grew normal, healthy intestines. </p>



<p>While this study doesn’t provide an answer as to what causes intestinal malrotation in human fetuses, or if antioxidants can prevent it, it&#8217;s a step closer. “The point is that our study opens up new avenues to look at, because prior to this, there really [wasn’t] a whole lot of explanation for intestinal malrotation,” Nascone-Yoder says.</p>

<p>Nearly 100 years ago, Muriel Bristol refused to drink a cup of tea that had been prepared by her colleague, the great British statistician Ronald Fisher, because Fisher had poured milk into the cup first and tea second, rather than tea first and milk second. Fisher didn’t believe she could tell the difference, so he tested her with eight cups of tea, half milk first and half tea first. When she got all eight correct, Fisher calculated the probability a random guesser would do so as well – which works out to 1.4%. He soon recognized that the results of agricultural experiments could be gauged in the same way – by the probability that random variation would generate the observed outcomes.</p>



<p>If this probability (the <em>P-value</em>) is sufficiently low, the results might be deemed statistically significant. How low? Fisher recommended we use a 5% cutoff and “ignore entirely all results which fail to reach this level.”</p>



<p>His 5% solution soon became the norm. Not wanting their hard work to be ignored entirely, many researchers strive mightily to get their <em>P</em>-values below 0.05.</p>



<span id="more-128781"></span>



<p>For example, a student in my introductory statistics class once surveyed 54 classmates and was disappointed that the <em>P</em>-value was 0.114. This student’s creative solution was to multiply the original data by three by assuming each survey response had been given by three people instead of one: “I assumed I originally picked a perfect random sample, and that if I were to poll 3 times as many people, my data would be greater in magnitude, but still distributed in the same way.” This ingenious solution reduced the <em>P</em>-value to 0.011, well below Fisher’s magic threshold.</p>



<p>Ingenious, yes. Sensible, no. If this procedure were legitimate, every researcher could multiply their data by whatever number is necessary to get a <em>P</em>-value below 0.05. The only valid way to get more data is, well, to get more data. This student should have surveyed more people instead of fabricating data.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">I was reminded of this student’s clever ploy when Frederik Joelving, a journalist with Retraction Watch, recently contacted me about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503?ref=pdf_download&amp;fr=RR-2&amp;rr=81d6a19cdfd5c1bc">a published paper</a> written by two prominent economists, Almas Heshmati and Mike Tsionas, on green innovations in 27 countries during the years 1990 through 2018. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/05/no-data-no-problem-undisclosed-tinkering-in-excel-behind-economics-paper/">Joelving had been contacted by a PhD student</a> who had been working with the same data used by Heshmati and Tsionas. The student knew the data in the article had large gaps and was “dumbstruck” by the paper’s assertion these data came from a “balanced panel.” Panel data are cross-sectional data for, say, individuals, businesses, or countries at different points in time. A “balanced panel” has complete cross-section data at every point in time; an unbalanced panel has missing observations. This student knew firsthand there were <em>lots</em> of missing observations in these data.</p>



<p>The student contacted Heshmati and eventually obtained spreadsheets of the data he had used in the paper. Heshmati acknowledged that, although he and his coauthor had not mentioned this fact in the paper, the data had gaps. He revealed in an email that these gaps had been filled by using Excel’s autofill function: “We used (forward and) backward trend imputations to replace the few missing unit values&#8230;.using 2, 3, or 4 observed units before or after the missing units.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That statement is striking for two reasons. First, far from being a “few” missing values, nearly 2,000 observations for the 19 variables that appear in their paper are missing (13% of the data set). Second, the flexibility of using two, three, or four adjacent values is concerning. Joelving played around with Excel’s autofill function and found that changing the number of adjacent units had a large effect on the estimates of missing values.</p>



<p>Joelving also found that Excel’s autofill function sometimes generated negative values, which were, in theory, impossible for some data. For example, Korea is missing R&amp;Dinv (green R&amp;D investments) data for 1990-1998. Heshmati and Tsionas used Excel’s autofill with three years of data (1999, 2000, and 2001) to create data for the nine missing years. The imputed values for 1990-1996 were negative, so the authors set these equal to the positive 1997 value.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/d_gDfdTCt8cKOMOo2gMuYgV8fMCEGrDsnpYmWM4fNZnJ0gWsE___2IeGByCEu06QBNgMsAwp5g_UNz9x6__gN4um6900t_FshExnFml2zYJVKF4wWBz7bn3FD18U2CyK5Hrv1k7HpTNp8TZ1I3MSWdH980UCy8bM" alt="KoreaExtrapolation.pdf"/></figure>



<p>Overall, the missing observations in this data set are not evenly distributed across countries and years. IPRpro (an index of&nbsp; intellectual and property rights strength) is missing 79% of its data because there are only observations every four, five, or six years. Another variable, EDUter (government expenditures on tertiary education as a percentage of GDP) was said to be a “crucial determinant of innovativeness” but is missing 34% of its data.</p>



<p>Some countries are missing data for several consecutive years. For example, the variable MKTcap is the market capitalization of listed domestic companies measured as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The MKTcap data end for Finland in 2005, Denmark in 2004, and Sweden in 2003, requiring 13, 14, and 15 years of imputed data, respectively. The MKTcap data for Greece don’t begin until 2001 (requiring 12 years of imputed data). Italy has MKTcap data for only 1999 through 2008. The authors imputed the values for the nine years before and the 10 years after this interval.</p>



<p>The most extreme cases are where a country has no data for a given variable. The authors’ solution was to copy and paste data for another country. Iceland has no MKTcap data, so all 29 years of data for Japan were pasted into the Iceland cells. Similarly, the ENVpol (environmental policy stringency) data for Greece (with six years imputed) were pasted into Iceland’s cells and the ENVpol data for Netherlands (with 2013-2018 imputed) were pasted into New Zealand’s cells. The WASTE (municipal waste per capita) data for Belgium (with 1991-1994 and 2018 imputed) were pasted into Canada. The United Kingdom’s R&amp;Dpers (R&amp;D personnel) data were pasted into the United States (though the 10.417 entry for the United Kingdom in 1990 was inexplicably changed to 9.900 for the United States).</p>



<p>The copy-and-pasted countries were usually adjacent in the alphabetical list (Belgium and Canada, Greece and Iceland, Netherlands and New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States), but there is no reason an alphabetical sorting gives the most reasonable candidates for copying and pasting. Even more troubling is the pasting of Japan’s MKTcap data into Iceland and the simultaneous pasting of Greece’s ENVpol data into Iceland. Iceland and Japan are not adjacent alphabetically, suggesting this match was chosen to bolster the desired results.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Imputation is attractive because it provides more observations and, if the imputed data are similar to the actual data, the <em>P</em>-values are likely to drop. In an email exchange with Retraction Watch, Heshmati said, “If we do not use imputation, such data is [sic] almost useless.”</p>



<p>Imputation sometimes seems reasonable. If we are measuring the population of an area and are missing data for 2011, it is reasonable to fit a trend line and, unless there has been substantial immigration or emigration, use the predicted value for 2011. Using stock returns for 2010 and 2012 to impute a stock return for 2011 is not reasonable.</p>



<p>Clearly, the more values are imputed, the less trustworthy are the results. It is surely questionable to use data for, say, 1999 through 2008 to impute values for 1990-1998 and 2009-2018. It is hard to think of any sensible justification for using 29 years of one country’s data to fill in missing cells for another country.</p>



<p>There is no justification for a paper not stating that some data were imputed and describing how the imputation was done. It is even worse to state the data had no missing observations. This paper might have been assessed quite differently – perhaps not been published at all – if the reviewers had known about the many imputations and how they were done.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063223141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birding to Change the World</a><br><em>Trish O’Kane</em><br><em>Ecco, $29.99</em></p>



<p>A “spark bird” is the species that inspires someone to start bird-watching. For Trish O’Kane, that bird was the northern cardinal. The backyard regular caught her eye while she was living with a friend in New Orleans, five months after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the region and her house in August 2005. Hearing cardinals’ chipping calls was an initial step toward over 1,960 hours of birding, 33 field notebooks filled with avian antics and a career change.</p>



<p>In her memoir, <em>Birding to Change the World</em>, O’Kane charts her pivot from human rights journalist to environmentalist. She worked as a hate crime researcher, an investigative reporter and a writing instructor for incarcerated mothers before starting work as a journalism instructor at Loyola University New Orleans the week before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/katrinas-legacy-refining-hurricane-forecasting">Hurricane Katrina</a> hit (<em>SN: 8/23/15</em>). </p>



<p>“How to stop war, how to end economic injustice, how to fight racism and white supremacy — these global problems were the focus of my life and work,” O’Kane writes. “I never paid any attention to environmental issues.”</p>



<p>Her fledgling interest in birds actually began a few days before the monster storm arrived. O’Kane notes how, despite the gorgeous weather, flocks of alarmed gulls shrieked over one of the levees near Lake Pontchartrain. “This was the first time I began to think of them as more than pretty flying objects and instead as creatures with their own agendas,” she writes. “But they can’t watch CNN, so how could they possibly know that a massive hurricane is going to hit us in less than forty-eight hours?” </p>



<p>It’s one of many moments where O’Kane makes sense of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-mechanics-compass-songbird-physics">the bizarre abilities of birds</a> — bizarre by human standards, anyway — by weaving established research with interviews with scientists (<em>SN: 6/28/21</em>). The gulls were reacting to sharp drops in barometric pressure from the encroaching storm.</p>



<p>Post-Katrina, O’Kane must navigate between working at Loyola and coping with the loss of her home. She finds relief in watching the birds that flit about in New Orleans’ Audubon Park. She starts bringing her class along for writing sessions. House sparrows, often scorned by bird enthusiasts for killing native birds, transform into a symbol of resourcefulness by building nests and foraging among the wreckage.</p>



<p>“My students stare at me in disbelief when I tell them that until I was forty-five years old, I never cared about birds,” O’Kane writes. She strived to make the world a better place for people. Now she was considering the welfare of wildlife. “I suddenly wondered how many creatures had died simply because of the way I lived.” She decides to pursue an eco-oriented career. In 2007, she enrolls in a doctorate program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison to study environmental science.</p>



<p>Most of the book focuses on O’Kane’s efforts to preserve Warner Park, along Madison’s Lake Mendota. It’s a convenient location for O’Kane to satisfy birding requirements for an ornithology class. But soon she successfully campaigns to stop the construction of a parking lot in one of the park’s meadows. Her activism snowballs into Wild Warner, a local crew of wildlife watchers flocking together to defend the park from further development. The organization eventually becomes part of O’Kane’s dissertation research, along with a birding class that pairs middle school students with college-student mentors.</p>



<p>It’s here that the memoir shows readers that an expertise in nature doesn’t require a degree. Take Jan, a retired feed mill worker plagued by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. O’Kane calls Jan an “ecology gold mine” of animal stories, thanks to his walks through Warner Park prescribed by his doctor. Then there’s Jeremy, a seemingly disinterested boy enrolled in O’Kane’s birding class. When reporters join an outing, the normally quiet Jeremy gushes about indigo buntings. O’Kane soon learns that Jeremy had taken to secretly studying the field guide gifted to him by his mentor.</p>



<p>O’Kane’s love for common birds fuels much of her work, a refreshing reminder of the incredible feats of nature happening in our own neighborhoods. A birder chasing the next exotic species to cross off their “bird life list” might dismiss the sighting of a shy gray catbird, readily found “meowling” under the cover of a nearby hedge. O’Kane, though, studies catbird migration. By strapping the birds with radar backpacks, her team confirms that the Warner Park’s catbirds migrate every fall as far as Mexico and Guatemala before returning each spring.</p>



<p>At its core, <em>Birding to Change the World</em> is about how people and birds today depend on one another. For birds, that dependence is tangible — for instance, the preservation of marsh habitat for wetland species. For people, the connection can be less concrete. </p>



<p>“For millennia, our species has seen birds as symbols of liberation,” O’Kane writes. In her case, it was liberation from the grief and depression that Katrina brought. “Bird by bird, every chickadee, nuthatch, catbird, wren, and owl forged a new neural pathway in my brain, a joyful pathway.” </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-media-teens-mental-health">Social media harms teens’ mental health, mounting evidence shows. What now?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In January, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook’s parent company Meta, appeared at a congressional hearing to answer questions about how social media potentially harms children. Zuckerberg opened by saying: “The existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health.”</p>



<p>But many social scientists would disagree with that statement. In recent years, studies have started to show a causal link between teen social media use and reduced well-being or mood disorders, chiefly depression and anxiety. </p>



<p>Ironically, one of the most cited studies into this link focused on Facebook.</p>



<p>Researchers delved into whether the platform’s introduction across college campuses in the mid 2000s increased symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The answer was a clear yes</a>, says MIT economist Alexey Makarin, a coauthor of the study, which appeared in the November 2022 <em>American Economic Review</em>. “There is still a lot to be explored,” Makarin says, but “[to say] there is no causal evidence that social media causes mental health issues, to that I definitely object.”</p>



<p>The concern, and the studies, come from statistics showing that social media use in teens ages 13 to 17 is now almost ubiquitous. Two-thirds of teens report using TikTok, and some 60 percent of teens report using Instagram or Snapchat, a 2022 survey found. (Only 30 percent said they used Facebook.) Another survey showed that girls, on average, allot roughly 3.4 hours per day to TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, compared with roughly 2.1 hours among boys. At the same time, more teens are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">showing signs of depression</a> than ever, especially girls (<em>SN: 6/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>As more studies show a strong link between these phenomena, some researchers are starting to shift their attention to possible mechanisms. Why does social media use seem to trigger mental health problems? Why are those effects unevenly distributed among different groups, such as girls or young adults? And can the positives of social media be teased out from the negatives to provide more targeted guidance to teens, their caregivers and policymakers?</p>



<p>“You can’t design good public policy if you don’t know why things are happening,” says Scott Cunningham, an economist at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increasing rigor</h2>



<p>Concerns over the effects of social media use in children have been circulating for years, resulting in a massive body of scientific literature. But those mostly correlational studies could not show if teen social media use was harming mental health or if teens with mental health problems were using more social media.</p>



<p>Moreover, the findings from such studies were often inconclusive, or the effects on mental health so small as to be inconsequential. In one study that received considerable media attention, psychologists Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski combined data from three surveys to see if they could find a link between technology use, including social media, and reduced well-being. The duo gauged the well-being of over 355,000 teenagers by focusing on questions around depression, suicidal thinking and self-esteem.</p>



<p>Digital technology use <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0506-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was associated with a slight decrease in adolescent well-being</a>, Orben, now of the University of Cambridge, and Przybylski, of the University of Oxford, reported in 2019 in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>. But the duo downplayed that finding, noting that researchers have observed similar drops in adolescent well-being associated with drinking milk, going to the movies or eating potatoes. </p>



<p>Holes have begun to appear in that narrative thanks to newer, more rigorous studies.</p>



<p>In one longitudinal study, researchers — including Orben and Przybylski — used survey data on social media use and well-being from over 17,400 teens and young adults to look at how individuals’ responses to a question gauging life satisfaction changed between 2011 and 2018. And they dug into how the responses varied by gender, age and time spent on social media.</p>



<p>Social media use was associated with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a drop in well-being among teens</a> during certain developmental periods, chiefly puberty and young adulthood, the team reported in 2022 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That translated to lower well-being scores around ages 11 to 13 for girls and ages 14 to 15 for boys. Both groups also reported a drop in well-being around age 19. Moreover, among the older teens, the team found evidence for the Goldilocks Hypothesis: the idea that both too much and too little time spent on social media can harm mental health.</p>



<p>“There’s hardly any effect if you look over everybody. But if you look at specific age groups, at particularly what [Orben] calls ‘windows of sensitivity’ … you see these clear effects,” says L.J. Shrum, a consumer psychologist at HEC Paris who was not involved with this research. His <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/728739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of studies related to teen social media use and mental health is forthcoming in the <em>Journal of the Association for Consumer Research.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cause and effect</h2>



<p>That longitudinal study hints at causation, researchers say. But one of the clearest ways to pin down cause and effect is through natural or quasi-experiments. For these in-the-wild experiments, researchers must identify situations where the rollout of a societal “treatment” is staggered across space and time. They can then compare outcomes among members of the group who received the treatment to those still in the queue — the control group.</p>



<p>That was the approach Makarin and his team used in their study of Facebook. The researchers homed in on the staggered rollout of Facebook across 775 college campuses from 2004 to 2006. They combined that rollout data with student responses to the National College Health Assessment, a widely used survey of college students’ mental and physical health.</p>



<p>The team then sought to understand if those survey questions captured diagnosable mental health problems. Specifically, they had roughly 500 undergraduate students respond to questions both in the National College Health Assessment and in validated screening tools for depression and anxiety. They found that mental health scores on the assessment predicted scores on the screenings. That suggested that a drop in well-being on the college survey was a good proxy for a corresponding increase in diagnosable mental health disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with campuses that had not yet gained access to Facebook, college campuses with Facebook experienced a 2 percentage point increase in the number of students who met the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression, the team found.</p>



<p>When it comes to showing a causal link between social media use in teens and worse mental health, “that study really is the crown jewel right now,” says Cunningham, who was not involved in that research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A need for nuance</h2>



<p>The social media landscape today is vastly different than the landscape of 20 years ago. Facebook is now optimized for maximum addiction, Shrum says, and other newer platforms, such as Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, have since copied and built on those features. Paired with the ubiquity of social media in general, the negative effects on mental health may well be larger now.</p>



<p>Moreover, social media research tends to focus on young adults — an easier cohort to study than minors. That needs to change, Cunningham says. “Most of us are worried about our high school kids and younger.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, researchers must pivot accordingly. Crucially, simple comparisons of social media users and nonusers no longer make sense. As Orben and Przybylski’s 2022 work suggested, a teen not on social media might well feel worse than one who briefly logs on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers must also dig into why, and under what circumstances, social media use can harm mental health, Cunningham says. Explanations for this link abound. For instance, social media is thought to crowd out other activities or increase people’s likelihood of comparing themselves unfavorably with others. But big data studies, with their reliance on existing surveys and statistical analyses, cannot address those deeper questions. “These kinds of papers, there’s nothing you can really ask … to find these plausible mechanisms,” Cunningham says.</p>



<p>One ongoing effort to understand social media use from this more nuanced vantage point is the SMART Schools project out of the University of Birmingham in England. Pedagogical expert Victoria Goodyear and her team are comparing mental and physical health outcomes among children who attend schools that have restricted cell phone use to those attending schools without such a policy. The researchers described the <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/7/e075832.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protocol</a> of that study of 30 schools and over 1,000 students in the July <em>BMJ Open.</em></p>



<p>Goodyear and colleagues are also combining that natural experiment with qualitative research. They met with 36 five-person focus groups each consisting of all students, all parents or all educators at six of those schools. The team hopes to learn how students use their phones during the day, how usage practices make students feel, and what the various parties think of restrictions on cell phone use during the school day.</p>



<p>Talking to teens and those in their orbit is the best way to get at the mechanisms by which social media influences well-being — for better or worse, Goodyear says. Moving beyond big data to this more personal approach, however, takes considerable time and effort. “Social media has increased in pace and momentum very, very quickly,” she says. “And research takes a long time to catch up with that process.”</p>



<p>Until that catch-up occurs, though, researchers cannot dole out much advice. “What guidance could we provide to young people, parents and schools to help maintain the positives of social media use?” Goodyear asks. “There’s not concrete evidence yet.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Ohki Katakura will talk about his work in the talk entitled &quot;How the cerebellum recognises learnt and novel patterns: computational approach with a biologically detailed network model&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The cerebellum is essential for motor control, timing and cognition. Although its anatomy
and physiology have been investigated, recent experimental studies raise new open
questions. These include how the granule cells process mossy fibre signals and how the
Purkinje cells code learnt and novel patterns. In this research, a detailed cerebellar
cortex network model was constructed by incorporating existing models [1,2] and
introducing long-term depression at granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The network
connectivity switches between the oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity states,
affecting the sparsity of activated granule cells. Pattern recognition criteria differed
across these states: in the oscillatory network, novel prompted longer pauses in Purkinje
cell spikes, while the non-oscillatory network responded with longer bursts. The number of
storable patterns in the network corresponds to the sparsity of activation.</p>

<p>A journal is retracting a paper on the purported harms of vaccines against COVID-19 written in part by authors who have had similar work retracted before.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/203052-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-lessons-learned-from-the-registrational-trials-and-global-vaccination-campaign#!/">COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines: Lessons Learned from the Registrational Trials and Global Vaccination Campaign</a>,” appeared late last month in <em>Cureus</em>, which used to be a stand-alone journal but is now owned by Springer Nature. (It has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cureus/">appeared frequently in these pages</a>.)</p>



<p>Graham Parker, Director of Publishing and Customer Success at <em>Cureus</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm we will be retracting it by the end of the week, as we have provided the authors with a deadline to reply and indicate whether they agree or disagree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The senior author on the work was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_A._McCullough">Peter McCullough</a>, a cardiologist at the Institute of Pure and Applied Knowledge who lost his board certification after the American Board of Internal Medicine <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23242430-abim-decision-on-mccullough">found</a> he had “provided false or inaccurate medical information to the public.”</p>



<span id="more-128774"></span>



<p>Indeed, McCullough had already lost one <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">paper</a>, in <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>, from Elsevier, when he and his colleagues submitted their latest opus to <em>Cureus</em>. And SSRN, which hosts preprints for <em>The Lancet</em>, another Elsevier journal, had <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4496137">removed work by him and colleagues</a> claiming large numbers of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days after the paper appeared, we asked John Adler Jr., the editor in chief of <em>Cureus</em>, if the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">track record </a>of the authors concerned him. His response seemed to admit to the risk, but he also defended the journal’s vetting of the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes I am aware that many of these authors are skeptical zealots when it comes to the dangers of vaccines. Our editorial response was extra vigilance during the peer review process with 8 different reviewers weighing in on publication or not, including a few with strong statistics knowledge. Therefore, a credible peer review process was followed and the chips fell where they may. That is all I can say. If you or other readers were to note fatal flaws in this article now that it is published, i.e. failure to accurately report financial COIs [conflicts of interest], totally erroneous statistical analysis, fake data etc. we will of course re-evaluate at any time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adler then took a jab at other journals:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The decision process Cureus made, contrasts sharply with Elsevier’s seeming editorial decision to just censor the article using ad hominem concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a Feb. 9, 2024 letter to the journal and the publisher, <a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-jpm2003">John P. Moore</a>, a microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, and <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/gregg-gonsalves/">Gregg Gonsalves</a>, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health, in New Haven, Conn., expressed their “serious concerns” about the article. Among their objections:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors utterly lack relevant professional qualifications that would enable them to assess the scientific publications they draw on and/or attempt to criticize. The authors self-describe their affiliations under the rubric of “Independent Research”, or list private foundations, or in one case report an academic discipline unrelated to biology. In short, the authors cannot draw on years of training in biological science, but appear to be self-taught via the “University of Google”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The point here is that the Cureus review merely regurgitates claims about mRNA vaccines that have circulated on the internet and been debunked over and over again, including by fact-checking organizations (e.g., Factcheck.org, and the USA Today and Politico factcheck teams).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They conclude:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By bringing this highly problematic review to your attention, we hope that you will conduct a thorough review of how it was accepted for publication in Cureus under the Springer Nature imprimatur. How appropriate was the peer review process? How did the editor act? Is the acceptance of this review symptomatic of a wider problem at the journal? Finally, if you share our views that this review is so flawed as to be dangerous to public health, you may well decide that it should be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Springer Nature had apparently been looking into the case already, and ended up agreeing with Moore, Gonsalves and other critics of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Steve Kirsch, a co-author of the paper, announced the retraction <a href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/our-paper-critical-of-the-covid-vaccines">on his Substack </a>over the weekend:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The paper I co-authored with 6 other authors will be retracted by the journal because the publisher won’t allow any paper that is counter-narrative to be published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Kirsch’s post, Springer Nature’s inquiry found:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>a significant number of concerns with your article that in our view can’t be remedied with a correction. The concerns include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>We find that the article is misrepresenting all-cause mortality data</li>



<li>We find that the article appears to be misrepresenting VAERs data</li>



<li>The article states that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine saved two lives and caused 27 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations, and the Moderna vaccine saved 3.9 lives and caused 10.8 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations, though there does not appear to be convincing evidence for this claim.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Incorrect claim: Vaccines are gene therapy products.</li>



<li>The article states that vaccines are contaminated with high levels of DNA. Upon review we found that the cited references are not sufficient to support these claims.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The article states that SV40 promoter can cause cancer because SV40 virus can cause cancer in some organisms and inconclusively in humans. However, we find that this is misrepresenting the cited study (Li, S., MacLaughlin, F., Fewell, J. <em>et al.</em> Muscle-specific enhancement of gene expression by incorporation of SV40 enhancer in the expression plasmid. <em>Gene Ther</em> 8, 494–497 (2001). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.gt.3301419">https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.gt.3301419</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>The article states that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines did not undergo adequate safety and efficacy testing, which the journal considers to be incorrect</li>



<li>The article incorrectly states that spike proteins produced by COVID-19 vaccination linger in the body and cause adverse effects.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>



<p>Waving the white flag, a bowed but unbroken Kirsch wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It doesn’t do any good to show them these reasons are all bogus. The laundry list of items is simply a placeholder to make it look like the journal is following the science.</p>



<p>Nothing we can say on appeal will make any difference.</p>



<p>The decision was made to retract the paper and facts don’t matter. It’s about supporting the narrative. When they write “in our view can’t be remedied with a correction” it means “don’t even bother arguing with us, your paper is retracted.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For his part, Moore said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal and publisher responded courteously and professionally to our letter, and I was pleased by the final outcome. They did what needed to be done.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weight-loss-drug-addiction-opioid-disorder">Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>DENVER — </strong>A weight-loss drug used to treat obesity and diabetes has shown promise to treat another disorder: opioid addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early results from a small clinical trial, presented February 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, suggest that a close relative of the weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic significantly lessened cravings for opioids in people with opioid use disorder.</p>



<p>“For them to have any time when they might be free of that craving seems to be very hopeful,” Patricia “Sue” Grigson, a behavioral neuroscientist at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey said at the conference.&nbsp;The vast majority of drug overdose deaths in the United States are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/overdose-prevention-opioid-safe-injection-harm-reduction">due to opioids</a> (<em>SN: 2/14/24</em>).</p>



<p>The drug, called liraglutide, mimics a hormone called GLP-1 that the body releases after people eat. Wegovy and Ozempic — brand names for semaglutide, a molecule that induces weight loss more effectively than liraglutide — also imitate the hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly how the drugs work when it comes to weight loss, but researchers think such GLP-1 dupes prompt the body and brain to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">make people feel full</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hints that such drugs could work for addiction, too. People taking Wegovy or Ozempic have reported lessened desire for not just food but also alcohol and nicotine. What’s more, Grigson and colleagues showed in a previous study in rats that liraglutide can cut down on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wegovy-ozempic-treat-addiction">heroin-seeking behavior,</a> perhaps by changing the animals’ brain activity (<em>SN: 8/30/23</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test whether liraglutide might work in people as a treatment for opioid addiction, Grigson and colleagues gave the drug to volunteers being treated for opioid use disorder at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa. The team analyzed data from 20 people, 10 of whom were slated to receive increasing drug doses over 19 days. The remaining 10 people received a placebo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At higher doses of liraglutide, patients dropped out of the trial largely due to gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, a known side effect of these drugs. Still, the treatment began reducing opioid cravings at the lowest dose, Grigson said, and desire for opioids was reduced by 30 percent overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s equivalent to the effect of about 14 days of intensive treatment at a residential center, Grigson said.</p>



<p>The results need to be confirmed in larger trials, she said. The team also hopes to try out other GLP-1 drugs, which may be more effective and come with fewer side effects, and include people with different levels of addiction.</p>
