<p>Kashif Barkat, who heads the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan, has had two of his studies retracted and two more corrected, all for issues related to images in the papers. Several more of his studies are flagged on PubPeer for similar reasons. </p>



<p>According to the retraction notice for one of the retracted articles, which appeared in&nbsp; <em>Polymer Bulletin </em>in 2020, Barkat does not agree with the journal’s decision to pull the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “Understanding mechanical characteristics of pH-responsive PEG 4000-based polymeric network for colorectal carcinoma: its acute oral toxicity study,” has been cited three times so far, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00289-024-05366-y">retraction note</a>, issued in June, reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129985"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding highly similar areas between the group I and II images in Fig. 11 representing stomach, lung and intestine tissues. In addition, the heart group II and intestine both group images appear highly similar to Fig. 10 heart I and intestine II images, respectively, in [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00289-024-05366-y#ref-CR1">1</a>].</p>



<p>The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data.</p>



<p>Kashif Barkat does not agree to this retraction. The other authors have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barkat has not responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The other retraction for Barkat is of a 2022 paper published in <em>BioMed Research International. </em>The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/5883239#">study</a>, “Polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30-Based Crosslinked Fast Swelling Nanogels: An Impeccable Approach for Drug’s Solubility Improvement,” has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791210/">retraction notice</a>, dated January 9:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted by Hindawi, as publisher, following an investigation undertaken by the publisher [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791210/#B1">1</a>]. This investigation has uncovered evidence of systematic manipulation of the publication and peer-review process. We cannot, therefore, vouch for the reliability or integrity of this article.</p>



<p>Please note that this notice is intended solely to alert readers that the peer-review process of this article has been compromised.</p>



<p>Wiley and Hindawi regret that the usual quality checks did not identify these issues before publication and have since put additional measures in place to safeguard research integrity.</p>



<p>We wish to credit our Research Integrity and Research Publishing teams and anonymous and named external researchers and research integrity experts for contributing to this investigation.</p>



<p>The corresponding author, as the representative of all authors, has been given the opportunity to register their agreement or disagreement to this retraction. We have kept a record of any response received.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the two corrected articles, Barkat and his colleagues acknowledge errors in the published images but that those mistakes did not affect the main conclusions of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.55913">correction</a>, issued by the <em>Journal of Applied Polymer Science</em> in June, was for a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.45312">2017 study</a> published by Barkat and colleagues, titled “Oxaliplatin-loaded crosslinked polymeric network of chondroitin sulfate-<em>co</em>-poly(methacrylic acid) for colorectal cancer: Its toxicological evaluation.” That paper has been cited 48 times.</p>



<p>The other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9846852/">corrigendum</a>, issued in January 2023 by <em>Frontiers in Chemistry</em>, was for a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010646/">2022 paper</a> titled, “Chitosan/Xanthan Gum based hydrogels as potential carrier for an antiviral drug: Fabrication, characterization, and safety evaluation,” cited 88 times.</p>



<p>At the end of the corrigendum, <em>Frontiers in Chemistry </em>published a separate note, which reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>All claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers. Any product that may be evaluated in this article, or claim that may be made by its manufacturer, is not guaranteed or endorsed by the publisher.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to these four, 10 other studies coauthored by Barkat are <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Kashif+Barkat">being discussed on PubPeer</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/bugs-brain-the-role-of-gut-brain-axis-in-neurological-disorders">Bugs &#38; Brain: The Role of Gut-Brain Axis in Neurological Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Within our bodies, trillions of cells originating from a single-celled zygote work in harmony to create and sustain us. However, residing in our guts is a vast and complex microbiome that, despite its integral role, remains largely unexplored. “The current estimate is that humans have 10 trillion human cells and about 100 trillion bacterial cells,” says Dr. Martin J. Blaser at the New York University School of Medicine. These microbes play an essential role in supporting healthy digestion, offering infection prevention, and even preserving reproductive health, as well as linking the gastrointestinal tract to the enteric nervous system. Scientifically, the &apos;gut-brain axis&apos; refers to the bidirectional interaction between gut microbiota and the brain, mediated through neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways. This interaction has been extensively demonstrated to influence brain activity.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The gut-brain axis involves complex communication between the central nervous system (CNS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The ANS, including the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, transmits signals between the gut and the brain. For example, in response to stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β can prompt the adrenal glands to release cortisol, a major stress hormone. Beyond neural pathways, the gut-brain axis also operates through the immune system, where gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, such as cytokine production and T cell development. Key gut bacteria, including Helicobacter, Bacteroides, Clostridia, and segmented filamentous bacteria, help balance pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. For instance, when the intestinal barrier is compromised, gut microbes can trigger immune cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα into the bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic inflammation.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">These interconnected systems—neural, immune, and endocrine—profoundly affect the brain and mental health. Research has shown that several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), Parkinson&apos;s disease, anxiety, depression, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, are influenced by the so-called &apos;dysbiosis&apos; of the gut microbiota.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the most well-documented examples of gut dysbiosis associated with a neurological condition is the overgrowth of </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Helicobacter pylori</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> in the intestines of Parkinson&apos;s disease patients. </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">H. pylori</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> infection has been shown to reduce dopaminergic transmission in neurons located in the substantia nigra, a brain region critical for motor control. This reduction in dopamine transmission may correlate with the progressive motor dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues, and cognitive impairment seen in Parkinson&apos;s disease. Additionally, studies have found an increase in bacteria from the families Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Barnesiellaceae in Parkinson’s patients, which may further contribute to disease progression. Meanwhile, a decrease in Prevotellaceae has been linked to reduced production of the hormone ghrelin, which is essential for proper dopaminergic transmission.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gut dysbiosis is also a significant factor in the context of AD. A study analysing stool samples from patients measured the abundance of six bacterial taxa, revealing an increase in pro-inflammatory species and a decrease in anti-inflammatory ones. This imbalance included a reduced population of Firmicutes and a potential increase in Bacteroidetes. While the amyloid hypothesis remains a central explanation for AD, there is limited information related to how gut dysbiosis and the tau hypothesis might also contribute to disease progression.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Given the emerging links between gut dysbiosis and these neurological conditions, several treatments aimed at restoring a healthy microbiome are being explored. In Parkinson&apos;s disease, microbial replacement therapy, which includes the transfer of liquid fecal matter from a healthy donor (fecal microbiota transplantation), has shown promise. Additionally, probiotics containing strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have been effective in alleviating some gastrointestinal symptoms in patients when administered over a period of 1-3 months.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, early studies in Alzheimer&apos;s patients have shown that treatments such as fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics could be beneficial. Although these studies have been conducted on small groups, they offer promising results that warrant further investigation. Nonetheless, research into restoring gut microbiota is still in its infancy and demands more intensive study to gain conclusive results.</span></span></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png"><img decoding="async" width="268" height="128" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129965"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A Swiss medical publisher has ceased operations, including shuttering <a href="https://www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/zeitschriften/">nationally prominent journals</a>, after its parent organization, the <a href="https://www.fmh.ch/">Swiss Medical Association FMH</a>, allegedly forced it into bankruptcy.</p>



<p>According to information on the website of EMH Swiss Medical Publishers, the Swiss Medical Association FMH holds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905082918/https://www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1599284532/">a 55% stake</a> in the firm. But on Aug. 22, 2024, the FMH’s board terminated its collaboration with the publishing house, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240904140042/https:/www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1607631223/">including licensing for the association’s journal <em>Schweizerische Ärztezeitung</em></a><em> </em>(Swiss Medical Journal), with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In doing so, [the association] deprived its own company of its livelihood. EMH filed its balance sheet today and thus opened bankruptcy proceedings,” the publisher said in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905082516/https://phc.swisshealthweb.ch/de/">a notice</a> posted on its website on September 4, 2024.</p>



<span id="more-129963"></span>



<p>The publisher had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240904140042/https:/www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1607631223/">previously announced</a> the move by its parent organization meant it had to discontinue the following journals immediately:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Swiss Medical Forum </em></li>



<li><em>Primary and Hospital Care </em></li>



<li><em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em></li>



<li><em>Cardiovascular Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Swiss Medical Informatics</em></li>
</ul>



<p>It would also close down its website www.swisshealthweb.ch, the firm said. The site was a major source of conflict with the FMH, which in <a href="https://fmh.ch/files/pdf30/2024-08-15-mm-fmh-emh_fmh_saez.pdf">an Aug. 15 media statement</a> said the IT project was too expensive and did not meet the needs of the association’s members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yvonne Gilli, president of the FMH, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The FMH regrets that further magazines can no longer be published due to this development. However, the licence rights to these affected journals are held by Petri Holding, not by the FMH. The FMH is therefore unable to make any statements about their future. However, the FMH is prepared to work on sustainable solutions for these journals on request.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the affected titles, the Scopus-indexed <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em>, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905085853/https://sanp.swisshealthweb.ch/en/about-sanp/">more than a century old.</a> It has featured works by such academic luminaries as Carl Gustav Jung, Eugen Bleuler, Hermann Rorschach and Michel Foucault<em>,</em> according to Daniele Zullino of Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, who was co-editor-in-chief of the publication until it folded.</p>



<p>“Everything stopped now,” Zullino said. “We don&#8217;t know what will happen.”</p>



<p>The <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em> was the only psychiatry journal in Switzerland, a country known for its contributions to that field, and among the most widely read medical journals there, Zullino added. “So we have to relaunch it.”</p>



<p>Other physicians in Switzerland echoed Zullino’s regret.</p>



<p>“From a researcher point of view, it is really sad to see the <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em> vanishing, as it is a well-respected and Scopus-listed journal,” said a physician-researcher in Switzerland, who asked to remain anonymous. “To cancel all papers under review also seems to be an unusual decision, and I am unsure what happens to accepted, but not yet published papers.”</p>



<p>In the Aug. 26 notice on its website, the soon-to-be erstwhile publisher added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Right up until the very end, we had tried to resume constructive discussions with FMH. With its decision, which was contrary to the contract and surprising to all of us, FMH is obviously knowingly accepting the break-up of its own subsidiary and 27 years of successful development and cooperation. As a result of FMH&#8217;s decision, all 35 EMH employees will lose their jobs. This is not only incomprehensible, but also socially irresponsible, as the impending liquidity shortage has since been addressed by suitable measures.</p>

<p><em>As Retraction Watch readers no doubt know, PubPeer has played a key role in a growing number of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00202-9">cases of misconduct</a>, allowing sleuths to publicly shine light in shadowy corners and prompting action by many universities. (Disclosure: Our Ivan Oransky is a volunteer member of the PubPeer Foundation&#8217;s board of directors.) But that has also meant that universities can feel overwhelmed by a deluge of PubPeer comments. </em></p>



<p><em>In a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2024.2390007">new article</a>, three attorneys from Ropes &amp; Gray in Boston who advise universities on such cases, along with Barbara Bierer, a researcher and former research integrity officer at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, also in Boston, examine &#8220;the origins of PubPeer and its central role in the modern era of online-based scouring of scientific publications for potential problems and outlines the challenges that institutions must manage in addressing issues identified on PubPeer.&#8221; Attorneys Mark Barnes, Minal Caron and Carolyn Lye, and the Brigham&#8217;s Barbara Bierer,  also recommend ways federal regulations could change to make the investigation process more efficient. We asked them to answer some questions about the article.  </em></p>



<p><strong>What prompted you to write this piece?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<span id="more-129945"></span>



<p>As acting or designated research integrity officers (“RIOs”), and as legal counselors to other institutions and their RIOs, we have fielded innumerable questions about how to deal responsibly with the waterfall of data integrity concerns posted on PubPeer and other websites.  The RIO community is, in general, under-resourced to be able to investigate every concern that is posted, and we have been asked many times:  Are there best practices here?  Do the federal regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 93 (“Part 93”) require us to review these websites and assess all concerns posted about research that has been conducted at our institution or by our researchers’ work?  We wrote this piece to try to respond to these community concerns in an organized way, to trigger a larger community discussion on these issues. </p>



<p>Additionally, we find that many members of the data integrity community may be unaware of the genesis of PubPeer, and this lack of knowledge can lead to wild theories about who began and who operates PubPeer.&nbsp; But in fact, there is a significant amount of information in the public domain about PubPeer, if you dig for it (albeit, mostly from 2016 and earlier).&nbsp; That is why, as a secondary objective, we wanted to provide a detailed overview of PubPeer, its animating rationales, and origins.</p>



<p><strong>As you note, some of you have been acting or designated RIOs at various institutions. How did that experience inform your thinking about PubPeer?&nbsp;</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="454" height="568" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129948" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png 454w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mark Barnes</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As designated RIOs, we have been directed by ORI and other government entities to regard specific PubPeer postings as formal allegations, and either to conduct an assessment of those allegations or to take them directly to inquiry.&nbsp; ORI also sometimes voices a requirement that in the course of an inquiry or investigation, RIOs must review online sources of public comments to ensure that all concerns related to a respondent’s past published research have been reviewed and considered (particularly if an inquiry committee has decided to dismiss a set of allegations at the inquiry stage, instead of proceeding to full investigation).&nbsp; Our experience is similar to the reported experiences of many RIOs.</p>



<p><strong>You write that “the influx of PubPeer comments received by institutions and triaged by RIOs and other research compliance personnel has placed a significant burden on research institutions already stretched thin by ongoing research misconduct proceedings and other research integrity and research compliance obligations.&#8221;&nbsp;For the benefit of Retraction Watch readers, what are these other obligations? Are they required by federal law or regulation?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>First and foremost, RIOs are required under Part 93, other federal agency regulations, and their institutional policies, to assess all complaints made to them about research integrity concerns; they then must shepherd many cases through inquiry and investigation. Although rigorous due process protections are needed to ensure fairness for respondents, they can cause processes to be slow and cumbersome.&nbsp; Further, in many cases, the allegations can be so numerous and so complex that speedily completing the misconduct process is just not possible.&nbsp; In addition, the role of a RIO is not always a full-time position, and many RIOs serve in other roles as well (e.g., Vice Provost/Associate Dean for Research) or have many other intra-institutional responsibilities (e.g., NIH- and NSF-required responsible conduct of research (“RCR”) training, other research-related compliance tasks).&nbsp; RIOs often simply do not have sufficient capacity to be able to scour these public science websites, identify all relevant postings, and consider their implications.</p>



<p><strong>What is the role of ORI in responding to PubPeer comments? Is there a mechanism for that?&nbsp;</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="956" height="796" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129949" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 956w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x250.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-768x639.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Barbara Bierer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>ORI and analogous offices in other federal agencies (e.g., DoD, NSF, DoE) can be effective in screening publicly posted concerns and bringing to a RIO’s attention those concerns that merit attention and assessment.&nbsp; ORI often refers allegations posted to PubPeer to the corresponding author’s institution, instructing the institution to conduct an assessment or inquiry of the allegations.&nbsp; Yet ORI typically does not indicate how it became aware of allegations referred to an institution.&nbsp; It may be that ORI does not proactively monitor PubPeer, but instead conducts a screening review of any PubPeer-sourced allegations that it receives from complainants and then passes on the relevant institution and allegations that seem cognizable.</p>



<p><strong>ORI is in the midst of&nbsp;<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/20/guest-post-why-i-commented-on-the-proposed-changes-to-u-s-federal-research-misconduct-policies-and-why-you-should-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewing the regulations</a>&nbsp;that guide it, which have not been updated since 2005. Several of you have written a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/-/media/files/articles/2024/01/20240104_research-misconduct-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking-respose-letter-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response to their call for feedback</a>. Do you think there is an opportunity to address PubPeer in new regulations?&nbsp;</strong><strong>You argue for a narrowing of the scope of what’s known as the “subsequent use exception,” including limiting any investigations to work in the last six years. What is that exception, and how would this help?</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="454" height="568" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129950" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png 454w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Minal Caron</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As we say in our published paper, it would be very useful if RIOs could be afforded, under Part 93, greater discretion to review concerns and allegations and try to resolve them with the authors and any cognizant journals at assessment, but this, as we argue, should apply only to situations in which original, accurate research data are available and the problem is reasonably identified by the RIO as “honest error.”&nbsp; This procedural reform could speed the process in a fault-free and constructive way and, at the same time, would free up time for other, less readily resolvable cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making the matter even more complicated, while the ORI research misconduct regulations contain a statute of limitations (a six-year lookback period) and the subsequent use exception to the six-year lookback period, other federal agencies (such as NSF) have no statute of limitations embedded in their research misconduct regulations.&nbsp;Another possible reform we suggest is narrowing the exceptions to that statute of limitations, which would reduce the burden on all institutional research misconduct processes, thus allowing more sustained focus on more recently published research.&nbsp; We recognize, however, that this reform would allow some truly egregious behavior to evade scrutiny under the research misconduct process, which is a serious consideration militating against such a reform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2024/08/optimizing-research-integrity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>&nbsp;about your paper, Dorothy Bishop says that “what is needed is hard data on how many reported cases of misconduct proceed to a full investigation, and how many subsequently are found to be justified.” Are data available on how often PubPeer comments turn out to be unfounded? If not, are there best guesses?&nbsp;</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129951" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png 683w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carolyn Lye</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We are not aware of any available data nor any reliable way in which this could be assessed, particularly because of the confidentiality obligations in research misconduct proceedings imposed by the applicable federal regulations and most institutional policies.&nbsp; We agree entirely with Dr. Bishop that the collection and analysis of this information – if it were possible – would be very useful.</p>



<p><strong>Are you concerned that raising the bar for investigations will mean many cases that should be investigated aren’t, and that significant parts of the scientific literature will remain, or become more, corrupted?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not sure what you mean by “raising the bar,” but we can say this:&nbsp; the best deterrent to falsification and fabrication of data and plagiarism is to identify serious concerns; address them quickly, thoroughly and fairly; correct the scientific record at the earliest possible time; and impose sanctions on those who have committed misconduct.&nbsp; No system can detect and prosecute all compliance violations.&nbsp; As Cesare Beccaria said in regard to the deterrent effect of criminal law, the severity of punishment is less important than its swiftness and its certainty.&nbsp; Here, we need credible, reliable, swift deterrence to re-order the system and reinforce sound ethics in research, and we believe that significant time delays do hinder the deterrent effect of the current approach.</p>



<p><strong>Sleuths have over the years said that many institutions already find reasons to dismiss cases that have merit, and you acknowledge in your paper that “if ORI were to give institutions greater latitude in their institutional decision-making at the early stages of a research misconduct proceeding, there would probably be a wide variety of outcomes,” some of them likely negative. How would your proposal guard against that? Is there an argument for adding more resources and improving institutional culture rather than, or in addition to, limiting what gets investigated?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Of course, it would be useful for every research institution to examine its research misconduct workload (as well as the workload that has been delayed, deferred and/or avoided) and compare that workload to the available resources.&nbsp; But we believe that the ability to resolve “honest error” cases quickly and to document the reasons why each case was resolved, if accompanied by robust auditing of this process by ORI and other cognizant agencies, could speed the process in many cases, allow prompt correction of the scientific record, and free up RIOs to focus on those researchers whose actions are clearly not due to “honest error” but instead may have been intentional, knowing or reckless in their dissemination of false data or plagiarized work.</p>

<p>The journal <em>Nature Synthesis</em> has pulled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00068-7">a high-profile article</a> describing the creation of a new type of carbon after a university investigation found some data were made up.</p>



<p>“The authors of the original paper claimed to have created an entirely new form or carbon, graphyne, which is fundamentally different common diamond or graphite,” said <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/valentin-rodionov-0">Valentin Rodionov</a>, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, whose team has been investigating the now-retracted work for the past two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If true, this would have been a groundbreaking discovery,” Rodionov told Retraction Watch. His team described its findings in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00642-1">a commentary</a> published on September 2 in the journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00627-0">retraction notice</a> released the same day stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A formal investigation was launched by the Office of Research Integrity at the University of Colorado after concerns were raised about the validity of some of the data reported in this work. From this investigation, it was concluded that the data used to produce Supplementary Figure S10 were fabricated and that the procedures used to produce Figure 2b deviated from standard practices. The investigation committee agreed that the data in Figure S10 are not critical to support the major claim of the manuscript and do not affect the overall scientific advance presented in a significant way. Out of a sense of responsibility, the authors have decided to retract the Article.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Rodionov explained that the authors used a “method called ‘alkyne metathesis,’ which was always expected to be the path to this new material. While this approach failed to work for the last 25 years, in the hands of the authors it has seemingly produced the desired result.”</p>



<p>But the findings didn’t hold up when Rodionov and his colleagues looked more closely. Of the two crystal structures for the synthesized material described in the paper, one “featured a distance between non-bonded carbon atoms which in our opinion is impossibly short,” he said. Furthermore, the reported spectroscopic characterization appeared to disagree with the structure claimed by the authors.”</p>



<p>It turned out that structure “could be generated through a common type of a computer simulation, if the parameters for the simulation were set to incorrect default values.” And that “structure was a perfect match for the reported X-ray diffraction data,” he said, referring to a technique for direct measurement of interatomic distances. Those data “featured an unusual distribution of experimental noise, and overall the noise level was lower than expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither discrepancy could be “explained by any reasonable means,” said Rodionov, whose team shared their findings with the University of Colorado and the journal starting in late 2022.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00136-y">correction to the paper in July 2022</a> added a Research Resource ID which had not appeared in the original version.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="168" height="210" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-127175"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michael Bailey</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A Springer Nature journal has rescinded the acceptance of a paper criticizing the publishing giant&#8217;s controversial <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02635-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retraction</a> last year of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> that surveyed parents of children with gender dysphoria, leading an associate editor to resign, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>According to emails we obtained, the blocked paper was slated to appear as a commentary in <a href="https://link.springer.com/collections/dcdbjehcbb">a special issue</a> of Springer Nature’s <em>Current Psychology</em> that aimed “to stimulate discussion of all aspects of the ‘unpublication’ of scientific articles.”</p>



<p>“This is the only time I&#8217;ve had an accepted paper overruled in 4 years” as an associate editor at this journal, Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University in Florida, one of two guest editors of the special issue, told us by email.</p>



<span id="more-129938"></span>



<p>Ferguson resigned from <em>Current Psychology</em>’s editorial board on August 29, a decision he said “pretty much sums up my feelings” about the publisher’s handling of the manuscript.</p>



<p>The aborted commentary, a draft of which Retraction Watch has seen, excoriated Springer Nature for pulling the article “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9">Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible Cases</a>,” which was published in March 2023 in the <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we explained last year in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/24/after-backlash-publisher-to-retract-article-that-surveyed-parents-of-children-with-gender-dysphoria-says-co-author/">a story</a> preceding the <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/104685">much-criticized</a> paper’s retraction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) is, the article stated, a “controversial theory” that “common cultural beliefs, values, and preoccupations cause some adolescents (especially female adolescents) to attribute their social problems, feelings, and mental health issues to gender dysphoria,” and that “youth with ROGD falsely believe that they are transgender,” in part due to social influences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the canceled commentary, which contained several instances of opinion and conjecture, Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and a coauthor of the 2023 paper, argued that retractions are “increasingly a vehicle for scientific censorship.” He laid out the details of how his work was withdrawn and speculated about the publisher’s motivations.</p>



<p>“I was critical of Springer Nature, because I believed its decision to retract my 2023 article was made for ideological rather than ethical reasons,” Bailey told us by email. “Furthermore, I criticized other actions by Springer Nature and its journals, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>, which deemphasize scientific integrity for the sake of identity politics. This recent experience does nothing to dampen that criticism.”</p>



<p>Bailey described himself in the commentary as “tenured, thick-skinned, and annoyed by present trends in academia away from academic freedom and towards identity politics.” Other academics have made similar points in the past, <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2015/02/galileos-middle-finger-scientists-under-attack/">highlighting the risks to democracy</a> when activists attack scientists over research they find politically unacceptable.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to the author, Ferguson had invited him to contribute to the special issue on retractions in <em>Current Psychology</em> in June 2023. Bailey submitted his paper two months later. In October, editor-in-chief of the journal Richard Ferraro told Bailey by email that two of three reviewers had recommended acceptance, but noted that “the Reject review aligns with my thoughts to an extent” and asked for a revision.</p>



<p>Bailey replied that he would not make the changes suggested by Ferraro, but was “willing to consider very specific modifications” that Ferguson had recommended. On December 18, Ferguson wrote to Bailey, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is a tricky issue and I know you (and I) want you to have your chance to get on the record with this. I also think this is an important message to get into the public. Although it’s true you could publish this in [the Journal of Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science, a title published by the <a href="https://www.soibs.com/">Society for Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science</a>, which Bailey co-founded in 2021], I think there are some advantages of you publishing this with Springer/Nature, not the least of which is that it weakens censorship efforts by tackling it directly at the source. Put bluntly, perhaps, I see value in publishing a criticism of Springer/Nature’s censorship in Springer/Nature.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(The retracted paper was since <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/23.10.00002v1">republished</a> in the<em> Journal of Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science</em>, <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/10/24/junk-science-journal-republishes-retracted-anti-trans-paper/">drawing flak</a> from the LGBTQ community.)</p>



<p>Bailey said he submitted a revision of his manuscript on March 27 and that it was accepted on May 21. In July, however, the paper had still not been published, and Bailey asked Ferguson for an update.</p>



<p>“Well it’s done and scheduled for the special issue, so there’s no plan (that I know of) to squish it,” Ferguson responded, adding that the paper had been “switched to a ‘commentary.’”</p>



<p>Ferguson added: “Do I suspect they feel a bit embarrassed by your article…maybe…but they seem to have done the ‘right’ thing.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Then, on August 29, Bailey received an email from Ferraro, one of the journal&#8217;s two editors-in-chief:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dear author,</p>



<p>You have submitted a manuscript to a special issue in Current Psychology, Retractions and Their Discontents. The guest editors had in principle accepted your manuscript and based on their recommendation, we also provisionally accepted your manuscript. As the Editors-in-Chief of Current Psychology, the final responsibility for the content of the journal, including its special issues, lies with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon further review and after careful consideration following conversations with the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group, we have decided not to proceed with the publication of your manuscript. What you have submitted appears to be an opinion piece, rather than an original research article and therefore not suitable for publication. We have therefore rescinded the accept decision.</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>F. Richard Ferraro</p>



<p>Lauren S. Seifert</p>



<p>Co-Editors-in-Chief of Current Psychology&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ferguson said he was informed of the decision to withdraw the acceptance of the commentary that same day.</p>



<p>“Apparently some kind of ‘Integrity Group’ at Springer got a hold of it, decided to squash it, and used the excuse that this was because it was an opinion piece (of course there are zillions of opinion pieces in all manner of psychology journals including, I am sure, many others Springer publishes),” he told us. “So I think it was this Integrity Group that [prompted the retraction], pretty much supervening all the actual scholars involved.”</p>



<p>Teresa Krauss, Publishing Director at Springer Nature, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Springer Nature expects all submitted manuscripts – whether original research, commentaries, or editorials – to contain factual and accurate information as part of our commitment to maintaining the validity of the scientific record. Journal editors can contact the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group for advice on any manuscript under consideration. In this instance, RIG was consulted due to concerns about the accuracy of some statements in the manuscript.</p>



<p>After examination of these concerns, the Editors were advised that they may want to review the manuscript again. After further careful consideration, they took the editorial decision to rescind the initial acceptance decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Editor&#8217;s Note (1500 UTC, 9/5/24): We have edited the headline and first paragraph of this story to attribute opinions about what occurred in this case. We have asked Springer Nature for details of the exchanges between the RIG and the editors of the journal in order to better understand what happened, and will update with anything we learn.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This month, we interviewed Eve Corrie, an </span></span></strong><em><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">in vitro</span></span></strong></em><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> neurobiologist working at Medicines Discovery Catapult, an independent, not-for-profit drug discovery innovation centre. Eve discusses her decision to move from academia to industry and the benefits she has experienced so far!</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I can probably trace the start of my interest in neuroscience back to a particular day in Year 11. A neuroanatomist had come to do some outreach during a lunchtime session, and she had brought a human brain in a bucket to pass round the whole class to hold. I remember thinking that it was so intense that I was holding the organ that makes a person a person, and how small it seemed. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After reading many popular neuroscience books during my gap year I ended up at UCL for 4 amazing years and got interested in the neuroscience of pain signalling. Having insisted for years that I didn’t want to do a PhD, I then ended up in Sheffield doing a PhD investigating the utility and mechanism of novel, engineered botulinum toxins as pain therapeutics. I got a taste of the drug discovery industry during a six-month placement at Eli Lilly as part of my studentship and realised that this was the sort of role that I wanted when I finished my doctorate. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have since moved over to industry where I currently work for Medicines Discovery Catapult, part of the Catapult network set up by Innovate UK to enhance and accelerate UK research and industry. I work on drug discovery projects using human stem cell-derived models of the brain and nervous system, mostly in the neurodegenerative disease space. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What made you pursue the position you are currently in?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I managed to find one of the only neuroscience industry jobs that let me stay up North! That’s sort of a joke, but not really. I really did not fancy moving down to London, Oxford, or Cambridge after I had become used to the significantly improved quality of life you can afford when you don’t live in the golden triangle. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It wasn’t just geography though, obviously the organisation and the role also seemed very good otherwise I wouldn’t have ended up here. The way MDC works is unique, being partially publicly funded and non-profit, but with aspects of working for a commercial company – a blend which seemed very appealing. It also allowed me to transition away from animal work and get experience working with human induced pluripotent stem cells, a transition that I think will serve me well as science moves away from the over-reliance on animal, particularly rodent, models.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I interviewed for one other role as I was applying for this one, and I’m now very glad I didn’t get it as it would have been entirely desk-based. Things like moving around the labs, physically doing things, and learning how to use pieces of equipment are quite important to my job satisfaction and I really enjoy that aspect of wet lab science. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It’s also great to be exposed to new projects in different disease areas, through meeting new potential clients and developing new ideas together. It’s very different to academia where you’re digging down into one tiny area of science for many years – rain or shine. Some people love that, but I need variety. We’re constantly developing new assays and learning new techniques in the lab and it’s very satisfying when it pays off. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also enjoy working for a company with such a broad remit. It’s almost like a blend of the best bits of working for a drug discovery company or a contract research organisation, mixed with some of the freedom to innovate that you get in academia. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Science is always challenging, whatever role or sector you’re in! Working with stem-cell derived models is particularly fiddly, as they are very sensitive and take a long time to mature. When you’ve been babying some precious cells for weeks, it can be kind of crushing when something goes wrong. Unfortunately, that’s just the nature of life in the lab. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’m having to learn how to sell what we do. I’m trying to learn how to network more efficiently, for example when attending and presenting at conferences. I’ve even been involved in a few social media posts and videos to advertise our neuroscience capabilities and conference posters, which has been a learning curve! The hard bit for me is not when you’re in the middle of a project, running the experiments. The hard bit is meeting the right people, building enough rapport, then having good enough ideas that they want to collaborate with you. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I went to Lyme Regis last summer, in order to visit where Mary Anning lived and worked along the Jurassic Coast in the 1800s. Mary was one of the best fossil hunters of history, discovering the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton, the first plesiosaurs, and the first pterosaur outside of Germany. She would walk the coastline every tide, especially in stormy weather, as this was when the rock would be eroded and reveal new specimens. She mostly did this to sell her findings to tourists to make a living, but in doing so changed the course of palaeontology, with many of her specimens still exhibited in the Natural History Museum today. Of course, as a working-class woman at that time she was never accepted into the scientific community and is only nowadays credited as the amazing scientist she was, but she’s one of my historical inspirations for her tenacity and diligence to her work. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">More personally, I’ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by inspiring women in science all the way from school, to my integrated masters, through my PhD and in my current role. My current manager is such a kind, supportive, clever person and she’s a joy to work with. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve never been particularly future-thinking or goal-seeking. I tend to bumble along in my career until the next thing happens to me, and this strategy has served me well so far. I imagine I’ll stay in my current role until I’m either no longer enjoying it or no longer progressing, then will look for the next step as that time approaches. I sometimes feel like there’s so much pressure to have the most impressive career in the room and always be striving for the next best thing, but unfortunately that also can tend to come with a lot of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. As long as I feel fulfilled in what I’m doing, and I’m surrounded by good colleagues around me, then why would I leave? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If I was hard-pushed to have a goal for myself then maybe in the future I’d like to move onto something more directly patient-focused or clinical, but I couldn’t tell you what that would look like.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Don’t panic if something you’ve been aiming for doesn’t pan out. There will always be something else that comes along that will be equally good, if not better. Try and think about the choices you make along the way, make informed decisions and life changes when you need to, but it’s not the end of the world if something goes a bit awry at some point. There are so many examples of scientists whose careers have taken a huge turning point they couldn’t have predicted, whether down to choice or something out of their control – just listen to a few episodes of The Life Scientific and you’ll realise how common it is. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Also, don’t give up immediately if something is tough! Stick it out for a while because, chances are, you will be capable of adapting to it. A bit of grit and tenacity will get you a long way. Obviously, even if after a decent adjustment period you’re still unhappy, or it’s affecting your mental health, then make one of those informed decisions and life changes, but make sure you allow for a decent settling period first. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Different sectors of STEM have significantly different problems. For example, in bioscience there seems to be a relatively equal split of men to women at all levels, and I’ve never felt any sort of way about being female in this environment. However, move over to the computer science sector and almost everybody is male. Maybe it’s a coincidence that the pay is significantly higher in this sector than bioscience, but maybe it’s not. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Something I think is a broader problem in all of STEM and academia is the noticeable lack of distribution across different “social classes” and representation from deprived areas. This problem can only be addressed at the root, very early on in childhood. It depends on the catchment area you are born in, whether you have guardians with time to read with you, whether your school has any resources to support your individual interests, whether you have to work part-time through university to supplement your Maintenance Loan which doesn’t cover your rent, whether you have the financial ability to relocate to begin a PhD project in a different part of the country… Until there is more support and less reliance on family to fill the gaps that should be provided by the government, this disparity will remain, and so much talent will continue to be wasted.</span></span></p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sampen-157x180-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="157" height="180" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sampen-157x180-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-128182"/></a></figure></div>


<p>The <em>Journal of Cellular Physiology</em>, a Wiley title, will retract two articles by an arthritis researcher the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/us-va-scientist-banned-from-agency-research-for-faking-data/">engaged in research misconduct</a>, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, the VA published <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-24342/findings-of-research-misconduct">findings</a> stating Hee-Jeong Im Sampen, formerly a research biologist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago, faked images and inflated sample sizes in three published papers, a grant application, a presentation, and an unpublished manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the findings, the VA banned Sampen, who publishes under the name Hee-Jeong Im, from conducting research for the department and requested retractions of the three publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the papers, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcp.25015">Development of an Experimental Animal Model for Lower Back Pain by Percutaneous Injury-Induced Lumbar Facet Joint Osteoarthritis</a>” and “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.24946">Environmental Disruption of Circadian Rhythm Predisposes Mice to Osteoarthritis-Like Changes in Knee Joint</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Cellular Physiology</em> in 2015, and don’t currently have any sort of notice about the VA finding they contain faked images.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129930"></span>



<p>In response to our inquiry, a Wiley spokesperson said the publisher was aware of the VA’s request to retract the paper “and has investigated.” The retractions “are in progress and should take place within the next few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third article in the VA’s findings, “<a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/75/12/2133">PKCδ null mutations in a mouse model of osteoarthritis alter osteoarthritic pain independently of joint pathology by augmenting NGF/TrkA-induced axonal outgrowth</a>,” was retracted July 1. <em>Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases</em>, the BMJ journal in which the paper appeared, “was notified in February 2024” about the findings of research misconduct, according to the <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/83/7/e17">retraction notice</a>. The journal also acknowledged and linked to the November 2023 Federal Register notice about the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three papers have been cited more than 100 times collectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with a handful of those coming after the VA’s publication of its findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampen, who holds a part-time, untenured position as a research professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Illinois, Chicago, told us she disagrees with the retractions, and the findings were “unjustified.” She previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/06/a-travesty-a-researcher-found-guilty-of-misconduct-by-federal-u-s-government-responds/">disputed the VA’s findings at length</a>, saying they “appear to serve some VA administrative purpose and led to my termination, but they lack validity from a legal, ethical, and practical scientific perspective.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings in her case are currently under review at the US Office of Research Integrity, Sampen told us. She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>But whatever ORI decides, I would like to tell you that the scientific validity of my lab’s research and findings have never been questioned. The allegations of research misconduct against me are based on my supervisory role, concern a tiny fraction of the enormous amounts of data my lab has published, and simply involve erroneously placed figures or images.</p>



<p>Throughout my entire life, I have humbly pursued science and put in a tremendous amount of effort while progressing as an academic. Science was my whole life. I never expected my reputation would hinge on alleged errors of which I was unaware and beyond my direct control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction of the two <em>Journal of Cellular Physiology</em> papers will bring Sampen’s total to four, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dIm%252c%2bHee-Jeong">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Arthritis Research and Therapy</em>, a Springer Nature title, retracted another of Sampen’s articles, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ar3441">Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is principally responsible for fibroblast growth factor 2-induced catabolic activities in human articular chondrocytes</a>,” in August. The <a href="https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-024-03381-y">notice</a> states “an investigation jointly conducted by Rush University and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center (JBVAMC) has determined that Fig. 5B contains fabricated and/or falsified data,” though the paper wasn’t listed in the VA’s published findings. The paper has been cited more than 100 times. </p>



<p>Sampen has continued to publish after the findings were announced, with “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi5501">Nanoparticle-based inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors alleviates osteoarthritis pain and cartilage damage</a>” appearing in <em>Science Advances</em> in February. The paper, which received coverage in <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2417059-injections-of-drug-filled-nanoparticles-may-relieve-arthritis-pain/">New Scientist without any mention of </a>the public misconduct findings, describes experiments administering an experimental drug formulation to mice with osteoarthritis.</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Monday, September 2nd, 2024</strong>, the arXiv team will be observing Labor Day, a federal holiday in the United States. This holiday will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As our team celebrates Labor Day, announcements will be slightly deferred.</p>
<p>As you plan your submissions to arXiv this week, please be aware of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Friday, August 30, 2024, and before 14:00ET Tuesday September 3, 2024 will be announced on Tuesday, September 3, 2024 at 20:00ET.</li>
<li><strong>September arXiv IDs. </strong>September arXiv IDs will be assigned to articles submitted in September at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, September 3, 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay up to date on arXiv news and changes to the announcement schedule, subscribe to <a href="http://blog.arxiv.org/">the arXiv blog</a> or follow us on social (<a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arxiv">LinkedIn</a>) for timely updates.</p>
