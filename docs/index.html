<p>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DFSettlementAgreement.pdf">settled a lawsuit</a> filed under the False Claims Act, admitting researchers used images and data that were “misrepresented and/or duplicated” in support of grant applications to the National Institutes of Health. Dana-Farber agreed to pay $15 million to settle the claim.</p>



<p>Sleuth <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/27/sholto-david-profile-dana-farber-retractions/">Sholto David</a> filed the claim in April 2024, about three months after he first posted about the allegations, which played a key role in Dana-Farber’s decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/health/dana-farber-cancer-studies-retractions.html">retract or correct dozens of studies</a>. Authors of some of those papers were among senior leaders of the institution, including <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp1104">president and CEO Laurie Glimcher</a>.</p>



<p>As is typical in such cases, the complaint remained sealed while the Department of Justice investigated. As part of the agreement, David will receive $2.63 million, or 17.5 percent of the settlement.</p>



<span id="more-133621"></span>



<p>“I&#8217;m very pleased with the settlement,” <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/">Eugenie Reich</a>, one of the attorneys who represented David, told Retraction Watch. “And the main thing is that the lion&#8217;s share goes back to NIH and should go back out for science.” More than $8.5 million “shall constitute restitution to the United States,” according to the settlement.</p>



<p>The False Claims Act allows plaintiffs to sue on behalf of the government. Plaintiffs have been successful in cases over the past decade involving universities and other research institutions including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/14/columbia-has-settled-a-fraud-case-for-9-5m-heres-why-thats-important/">Columbia</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/27/harvard-teaching-hospital-pay-10-million-settle-research-misconduct-allegations/">Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a>, and Duke University. Judges can award whistleblowers up to 30 percent of the settlement, although this provision of the Act has been <a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/alerts/2025/12/the-eleventh-circuit-questions-the-constitutionality-of-fcas-qui-tam-provision?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-eleventh-circuit-questions-the-constitutionality-of-fcas-qui-tam-provision">challenged recently in courts</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typical settlements for research misconduct allegations have been in the $10 million range, although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/13/false-claims-allegations-cost-mass-general-former-harvard-researcher-more-than-1-million/">some have been smaller</a>. As in the case of Dana-Farber, institutions often receive “credit under the Department of Justice’s guidelines for taking disclosure, cooperation, and remediation into account in False Claims Act cases.” In the Duke case, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/03/25/duke-settles-case-alleging-data-doctoring-for-112-5-million/">settled for $112.5 million</a>, the whistleblower, former lab technician Joseph Thomas, received $33.8 million.</p>



<p>The settlement is not surprising, said <a href="https://www.tzlegal.com/people/renee-brooker/">Renée Brooker</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based whistleblower attorney with Tycko &amp; Zavareei LLP who specializes in False Claims Act cases. And it’s among a growing number of fraud cases brought by the government for research misconduct associated with NIH research grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The False Claims Act is a great watchdog, if you will, for exactly this type of fraud,&#8221; Brooker, a former assistant director for the Department of Justice in charge of False Claims Act cases, told us. &#8220;Any question brought that involves falsified or improper or inaccurate data or conclusions is important for the Department of Justice and the NIH to make an example of to deter future misconduct by any other research institutions that are getting federal money.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Dana-Farber case is unique because of the speed at which the settlement came down, says <a href="https://www.tzlegal.com/people/eva-gunasekera/">Eva Gunasekera</a>, a whistleblower attorney also at Tycko &amp; Zavareei LLP and former DOJ senior counsel for healthcare fraud.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a really quick settlement,&#8221; she told Retraction Watch. &#8220;The case was filed in 2024. In False Claims Act-speak, usually cases take at least three years from the filing to some resolution, and usually much longer than that. I think that&#8217;s another good indication that this administration is still prioritizing much of the same kinds of fraud objectives and enforcement actions that we&#8217;ve known for the last decade plus.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reich also noted the speed. “One currency here is time. This has resolved in only 20 months. We know that research integrity disputes take a long time, and we know that False Claims Act cases take a long time,” Reich said, noting the original complaint included more than 90 papers. “And when you multiply that, this is fast.”</p>



<p>Brooker said she hoped the settlement would raise awareness among the research community about the importance of reporting fraud or false claims to the government, and the possibility of receiving a reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you have widespread knowledge [about this] by grantees,&#8221; said Brooker, who works with Gunasekera. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of a different space when you&#8217;re talking about people receiving grants versus the general health care organization type-cases. [It&#8217;s] helpful to just get on the radar screen of folks who are involved in the grant community because they have this mechanism of the qui tam provisions to report fraud in a meaningful way and possibly get justice in the reward for reporting.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David told us he first came across many of the papers listed in the lawsuit while writing a series of blog posts in <em>For Better Science</em>. After writing about Memorial Sloan Kettering researcher Sam Yoon in <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/01/memorial-sloan-kettering-paper-mill/">late 2023</a>, David said he eventually arrived at researchers from Dana-Farber by “following strings and strands” of coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/">January 2024 blog post</a>, David called out image similarities and signs of data manipulation in dozens of papers coauthored by a number of Dana-Farber affiliates. Among those were <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/william-c-hahn">William Hahn</a>, chief operating officer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who David noted had an “impressive” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22William+C.+Hahn%22+OR+%22W+C+Hahn%22">PubPeer record</a>, including many comments about possible image issues. David also named <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/irene-ghobrial">Irene Ghobrial</a>, the senior vice president for experimental medicine, alleging there were “obvious duplications” in a bone marrow study.</p>



<p>Soon after the blog post was published, Dana-Farber requested journals retract six of the 58 studies David named and correct dozens of others, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/health/dana-farber-cancer-studies-retractions.html">the <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>reported<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original complaint filed in April 2024 included 95 studies by Hahn, Ghobrial, and other Dana-Farber researchers “reflecting a pattern of fraud,” the complaint read. The complaint goes on to list several grants that relied on data in some of those papers.</p>



<p>The settlement does not name specific researchers, instead referring to “Researcher 1,” the principal investigator on one set of grants in the lawsuit, and “Researcher 2,” who oversaw a second set of grants.</p>



<p>The settlement identifies 14 papers published under Researcher 1’s supervision. The senior author on 12 of the papers is <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kenneth-c-anderson">Kenneth C. Anderson</a>, director of Dana-Farber’s LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center. Anderson has <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?#?auth%3dKenneth%2bC%2bAnderson">10 retractions in our database,</a> dating back to 2008.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Researcher 1 failed to exercise sufficient oversight over these researchers in the course of their preparation of the Subject Publications and their conduct of the underlying research reported in the Subject Publications.&nbsp; As a result, Dana-Farber spent funds from the Group 1 Subject Grants that were unallowable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The settlement agreement is noting that a PI holding a grant who fails to supervise, who&#8217;s done this repeatedly and created a pattern of flawed data — not fraudulent or misconduct, but flawed data — that they should be paying more attention,” Reich said.</p>



<p>The second group of grant applications listed relied on research described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3867">a 2015 <em>Nature Medicine</em> article</a>. “Certain images and data in the Journal Article were misrepresented and/or duplicated,” the settlement reads. The senior author on that article is physician-scientist <a href="https://labs.dana-farber.org/carrascolab/people/ruben-d-carrasco-md-phd">Ruben Carrasco</a>. </p>



<p>The article received two corrections in 2024, both image related.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">An unusual aspect of the case, Reich said, was that all the pieces of the case were publicly available.</p>



<p>“Most of the evidence is public and has been in plain sight for a long time for people tenacious enough to track it all down and bring it all together,” she said. “I think often we&#8217;re playing whack-a-mole with a bad article and we&#8217;re not always seeing the patterns, and we&#8217;re not always seeing the money behind the patterns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecing that together is what David did, she said. “It&#8217;s a synthesis of what&#8217;s publicly available in a way that makes sense for enforcement.”</p>



<p>This was the first time David has been involved with a False Claims Act lawsuit, he told us.</p>



<p>“People might see it as an attack on universities or an attack on science,” David said. “At the end of the day, the purpose of this is, the money goes back to the NIH, and the NIH are going to spend on cancer research.”</p>



<p>“Most of the stuff that is written about does not come out in a press release like this,” he added, referring to research integrity issues. “That doesn&#8217;t make it any less important.”</p>

<p>Three years after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">he was let off the hook</a> by a government commission, a former university vice chancellor in Pakistan is facing sanctions for plagiarizing <a href="http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/id/eprint/21973/">a student thesis</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">a paper</a> from 2020, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://uog.edu.pk/faculty/mrn6572e243ad17e/muhammad-suleman-tahir">Muhammad Suleman Tahir</a>, previously of Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, is now professor and chair of the department of chemical engineering at the University of Gujrat. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nov-20-2025-Report-on-Complaint-of-Plagiarism-against-the-VC-KFUEIT-Rahim-Yar-Khan.pdf">According to a report</a> issued on November 20 by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in Islamabad, Tahir and his coauthors have been barred from supervising graduate students for three years and also have received a warning for their offense.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the University of Gujrat removed Tahir from his position as director of the institution’s Advanced Study &amp; Research Board on December 3, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dec-3-2025-Removal-from-directorship.jpg">according to a notification</a> we obtained.</p>



<span id="more-133616"></span>



<p>“This marks the first institutional action resulting directly from the confirmed plagiarism findings,”<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/farukh-iqbal-mieaust-cpeng-ner-rpeq-0bb3663a/?originalSubdomain=au"> Farukh Iqbal</a>, who brought the charges against Tahir, told us.</p>



<p>The case goes back to 2020, when Iqbal was working toward a doctorate in chemical engineering in Australia and noticed a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">paper</a> in <em>Fuel</em> that was clearly based on his master’s thesis. He alerted the journal, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/27/vice-chancellor-of-university-in-pakistan-loses-paper-for-plagiarizing-from-a">pulled the offending article</a> in 2021, as we reported at the time.</p>



<p>Iqbal also complained to the HEC, which found the retracted paper was based on the master’s thesis of Numair Manzoor, one of Tahir’s students. Manzoor’s thesis, in turn, was “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">completely plagiarized</a>” from Iqbal’s, according to an expert committee convened by the HEC, as we reported in 2023.</p>



<p>Tahir argued without proof that Iqbal was the one who had plagiarized Manzoor’s work, and not the other way around. He also said he had been unaware that the paper was submitted. And he filed a 500 million rupee (~$2,800,000USD) defamation suit against Iqbal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on Tahir’s inconsistent claims of ignorance, the HEC expert committee recommended against penalizing the then-vice chancellor in February 2022. Iqbal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Appeal.pdf">appealed</a> the decision the following month, but nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, on the morning of March 13, 2023, we contacted the HEC for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">the story</a> we ran the following day. We heard nothing back. But that same day, the HEC constituted a new expert committee to review Iqbal’s appeal, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/July-10-2023-Report-of-Expert-Committee.pdf">according to a committee report</a> we obtained. The report, which was signed on July 10, 2023, but has not been disclosed until now, shows the committee recommended punishing all of the authors of the plagiarized paper, including Tahir. But for more than two years, the HEC did not act on these recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unaware of the committee’s decision, Iqbal complained to the Higher Education Department (HED) of the Government of Punjab, a provincial organ that has no power over the national HEC, but can ask for updates on university matters. On October 30 of this year, the HED sent a letter to the HEC inquiring about Iqbal’s appeal. The HEC’s November 20 report, which adhered to the expert committee’s recommendations from 2023, is addressed to the HED as a direct response to its request for an update.</p>



<p>“Deputy Secretary Dr. Saima Anwar [of the HED] handled the matter with exceptional integrity and ensured that my appeal – stalled for years – was finally processed,” Iqbal told us by email. “HEC disclosed the old decision and declared punishment (Minor Penalty) to all authors.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/writ-petition-1.jpg">a court document</a> he shared with us, Tahir has challenged HEC’s decision in court. He told us the case is under consideration and did not comment further.</p>



<p>But Iqbal said the court had “declined to grant any interim relief [to Tahir]. It did not suspend or stay the HEC decision; instead, it simply issued notices to the parties for a later hearing.”</p>



<p>Iqbal also noted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Suleman+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Bilal+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22M.B.+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Sagir%22">dozens of studies</a> by Tahir and his coauthors had been flagged on PubPeer, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522012851">some</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402619319722">have</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522022317?via%3Dihub">been</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522022317?via%3Dihub">retracted</a>.</p>



<p>“The plagiarism case that triggered this process is now legally finalized by HEC, but the broader pattern of misconduct is still unfolding at the journal level,” he said.</p>

<p>A Cell Press journal quietly removed part of a funding statement from a paper related to gender-affirming hormone therapy that the authors say was included in error. Experts called the move “worrying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00941-6">the paper</a>, which appeared in <em>Cell Reports</em> on September 23, gave estrogen therapy to male monkeys to better understand how hormone therapies used in gender clinics might affect the immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research drew attention from several conservative news organizations, some of which called the project “<a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/08/shocking-exclusive-taxpayer-dollars-nih-used-create-transgender/">disturbing</a>” and alleged <a href="https://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2025/08/29/wcw-investigation-nih-state-of-florida-fund-transgender-monkey-experiment/">the work cost millions of dollars</a> in National Institutes of Health funding.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133594"></span>



<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251006181331/https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00941-6">archived version of the paper</a> dated October 6 included a state-funded grant, which is no longer listed in the acknowledgement. The removed statement read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The study was further supported by a pilot award by the HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases Institute (HEIDI) at the University of Miami through the State of Florida Funding Initiative (M.A.M.) sponsored by the State of Florida, Department of Health (award contract #CODVD to M. Stevenson).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://wertheim.scripps.ufl.edu/profile/martins-mauricio/">Mauricio Martins</a> is a researcher at the Herbert Wertheim Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology at the University of Florida in Jupiter. Martins told Retraction Watch the statement was “inadvertently carried over from a different paper published around the same time” and that the Florida Department of Health grant supported another project unrelated to the <em>Cell Reports </em>paper.</p>



<p>When asked specifically whether the university or the state of Florida asked him to remove the statement, Martins replied they did not. “Once I realized that the HEIDI funding statement in the Cell Reports paper was incorrect, I asked the journal to correct it,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martins did not respond to our question asking which paper the funding statement originally belonged to. But <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1177/08892229251370763">another article</a> he coauthored in August in Mary Ann Liebert’s <em>AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses</em> <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08892229251380258">received a correction this month</a> to add the HEIDI grant to the funding statement. The article, reporting on an HIV-related immunological experiment in monkeys, shares three other coauthors with the <em>Cell Reports </em>paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.med.miami.edu/state-and-community-support-brings-heidi-closer-to-an-hiv-aids-cure/">HEIDI award</a> is a state-funded pilot grant given to research on HIV/AIDS at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine. The award’s <a href="https://med.miami.edu/centers-and-institutes/hiv-aids-institute/research/pilot-awards">website</a> no longer lists previous recipients of the grant, but according to an archived version of the website, Martins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250829135920/https://med.miami.edu/centers-and-institutes/hiv-aids-institute/research/pilot-awards">received the grant</a> in the 2022-2023, 2021-2022 and 2017-2018 award cycles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEIDI director <a href="https://med.miami.edu/faculty/mario-stevenson-phd">Mario Stevenson</a>, who was named in the now-removed text, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was aware of the paper or asked that the funding statement be removed. (He is not a coauthor on the <em>Cell Reports</em> study.) The Florida Department of Health also did not respond to questions on whether they were aware of the study or the funding statement.</p>



<p>When we asked why <em>Cell Reports</em>, owned by Elsevier, did not issue a correction to the article to signal the change, Shawnna Buttery, the editor-in-chief, told us their policy “considers grant and funder details to be non-scientific content of great importance to authors and their funders but not of interest to our readers, and our policy is to make such changes without requiring a Correction notice.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=62124">Mohammad Hosseini</a>, who teaches research ethics at Northwestern University in Chicago, disagreed with that assessment. “If, as they say, the funding statement was only useful for the authors and funders, then there would be no reason to disclose funding information,” he told us. “I believe that the change warranted a correction and cannot really get my head around why the journal or the publisher decided against it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-grey">Andrew Grey</a> at the University of Auckland, who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/04/how-many-ducks-do-you-need-to-line-up-to-get-a-publication-retracted/">previously written for Retraction Watch</a>, called Buttery’s statement “worrying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors made an error, which has been corrected. Readers should be made aware of the correction. It’s a straightforward matter to do so,” Grey said.</p>



<p>Funding disclosures are “pretty central to research integrity in a publication,” <a href="https://www.lisamrasmussen.com/">Lisa Rasmussen</a>, the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/gacr20"><em>Accountability in Research</em></a>, told us. “If funding declarations can be made to disappear after publication with no record, it&#8217;s easy to imagine how this could go wrong given particular political or other pressures.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Journals have been called out before for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/12/stealth-corrections-when-journals-quietly-fix-papers/">making changes without noting them</a> in a correction. Last year, a team of researchers found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.1660">131 articles with what they called “stealth corrections,”</a> changes to author information, figures or data, editorial process records, or other alterations — including to funding statements.</p>
