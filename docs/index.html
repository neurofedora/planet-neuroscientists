<p>Two orthopedic surgeons in Turkey will not attain tenured professorships following alleged research misconduct that, so far, has also cost them a pair of publications, Retraction Watch has learned. </p>



<p><a href="https://tr.linkedin.com/in/faruk-%C3%A7atma-a66b6181">Mehmet Faruk Çatma</a> and <a href="https://tr.linkedin.com/in/serhan-%C3%BCnl%C3%BC-b58b39138">Serhan Ünlü</a> are among the authors of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00264-016-3144-0">a paper about hip-replacement surgery</a> that was published in 2016 in <em>International Orthopedics</em> and retracted earlier this year.</p>



<p>The February 16 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00264-023-05720-1">retraction notice</a> reads:</p>



<span id="more-127224"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor in Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concern have [sic] been raised that the authors may not have been in possession of the whole set of data reported in the paper. The journal received a local court verdict stating that the authors were unable to present the whole data set to the court. The authors did not provide an explanation of why they did not submit their dataset to the local court. The Editor, therefore, cannot be certain of the provenance and ownership of the data, and thus, the integrity of the paper&#8217;s findings. The authors have not explicitly stated that they agree to this retraction. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper, &#8220;Femoral shortening osteotomy in total hip arthroplasty for severe dysplasia: a comparison of two fixation techniques,&#8221; has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The journal&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Marius Scarlat, and its publisher, Springer Nature, declined to give further details or share the court verdict. Neither Ünlü, Çatma nor the paper&#8217;s corresponding author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2986-4083">Alper Öztürk</a>, responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as the retraction notice suggests, the story has twists.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">It began seven years ago when <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Murat-Altay">Murat Altay</a>, an orthopedic surgeon in Ankara, came across the now-retracted article in <em>International Orthopedics</em>. He realized the paper was based on work he had presented orally at a conference a couple of years earlier with some of the other authors. But his name had been left out of the publication.</p>



<p>And that wasn&#8217;t all. The paper claimed to include data from 76 patients whose surgeries were performed with an incision at the back of the hip, rather than at the side, which was Altay&#8217;s approach. &#8220;But in reality, there were only 8 patients who met the criteria for this publication,&#8221; he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Altay, now a professor at Keçiören Training and Research Hospital in Ankara, said he had evidence for this number because he obtained a patient list from Stryker, the company that supplied the hip implants used in the surgeries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Altay complained about the paper to organizations in Turkey, including the Intercollegiate Board, which conducts examinations for tenured professorships in the country, and the Turkish Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology. Eventually, he took his case to the Ankara Regional Administrative Court.</p>



<p>The authors of the article were requested to provide their data, but failed to do so, as stated in a notarized translation of a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Court-Decision.pdf">court decision</a> Altay shared with Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>While several parts of the story remain murky, the court appears to have relied on reports from three independent experts that supported Altay&#8217;s allegations. According to one of these reports, which was quoted by the court:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Ünlü&#8217;s failure to submit the aforementioned data despite the court decision supports the idea that there are not the number of patients stated in the publication in question, considering the mentioned issues; that the number of patients in the subject publication was reported, that the names in the oral statement were changed and removed, that it was understood that there were serious similarities between the subject publication and the other publication, therefore the subject article was evaluated as ethically flawed…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The “other publication” to which the expert refers is a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.4103/ortho.IJOrtho_445_16">2018 paper</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Orthopaedics</em>, which was corrected that same year. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.4103/0019-5413.240513">corrigendum</a> states that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the authors acknowledge that Mehmet Faruk Çatma and Serhan Ünlü did not co-author or contribute to this article and were erroneously listed as co-authors. The correct authorship is “Murat Altay, İsmail Demirkale, Hakan Şeşen, Mert Karaduman”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Altay said he expects yet <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2309499018798184">another 2018 publication</a>, this one in the <em>Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery</em>, to be retracted due to &#8220;unfair authorship&#8221;:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Again, since I have contributed to this publication, I should have my name, but the authors unfairly removed my name from the publication. Likewise, ethical violation was proved by the court decision. My correspondence with the journal continues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also shared with Retraction Watch <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FARUK-DOC-ALINMASI-scaled.jpg">two</a> <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SERHAN-DOC-ALINMAS-scaled.jpg">letters</a> (in Turkish) in which the Intercollegiate Board updated him on Ünlü and Çatma’s applications for associate professorships. In Ünlü’s case, two Turkish speakers who reviewed the letters told Retraction Watch that his application had been rejected. In Çatma’s case, it is unclear whether his application had been denied, or he had been stripped of an existing associate professorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The process took a long time and in the end, the publication of two separate articles received ethical violations and the associate professorships of two doctors were withdrawn,&#8221; Altay said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-bacteria-microbe-biodiversity">Coral reefs host millions of bacteria, revealing Earth’s hidden biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coral reefs are hot spots for more than fish.</p>



<p>Fish and corals in reefs across the Pacific Ocean may <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38500-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harbor nearly 3 million varieties of bacteria</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>That means scientists are vastly underestimating Earth’s microbiome, microbiologist Pierre Galand of Sorbonne University in Paris said at a May 31 news conference. The new count of bacteria living in the Pacific Ocean’s coral reefs alone falls within current estimates for the total microbial diversity of Earth, suggesting that there exponentially more bacteria living on the planet than previously thought.</p>





<p>Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, and microbes are key for keeping the captivating creatures that live there healthy. Bacteria can help corals get the nutrients they need to survive or guard against disease. A dose of probiotics may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/probiotics-lab-coral-heat-stress-death-reef-survival-ocean-warming">offer protection from deadly heat stress</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>But the biodiversity of these reef-dwelling microbes is unclear. Most studies examine animal species in a small area or focus on only one species. And global surveys are hard to do.</p>



<p>During the Tara Pacific Expedition from 2016 to 2018, Galand and colleagues visited 99 coral reefs. At each site, they collected samples from plankton, three coral species and two fish species, amassing 5,392 samples. The team then categorized how many varieties of bacteria they could find in each sample, based on genetic differences among microbes.</p>



<p>“The word species doesn’t really work well for microbes,” says Jennifer Biddle, a microbial ecologist at the University of Delaware in Lewes who was not involved in the study. It’s difficult to compare physical characteristics like shape or color to separate such small and hard to see organisms into distinct species.</p>



<p>But genetic analyses identified more than 540,000 bacterial varieties living on the three types of organisms. That number alone — from a tiny fraction of Pacific reef fauna — accounts for up to about 20 percent of current estimates of all bacteria living on Earth, which range from 2.72 million to 5.44 million. Based on how many species of fish and corals live in the western and central Pacific, coral reefs from that ocean alone may harbor at least 2.8 million kinds of bacteria, the team calculated.</p>



<p>Such diversity may be a kind of “ecological insurance” for reefs, Galand said. For instance. multiple types of bacteria may help coral polyps in the same way, such as making sure the coral-building creatures get a key nutrient. With so much diversity, some bacteria may easily be able to replace others that are in trouble when something like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-waves-are-roasting-reefs-some-corals-may-be-resilient">high temperatures</a> cause the bacterial population to crash (<em>SN: 4/20/18</em>).</p>





<p>The estimates may still be lowballing microbial diversity in Pacific reefs, Biddle says. It’s difficult to count something that’s invisible to the naked eye, and molecular tools to look at genetic material often exclude organisms that scientists are unaware of. “We’re always undercounting microbes with the methods we’re using.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radioactive-decay-nuclear-clock-reality">Measurements of a key radioactive decay nudge a nuclear clock closer to reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hickory dickory dock, this nucleus could make a great clock.</p>



<p>A special variety of the element thorium hosts an atomic nucleus that could be used to keep time, scientists say. In a first, researchers have measured a type of decay of this thorium nucleus that releases a single particle of light. The measurement of the energy released in the decay is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05894-z#author-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times as precise</a> as estimates based on different types of decays, researchers report in the May 25 <em>Nature</em>. The improved energy measurement could galvanize work toward the first nuclear clock, which would follow in the footsteps of atomic timepieces.</p>





<p>“We have already amazing atomic clocks which run very precisely,” says nuclear physicist Sandro Kraemer of KU&nbsp;Leuven in Belgium. Those atomic clocks are based on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-atomic-clock-most-precise-yet">physics of the electrons that surround an atom</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>). A nuclear clock would be based on the atom’s nucleus. Some scientists believe nuclear clocks could be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-clock-atomic-most-precise-time-physics">even more precise than atomic clocks</a>, which are already such powerful tools that they’re used in everything from GPS satellites to experiments that test whether fundamental laws of physics hold true (<em>SN: 6/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>The well-established technology of atomic clocks is based on how an atom’s electrons jump into a higher energy state. It takes a specific frequency of light, with just the right amount of energy, to initiate the jump. The oscillation of that light acts like the ticking of a clock. A nuclear clock would be based on similar energy jumps made by a nucleus.</p>



<p>Most atomic nuclei have energy levels too far apart to allow scientists to set the jump off with a laser — a necessity for building a clock. But a particular variety, or isotope, of thorium called thorium-229 has two energy levels unusually close together — about 8 electron volts. Still, no one has been able to initiate the jump with a laser, because the size of that energy gap wasn’t precisely known until now.</p>



<p>Kraemer and colleagues measured the energy released when the thorium-229 nuclei decayed, jumping down in energy from its higher energy state. First, the team had to get thorium-229 into that high-energy state, which is called an isomer. One way to do that is to start from another element that can decay into the thorium isomer. Using a radioactive beam at the ISOLDE facility at the European physics lab CERN near Geneva, the team embedded actinium-229 into crystals of calcium fluoride and magnesium fluoride. The actinium-229 decayed, producing the thorium-229 isomer.</p>



<p>This technique helped scientists sidestep a sticking point. Normally, thorium-229 decays in a way that makes the energy difficult to measure, by transferring its energy to an electron and kicking it out of the atom. A decay that emits a particle of light, or photon, is much easier to measure, but it normally happens only once in a billion decays. </p>



<p>Embedding the thorium-229 into the crystals suppressed the decay that is more difficult to measure, making the single-photon decay dominate. That allowed the researchers to detect the single photons from isomer decays and measure their energy. The researchers estimated the decay had an energy of 8.338 electron volts. That figure agrees with earlier measurements of how far apart the two energy levels are, but is much more precise.</p>



<p>“This is a milestone that people have been looking for,” says quantum physicist Simon Stellmer of the University of Bonn in Germany, who was not involved with the study. Previous claims of detecting this type of decay haven’t held up, Stellmer says. “This seems to be the first true and real observation of this isomer decay.”</p>





<p>Physicists are now working to use a laser to set off the energy transition, going from the low-energy state to the higher-energy isomer, in the next step toward creating a nuclear clock. “It is actually something that we in our lab are trying to do,” says physicist Ekkehard Peik of the National Metrology Institute of Germany in Braunschweig, who was not involved with the new research. “That’s why we are very excited.”</p>



<p>A nuclear clock could provide a new angle on physics phenomena. “It would be very interesting to compare conventional atomic clocks and nuclear clocks because the underlying physics … is different,” Peik says. For example, nuclear clocks could reveal subtle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">variations in fundamental constants of nature</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>Another bonus of going nuclear: The clocks could be made with nuclei inside a solid material, as opposed to atomic clocks, in which atoms must be suspended inside a vacuum chamber. That means a nuclear clock could be more stable and make measurements more quickly, Kraemer says.</p>

<p>Ten years after a neuroscientist was fired from his job at a Veterans Administration Medical Center, he has won a challenge of the decision.</p>



<p>Wayne State University, where the researcher, Christian Kreipke, was studying traumatic brain injury, fired him in February 2012 following a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Kreipke-misconduct-report.pdf">research misconduct investigation</a> that found he had faked data. At the time Kreipke had a dual appointment at the John D. Dingell Veterans Administration Medical Center in Detroit.</p>



<p>Kreipke maintains that Wayne State investigated him <a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/news/2017-05-19/after-almost-seven-years-new-twists-in-wayne-state-whistleblower-case">in retaliation</a> for asking questions about how the university administered grant funding. He filed a whistleblower lawsuit after he was fired alleging that the university had committed grant fraud against the federal government, to the tune of <a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/law/2014-04-18/former-wayne-state-medical-professor-sues-accuses-university-of-defrauding-us-government#stream/0">$169 million</a>. In 2014, a judge <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/michigan/miedce/2:2012cv14836/274890/49/">dismissed the case</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127216"></span>



<p>In 2018, Kreipke was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/31/after-years-of-court-battles-former-wayne-state-researcher-barred-from-federal-grants-for-five-years/">banned</a> from receiving U.S. government funding for five years, after he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/07/18/ex-wayne-state-scientist-ori-square-off-court/">went to court</a> to challenge the Office of Research Integrity’s findings that he engaged in research misconduct. His challenge was unsuccessful, and the ban runs until July of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following another research misconduct investigation, the VA terminated Kreipke in October 2013, when his temporary appointment expired. The agency also banned him from receiving internal research funding for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kreipke, who has been working in the auto industry, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/whistleblower.htm#:~:text=Individual%20Right%20of%20Action%3A%20The,was%20taken%20because%20of%20whistleblowing.">appealed</a> the actions, which he alleged were retaliatory, to the <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/About/about.htm">U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board</a>. An administrative judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/24/existence-motive-retaliate-judge-hands-victory-whistleblower-scientist/">ruled in his favor</a> in an initial decision in 2017. The VA asked for a review of that decision, which the board upheld in its final decision, issued May 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CH150284W1-PFR-7-DocNum2031979-1.pdf">final decision</a>, the VA had the “ultimate burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of [Kreipke’s] protected disclosures.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board affirmed the administrative judge’s initial decision that the VA did not meet this burden, even when considering the retraction of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/02/researcher-lost-whistleblower-lawsuit-logs-4-retractions/">four of Kreipke’s journal articles</a> which the agency submitted as additional evidence. The final decision stated:&nbsp;</p>



<p>to the extent that the agency has submitted the retractions to impeach the appellant’s credibility, it has not shown that this evidence is new and material.</p>



<p>Kreipke has now had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKreipke%252c%2bChristian%2bW">six articles retracted</a>, by our count.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board’s final decision ordered the VA to rescind its termination of Kreipke’s appointment and a grant that was active at the time, as well as the 10-year funding ban, and to give him back pay with interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No money can restore the 12 years or more he has lost out of the field of scientific research to clear his name,” Shereef Akeel, Kreipke’s lawyer, told us. He said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, the damages that he has suffered are devastating and long lasting.&nbsp; As an upcoming scientist, who was making scientific breakthroughs in his field, to be retaliated in such a horrific manner for blowing the whistle simply shocks the conscious.&nbsp; Every American needs to know what happened to Professor Kreipke so it never happens again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>On this week Journal Club session David Haydock will present his work in a talk entitled &quot;Novel Computational Methods for Predicting Transitions in Spatiotemporal Neurodynamics between Attention and Mind-wandering&quot;.
Please see below for the asbstract of the talk and a related paper.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to characterise microstates: sets of transient,
quasi-stable topographical maps of global EEG signal distributed across the scalp with an
average duration of 80 milliseconds. In recent years, sequence analysis of EEG microstates
has become of increased interest. Patterns in EEG microstate sequences have shown
meaningful relation to mental states, psychopathologies, neurodevelopmental stages, and
neurological diseases. Whilst EEG microstate syntax captures neural spatiotemporal
dynamics at the scalp, its relationship to large neural networks and their dynamics, as
well as associated cognitive processes/mental states, remain elusive. Functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies attempted to identify the relationship between EEG
microstates and the brain's intrinsic functional networks. Previously, we have used a
similar set of fMRI states referred to as co-activation patterns (CAPs) in an attempt to
investigate how the sequencing of EEG microstates may change alongside the sequencing of
fMRI states. Here instead, we correlate the fMRI time series with gradients - a set of
axes by which large scale cortical organisation operates along. The aim of the approach is
to interpolate the location of EEG microstates within an fMRI &quot;gradient phase space&quot;, and
hence identify whether EEG microstates, and indeed EEG microstate sequences, have a
preference for a specific region of the gradient space.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://diversityhealthcare.imedpub.com/canadian-indigenous-womens-perspectives-ofmaternal-health-and-health-care-services-asystematic-review.php?aid=11328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent systematic review</a> highlighted that Indigenous women in Canada face systemic barriers and historical trauma that hinder their access to quality healthcare. Recognizing the need for change, the Indigenous Birth Support Worker (IBSW) Program was developed at the Jim Pattison Children&#8217;s Hospital Maternal Care Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. IBSWs are Indigenous women who received teachings in Indigenous birthing ceremonies, cultural practices, Doula training, breastfeeding and nutrition. They completed a practicum placement at the Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital Maternal Services Unit. The IBSW program aims to provide respectful, culturally safe, and trauma-informed care to Indigenous women and their families throughout their birthing journey, offering a positive and empowering experience.</p>
<h4>Background and Program Development</h4>
<p>The IBSW Program was established in response to an external <a href="https://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca/DocumentsInternal/Tubal_Ligation_intheSaskatoonHealthRegion_the_Lived_Experience_of_Aboriginal_Women_BoyerandBartlett_July_22_2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> of tubal ligation procedures in the Saskatoon Health Region, which uncovered disturbing accounts of Indigenous women being pressured into these procedures. Indigenous women felt helpless and invisible, unable to advocate for their healthcare needs. These negative experiences resulted in unmet needs, dissatisfaction with care, and a lack of trust in the healthcare system.</p>
<p>To address these challenges and respond to the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth and Reconciliation Commission&#8217;s Call to Action</a> #22, the IBSW Program was created. This program integrates Elders and cultural healing practices into Canadian healthcare institutions to provide culturally safe and trauma-informed care for Indigenous women.</p>
<h4>Principles of the IBSW Program</h4>
<p>The IBSW Program is guided by six fundamental principles proposed by Perinatal Services, BC, aligning with cultural safety and holistic care:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cultural safety and cultural humility: The program ensures Indigenous patients feel supported and respected by incorporating cultural practices and traditions into their birthing experiences.</li>
<li>Self-determination: Indigenous women are empowered to make informed decisions about their healthcare, gaining agency and control over their birthing journey.</li>
<li>Trusting relationships: Building trust between IBSWs and Indigenous clients is a cornerstone of the program, which includes open communication, active listening, and mutual respect to foster trust.</li>
<li>Respect for traditional practices and knowledge: IBSWs demonstrate understanding and respect for Indigenous cultural traditions, values, and traditional knowledge related to childbirth.</li>
<li>Addressing anti-Indigenous racism: The program raises awareness of overt and covert racism experienced by Indigenous individuals in healthcare settings, combating discrimination and creating inclusive care.</li>
<li>Strengths-based and trauma-informed care: The IBSW Program recognizes and builds upon the strengths of Indigenous women and their families.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>The IBSW Program represents a significant step toward achieving equitable and inclusive healthcare for all</p></blockquote>
<p>Implementing these principles, IBSWs bridge the cultural gap, allowing Indigenous families to integrate their traditional birthing ceremonies and practices. This approach restores birth as a ceremony, fostering cultural continuity and pride.</p>
<h4>Evaluation Findings</h4>
<p>A qualitative research design was employed to explore the perspectives of program workers and clients. The study, conducted between December 2019 and January 2021, included 1023 clients who accessed care through the program.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05695-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, the IBSWs discussed services provided, client needs, barriers to care, communication with other healthcare professionals, lessons learned, and recommendations for improvement. Client interviews focused on program services received, experiences with IBSWs and other healthcare staff, and overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>The findings highlight the significant, positive impact of the IBSW Program. Both program workers and clients expressed high satisfaction with the services provided. The IBSWs&#8217; understanding of Indigenous cultural practices bridged the gap between Western healthcare and traditional birthing protocols, restoring cultural continuity and ceremony.</p>
<p>Clients reported feeling empowered and having increased agency in making informed decisions about their healthcare. The trusting relationship facilitated effective communication and collaboration with other healthcare professionals involved in the client&#8217;s care.</p>
<p>The strengths-based and trauma-informed care approach of the IBSW Program proved crucial in supporting Indigenous women and families who had experienced historical and intergenerational trauma. By focusing on their strengths and providing holistic care, the IBSWs fostered resilience and healing.</p>
<h4>Recommendations:</h4>
<blockquote><p>The program contributes to healing, resilience, and the well-being of Indigenous women and their families.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Continued Education and Training: Ongoing education and training are essential to enhance IBSWs&#8217; knowledge and skills in cultural practices, trauma-informed care, and Indigenous health.</li>
<li>Strengthening Collaboration: Stronger collaboration between IBSWs and other healthcare professionals involved in Indigenous clients&#8217; care can ensure a holistic and coordinated approach to healthcare delivery.</li>
<li>Community Engagement: Connecting with local Indigenous communities, organizations, and Elders can foster cultural relationships, share knowledge, and provide comprehensive support to Indigenous families.</li>
<li>Increased Program Awareness and Expansion: Promoting the IBSW Program among Indigenous communities through community events, outreach initiatives, and collaboration with Indigenous organizations and leaders and increasing program capacity and availability.</li>
<li>Culturally Appropriate Resources: Providing culturally appropriate resources and educational materials reflecting Indigenous traditions, practices, and values to support informed decision-making and promote cultural continuity.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Lessons Learned:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Importance of Cultural Safety: Creating an environment where Indigenous clients feel safe, respected, and supported is fundamental to their positive birthing experiences.</li>
<li>Empowerment through Advocacy: The IBSWs&#8217; advocacy empowered clients, enabling them to voice their needs, preferences, and concerns.</li>
<li>Value of Traditional Practices: Integrating traditional birthing protocols and practices into the process fosters cultural pride and continuity.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The IBSW Program effectively addresses Indigenous women&#8217;s negative experiences and unmet needs in the healthcare system. By incorporating the recommendations and building upon existing strengths, the IBSW Program can serve as a model for culturally safe and trauma-informed care in Indigenous communities across Canada. Ongoing collaboration, evaluation, and involvement of Indigenous communities are crucial to ensure the program remains responsive to the diverse needs and aspirations of Indigenous women and their families.</p>
<p>The IBSW Program represents a significant step toward achieving equitable and inclusive healthcare for all, honouring Indigenous traditions, and promoting positive birthing experiences. By valuing cultural safety and humility, addressing historical trauma, and promoting self-determination, the program contributes to healing, resilience, and the well-being of Indigenous women and their families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-build-tall-nest-hills-landmarks">These ants build tall nest hills to help show the way home</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some ants have figured out how to keep from getting lost: Build taller anthills.</p>



<p>Desert ants that live in the hot, flat salt pans of Tunisia spend their days looking for food. Successful grocery runs can take the insects as far as 1.1 kilometers from their nests. So some of these ants build <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00614-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">towering hills over their nests that serve as a landmark</a> to guide the way home, researchers report in the July 10 <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“I am surprised and fascinated that ants have visual acuity at the distances implied in this work,” says ecologist Judith Bronstein of the University of Arizona in Tucson who wasn’t involved in the new study.&nbsp; It “also implies that ants regularly assess the complexity of their local habitat and change their decisions based on what they conclude about it.”</p>



<p>Desert ants (<em>Cataglyphis </em>spp.) use a navigation system called path integration, relying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/desert-ants-look-sky-rely-memory-navigate-backward">on the sun’s position and counting their steps</a> to keep track of where they are relative to their nest <em>(SN: 1/19/17</em>)<em>.</em> But this system becomes increasingly unreliable as distance from the nest increases. Like other types of ants, desert ants also rely more generally on sight and smell. But the vast, almost featureless salt pans look nearly the same in every direction.</p>



<p>“We realized that, whenever the ants in salt pans came closer to their nest, they suddenly pinpointed the nest hill … from several meters distance,&#8221; says Markus Knaden, a neuroethologist at Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. “This made us think that the hill functions as a nest-defining landmark.”</p>



<p>So Knaden and colleagues captured ants (<em>C. fortis</em>) from nests in the middle of salt pans and from along their shorelines. Only nests from the salt pan interiors had distinct hills, which can be up to 40 centimeters tall, whereas the hills on shoreline nests were lower or barely noticeable. </p>

Other ants of the same species that live closer to areas with more visual landmarks build more typical, inconspicuous nests with only a small hole for an entrance (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124977">M. Knaden</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, the team removed any hills and placed the captured insects some distance away from their nests. Ants from the salt pans’ interiors struggled more than shore ants to find home. Since the shore ants were adept at using the shoreline for guidance, they weren’t as affected by the hill removal, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>The team wanted to know if the ants were deliberately building a taller hill when their surroundings lacked any visible landmark. So, the researchers removed the hills of 16 salt pan nests and installed two 50-centimeter-tall black cylinders apiece near eight of them. The other eight nests were left without any artificial visual aid.</p>





<p>After three days, the researchers found that ants from seven of the unaided nests had rebuilt their hills. But ants from only two of the nests with cylinders had bothered to rebuild.</p>



<p>“These desert ants already told us about path integration and step counting for orientation…. But this business of building your own visual landmark, incredible,” says entomologist John Longino of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who wasn’t involved in the research. “Are they sitting down to a council meeting to decide whether they need a bigger landmark? Is this somehow an evolved&nbsp;behavior in this one desert ant species?”</p>



<p>For now, it’s unclear how the ants decide to build, or not to build, a hill. Interestingly, nest building is usually performed by younger ants that are not foragers yet, Knaden says, and have not experienced the difficulty in finding a nest in the absence of a hill. That means there is an exchange of information between the veteran foraging ants and their novice nest mates, he says.</p>



<p>Bronstein also wonders about the risks of building the taller structures. Such risks “are implied by the fact that the ants don’t build such a structure where it isn’t needed,” she says. But, “for instance, isn’t it a clear cue to ant predators that food can be found there?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-lyme-vaccine-mice-protect-humans">How a new Lyme vaccine for mice may protect people</a></h4>

              
                <p>A vaccine to fight Lyme disease, decades in the making, has received a temporary green light from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But it’s not for people — it’s for mice.</p>



<p>The vaccine isn&#8217;t a rodent-sized injection, which wouldn’t work for targeting large populations quickly. Instead, it’s coated onto edible, nutrition-free pellets that mice gobble up.</p>



<p>The vaccine makes mice develop antibodies that neutralize <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the bacterium that causes most U.S. cases of Lyme disease. When ticks imbibe the blood of a vaccinated mouse, the idea goes, they won&#8217;t get an active infection and so can’t transmit the bacteria to people or other animals.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Mice are probably one of the most important <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/4/1565/6245992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reservoir hosts</a> for Lyme disease,” especially in the eastern United States where Lyme disease is rampant, says Jean Tsao, a disease ecologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing who was not involved in developing the new vaccine. Reservoir hosts are animals with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-animals-skinks-lyme-disease-united-states-south">in their blood</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/21</em>).</p>



<p>The vaccine has a conditional license, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usda-approves-novel-vaccine-against-wildlife-spread-of-the-bacterium-responsible-for-lyme-disease-301818926.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">granted on April 29</a>. That means it is available on request by groups such as federal and state health agencies under certain conditions for roughly one year, with the possibility of renewal.</p>



<p>The first well-documented case of Lyme disease in a person in the United States was in 1970. A vaccine for humans was available from 1998 to 2002, but it was taken off the market due to low consumer demand, likely related to fears over the vaccine’s safety. Some vaccinated people reported developing arthritis, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found no meaningful difference in joint problems in vaccinated versus control groups.</p>



<p>Both the mouse and human vaccines use a protein called OspA, found on the surface of <em>B. burgdorferi,</em> to spur antibody production and prevent infection.</p>



<p>Biologist Maria Gomes-Solecki co-led the early development of the new mouse vaccine. Her team distributed an early version of the vaccine to areas in upstate New York from 2007 to 2011. <em>B. burgdorferi </em>has a two-year life cycle in ticks. This and other factors mean it takes time to see meaningful reductions in infections, says Gomes-Solecki, of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. After two and five years of vaccination, the researchers found that tick infections were reduced <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/209/12/1972/798577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 23 and 76 percent</a>, respectively, compared with control sites.</p>



<p>That early vaccine used live <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria to deliver the OspA protein. But the current, green-lighted version of the vaccine uses inactive <em>E. coli</em>. A 2020 study of the new vaccine found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10493-019-00458-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 30 percent reduction in the proportion of infected ticks</a> in residential areas after two years, compared with control sites. Several coauthors on that study work for US Biologic, the company Gomes-Solecki cofounded to develop the vaccine.</p>





<p>“The vaccine they have works, but it’s not spectacular” in terms of the rate of reducing <em>B. burgdorferi</em>–infected ticks, says Sam Telford III, an epidemiologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who was involved in the development of the human vaccine and led research in the 1990s for vaccinating mice.</p>



<p>Edible vaccines targeted at hosts have worked well for other diseases and species. For instance, vaccinating prairie dogs against the plague has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28643091/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decreased</a> levels of the disease. For now, it remains to be seen whether vaccinating mice will result in lower Lyme risks for humans. “With additional studies as the product rolls out &#8230; we’ll see more data on how well it does,” Telford says. “It’s certainly a step in the right direction.”</p>



<p>Researchers are studying many approaches to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-here-stay-scientists-finding-ways-outsmart-bloodsuckers">controlling Lyme disease</a>, including genetically engineered mice that produce <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antibodies without the need for vaccination (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>). Tsao and Telford are studying how to limit tick populations by controlling deer numbers. And a new vaccine for humans is <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late-phase testing</a> in several thousand people.</p>



<p>Vaccines that target wildlife hosts will remain one tool among many for managing exposure to Lyme disease, the researchers say. Showering after being in areas with ticks, wearing long sleeves and pants and doing tick checks will still be important.</p>



<p>“We have to continue to be vigilant,” Gomes-Solecki says.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The news&nbsp;of Zahra Jalilian’s death seemed to change as quickly as it spread.</p>



<p>On Dec. 4, 2022, the University of Tehran&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ut.ac.ir/fa/news/31710/%D8%AF%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%AE-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%82-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87">announced</a>&nbsp;that the nanotechnology graduate student had died following “a tragic self-harm incident.” Political opposition groups quickly countered that darker forces were likely at work, attributing the 31-year-old Ph.D. student’s death to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sh_a_kermanshah/status/1599524019438374912">Islamic mercenaries</a>, government&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ARAMalliance/status/1599893539374112776">functionaries</a>, and other plots. Jalilian’s family, meanwhile, has accused her adviser of getting rid of his student in order to take credit for her work —&nbsp;charges that he steadfastly denies.</p>



<p>What is clear amid the varying and sometimes overheated accounts is that Jalilian was struggling under the pressures of her research. Interviews with her former colleagues, alongside voice memos that appeared on a university messaging platform shortly after her death, provide a rare glimpse into the culture of a scientific lab in a country that is often opaque to the outside world —&nbsp;and where mental illness is often ignored, denied, and deeply freighted with stigma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-braided-anyons-quasiparticles-memory">Quantum computers braided ‘anyons,’ long-sought quasiparticles with memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anyons, anyone?</p>



<p>Scientists have created strange new particle-like objects called non-abelian anyons. These long-sought quasiparticles can be “braided,” meaning that they can be moved around one another and retain a memory of that swapping, similar to how a braided ponytail keeps a record of the order in which strands cross over each other.</p>



<p>Two independent teams — one led by researchers at Google, the other by researchers at the quantum computing company Quantinuum — have reported creating and braiding versions of these anyons using quantum computers. The Google and Quantinuum results, respectively reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05954-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 11 in <em>Nature</em></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9 at arXiv.org</a>, could help scientists construct quantum computers that are resistant to the errors that currently bedevil the machines.</p>





<p>Non-abelian anyons defy common intuition about what happens to objects that swap locations. Picture the street game with cups and balls, where a performer swaps identical cups back and forth. If you weren’t watching closely, you’d never know if two cups had been moved around one another and back to their original positions. In the quantum world, that’s not always the case.</p>



<p>“It’s predicted that there is this crazy particle where, if you swap them around each other while you have your eyes closed, you can actually tell after the fact,” says physicist Trond Andersen of Google Quantum AI in Santa Barbara, Calif. “This goes against our common sense, and it seems crazy.”</p>



<p>Particles in our regular 3-D world can’t do this magic trick. But when particles are confined to just two dimensions, the rules change. While scientists don’t have a 2-D universe in which to explore particles, they can manipulate materials or quantum computers to exhibit behavior like that of particles that live in two dimensions, creating objects known as quasiparticles.</p>



<p>All fundamental subatomic particles fall into two classes, based on how identical particles of each type behave when swapped. They are either fermions, a class that includes electrons and other particles that make up matter, or bosons, which include particles of light known as photons.</p>



<p>But in two dimensions, there’s another option: anyons. For bosons or fermions, swapping identical particles back and forth or moving them around one another can’t have a directly measurable effect. For anyons, it can. </p>



<p>In the 1990s, scientists realized that a specific version of an anyon, called a non-abelian anyon, could be used to build quantum computers that might safeguard fragile quantum information, which is easily knocked out of whack by minute disturbances.</p>





<p>“For fundamental reasons these anyons have been very exciting, and for practical reasons people hope they might be useful,” says theoretical physicist Maissam Barkeshli of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved with either study.</p>



<p>Google’s team created the anyons using a superconducting quantum computer, where the quantum bits, or qubits, are made of material that conducts electricity without resistance. Quantinuum’s study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, is based on a quantum computer whose qubits are composed of trapped, electrically charged atoms of ytterbium and barium. In both cases, scientists manipulated the qubits to create the anyons and move them around, demonstrating a measurable change after the anyons were braided.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously created and braided a less exotic type of anyon, called an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-braided-quasi-particles-anyons">abelian anyon</a>, within a 2-D layer of a solid material (<em>SN: 7/9/20</em>). And many physicists are similarly questing after a solid material that might host the non-abelian type.</p>



<p>But the new studies create non-abelian states within qubits inside a quantum computer, which is fundamentally different, Barkeshli says. “You’re kind of synthetically creating the state for a fleeting moment.” That means it doesn’t have all the properties that anyons within a solid material would have, he says.</p>



<p>In both cases, much more work must be done before the anyons could create powerful, error-resistant quantum computers. Google’s study, in particular, produces an anyon that’s akin to a fish out of water. It’s a non-abelian within a more commonplace abelian framework. That means those anyons may not be as powerful for quantum computing, Barkeshli says.</p>



<p>It’s not all about practical usefulness. Demonstrating that non-abelian anyons really exist is fundamentally important, says Quantinuum’s Henrik Dreyer, a physicist in Munich. It “confirms that the rules of quantum mechanics apply in the way that we thought they would apply.”</p>

                <p>While volunteering at the University of New Mexico’s Children’s Hospital in Albuquerque, Quinton Smith quickly realized that he could never be a physician.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Then an undergrad at the university, Smith was too sad seeing sick kids all the time. But, he thought, “maybe I can help them with science.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smith had picked his major, chemical engineering, because he saw it as “a cooler way to go premed.” Though he ultimately landed in the lab instead of at the bedside, he has remained passionate about finding ways to cure what ails people.</p>





<p>Today, his lab at the University of California, Irvine uses tools often employed in fabricating tiny electronics to craft miniature, lab-grown organs that mimic their real-life counterparts. “Most of the time, when we study cells, we study them in a petri dish,” Smith says. “But that’s not their native form.” Prodding cells to assemble into these 3-D structures, called organoids, can give researchers a new way to study diseases and test potential treatments.</p>



<p>By combining Silicon Valley tech and stem cell biology, scientists are now “making tissues that look and react and function like human tissues,” Smith says. “And that hasn’t been done before.”</p>



<h4>The power of stem cells</h4>



<p>Smith’s work began in two dimensions. During his undergraduate studies, he spent two summers in the lab of biomedical engineer Sharon Gerecht, then at Johns Hopkins University. His project aimed to develop a device that could control oxygen and fluid flow inside minuscule chambers on silicon wafers, with the goal of mimicking the environment in which a blood vessel forms. It was there that Smith came to respect human induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>



<p>These stem cells are formed from body cells that are reprogrammed to an early, embryonic stage that can give rise to any cell type. “It just blew my mind that you can take these cells and turn them into anything,” Smith says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smith ultimately returned to Gerecht’s lab for his Ph.D., exploring how <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602883#sec-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical and chemical cues</a> can push these stem cells toward becoming blood vessels. Using a technique called micropatterning — where researchers stamp proteins on glass slides to help cells attach — he spurred cells to organize into the beginnings of artificial blood vessels. Depending on the pattern, the cells formed <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1808021115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-D stars, circles or triangles</a>, showing how cells come together to form such tubular structures. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="245" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-quinton-smith_inline.jpg" alt="An image of three shapes, all blue with a green border.

Smith</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While a postdoc at MIT, he transitioned to 3-D, with a focus on liver organoids.</p>



<p>Like branching blood vessels, a network of bile ducts carry bile acid throughout the liver. This fluid helps the body digest and absorb fat. But artificial liver tissue doesn&#8217;t always re-create ducts that branch the way they do in the body. Cells growing in the lab “need a little bit of help,” Smith says.&nbsp;</p>





<p>To get around the problems, Smith and his team pour <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202102698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a stiff gel around minuscule acupuncture needles</a> to create channels. After the gel solidifies, the researchers seed stem cells inside and douse the cells in chemical cues to coax them to form ducts. “We can create on-demand bile ducts using an engineering approach,” he says.</p>



<p>This approach to making liver organoids is possible because Smith speaks the language of biology and the language of engineering, says biomedical engineer Sangeeta Bhatia, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at MIT and Smith’s postdoc mentor. He can call on his cell biology knowledge and leverage engineering techniques to study how specific cell types are organized to work together in the body.</p>



<p>For example, Smith’s lab now uses 3-D printing to ensure liver tissues grown in the lab, including blood vessels and bile ducts, organize in the right way. Such engineering techniques could help researchers study and pinpoint the root causes behind some liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease, Smith says. Comparing organoids grown from cells from healthy people with those grown from cells from patients with liver disease — including Hispanic people, who are disproportionately affected — may point to a mechanism.</p>



<h4>Looking beyond the liver</h4>



<p>But Smith isn’t restricting himself to the liver. He and his trainees are branching out to explore other tissues and diseases as well.</p>



<p>One of those pursuits is preeclampsia, a disease that affects pregnant women, and disproportionately African American women. Women with preeclampsia develop dangerously high blood pressure because the placenta is inflamed and constricting the mother’s blood vessels. Smith plans to examine lab-grown placentas to determine how environmental factors such as physical forces and chemical cues from the organ impact attached maternal blood vessels.</p>



<p>“We’re really excited about this work,” Smith says. It’s only recently that scientists have tricked stem cells to enter an earlier stage of development that can form placentas. These lab-grown placentas even produce human chorionic gonadotropin, the hormone responsible for positive pregnancy tests.</p>



<p>Yet another win for the power of stem cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coopers-black-orchid-fungus-conservation">A hunt for fungi might bring this orchid back from the brink</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you ever come across a <a href="https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/gastrodia-cooperae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Cooper’s black orchid in the wild, you probably would mistake it for a stick — or perhaps an odd potato if you dig a little underneath it. Unlike many others of its kind, this delicate flower is devoid of lush green leaves and flashy petals. Its stem lies on the floor of New Zealand’s broadleaf forests for most of the year, only popping up during the summer months to blossom with pendulous brown and white blooms. And rather than growing a tangle of roots, the orchid sprouts a pale brown tuber.</p>



<p>But the chances of encountering a <a href="https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/gastrodia-cooperae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooper’s black orchid</a> (<em>Gastrodia cooperae</em>) are getting slimmer. Fewer than 250 adult plants have been found since botanist Carlos Lehnebach identified the species in 2016, and they live in only three sites across New Zealand. To make matters worse, feral pigs, rabbits and other animals like to nosh on the tubers. And the forests where the orchid grows are being <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clearing-land-feed-human-population-2050-threat-species">cleared for farmland</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>). In 2018, New Zealand’s Department of Conservation&nbsp; <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/science-and-technical/nztcs22entire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classified the orchid</a> as <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/conservation-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally critical</a>, emphasizing its high risk of extinction.</p>





<p>At the Lions Ōtari Plant Conservation Laboratory in Wellington — part of the country’s only botanical garden focused on native plants — Lehnebach and colleagues are working to bring Cooper’s black orchid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-microbes-crops-food-endangered-species">back from the brink</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>From one of the lab’s three fridge-sized incubators, conservationist Jennifer Alderton-Moss pulls out dozens of petri dishes containing the orchids’ speck-sized seeds and root-emanating tubers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="360" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-360x450.jpg" alt="A man and woman looking at plants, some marked with reddish pink tape" class="wp-image-3124780" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-306x383.jpg 306w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-149x186.jpg 149w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-464x580.jpg 464w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1-621x776.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/051223_RDC_orchid_inline-1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124780">Jennifer Alderton-Moss and Carlos Lehnebach count the number of seed capsules on adult <em>Gastrodia cooperae</em> plants in a New Zealand forest, marked with reddish pink tape.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124780">Karin van der Walt</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The researchers dissect the roots under a microscope to look for fungi that could help the seeds germinate. Early in life, most orchids rely on fungi for essential nutrients and minerals. To conserve Cooper’s black orchids, the team needs to identify exactly which fungal species supplies the plant with nutrients. DNA testing helps the team rule out known orchid pathogens. Potential candidates are then extracted from roots and grown on petri dishes. Once they’re mature enough, fungi get paired up with seeds on another dish.</p>



<p>“We’re working with a rare species, so we can’t just [take] hundreds of seeds,” says conservationist Karin van der Walt. The team first tested its methods on <a href="https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/gastrodia-sesamoides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gastrodia sesamoides</em></a>, a common orchid that also grows tubers. &#8220;If we get it wrong, at least we’re not causing extinction,” she says.</p>



<p>It took the researchers about a year of trial-and-error to find the right germination method for Cooper&#8217;s black orchid. Once they did, they had to wait another two to four months for the seeds to sprout.</p>



<p>Alderton-Moss removes a dish from a resealable bag <a href="https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/gastrodia-sesamoides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>and points out a fungus, an orchid leaf for the fungus to feed on and a few seeds that have now developed into light brown tuberlike grains. Cooper’s black orchid may have finally found its perfect match in <em>Resinicium bicolor</em>.</p>





<p>Commonly known as white-rot fungus, <em>R</em>. <em>bicolor</em> is a scourge on Douglas fir trees — a farmed nonnative tree in New Zealand — but seems to provide Cooper’s black orchid seeds with the nutrients and minerals they need to germinate. The next step is to grow Cooper’s black orchid plants from seedlings. That will reveal whether the fungus that helps seeds germinate is the same one that sustains the adult plant.</p>



<p>In the meantime, seeds and fungi are kept in a chilly slumber in one of the lab’s sterile rooms. Seeds are stored inside an incubator at –18° Celsius, while fungi are stored inside a cryogenic container with liquid nitrogen at –200° C. “If we lose [the orchid entirely], we have seeds banked in the lab,” van der Walt says. &#8220;We can at least grow them back — we know we can get that far.”</p>

<p>To test the viability of banked seeds and fungi, the team plans to thaw them at quarterly intervals to see how much they’ll grow.</p>



<p>Ultimately, researchers want to seed wild areas with this plant-fungi pair to boost the population — without all the lab steps. Though there are still other factors to work out to make wild growth a reality, the lab technique is “a powerful way to prevent extinction,” van der Walt says, not only for the Cooper&#8217;s black orchid but other endangered species, too.<a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/science-and-technical/nztcs22entire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-prediction">Why the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season is especially hard to predict</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s hard to know how busy this year’s<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/#top" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Atlantic hurricane season will be</a>, thanks to a rarely observed combination of ocean and climate conditions.</p>



<p>The Atlantic Ocean is in an active storm era, a yearslong period of increasing storm activity. Plus sea surface temperatures there are much higher than usual this year, which can fuel storms, Matthew Rosencrans, the lead hurricane forecaster for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said May 25 at a news conference. But this year will also see the onset of an El Niño phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation ocean and climate pattern, which tends to suppress hurricane formation.</p>





<p>That’s not a scenario that has occurred in historical records often, Rosencrans said. “It’s definitely kind of a rare setup for this year.”</p>



<p>He and his colleagues reported that there’s a 40 percent chance that Atlantic hurricane activity will be near normal this year. Near normal is actually unusually high for an El Niño year. But there’s also a 30 percent chance that activity will be above normal, and a 30 percent chance it’ll be below normal.</p>



<p>Overall, the agency is predicting 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to nine are predicted to become hurricanes, with sustained wind speeds of at least 119 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour). Between one and four of those hurricanes could be category 3 or greater, with wind speeds of at least 178 kph (111 mph). The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1 and ends November 30.</p>



<p>There’s little consensus among other groups’ predictions, in part due to the uncertainty of what role El Niño will play. On April 13, <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, announced that it anticipated a below-average season</a>, with just 13 named storms, including six hurricanes. On May 26, the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/tropical-cyclones/seasonal/northatlantic2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.K. Meteorological Office announced that it predicts an extremely busy hurricane season</a> in the Atlantic, with 20 named storms, including 11 hurricanes, of which five could be category 3 or greater. The long-term average from 1991 to 2020 is 14 named storms.</p>



<p>So far, 23 different groups have submitted predictions for the 2023 Atlantic season to <a href="https://seasonalhurricanepredictions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a platform hosted by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain</a>, which allows users to compare and contrast the various predictions. There’s a large spread among these predictions, ranging “from below average to well above average,” says Philip Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who is responsible for the group’s seasonal Atlantic hurricane forecasts.</p>



<p>That spread is likely the result of two big sources of uncertainty, Klotzbach says: the strength of the El Niño (and when during the year it’s expected to develop), and whether the Atlantic’s surface water temperatures will stay above average.</p>



<p>Each group’s forecast is based on a compilation of many different computer simulations of ocean and atmospheric conditions that might develop during the hurricane season. How often those models agree leads to a probability estimate. NOAA’s models struggled to agree: “That’s why probabilities are not 60 to 70 percent,” Rosencrans said. “That’s to reflect there’s a lot of uncertainty this year in the outlook.”</p>





<p>An emerging El Niño phase is signaled by abnormally warm waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which in turn is tied to shifts in wind strength and humidity around the globe. One of the ways that El Niño tinkers with climate is that it alters the strength of winds in the upper atmosphere over the northern Atlantic Ocean. Those stronger winds can shear off the tops of developing storms, hampering hurricane formation. Warmer ocean waters like those in the Atlantic right now, on the other hand, fuel hurricanes by adding energy to storm systems. How active a season it will be depends on which of those two forces will prevail.</p>



<p>The Met Office, for example, reported that its climate simulations suggest that the wind shear due to this year’s El Niño will be relatively weak, while surface ocean temperatures will remain well above average. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season">Similarly anomalously warm waters in 2017</a> were found the be the primary cause behind that year’s glut of intense Atlantic hurricanes (<em>SN: 9/28/18</em>).</p>



<p>In the future, hurricane forecasts could become ever more uncertain. It’s unknown <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable">how climate change will affect large-scale ocean and climate patterns</a> such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation in general (<em>SN: 8/21/19</em>). Computer simulations have suggested that as the atmosphere warms, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">these globe-scale “teleconnections</a>” may become somewhat disconnected, which also makes them potentially harder to predict (<em>SN: 2/13/23</em>). Climate change is also expected to increase ocean temperatures.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, the Pacific Ocean’s hurricane season has already begun with a powerful storm, Super Typhoon Mawar, which battered Guam as a category 4 cyclone before roaring toward the Philippines on May 25, strengthening to category 5.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quake-crust-thickness-earth">A quake on Mars showed its crust is thicker than Earth’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>Planetary scientists now know how thick the Martian crust is, thanks to the strongest Marsquake ever observed.</p>



<p>On average, the crust <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/users/549578/articles/627343-global-crustal-thickness-revealed-by-surface-waves-orbiting-mars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is between 42 and 56 kilometers thick</a>, researchers report in a paper to appear in Geophysical Research Letters<em>.</em> That’s roughly 70 percent thicker than the average continental crust on Earth.</p>



<p>The measurement was based on data from NASA’s InSight lander, a stationary seismometer that recorded waves rippling through Mars’ interior for four Earth years. Last May, the entire planet shook with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">magnitude 4.7 quake that lasted more than six hours</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22</em>). “We were really fortunate that we got this quake,” says seismologist Doyeon Kim of ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>InSight recorded seismic waves from the quake that circled Mars up to three times. That let Kim and colleagues infer the crust thickness over the whole planet.</p>



<p>Not only is the crust thicker than that of the Earth and the moon, but it’s also inconsistent across the Red Planet, the team found. And that might explain a known north-south elevation difference on Mars.</p>



<p>Topological and gravity data from Mars orbiters have shown that the planet’s northern hemisphere is substantially lower than the southern one. Researchers had suspected that density might play a part: Perhaps the rocks that make up northern Mars have a different density than those of southern Mars.</p>



<p>But the crust is thinner in the northern hemisphere, Kim and colleagues found, so the rocks in both hemispheres probably have the same average densities. That finding helps scientists narrow down the explanations for why the difference exists in the first place.</p>



<p>Knowing the crust’s depth, the team also calculated that much of Mars’ internal heat probably originates in the crust. Most of this heat comes from radioactive elements such as potassium, uranium and thorium. An estimated 50 to 70 percent of those elements are probably in the crust rather than the underlying mantle, computer simulations suggest. That supports the idea that parts of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">Mars still have volcanic activity</a>, contrary to a long-held belief that the Red Planet is dead (<em>SN: 11/3/22)</em>. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/house-built-recycled-diapers">This house was built partly from recycled diapers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meet the house that diapers built.</p>



<p>Researchers have designed and erected a house that has shredded, disposable diapers mixed into its concrete and mortar. A single-story home of about 36 square meters can pack nearly 2 cubic meters of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32981-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used diapers into its floors, columns and walls</a>, the team reports May 18 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Using recycled diapers as composite building materials would not only shrink landfill waste but also could make such homes more affordable, the team says, a particular need in developing countries like Indonesia where the demand for low-cost housing far outstrips the supply.</p>





<p>Indonesia’s urban population has increased by about 4 percent per year in the last three decades, and more of its people are moving to urban centers. Over two-thirds of Indonesians are expected to live in urban areas by 2025, says environmental engineer Siswanti Zuraida of the University of Kitakyushu in Japan. That population boom is putting a heavy strain on both housing demand and waste management, says Zuraida, who is originally from Indonesia. Used disposable diapers mostly pile up in landfills or get incinerated, adding to a growing waste problem.</p>



<p>The materials used to build a house, meanwhile, particularly those needed to shore up its structural integrity, are often the biggest barrier to making homes affordable. So researchers have previously examined the possibility of using a wide variety of unconventional materials that could also save costs. These materials included many that would otherwise pile up as waste, such as the husks of rice grains or fly ash, the fine residue left over from the combustion of pulverized coal. Disposable diapers, as it happens, contain a lot of potentially useful building material, such as wood pulp, cotton, rayon and plastic.</p>



<p>Zuraida and colleagues assessed how much of the sand, gravel and other traditional building materials used in mortar and concrete could be replaced by diapers — washed, dried, sterilized and shredded — without reducing the strength of the structures. They created six different samples of concrete and mortar by mixing different proportions of diaper material with cement, sand, gravel and water. Crushing the samples in a machine let the researchers test how much weight each could bear.</p>



<p>The team then went on to design — and then build — a small, single-story, two-bedroom, one-bathroom home based on the maximum amount of diaper waste they calculated they could use. Recycled diapers could replace up to 27 percent of the traditional materials used in load-bearing structural components like columns and beams without losing significant strength, the team found. For buildings with more floors, that fraction is somewhat less: A three-story home could use up to 10 percent disposable diapers in its load-bearing structures, the team calculated. As for nonstructural components like wall partitions or garden paving blocks, shredded diapers could replace up to 40 percent of the sand.</p>



<p>Despite the need for more affordable housing, there are significant hitches that stand in the way of adopting diapers or other low-impact nonconventional materials, Zuraida says.</p>



<p>Diapers’ plastic components would have to be separated from the organic fibers, a complicated recycling process currently available only in developed nations. And Indonesia’s building regulations restrict construction materials to concrete, bricks, wood and ceramics — materials that also bear a high cost in terms of carbon emissions.</p>





<p>&#8220;Thinking about how to use waste for other purposes is an excellent idea,&#8221; says chemist Christof Schröfl of Technische Universität Dresden in Germany. But there may be limits on the ultimate environmental friendliness of repurposing used diapers in buildings, he says, due to the existing challenges of separating and sanitizing diapers in waste. “It’s maybe worthwhile to start thinking about ways to replace single-use diapers” with something less frequently disposed of.</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’&nbsp;</em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em>&nbsp;without their permission? We recently launched the&nbsp;</em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When web domains of legitimate journals expire, fraudulent publishers have an opening to hijack them by registering the expired domains and creating clone websites that mimic the genuine journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, John <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-how-hijack-journal">Bohannon</a> found fraudulent publishers had hijacked the websites of several legitimate journals indexed in Web of Science. The expired domains of <em>GMP Review</em> and <em>Ludus Vitalis</em>, which Web of Science listed as their official homepages, were registered by the fraudulent publishers, who created clone journals offering to publish papers for a fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking over expired domains remains a successful strategy for fraudulent publishers, because potential authors may use the websites listed in scientometric databases to verify the authenticity of a journal. Recently, three examples have come to light of journals with domains that expired and were hijacked by fake journals.</p>



<span id="more-127185"></span>



<p>One of the hijacked titles is the <em>Russian Law Journal</em>. The website of the journal expired at the end of 2022, and a new journal imitating the original was set up by January 2023:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="660" height="245" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png?resize=660%2C245&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127186" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png?w=974&amp;ssl=1 974w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png?resize=768%2C285&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>



<p>Clarivate’s Master Journal List still pointed to the compromised site, and unauthorized content penetrated the Web of Science Core Collection as well. The genuine journal stopped publishing in 2021, so all 59 papers indexed in 2022 and 2023 potentially originate from the hijackers:</p>

<p>A screenshot from May 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><em>The Journal of Academic Leadership</em> is another title that has been compromised. The domain of the journal expired and was offered for<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211216105909/http://www.academicleadership.org/"> sale for $3,000</a> as of December 2021. A buyer emerged by March 2022, and the domain now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220302124710/http://www.academicleadership.org/index.php/jal">hosts the fake journal</a>. Scopus had listed the compromised link, but the index later removed it.</p>

As a result, the link to the journal in Clarivate&#8217;s Master Journal List has been compromised:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="660" height="329" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=660%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127187" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?w=974&amp;ssl=1 974w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=768%2C382&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>



<p>The strategy of hijackers of registering expired domains likely will continue. Journals that have ceased publishing are particularly at risk, as their web domains will eventually expire, making them vulnerable to dishonest publishers. Journals that have launched a new website on an alternative domain also are vulnerable, as are those that may have inadvertently failed to renew their domain registration. </p>



<p>Taking over expired domains provides fraudulent publishers with the opportunity to compromise homepage links in scientometric databases, as well as index unauthorized content in some cases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-dysentery-giardia-parasite-toilet">Oldest traces of a dysentery-causing parasite were found in ancient toilets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giardia has plagued people for a long time.</p>



<p>The parasite can bring about dysentery — a miserable (and occasionally deadly) mixture of diarrhea, cramps and fever. Scientists have now uncovered traces of the giardia parasite in the remains of two roughly 2,600-year-old toilets once used by the wealthy denizens of Jerusalem. The remains are <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182023000410" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest known biological evidence of giardia</a> anywhere in the world, researchers report May 25 in <em>Parasitology</em>.</p>



<p>The single-cell parasite <em>Giardia duodenalis </em>can be found today in human guts around the planet. This wasn’t always the case — but working out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-bacteria-infection-medieval-child-haemophilus-influenzae-type-b">how pathogens made their debut</a> and moved around is no easy feat (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). While some intestinal parasites can be preserved for centuries in the ground, others, like giardia, quickly disintegrate and can’t be spotted under a microscope.</p>





<p>In 1991 and 2019, archeologists working at two sites in Jerusalem came across stone toilet seats in the remains of mansionlike homes. These “were quite posh toilets” used by “swanky people,” says Piers Mitchel, a paleoparasitolgist at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>The original excavators of soil taken from beneath the seats of these toilets glimpsed traces of roundworm and other possible intestinal parasites in soil samples put under a microscope. Mitchel and his colleagues built on this analysis by using antibodies to search for the remains of giardia and two other fragile parasites in the millennia-old decomposed feces under both seats.</p>



<p>There was “plenty of doubt” that giardia was around in Jerusalem at the time because it’s so hard to reconstruct the movement of ancient disease, Mitchel says.</p>



<p>But the find hints that it was a regular presence in the region, says Mattieu le Bailly, a paleoparasitolgist at the University Bourgogne Franche-Comté in Besançon, France, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>The idea that a pathogen like giardia, which spreads via contaminated water and sometimes flies, existed and was possibly widespread in ancient Jerusalem makes a lot of sense, Mitchel says, given the hot, dry, insect-ridden climate around the Iron Age city.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-microbes-climate-young-trees">Soil microbes that survived tough climates can help young trees do the same</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microbial stress can be a boon for young trees.</p>



<p>Saplings grown in soil microbes that have experienced drought, cold or heat are <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2027?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D04632587591522892811387901287291181512%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1684867390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to survive</a> when faced with those same conditions, researchers report in the May 26 <em>Science</em>. And follow-up tests suggest that the microbes’ protective relationship with trees may linger beyond initial planting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team’s findings could aid massive tree planting efforts by giving new saplings the best chance of survival over the long run, says Ian Sanders, a plant and fungal ecologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. “If you can control which microbes are put onto tree saplings in a nursery, you can probably help to determine whether they’re going to survive or not when they’re transplanted to the field.”</p>





<p>As climate change pushes global temperatures ever higher, many species must either adapt to new conditions or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-early-primates-lived-swampy-arctic">follow their ideal climate</a> to new places (<em>SN: 1/25/23</em>). While forests’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-antarctica-south-pole-roughly-90-million-years-ago">ranges have changed</a> as Earth’s climate has warmed and cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the pace of current climate change is too fast for trees to keep up (<em>SN: 4/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>Trees live a long time, and they don’t move or evolve very quickly, says Richard Lankau, a forest ecologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. They do have close relationships with fast-adapting soil microbes, including fungi, which can help plants survive stressful conditions.</p>



<p>But it was unclear whether microbes that had previously survived various climates and stresses might give inexperienced baby trees encountering a changing climate a leg up. With friends in the soil, “trees might have more tools in their toolkit than we give them credit for” to survive tough conditions, Lankau says.</p>



<p>For the study, Lankau and fellow ecologists Cassandra Allsup and Isabelle George — both also at UW–Madison — collected soil from 12 spots in Wisconsin and Illinois that varied in temperature and amount of rain. The team then used the soils to plant an abundance of 12 native tree species, including white oak (<em>Quercus alba</em>) and silver maple (<em>Acer saccharinum</em>). Overall, “we had thousands of plants we were monitoring,” Allsup says.</p>



<p>Those saplings grew in the soils in a greenhouse for two months before being transplanted in one of two field sites — one warm and one cold. To simulate drought, some trees in each spot were placed under transparent plastic sheets that blocked direct rainfall.</p>



<p>One site in northern Wisconsin was at the northern edge of the trees’ range and represented how trees might take root in a new area that’s getting warm enough for them to grow. There, trees planted in soil containing cold-adapted microbes better survived Wisconsin’s frigid winter temperatures. Plants that faced drought in addition to the cold, on the other hand, didn’t have the same benefit.</p>



<p>The other location, set up in central Illinois, was designed to represent a region where the climate is getting too hot or dry for the tree species to tolerate. Saplings grown in soil with microbes from arid spots were more likely to survive a lack of rain. But those grown in soils with heat-tolerant microbes were only slightly more likely to survive when they received normal rainfall.&nbsp;</p>

That connection could help saplings expand their range amid changing climate.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124886">Cassandra Allsup</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Resident species already living in the area didn’t outcompete all of the transplanted microbes. Newly introduced fungi persisted in the soil for three years, a sign that any protective effects might last at least that long, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s still unclear which microbes best aid the trees. Analyses of microbes living in the soil hinted that fungi that live inside plant roots may better help trees survive drought. Cold-adapted soils seem to have fewer fungal species. But soils also contain bacteria, archaea and protists, Sanders says. “We don’t know what it is yet that seems to affect the plant survival in these changing climates.”</p>





<p>Determining which microbes are the important ones and whether there are specific conditions that best suit the soil is next up on the list, Allsup says. For example, can dry-adapted soil from Iowa help when planting trees in Illinois? “We need to think more about soils and combinations and [transplant] success… to actually save the forest.”</p>



<p>One caution, Sanders says, is that transporting microbes from one place to another en masse could bring the bad along with the good. Some microbes might be pathogens in the new place where they’re transplanted. “That’s also a big danger.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>More than 5,000 animal species previously unknown to science live in a pristine part of the deep sea.</p>



<p>Their home — called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone — sits in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. The zone is roughly twice the size of India, sits 4,000 to 6,000 meters deep and is largely a mystery, like much of the deep sea.</p>



<p>In a new study, scientists amassed and analyzed more than 100,000 published records of animals found in the zone, with some records dating back to the 1870s. About 90 percent of species<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00534-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> from these records were previously undescribed</a>: There were only about 440 named species compared with roughly 5,100 without scientific names. Worms and arthropods make up the bulk of the undescribed creatures, but other animals found there include sponges, sea cucumbers and corals, the researchers report May 25 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“The diversity down there does surprise me,” says study coauthor Muriel Rabone, a data analyst and biologist at the Natural History Museum in London. “It’s just astonishing.”</p>

<h3>Life in the deep</h3>



<p>A new study analyzed more than 100,000 records of animals found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a large area of the seafloor in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. About 90 percent of species from the records were unknown to science (orange).

<p>Due to its rich content of minerals like cobalt and nickel, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is sought after by mining companies. About a sixth of it, roughly a million square kilometers, has already been promised to companies for exploration.</p>





<p>Many of the named species in the new study have been found only in the zone, emphasizing how important it is to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-deep-sea-sponge-could-play-starring-role-monitoring-ocean-health">establish a biodiversity baseline</a> for the area before mining starts, Rabone says. But the area is deep and remote, making data collection there difficult and expensive (<em>SN: 11/10/17</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, deep-sea ecosystems are connected to the ecosystems above them, Rabone says, such as through nutrient cycling. Scientists need to understand more about the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and areas like it to anticipate how the effects of mining may bubble up to the ocean surface.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="168" height="210" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif?resize=168%2C210" alt="" class="wp-image-127175" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michael Bailey</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Springer Nature will retract an article that reported results of a survey of parents who thought their children’s gender dysphoria resulted from social contagion. The move is “due to concerns about lack of informed consent,” according to tweets by one of the paper’s authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9">Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible Cases</a>,” was published in March in the <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>. It has not been cited in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, but Altmetric, which tracks the online attention papers receive, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9/metrics">ranks</a> the article in the top 1% of all articles of a similar age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) is, the article stated, a “controversial theory” that “common cultural beliefs, values, and preoccupations cause some adolescents (especially female adolescents) to attribute their social problems, feelings, and mental health issues to gender dysphoria,” and that “youth with ROGD falsely believe that they are transgender,” in part due to social influences.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://psychology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/profiles/michael-bailey.html">Michael Bailey</a>, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and the paper’s corresponding author, tweeted:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bailey told Retraction Watch that he would “respond when [he] can” to our request for comment, following “new developments on our end.” Neither Springer Nature nor Kenneth Zucker, editor in chief of <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>, has responded to similar requests. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper reported the results of a survey of parents who contacted the website ParentsofROGDKids.com, with which the first author is affiliated. According to the abstract, the authors found:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Pre-existing mental health issues were common, and youths with these issues were more likely than those without them to have socially and medically transitioned. Parents reported that they had often felt pressured by clinicians to affirm their AYA [adolescent and young adult] child’s new gender and support their transition. According to the parents, AYA children’s mental health deteriorated considerably after social transition.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Soon after publication, the paper attracted criticism that its method of gathering study participants was biased, and that the authors ignored information that didn’t support the theory of ROGD.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em> is the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR), which tweeted on April 19:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The episode prompted a May 5 &#8220;<a href="https://www.fairforall.org/open-letters/archives-of-sexual-behavior/">Open Letter in Support of Dr. Kenneth Zucker and the Need to Promote Robust Scientific Debate</a>&#8221; from the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism that has now been signed by nearly 2000 people.</p>



<p> On May 10, the following publisher’s note was added to the article: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>readers are alerted that concerns have been raised regarding methodology as described in this article. The publisher is currently investigating this matter and a further response will follow the conclusion of this investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Six days later, the publisher removed the article’s supplementary information “due to a lack of documented consent by study participants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The story may feel familiar to readers who recall what happened to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">another paper in 2018</a>. In that paper, Brown University’s Lisa Littman coined the term ROGD. Following a backlash, Brown <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/29/reader-outcry-prompts-brown-to-retract-press-release-on-trans-teens/">took down a press release</a> touting the results, and the paper was eventually <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214157">republished with corrections</a>.</p>



<p>Bailey has been accused of mistreating transgender research participants, but an investigation by bioethicist Alice Dreger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170124/">found</a> that of the many accusations, “almost none appear to have been legitimate.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://unherd.com/2023/05/why-is-my-gender-research-being-cancelled/">post on UnHerd</a> earlier this month, Bailey responded to the reported concerns about the study lacking approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and that the way the participants were recruited biased the results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IRB approval was not necessary, Bailey wrote, because Suzanna Diaz, the first author who collected the data, was not affiliated with an institution that required it. “Suzanna Diaz” is a pseudonym for “the mother of a gender dysphoric child she believes has ROGD” who wishes to remain anonymous for the sake of her family, Bailey wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper included the following statement about its ethical approval:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The first author and creator of the survey is not affiliated with any university or hospital. Thus, she did not seek approval from an IRB. After seeing a presentation of preliminary survey results by the first author, the second author suggested the data to be analyzed and submitted as an academic article (he was not involved in collecting the data). The second author consulted with his university’s IRB, who declined to certify the study because data were already collected. However, they advised that publishing the results was likely ethical provided data were deidentified. Editor’s note: After I reviewed the manuscript, I concluded that its publication is ethically appropriate, consistent with Springer policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his UnHerd post, Bailey quoted from the journal’s <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10508/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20involving%20human%20participants,%20their%20data%20or%20biological%20material">submission guidelines</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the Editor&#8217;s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Regarding the methodological limitations of the study, these were addressed forthrightly and thoroughly in our article,” Bailey wrote.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/painting-beer-brew-yeast-art-canvas-denmark">19th century painters may have primed their canvases with beer-brewing leftovers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beer breweries’ trash may have been Danish painters’ treasure.</p>



<p>The base layer of several paintings created in Denmark in the mid-1800s <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade7686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contains remnants of cereal grains and brewer’s yeast</a>, the latter being a common by-product of the beer brewing process, researchers report May 24 in <em>Science Advances.</em> The finding hints that artists may have used the leftovers to prime their canvases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Records suggest that Danish house painters sometimes created glossy, decorative paint by adding beer, says Cecil Krarup Andersen, a conservator at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. But yeast and cereal grains have never been found in primer.</p>





<p>Andersen had been studying paintings from the Danish Golden Age, an explosion of artistic creativity in the first half of the 19th century, at the National Gallery of Denmark. Understanding these paintings’ chemical compositions is key to preserving them, she says. As part of this work, she and colleagues looked at 10 pieces by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, considered the father of Danish painting, and his protégé Christen Schiellerup Købke.</p>



<p>Canvas trimmings from an earlier conservation effort allowed for an in-depth analysis that wouldn’t have otherwise been possible, since the process destroys samples. In seven paintings, <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </em>proteins turned up, as well as various combinations of wheat, barley, buckwheat and rye proteins. All these proteins are involved in beer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biochemist-brews-wild-beer">fermentation</a> (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>).</p>



<p>Tests of an experimental primer that the researchers whipped up using residual yeast from modern beer brewing showed that the mixture held together and provided a stable painting surface — a primary purpose of a primer. And this concoction worked much better than one made with beer.</p>



<p>Beer was the most common drink in 1800s Denmark, and it was akin to liquid gold. Water needed to be treated prior to consuming and the brewing process took care of that. As a result, plenty of residual yeast would have been available for artists to purchase, the researchers say.</p>



<p>If the beer by-product is found in paintings by other artists, Andersen says, that information can help conservators better preserve the works and better understand the artists’ lives and craftsmanship. “It’s another piece of the puzzle.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-paralysis-walk">A brain implant helped a man with paralysis walk more naturally</a></h4>

              
                <p>A system that restores communication between the brain and spine has enabled a man paralyzed by a spinal cord injury to regain near-natural walking ability.</p>



<p>Once the patient’s brain activity was decoded, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06094-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain-spine interface</a> took mere minutes to calibrate, after which the man reported natural-feeling control over movements. He still needs crutches but can easily navigate ramps and steps, surpassing gains from previous treatments, researchers report May 24 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“The results are consistent with what I’d hope would happen, which is encouraging,” says V. Reggie Edgerton, a physiologist at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, Calif., who was not involved in the study. Still, in terms of treating spinal cord paralysis, he says, “we’re at the stage of the Wright brothers and flight.”</p>





<p>Spinal cord injuries can interrupt communication between the brain and spine, causing paralysis. Previous research showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">stimulating spinal cord nerves can produce movement</a> (<em>SN: 8/3/22</em>), but this is the first time that a patient’s own brain activity has been used to re-establish voluntary control of leg movements.</p>



<p>A biking accident 12 years ago left the 40-year-old man, who prefers to be identified by his first name, Gert-Jan, paralyzed with an incomplete spinal cord injury. Six years later, he enrolled in a clinical trial involving a spinal cord implant that stimulates nerves that control leg movements. He <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01663-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regained the ability to step with a walker</a>, but this involved making unnatural heel movements, picked up by motion sensors, to trigger preprogrammed nerve stimulation patterns. He had difficulty starting and stopping, and could walk only over flat surfaces.</p>



<p>The new study aimed to hand control over to Gert-Jan&#8217;s brain. “Despite using the [spinal cord implant] stimulation for three years, he hit a plateau in his recovery, and became interested in using the new brain-controlled stimulation,” says Grégoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. “So he became our first test pilot.”</p>



<p>Courtine and colleagues added a brain implant to create a system that translates thought into movement. Two electrode arrays that sit on the surface of the brain record activity from the sensorimotor cortex, a region of the brain that helps direct muscle movements. These signals are sent wirelessly to a processing unit that converts them into stimulation patterns, which are transmitted to the spinal cord implant.</p>



<p>After implantation, Courtine and colleagues asked Gert-Jan to attempt leg joint movements while they analyzed his brain activity. Different patterns of activity differentiated hip, knee and ankle movements, the researchers found, enabling them to map brain signals to intended movements. The team created stimulation patterns targeting muscles that control putting weight down, pushing forward and leg swings, to reproduce walking motions. During use, an artificial intelligence algorithm translates incoming brain signals into appropriate command signals for the spinal implant.</p>



<p>The researchers calibrated the system so that Gert-Jan could control the amount of movement. “This brings a more fluid walking pattern,” Courtine says, helping him adapt his foot placement and even climb staircases.</p>





<p>“The stimulation before was controlling me, and now I’m controlling the stimulation,” Gert-Jan said May 23 during a news conference.</p>



<p>A “neurorehabilitation” training program while using the device led to mobility improvements even with the brain-spine interface turned off, the researchers found. “This suggests new nerve connections developed,” Courtine says.</p>



<p>Researchers need to understand more about how this recovery works. “The question is: Where in the brain is getting connected to where in the spinal cord? And we don&#8217;t really know that,” Edgerton says. “We need to figure out how the two are working together.”</p>



<p>The extent of Gert-Jan&#8217;s recovery delivered quality-of-life boosts, such as moving around the house independently, or standing at a bar drinking with friends. “That&#8217;s the goal of a lot of people who are completely paralyzed,” Edgerton says. “To be standing at a bar, looking people eye to eye.” While many paralyzed people prioritize other problems, such as bathroom function and blood pressure, this study aimed only to restore mobility.</p>



<p>Gert-Jan has been using the system for nearly two years now, Courtine says, and the brain implant has remained stable and reliable.</p>



<p>The researchers think the approach will work for other patients, but caution that the extent of recovery may depend on the severity of injury. “You have to be careful to calibrate expectations,” Courtine says. “But I&#8217;m confident we can reproduce the same outcome, especially in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury.”</p>



<p>The team plans to apply the approach to the upper limbs too, neuroscientist Henri Lorach, also at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, said during the news conference. “We are initiating a clinical trial in three participants that will target these circuits.” It may also be possible to treat paralysis caused by stroke, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Courtine and colleagues developed a version of the system that Gert-Jan could operate himself at home, but further improvements are still needed. The processing unit is bulky, for example, and the brain implant involves two 5-centimeter-wide cylinders that sit in holes cut in the skull.</p>



<p>Onward Medical, a Lausanne-based company cofounded by Courtine, is working on miniaturizing the brain implant and processing unit, Courtine says, to develop a commercial version that “is easy for patients to use in daily life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiny-mice-armadillo-armor-tails">Spiny mice have armadillo-like armor in their tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spiny mouse is an unassuming rodent, but it’s armed with a very special tail.</p>



<p>CT scans show the <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)00856-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail is sheathed in a secret blanket of bony plates</a>. Before the scans, only one other group of modern mammals was known to wield this kind of armor: armadillos. The discovery, reported May 24 in <em>iScience</em>, may mean that the skin bones are more widespread in mammals than previously thought and could shed light on their evolution.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The rodent’s secret was revealed when evolutionary biologist Edward Stanley of the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville put a museum specimen of a spiny mouse (<em>Acomys spp</em>.) in an X-ray machine as part of a multi-institutional project to develop 3-D digital models of all vertebrate life.</p>



<p>It was a “nondescript looking” mouse with slightly spiky fur, Stanley says. But in the initial X-ray, its tail looked unusual. “It looked kind of dark and weird,” he says.</p>



<p>A more detailed CT scan showed the mouse’s whole tail was covered in overlapping bony plates within the skin, under the surface layers.</p>



<p>To understand how the bony plates develop, Stanley and his colleagues teamed with Malcolm Maden, a developmental biologist at the University of Florida. The team scanned the tails of newborn spiny mice up to those that were 6 weeks old. Bony plates form first near the base of the tail and then as the mouse ages, grow down the tail to its tip. CT scans revealed that three other species in the same subfamily as the spiny mouse also have armor-studded tails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These bony plates, called osteoderms, may help keep spiny mice and their relatives alive. The rodents’ skin is especially fragile and easily tears off, particularly on the tail. It’s hypothesized that the tearaway skin is a macabre defense, where attacking predators are left with a mouthful or paw full of shed skin. The plates may prevent predators from piercing too deep. </p>



<p>“If you can stop the teeth or the claws of your predator at the tearaway boundary, then it’s much easier to get away,” Stanley explains. The mice regenerate the lost skin later.</p>



<p>But the tail’s skin bones might protect against more than just predators. For some reason, spiny mice routinely bite each other’s tails, says Ashley Seifert, a developmental biologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. “So maybe they have evolved osteoderms as armament, but to defend their tails from each other instead of predators.”</p>





<p>To better understand the biological underpinnings of the bony skin, the researchers took skin samples from the tails of newborn spiny mice in places with and without osteoderms and analyzed gene activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In skin samples with osteoderms, the activity of a suite of genes associated with bone cell development was boosted compared with samples without osteoderms. But the activity of genes that make keratin, a key building block for skin, was ramped down. The next step, Maden says, is to see how all these genes actually grow the osteoderms.</p>



<p>The research could help provide insights into osteoderm evolution. Bony skin is found in a variety of reptile groups, having evolved independently in crocodilians, many different lizard groups and some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ankylosaur-dinosaur-tail-club-bludgeon">dinosaurs</a> (but no birds) (<em>SN: 12/6/22</em>). Madagascar’s fish-scaled geckos have osteoderms and shed skin like spiny mice. Aside from the rodents in the new study and armadillos, the only other known mammals with bony skin are all extinct: an ancient hedgehog-like animal called <em>Pholidocercus</em>, ground sloths and armadillo relatives called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/surprise-ancient-armadillos-are-related-modern-armadillos">glyptodonts</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/16</em>).</p>



<p>Delving into gene activity patterns is rarely done in osteoderm research, says Chris Broeckhoven, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. Having this comparative data from mice available could yield key evolutionary insights.</p>



<p>One key insight, Maden says, could be “why [osteoderms] keep appearing in evolution and then disappear.”</p>



<p>It’s also possible osteoderms are more common among vertebrates than previously thought. No snakes were known to have the bony skin and then in April researchers reported finding them in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33244-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sand boas</a>.</p>



<p>These discoveries are “a good example of how you should look at the world around you,” Maden says. “Who knows what you will discover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-lightning-bolt-contort-earth">Jupiter’s lightning bolts contort the same way as Earth’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>On Jupiter, lightning jerks and jolts a lot like it does on Earth.</p>



<p>Jovian lightning emits radio wave pulses that are typically separated by about one millisecond, researchers report May 23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The energetic prestissimo, the scientists say, is a sign that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38351-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the gas giant’s lightning propagates in pulses</a>, at a pace comparable to that of the bolts that cavort through our own planet’s thunderclouds. The similarities between the two world’s electrical phenomena could have implications for the search for alien life.</p>





<p>Arcs of lightning on both worlds appear to move somewhat like a winded hiker going up a mountain, pausing after each step to catch their breath, says Ivana Kolmašová, an atmospheric physicist at the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague. “One step, another step, then another step … and so on.”</p>



<p>Here on Earth, lightning forms as turbulent winds within thunderclouds cause many ice crystals and water droplets to rub together, become charged and then move to opposite sides of the clouds, progressively generating static electrical charges. When the charges grow big enough to overcome the air’s ability to insulate them, electrons are released — the lightning takes its first step. From there, the surging electrons will repeatedly ionize the air and rush into it, lurching the bolt forward at an average of hundreds of thousands of meters per second.</p>



<p>Scientists have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exotic-lightning-jupiter-clouds-nasa-juno-images">superbolts observed in Jovian clouds</a> might also form by collisions between ice crystals and water droplets (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>). But no one knew whether the alien bolts extended and branched in increments, as they do on Earth, or if they took some other form.</p>



<p>For the new study, Kolmašová and her colleagues used five years of radio wave data collected by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-juno-jupiter-moons-mission">NASA’s Juno spacecraft</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/22</em>). Analyzing hundreds of thousands of radio wave snapshots, the team found radio wave emissions from Jovian lightning appeared to pulse at a rate comparable to that of Earth’s intracloud lightning — arcs of electricity that never strike ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If bolts extend through Jupiter’s water clouds at a similar velocity as they do in Earth’s clouds, then Jovian lightning might branch and extend in steps that are hundreds to thousands of meters long. That’s comparable in length to the jolted strides of Earth’s intracloud lightning, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“That’s a perfectly reasonable explanation,” says atmospheric physicist Richard Sonnenfeld of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, who wasn’t involved in the study. Alternatively, he says, the signals could be produced as pulses of electrical current propagate back and forth along tendrils of lightning that have already formed, rather than from the stop-and-go advancements of a new bolt. On Earth, such currents cause some bolts to appear to flicker.</p>



<p>But stop and go seems like a sound interpretation, says atmospheric physicist Yoav Yair of Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel. Kolmašová and her colleagues “show that if you&#8217;re discharging a cloud … the physics remains basically the same [on Jupiter as on Earth], and the current will behave the same.”</p>





<p>If that universality is real, it could have implications for the search for life elsewhere. Experiments have shown that lightning strikes on Earth could have smelted some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry">chemical ingredients</a> needed to form the building blocks of life (<em>SN: 3/16/21</em>). If lightning is discharging in a similar way on alien worlds, Yair says, then it could be producing similar ingredients in those places too.</p>

<p>A researcher who used similar, related, or identical research to publish over 30 studies in various academic journals will have four more of those papers retracted, bringing his total to ten retractions, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>Hossein Mohammadhosseini was formerly listed as a researcher at the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Technology, Malaysia. His retracted papers all relate to a method to make more sustainable concrete by adding metalized plastic fibers, polypropylene fibers, and/or palm oil fuel ash.</p>



<p>Four of Mohammadhosseini’s studies are being retracted from the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production.</em> They are:</p>



<span id="more-127165"></span>

<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620307733?via%3Dihub">Waste metalized film food packaging as low cost and ecofriendly fibrous materials in the production of sustainable and green concrete composites</a> (published in 2020 and cited 44 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science)</li>

</ul>



<p>Though the studies have not yet been retracted, Retraction Watch learned of the upcoming retractions from an anonymous whistleblower who goes by the name Artemisia Stricta. Artemisia, who originally raised the concerns about Mohammadhosseini’s research in October 2022, was informed of the upcoming retractions on May 8 by Chunyan Wang, assistant editor of the journal, and alerted Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, told Retraction Watch that “the investigations of the five papers have concluded, and the retraction notices for the four papers will be published in the coming weeks.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In October 2022, Artemisia emailed editors of each of the 11 journals that had published these studies. Between 2015 and 2022, Artemisia noted that Mohammadhosseini published 33 papers using the same research on this formulation of concrete. Artemisia wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Notably, even when different materials or conditions were reported (e.g., prepacked vs. mixed-in aggregate, unexposed vs. sulfate-exposed concrete), identical results were sometimes shown. This indicates potential falsification. It is also notable that identical (or nearly-identical) work was often published with varying authorship lists, indicating either ghost or gift authorship.</p>



<p>Generally, it appears that the authors submitted similar publications in parallel, which would have allowed them to avoid detection for duplicate submission. Of course, as part of the submission process, authors are generally required to attest that they will not do so, as such duplicate publication wastes the resources of journals/publishers and skews the scientific literature.</p>



<p>As I am sure you will agree, such conduct, if confirmed, would violate publication ethics and may constitute grounds for retraction of the papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of these 33 papers had already been retracted when Artemisia wrote this message, and since then, five others have been retracted, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHossein%2bMohammadhosseini">Retraction Watch Database</a>.</p>



<p>Though Artemisia originally raised concerns about five papers published in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production,</em> the journal ultimately decided to retract only four of them. In response to questions from Retraction Watch,an Elsevier spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Artemisia Stricta contacted the Editor of JCLP with concerns about five papers.&nbsp; We investigated all five papers and found that – in four of them – images and data had been re-used from already published papers.&nbsp; The author was asked to provide explanations, denied duplication but ultimately upon further review the decision was made to retract 4 of the 5 papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, Artemisia reiterated that they believe all five papers contain duplicated material and should have been retracted. Artemisia also said they believed that in all, there were about 40 papers published by this researcher and their coauthors that should be retracted.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Though Mohammadhosseini did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, Artemisia forwarded us an email that Mohammadhosseini had sent them in October 2022, which Artemisia said is the first such email they have received directly from a researcher asking them to stop raising concerns about the researcher’s work. In the message, Mohammadhosseini wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We expected if there were a mistakes in our papers, you would contact us directly and help us to resolve it, but unfortunately, you did this in a way that the journal’s editor, my colleagues, and friends thought wrong about me, and it embarrassed me.</p>



<p>I don’t understand the reason behind this action. You have emailed all journals and mentioned duplication, which is not correct, as I reuse some of the common pictures in relevant papers.</p>



<p>You have done what you want to destroy my life and career, which is not fair, but I confirm and guarantee that there is no wanted duplication to ignore the journal’s ethics.</p>



<p>I hope you are satisfied with what you did, and I request you stop playing with my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Artemisia wrote that while they “feel a lot of compassion” for Mohammadhosseini, he does not seem to understand how his misconduct has damaged this field of study. For instance, Artemisia noted that because research like this is used in building codes, falsified data can claim lives.</p>



<p>Along with his message, Mohammadhosseini forwarded Artemisia an email he had received claiming to know Artemisia’s identity. Artemisia said the claims in the message were not only false but dangerous, and that at least one researcher, who might be the one identified in the email, has had death threats made against them and their family based on the false notion that this person was Artemisia. Artemisia wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By and large, the scientific community (to include editors at prominent journals and publishers) has received my allegations with hostility. Revenge, retaliation, and bluster seem to be kneejerk reactions, and their deterrent effect cannot be overlooked. Prominent researchers, when not actively complicit, often allow this atmosphere to fester by inaction.</p>

                <p>Deblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind.</p>

<p>Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natya, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I&#8217;m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.”</p>



<p>That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders.</p>





<p>“She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.”</p>



<h4>A focus on nanoelectronics</h4>



<p>Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering.</p>



<p>At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house.</p>



<p>“That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.”</p>





<p>After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics.</p>



<p>One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/century-scientific-innovation-invention-technology">common silicon transistors</a> (<em>SN: 3/18/22</em>). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering.</p>



<h4>When tech meets the body</h4>



<p>Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00912-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amyloid-beta plaques</a> as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32862-4#article-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cell Rover</a>, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules.</p>



<p>Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it.</p>

<p>She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.”</p>



<p>One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.”</p>
