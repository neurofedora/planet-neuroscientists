              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fossil-body-like-duck">This dinosaur may have had a body like a duck’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dinosaur unearthed in Mongolia is making a splash among paleontologists, as its sleek physique adds potential evidence to the idea that some dinos were suited for life in the water. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a><em>Natovenator polydontus</em></a> may be the first known nonbird dinosaur to have possessed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04119-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a streamlined body comparable to that of modern diving birds</a>, researchers report December 1 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. <em>Natovenator</em> and other closely related dinosaurs may have been swimming predators, the researchers say, challenging the popular notion that all dinos were landlubbers.</p>





<p><em>Natovenator</em> was small like a duck and probably used its forelimbs when swimming, says Yuong-Nam Lee, a vertebrate paleontologist at Seoul National University in South Korea. “We think that <em>Natovenator</em> lived in shallow water and ate small fish,” he says.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that researchers have suspected a nonbird dinosaur of having an aquatic lifestyle. For years, paleontologists have debated whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-bones-dinosaur-swim-paleontology">spinosaurs were aquatic predators</a> (<em>SN: 3/23/22</em>). And in 2017, researchers reported that <em>Halszkaraptor </em>—a close relative of <em>Natovenator</em> — had features <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analogous to those of aquatic birds and reptiles</a>, though the scientists were unable to infer a body shape.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Lee and colleagues analyzed a well-preserved skeleton from the Hermiin Tsav fossil formation in Mongolia, found in rocks from the Upper Cretaceous, which dates to about 100 million to 66 million years ago. The skull, teeth, neck and limbs of <em>Natovenator</em> are akin to those of <em>Halszkaraptor</em>, the team reports, suggesting the two probably had comparable lives.</p>



<p>What’s more, the orientation of <em>Natovenator</em>’s ribs indicates that it had a streamlined body like that of modern waterfowl, with a compressed and flattened rib cage akin to aquatic reptiles, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The close resemblance between <em>Natovenator</em> and a duck or cormorant is almost certainly an example of what’s known as convergent evolution, says Thomas Holtz Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved in the study. “Similar body plans evolve because of similar lifestyles.”</p>



<p>It remains unclear just how strong a swimmer <em>Natovenator</em> may have been. The dinosaur’s forelimbs appear short, and its hind limbs seem to lack attributes of kick-propelled swimmers like loons, Holtz says. But semiaquatic mammals like minks and some other successful modern swimming predators have skeletons that aren’t highly specialized for life in the water either, he says. “So <em>Natovenator</em>&nbsp;might be intermediate in swimming ability, between something like a mink and a loon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon">Artemis missions will usher in a new, more diverse crew of astronauts</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When astronaut Eugene Cernan stepped from the moon’s surface into his spacecraft in December 1972, he was aware it was the end of an era. His mission, Apollo 17, was the last of the Apollos.</p>



<p>“Take your final look at the valley of Taurus-­Littrow, except from orbit,” Cernan said of the view before the craft lifted off. “We’re on our way, Houston!”</p>



<p>And with that, the last person to walk on the moon returned to Earth. No other boots have touched lunar soil in the 50 years since then.</p>





<p>Now, NASA is preparing to go back, and China is on its way too. On November 16, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">U.S. Artemis I mission launched</a> to bring the first crew-ready space capsule to the vicinity of the moon since Cernan and his two crewmates left half a century ago.</p>



<p>That spacecraft isn’t carrying any astronauts; the mission was designed to check technology and other systems that will eventually take people to the moon, on Artemis III, no sooner than 2025. This time, NASA says, the intention is to stay longer, to learn how to live on the moon and eventually send people to Mars.</p>



<p>The obvious next question is, who gets to go?</p>



<p>Thanks to social, political and scientific changes over the last 50 years, today’s astronauts are not like the astronauts of the past. They are more diverse in sex, race and field of expertise. The next set of people to walk on the moon will face different challenges and require different skills, temperaments and support systems than the Apollo crews.</p>



<p>And some groups are thinking about how to include people with disabilities in the spacefaring future. Preparing for a more permanent human presence in space will require rethinking the right stuff. Future lunar crews may reflect our lives on Earth more faithfully, making space for everyone.</p>



<h4>Becoming an astronaut</h4>





<p>NASA has declared that upcoming missions to the moon will include a woman and a person of color, setting two firsts for lunar astronauts.</p>



<p>The next visitors to the moon haven’t been selected yet. But there are only about 50 people to choose from. The 43 active astronauts and 10 astronaut candidates, who are still in training, come from a variety of backgrounds. The list includes medical doctors, military pilots, geologists, microbiologists, engineers and others. Of NASA’s active astronauts, about 37 percent are women.</p>



<p>“The astronaut corps is, of course, NASA’s most visible workforce,” says Lori Garver, who was NASA’s deputy administrator from 2009 to 2013. “Because of that, NASA has, I think, a responsibility to have an astronaut corps that reflects the nation.”</p>

Apollo 17’s crew was Harrison Schmitt (back left), Eugene Cernan (front) and Ronald Evans (back right). </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119638">NASA</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Modern astronauts are already different from those of Apollo. For its first class of astronauts in 1959, NASA recruited military fighter pilots shorter than 5 feet, 11 inches (because of the tight space in the Mercury space capsule). At the time, all military test pilots were white men, so all astronauts were too.</p>



<p>NASA recruited its first class of “scientist-­astronauts” in 1964. The move drew criticism from pilots. In an interview, Cernan — who shared his spot on Apollo 17 with the only geologist to walk on the moon, Harrison Schmitt — called science “a parasite” on the moon program. “Science is not the reason we learned to fly,” he griped. Cernan later referred to Schmitt as “Dr. Rock” and worried that he wouldn’t be able to get out of a tough spot on his own.</p>



<p>But according to NASA’s mission report, Apollo 17 was “the most productive and trouble-free manned mission.” It “demonstrated the practicality of training scientists to become qualified astronauts.”</p>



<p>Today, 42 percent of NASA’s active astronauts have a research science or medicine background, in fields ranging from oceanography to physics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2.jpg" alt="A photo of the 10 astronaut candidates for 2022 in their blue flightsuits" class="wp-image-3119639" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-521x383.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-612x450.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-253x186.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119639">The most recent class of NASA astronaut candidates is more diverse.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119639">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Counterintuitively, though, NASA’s definition of “astronaut” doesn’t require going to space. Once you’ve made it through the strenuous and selective application and training process, you’re a member of the astronaut corps, whether you leave Earth or not.</p>



<p>The first step in applying to be an astronaut is “unnervingly underwhelming,” says geobiologist Zena Cardman, who joined the astronaut corps in 2017 but has not yet been to space. “You submit a very short resume to USAJobs.gov, and then you wait for a long time,” she says. (Full disclosure: I applied to the astronaut program myself in 2012. I kept the rejection postcard for years.)</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/frequently-asked-questions-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimum requirements</a> for applying are being a U.S. citizen, having a master’s degree in engineering, biological science, physical science or math, and two years of professional experience, including teaching or graduate school. Pilots can substitute the two years of experience with 1,000 hours of jet-flying experience. Candidates who make it through that first round travel to Houston for a two-round interview process.</p>



<p>“What we’re looking for in these first few Artemis missions … first and foremost, is technical expertise,” astronaut Reid Wiseman, chief of NASA’s Astronaut Office, said in a news briefing on August 5. A lot of those desired skills revolve around acquiring resources to support long stays.</p>



<p>Artemis III plans to send people to the lunar south pole, which could be a reasonable place to put a long-term base. It has regions that will be in sunlight for the entire 6.5-day mission. The light will help generate energy from solar power. And it has regions in permanent shadow that host pockets of water ice, which could be used for water and fuel for human settlements.</p>



<p>The possibility of finding and using resources on the moon is part of why science backgrounds, especially in geology, are now more important for astronauts. But in the astronaut corps, everyone does everything, Cardman says. Her background is in geology and microbiology. She’s done fieldwork in Antarctica, the Arctic, underground caves and on ocean research vessels. Space “seemed like the ultimate fieldwork endeavor,” she says.</p>



<p>To round out her skills, she’s getting trained in engineering and aviation, and her test pilot colleagues are learning geoscience. “We will have roles, but we won’t be siloed,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Science expertise</h3>



<p>A science background is considered a necessity for today’s 43 active astronauts (top). Many are in the military, but also have degrees in medicine, geoscience or physics. The original Apollo astronauts (bottom) were mostly military pilots, some with engineering backgrounds.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skill, the next most important characteristic NASA looks for is: “Are you a team player?” Wiseman says. Working together was important on the Apollo missions. But those missions lasted 12 days at most, with three days tops on the lunar surface. Astronauts on a weeks-long Artemis mission to the moon or a years-long mission to Mars will need to survive in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigors-mars-trip-make-teamwork-priority">stressful, challenging, isolated environments</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/14, p. 22</em>). Getting along becomes crucial to staying alive.</p>



<p>That explains why the interview process includes teamwork exercises and group dynamic activities to simulate the kinds of situations astronauts would find themselves in, Cardman says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="619" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030.jpg" alt="NASA engineers wear spacewalk backpacks with headlamps in a dark space" class="wp-image-3119644" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-637x383.jpg 637w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-749x450.jpg 749w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-309x186.jpg 309w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-965x580.jpg 965w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119644">NASA engineers wear spacewalk backpacks with headlamps to practice sample collection in New Mexico. At the lunar south pole, some regions will be in permanent shadow.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119644">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The interview also involves medical screening. The details are not public, but “they really go quite in depth,” Cardman says. There’s no official requirement for any particular body type or standards for physical fitness, like running a mile in a certain time or doing a certain number of pull-ups. “It’s more functional,” she says. As long as you can meet the mental and physical demands of a spacewalk, it doesn’t matter how you get in shape. Cardman’s exercise of choice is powerlifting.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there are thousands more applicants than there are openings for astronaut jobs. “The final selection is somewhat subjective,” Garver says. “So I think it’s absolutely appropriate that you look at the demographic along with the qualifications.”</p>



<h4>Take it to the limit</h4>



<p>There’s one other medical requirement for the next people to walk on the moon: They can’t have already spent too much time in space.</p>



<p>Over time, exposure to the harmful charged particles that zip around space can increase a person’s risk of developing cancer. For <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">astronauts’ safety</a>, NASA limits the amount of radiation an astronaut can absorb over their career. (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>From 1995 until 2021, those bounds were dependent on an astronaut’s age and sex. The limit was the amount of radiation that correlates with a 3 percent risk of dying from cancer caused by radiation exposure. But because women were considered to have higher risks of dying from radiation-­related cancers, that limit grounded female astronauts earlier than males. </p>



<p>Effectively, women were allowed about 150 millisieverts of radiation in their careers, while men were allowed closer to 800 millisieverts, says emergency medicine physician and aerospace engineer Erik Antonsen of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>



<p>“It was a consequence of the way we were calculating risk that women were being limited much earlier in their career and could not fly as much as men,” Antonsen says. “We had to dive deep into that stuff, come back up for air and say, hey man, there’s not justification for this stuff. And it’s causing discrimination against females.” </p>



<p>Antonsen notes that no openly transgender astronauts have flown, but he can’t think of any medical issues that would hold them back.</p>



<p>In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26155/chapter/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a report urging NASA to change the limit</a> to 600 millisieverts of radiation over a career for everyone, regardless of sex or age. That amounts to about 400 days in orbit around the moon or 680 days on the lunar surface, some of the time in a habitat, for an astronaut with no other spaceflight exposures.</p>

<p>NASA, the German Aerospace Center and the Israel Space Agency are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">flying a pair of dummies on Artemis I</a> to test a radiation protection vest for female astronauts, which might help reduce radiation risks further if worn on future missions.</p>



<p>That could all be good news for Cardman. She and her cohort, who are beginning to fly missions to the International Space Station, are likely candidates for Artemis III. Cardman herself could be the first woman on the moon.</p>



<p>She’s modest about it. “I would be thrilled to go to the moon, of course,” she says. “Depending on the timeline, who knows. But it’s pretty exciting to know I work with the people who will be the first ones setting foot on the moon in half a century.”</p>



<h4>The new right stuff</h4>



<p>Even though there are no official astronaut health standards, NASA does end up selecting “the healthiest damn people to fly,” Antonsen says.</p>



<p>Commercial spaceflight is expanding the pool of people who get to go to space. Companies like SpaceX, which is building the moon lander for Artemis III, and Blue Origin are already sending paying customers on space joyrides. These companies have different goals, incentives and risk tolerances than NASA does.</p>



<p>“The beautiful thing about this is, the goal is eventually to send just people,” Antonsen says. “It’s changing. And it should change.”</p>



<p>SpaceX would not comment on how it chooses who it sends to space. But Antonsen speculates that some companies’ only criteria for their customers will be “making sure they can walk up the stairs to get to the vehicle.”</p>



<p>And even that might not be the final barrier for long. Some organizations are investigating how disabled people can live and work in space.</p>



<p>“Disability inclusion affects how we design our spacecraft,” says AJ Link, communications director of the nonprofit advocacy group AstroAccess. “If we can make space accessible, we can make any space accessible.”</p>



<p>By organizing flights for disabled people on zero gravity aircraft, AstroAccess aims to show that disabled people have strengths that could be useful in space. In October 2021, 12 people with various disabilities took a parabolic flight, in which the plane took a repeating upward and downward trajectory to give the passengers inside a few minutes of weightlessness.</p>

Linguist Sheri Wells-Jensen (back row, second from left), who is blind, was surprised that her usual instincts worked differently in zero G.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119641">ASTROACCESS/ZERO G CORPORATION</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“My personal, emotional conclusion was, it was wicked fun,” says Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Wells-­Jensen, who is blind, was one of the people on that flight. She plans to try it again in December, on the anniversary of Apollo 17’s departure from the moon, despite describing herself as a “big chicken.”</p>



<p>“I’m not a thrill seeker. I don’t even like roller coasters,” she says. But in zero g, she was “surprised by how not terrified” she was.</p>



<p>She was also surprised at how useless her normal instincts were. In simulated lunar gravity, a tiny hop sent her flying to conk her head on the ceiling. The plane was so noisy that her normal ways of orienting by sound didn’t work. She felt like there was no up or down. “I’m damn well oriented on Earth, but boy, there were several moments there where I had nothing,” she says.</p>



<p>Learning how disabled people behave on spaceflights will help all astronauts in the future, regardless of disability, Wells-Jensen says.</p>

<p>“Space is a profoundly disabling environment. It’s always trying to kill you,” Wells-Jensen says. What happens if an astronaut loses their vision, whether temporarily or permanently, on the way to Mars? Or if the spacecraft lights go off, or smoke makes it hard to see? Designing a spacecraft to be used by blind people, she says, will help all astronauts navigate those situations.</p>



<p>Similarly, if an astronaut loses use of their legs, knowing how people with amputations or limb deficiencies navigate a spacecraft will give them options. “For able-bodied people who acquire a disability in space, we’re not just going to send them home,” Wells-Jensen says. “How do we make sure they’re safe and can still do their jobs?”</p>



<p>Wells-Jensen hopes that sending disabled people on zero-g flights will raise awareness of how capable they are as well. “A disabled person could take a suborbital flight tomorrow,” she says. “I think at this point, the limiting factor is cultural, rather than technological.”</p>



<p>The European Space Agency is also recruiting disabled astronauts, with physical characteristics such as limb deficiencies or short stature that would normally disqualify them. These &#8220;parastronauts&#8221; will help study the kinds of adaptations needed for disabled people to fly in space. In November, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Astronauts/John_McFall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESA named its first parastronaut</a>: John McFall, a British paralympic sprinter and orthopedist, whose right leg was amputated after a motorcycle accident when he was 19.</p>



<p>Both ESA and AstroAccess argue that now is the time to consider accessibility in space, before the spacefaring vehicles of the future are finalized.</p>



<p>“Retrofitting is hard,” Wells-Jensen says. “Building things the way you want them is much easier.”</p>



<p>That could be especially important for private companies like SpaceX that are designing moon vehicles. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial space transportation</a>, has a legal moratorium on setting regulations about the safety of participants in private spaceflights until October 2023 to give the industry time to get established and collect data. AstroAccess, for one, wants to help guide those regulations.</p>



<p>“We want to fundamentally change the way humanity goes to space,” Wells-Jensen says. “We can’t become a spacefaring species if only some of us can go.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawaii-mauna-loa-volcano-erupting-what-you-need-to-know">Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano is erupting. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mauna Loa, Earth’s largest active volcano, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mauna-loa/mauna-loa-eruption-webpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abruptly woke up on November 27</a> after an almost 40-year nap. The volcano shot fountains of lava as high as 50 meters into the air, while rivers of molten rock streamed down the volcano’s flanks toward Saddle Road, the main highway on Hawaii’s Big Island.</p>



<p>Mauna Loa stands shoulder to shoulder with four other volcanoes, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilauea-volcano-pyrotechnics-lava-no-signs-stopping">explosively dramatic Kilauea</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/18</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mauna-kea-volcano-dormant-tiny-earthquakes-gas-magma">quietly grumbling Mauna Kea</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>). Kilauea has grabbed headlines in recent years with its pyrotechnics while Mauna Loa has slumbered. But the sleeping giant hasn’t been so quiet in the past, says Ingrid Johanson, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in Hilo.</p>





<p>Historically, she says, Mauna Loa would awaken every seven years or so on average. This last stretch between eruptions “is quite a big gap.”</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Johanson about how Mauna Loa tends to wake up, what’s in the path of the lava and what sort of neighbors Kilauea and Mauna Loa are.</p>



<h4>Were there warning signs that Mauna Loa was about to erupt?</h4>



<p>“It depends on what you mean by warning,” Johanson says. “In a manner of speaking, we’ve known that Mauna Loa was showing signs of unrest since 2015.” At that time, she says, there was an uptick in the rate of local earthquakes, as well as in GPS observations of land deformation — a bulging upward of the land surface that indicates magma is on the move below ground. </p>



<p>Those signs tapered off a bit and then increased again over the last six months, suggesting “that the situation was evolving,” Johanson says. But when the volcano would actually erupt wasn’t possible to determine. “Fundamentally, we had about an hour and a half of warning,” she says. That was the time span between when researchers noted a sudden swarm of earthquakes pointing to an imminent eruption and the emergence of lava.</p>



<p>That short notice is “true to form” for Mauna Loa, she adds. Its “other eruptions have evolved very quickly in the same way.”</p>



<h4>How is the monitoring of Mauna Loa different than it was before the last eruption in 1984?</h4>





<p>“One of the big differences between 1984 and now is the technology,” Johanson says.</p>



<p>“We can see more earthquakes [and] detect a wider range of frequencies in the seismic waves. And we have GPS and electronic tiltmeters to measure deformation continuously.” That technology allowed scientists to detect not only that there was land deformation recently, but also how it was changing over time, giving just a bit of extra warning time.</p>



<p>That wasn’t possible 40 years ago. Back then, researchers measured deformation by hand, hiking up to the volcano’s summit every few weeks or so. “There was a technique called EDM, for electronic distance measuring, which was essentially shining a laser into a reflector, so you could get very precise distance measurements,” Johanson says. Subtle shifts in the reflector’s location, installed on the volcano, helped reveal the deformation.</p>



<h4>Does the current eruption pose a threat to people?</h4>



<p>“It’s a little early to tell — it’s not yet clear how much volume we can expect out of this eruption,” Johanson says. “I don’t think it’s a given that this will be a more momentous eruption than past ones, but there is a sense of maybe coming back to business as usual for the volcano.”</p>

<p>The good news is that the lava flows don’t currently pose a threat to communities on the Big Island. However, Saddle Road connects the island’s eastern and western sides, Johanson notes. “If the lava were to cross the highway, it would really impact the island.”</p>



<p>But the eruption has interrupted data collection for one of climate science’s most iconic charts: the Keeling Curve, a nearly unbroken 60-year record of atmospheric carbon dioxide that shows a steady rise in levels of the gas.</p>



<p>The carbon dioxide data are collected from instruments at the Mauna Loa Observatory. &nbsp;<a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/2022/11/29/historic-keeling-curve-observation-interrupted-by-volcanic-eruption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The eruption cut off power to the observatory</a> on November 28. As of November 30, the power had not yet been restored, and lava flows had cut off access to the site. For now, it’s unclear if the interruption will have a lasting impact on data collection.</p>



<h4>Kilauea has been erupting more or less continuously for decades. How are Kilauea and Mauna Loa connected?</h4>



<p>They are two separate volcanoes with geochemically distinct lavas, suggesting their plumbing systems — the networks of tunnels and channels through which magma moves — are separate. That plumbing separation probably occurs below the crust and in the mantle, Johanson says, though ultimately the volcanoes tap into the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-hot-spots-shallow-heat-source-tectonic-plates-mantle">same mantle hot spot</a> (<em>SN: 1/6/22</em>). </p>



<p>That said, Kilauea and Mauna Loa are uneasy neighbors, communicating through changes in pressure and stress underground, she says. Pressure changes in the plumbing beneath one volcano can subtly affect the other, for example, altering how easy it is for one volcano to expand, making way for more magma to move in. “They do kind of elbow each other a little bit.”</p>

<p>Following severe population decline and local extinction due to habitat loss and persecution, the European wildcat has recently reappeared in several human-dominated regions in Germany. In <em>BMC Genomics</em>, scientists from the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Center in Germany research the consequences of human disturbance on the genetic structure of this elusive species.</p>
<p>The researchers sequenced and analysed the genomes of 47 wildcats and 16 domestic cats and found that the main population divergence between wildcats in eastern and central Germany occurred within the past 200 years. The authors speculate this change in genomic structure is likely the result of isolated populations due to human-driven habitat fragmentation rather than ancient historical events.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the group found that highly differentiated genes between wild cat populations were involved in producing the neuromodulator serotonin. Serotonin plays a role in stress susceptibility and tolerance. Therefore, this finding points toward the potential adaptation of wildcat populations to human-dominated environments.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understanding footballers&#8217; long-term health can help clinicians make good decisions about player health during and after their career. In </span><em>BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation</em>, researchers evaluate <span data-preserver-spaces="true">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of football on the lumbar spine and discern clinically significant pathology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The researchers analysed MRI scans of the lumbar spines of 18 elite male adolescent footballers exhibiting no symptoms and found that pathology was common (15 of 18 players presented ≤1 abnormality). However, the authors observed that lumbar spine pathology does not appear as prevalent among footballers compared to elite athletes from other sports, which place greater demands on the spine, such as tennis. The researchers stress that clinicians should interpret signs of spinal pathology with caution, as they may not correlate to clinical presentation given that the population studied was asymptomatic.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This study also supports using MRI 3D VIBE sequencing as an alternative to Computerised Tomography (CT) to diagnose and assess the healing of stress fractures to the spine in elite footballers. Such volumetric MRI could negate the requirement for CT and its accompanying radiation exposure. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In BMC Psychiatry, researchers describe the outcomes of a consensus meeting held between experts regarding the historical, current and future delivery of care for patients with ADHD in the UK. ADHD is common and is estimated to affect 2.8% of the adult population. Therefore, the authors argue that we should not restrict ADHD management to specialist services. Instead, all adult mental health care professionals, including primary care professionals, require training to manage ADHD alongside other common adult mental health conditions.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unsafe abortion is a leading – but preventable – cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. According to the World Health Organisation, around 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% occur in developing countries. In <em>BMC Women&#8217;s Health</em>, researchers perform a systematic review to investigate the factors which influence decision-making on abortion in legally restricted settings in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After analysing 46 articles that met the review&#8217;s inclusions criteria, the authors indentified four primary themes that influenced women&#8217;s abortion-related decision-making processes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the role of knowledge (including of laws, methods and sources)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the role of safety (including medical, legal and social safety)</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study demonstrates that women&#8217;s choices after deciding to terminate a pregnancy are shaped by myriad factors &#8211; particularly when abortion is legally restricted. Therefore, to reduce the likelihood of harm and meet women&#8217;s abortion needs to the full limit of the law, a better understanding of how these factors work in concert is needed.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammoths-extinct-earlier-edna-evidence">Mammoths may have gone extinct much earlier than DNA suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some ancient DNA may be leading paleontologists astray in attempts to date when woolly mammoths and woolly rhinos went extinct.</p>



<p>In 2021, an analysis of plant and animal DNA from sediment samples from the Arctic, spanning about the last 50,000 years, suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">mammoths survived</a> in north-central Siberia as late as about 3,900 years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>). That’s much later than when the youngest mammoth fossil found in continental Eurasia suggests the animals died out; it dates to about 10,700 years ago. Only on Wrangel Island off the coast of Siberia and the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were mammoths known to have survived later.</p>





<p>The finding was one of several in recent years using ancient DNA found in sediment and other environmental material to suggest new insights into animal extinctions. Genetic evidence from woolly rhinos in Eurasia and horses in Alaska have also indicated that these animals remained thousands of years longer in some areas than was thought.</p>



<p>But thousands of years is also how long the animals’ large bones can linger on the ground in the frigid north, slowly weathering and shedding tiny bits of DNA, two researchers write November 30 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That means that the youngest ancient DNA in sediment samples may have come from such bones, not living mammoths, woolly rhinos and other megafauna. Studies that rely on this genetic evidence could <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05416-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skew estimates of when these animals went extinct by thousands of years</a> toward the present, say paleontologists Joshua Miller of the University of Cincinnati and Carl Simpson of the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>When, and why, mammoths and some other Ice Age creatures died out is a lingering mystery. Dating when these animals went extinct could help reveal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-mammoths-competed-other-animals-and-lost">what drove them to their demise</a> — humans, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/woolly-rhinos-extinction-climate-change">a warming climate</a>, some combination of the two or something else entirely (<em>SN: 11/13/18; SN: 8/13/20</em>).<br><br>But getting a good sense of when a species disappeared from its range, or from the planet, is not straightforward. For long-gone animals, fossils can help, but it would be a huge coincidence if the youngest fossil ever found of an extinct species was also the last individual to live.</p>



<p>Where fossils give out, DNA has started to take over. For the last two decades, environmental DNA, or eDNA, has become a go-to technique to find out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">what organisms are living</a>, or used to live, in a certain place (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>).<br><br>Paleontologists generally focus on a variant of eDNA that gloms onto minerals and other material and gets buried over time. That “sedimentary ancient DNA,” or sedaDNA, is what evolutionary geneticist Yucheng Wang of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues analyzed in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04016-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2021 study on mammoths</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The DNA can come from a living animal, but it can also come from poop, from bones,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;In our case, we&#8217;re focusing on bones.&#8221;</p>



<p>In warmer climates, a bone lasts long enough to spread DNA for at most a few decades, which usually is not important for getting a general date of extinction, he says. “But up in these cold settings, you would expect a much, much larger, even millennial-scale gap.&#8221;</p>





<p>Miller and Simpson base their estimates of how long the bones of dead mammoths can shed DNA into the environment on radiocarbon dating of the bones of large animals found on the Earth’s surface in cold places today. Caribou antlers as old as 2,000 years have been found on the islands of Svalbard in Norway and Ellesmere Island in Canada, and 5,000-year-old remains of elephant seals near the coastline of Antarctica.<br><br>Wang and his colleagues disagree that the mammoth eDNA in their sample could be partly from cold, old bones weathering down. In a reply in the same issue of <em>Nature, </em>they point out, for instance, that the very youngest mammoth eDNA they found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05417-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows low genetic diversity</a>, precisely what you&#8217;d expect if the DNA actually came from a declining population at the end of the mammoth&#8217;s time on Earth, instead of from a thriving population earlier on.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Miller and Simpson bring up a valid point for further testing and analysis,” says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar, a pioneer of eDNA research who wasn’t involved in the 2021 mammoth study. “But I don’t think that their analysis is nearly sufficient to combat the multiple avenues of evidence which suggest late persisting megafauna,&#8221; says Poinar, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. He points out, for example, that in Wang’s study the DNA evidence tracks the plants of the time period. This suggests woolly mammoths in north-central Siberia could persist thanks to the steppe-tundra, which was their natural habitat, holding on there.<br><br>For Miller, the time span between the youngest known mammoth skeletal remains from north-central Siberia and the youngest mammoth eDNA reported by Wang and his colleagues is just too suspicious.</p>



<p>&#8220;That paper gives us scientific permission to really expect bones to be out there that are much younger than we have seen. There should be dozens, or hundreds of [such relatively recent] dead mammoths somewhere,” he says. “People have been looking for them…. And you just don&#8217;t find anything younger.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-explain-execute-splashless-dive">Physicists explain how to execute a nearly splashless dive</a></h4>

              
                <p>Olympic divers slice into a pool with a quick turn underwater that minimizes splash. But <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/A01.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not for the reasons many athletes think it does</a>, according to research reported November 20 at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis.</p>



<p>“The way that divers describe it,” says fluid mechanics researcher Elizabeth Gregorio of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., “is that they want to pull the splash in with them.” The goal is a nearly splashless rip entry that Gregorio says makes a sound resembling tearing paper.</p>





<p>To study the move, Gregorio duplicated it with hinged models that bend in the middle, much as a diver bends at the hips. She plunged the models into water to simulate divers in action. </p>



<p>Angles cut into the model re-created the shape of a diver’s head and arms. The shape meant the model folded in the middle, just as the angle of a diver’s arms and head after entering the water helps the athlete bend at the hips to execute a submerged turn.</p>



<p>The folded model pulled air behind it to create a large, air-filled cavity under the water. It’s the same thing that happens when a diver turns underwater following a dive. </p>

The resulting bubble explains how elite divers can achieve low-splash, high-scoring rip entries.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119593">E. Gregorio/George Washington University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The effect, Gregorio says, “reduces the jets that would come up after you enter the water,” leading to a score-boosting rip entry. Instead of “pulling the splash in,” the air-filled cavity prevents the splash from forming in the first place.</p>



<p>The research isn’t all about divers’ technique. Gregorio wonders if rip entries reduce the forces divers experience on impact. If so, the studies could help with splashdowns for returning space missions. She also imagines stealthy drones that slip into water without leaving attention-grabbing splashes behind.</p>

<p><strong>A get-sober pill? </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 18, 1972</p>



<p>Researchers at the Tucson Veterans Administration Hospital have been able to reduce intoxication time in rats by administrating harmless chemicals…. Injections of vitamin B3, and vitamin B5 with cystine, were successful&#8230; Glyceraldehyde, however, was effective when ingested and sodium acetate (still untested orally) is expected to be even more effective.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Inebriation and the dreaded hangover that follows still don’t have cures — but scientists haven’t stopped searching. A compound in the seeds of Japanese raisin trees appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drug-gives-rats-booze-guzzling-superpowers">fend off drunkenness in rats</a> and sober them up (<em>SN: 1/4/12</em>), but follow-up research found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33656905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no effect</a>. Remedies that <em>have</em> worked in rodents have not yet led to treatments for people. </p>



<p>In July, an antihangover supplement became available in the United Kingdom and may soon appear in U.S. stores. The Swedish company that makes this probiotic pill, Myrkle (pronounced &#8220;miracle&#8221;), claims that it can break down <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/11786388221108919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent of the alcohol</a> in a person’s system in one hour. But the claim is based on a single study conducted by the company. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-health-risk-water">‘Forever chemicals’ may pose a bigger risk to our health than scientists thought</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">For decades, chemicals that make life easier — your eggs slide out of the frying pan, stains don’t stick to your sofa, rain bounces off your jackets and boots — have been touted as game changers for our busy modern lives. “Better things for better living … through chemistry,” was the optimistic slogan coined by DuPont, the company that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/materials-plastics-polymers-fiber-optics-history">invented the widely used chemical coating Teflon</a>.</p>



<p>But this better living has come at a cost that is getting new attention. These chemicals — dubbed forever chemicals for their ability to last in the environment — are proving to have a lasting impact on human health. A growing body of research links the group of chemicals broadly known as PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, to conditions from unhealthy blood lipid levels to pregnancy complications to cancer.</p>





<p>Alarm about the health impacts of these chemicals has sparked a recent flurry of action from U.S. public health and regulatory officials. Warning that PFAS pose a greater health risk than previously thought, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in June <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-new-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfas-chemicals-1-billion-bipartisan#:~:text=EPA&#039;s%20lifetime%20health%20advisories%20identify,these%20PFAS%20in%20drinking%20water." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically lowered its recommended safe levels</a> of the chemicals in drinking water.</p>



<p>“The updated advisory levels are based on new science, including more than 400 recent studies which indicate that negative health effects may occur at extremely low levels, much lower than previously understood,” Radhika Fox, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Water, said in June at the <a href="https://pfasproject.com/conference-presentations/2022-pfas-conference/#:~:text=2022%20Third%20National%20PFAS%20Conference%20The%203rd%20National,to%20discuss%20how%20best%20to%20address%20PFAS%20contamination." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third National PFAS Conference</a>, held in Wilmington, N.C.</p>



<p>Soon after, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26156/guidance-on-pfas-exposure-testing-and-clinical-follow-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first clinical guidelines quantifying blood concentration levels of PFAS</a> that could put someone’s health at risk. The 300-page report urges clinicians to recommend regular blood tests for anyone exposed to high levels of the chemicals and to provide information on how to limit exposure, such as <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/news/not-all-home-drinking-water-filters-completely-remove-toxic-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing special filters</a> known to reduce PFAS in drinking water.</p>



<p>In the United States alone, by one measure, the tally in medical care costs and lost productivity from PFAS exposure linked to five medical conditions <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12403-022-00496-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adds up to at least $5.5 billion annually</a>, researchers at New York University reported July 26 in <em>Exposure and Health</em>. Those conditions include low birth weight, childhood obesity, hypothyroidism in women, and kidney and testicular cancers. </p>



<p>“We only looked at two of the more than 9,000 chemicals in the PFAS family, so we’re just seeing the tip of an iceberg,” says Leonardo Trasande, a pediatrician and environmental health expert at NYU Langone Health.</p>

<h4>Ubiquitous chemicals</h4>



<p>Among those most at risk of exposure are firefighters: PFAS make protective gear more water resistant, and the chemicals are found in a widely used fire suppressant foam. But most people have some measurable level of PFAS in their bodies, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure typically comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">ingesting PFAS-contaminated drinking water</a> or food grown in soil treated with fertilizers made from sewage contaminated with the chemicals (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 18</em>). An estimated 2,854 locations across the United States have PFAS contamination.</p>





<p>“People and communities have had significant exposure to these chemicals. If they can ID that they are in an area of significant exposure, they should seek testing through their usual source of care,” says Ned Calonge, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora who chaired the committee that wrote the National Academies report. The committee linked PFAS exposure to a slightly different list of conditions than the NYU team, finding “sufficient evidence” linking PFAS to four conditions: poor antibody response to vaccination, abnormally high cholesterol levels, decreased infant and fetal growth, and kidney cancer. Evidence was “suggestive” for breast and testicular cancers, as well as thyroid problems and ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. </p>



<p>The report calls for more research into the health effects of PFAS, noting gaps in evidence on everything from neurological issues to bone density. These chemicals have a wide range of impacts on multiple systems in the body, Calonge says. And they’re “ubiquitous in the environment.”</p>

<h4>Newer, not safer</h4>



<p>PFAS have been produced in the United States since the 1940s. Because they are good at repelling oil and water, holding up at high temperatures and reducing friction, the chemicals became useful for a vast array of products, including carpeting, upholstery, food packaging and even dental floss. Yet, relatively few of the 9,000 or so versions of these synthetic chemicals have been studied for their toxicologic effects. </p>



<p>Many PFAS are now recognized as endocrine disruptors, chemical compounds that interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine, or hormonal, system. But <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1668/htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFAS have other effects that can boost cancer risk</a>, such as weakened immunity, excessive cell growth and altered gene activity. One study <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/113/5/580/5906528?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a greater than twofold increase in kidney cancer risk</a> between people with the highest versus lowest blood levels of one common PFAS called perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, researchers reported in 2021 in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>



<p>A newer generation of PFAS was assumed to be safer because the chemicals <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-10/genx-final-tox-assessment-general_factsheet-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are less likely to accumulate in the body</a>. But these newer compounds are structurally similar to the older ones and can be just as harmful to health as their cousins, Trasande says. These newer molecules “are increasingly being associated with diseases like gestational diabetes. We’re just starting to see the bigger problem that might be at play.”</p>



<p>The EPA’s new drinking water advisory aims to tackle both old and new PFAS. It targets two of the earlier and most commonly found kinds of PFAS in the environment: PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS. The advisory reduces the level of drinking water contamination below which adverse health effects are not expected from 70 parts per trillion to 0.004 and 0.02 ppt, respectively. Those levels are based on routine exposure to them over a lifetime.</p>



<p>The EPA’s health advisory also provided the first-ever recommendations on two of the newer kinds of PFAS: hexa­fluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and HFPO ammonium salt, collectively known as GenX chemicals, and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, or PFBS. The agency set the drinking water safety threshold at 10 ppt for GenX chemicals and 2,000 ppt for PFBS. These newer chemicals have similar persistence in the environment, the agency states.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>Health impacts</h3>



<p>A National Academies panel found sufficient and suggestive evidence that PFAS boost risk for several ailments.&nbsp;<br>* in adults, † in children</p>



<h6>Sufficient evidence</h6>



<ul><li>Poor antibody response to vaccination *†</li><li>Abnormally high cholesterol levels *†</li><li>Decreased infant and fetal growth</li><li>Kidney cancer *</li></ul>



<h6>Suggestive evidence</h6>



<ul><li>Breast cancer *</li><li>Liver enzyme alterations *†</li><li>Pregnancy-induced hypertension *</li><li>Testicular cancer *</li><li>Thyroid disorders * </li><li>Ulcerative colitis *</li></ul>
</div>



<p>Consumers can ask their municipal water provider for data on PFAS testing in their area. Testing is becoming more common, and providers should be able to list which PFAS they test for. Private wells can be contaminated with PFAS if they are near manufacturers that produce or use the chemicals, as well as airfields where PFAS are used for firefighting, firefighting training areas and some waste disposal sites. People with private wells near one of these facilities can get their water tested. The EPA is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity/wiin-grant-small-underserved-and-disadvantaged-communities-grant-program-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving grants</a> to help underserved small and disadvantaged communities provide household water quality testing and comply with drinking water regulations.</p>



<h4>PFAS price tag</h4>



<p>Because there are limited available data on the health effects of the newer generation of chemicals, the NYU and National Academies reports focused on the impacts of older PFAS.</p>



<p>First, the NYU team examined PFAS chemicals in blood samples obtained from roughly 5,000 adults and children who participated in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Then, based on earlier studies linking PFAS to certain diseases and models that estimate medical costs and lost worker productivity for these illnesses, the team came up with its PFAS price tag.</p>



<p>Childhood obesity, the largest contributor to the overall economic toll of PFAS exposure, costs about $2.7 billion a year, the team estimates, followed by hypothyroidism in women at $1.26 billion. When the researchers considered other PFAS-linked diseases beyond the top five, such as endometriosis, obesity in adults and pneumonia in children, the estimated economic burden rose to as much as $63 billion annually.</p>



<h4>Assessing risk</h4>



<p>The National Academies report focused in part on how to curb that toll by providing testing guidelines to clinicians to detect high levels of PFAS in the body and try to reduce exposure.</p>



<p>The report provides the first clinical guidelines on how to assess a person’s disease risk. A person with a PFAS blood concentration of less than 2 nanograms per milliliter doesn’t have to worry. But for patients with blood concentrations between 2 and 20 ng/mL, clinicians should screen for conditions like unhealthy levels of fat in the blood, which can lead to heart problems. Such screening is especially important for people more vulnerable to the effects of PFAS exposure, like children, pregnant people and those who are immunocompromised. For anyone who tests above 20 ng/mL, the report encourages routine screenings for some cancers, thyroid problems and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“For almost 20 years, we’ve been able to measure PFAS in people’s blood, but there was no guidance to say what [those measurements] mean,” says National Academies report coauthor Jane Hoppin, who heads the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “For the first time, this actually sets some ranges, some guidance for what could be levels of concern, and what kinds of health follow-up might be appropriate.”</p>



<p>She hopes that the recommendations will increase testing availability and make both doctors and patients more aware of these chemicals and their health risks. The report also encourages doctors to work with their patients to figure out where they are being exposed to PFAS and how to mitigate those risks, by cutting down on PFAS-containing products and filtering water.</p>



<p>Activated carbon filters, found in some countertop or pitcher filters, don’t remove PFAS as completely as reverse osmosis filters, researchers at Duke University and North Carolina State reported in 2020. The National Academies report offers a link to NSF, a testing organization that offers <a href="https://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CPFOA+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=053%7CPFOS+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=P473%7CPFOA+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=P473%7CPFOS+Reduction&amp;ProductType=&amp;submit2=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical details</a> on which filters actually filter out PFAS.</p>



<p>Efforts like reducing PFAS in drinking water could help. While EPA’s health advisories are recommendations and not enforceable, Trasande is pleased that the agency acted quickly, particularly on newer chemicals like GenX. But he argues that in light of what we already know and are continuing to learn about the disease burden caused by these chemicals, PFAS should undergo more testing before they are approved. Better yet, they should be regulated by class instead of taking what he calls a whack-a-mole approach.</p>



<p>“Our environmental policy still takes a wait-and-see approach that we should wait 20 to 30 years, which is the time that people take to develop diseases due to chemical exposures,” he says.</p>

                <p>Scientists have found that bats use distinct structures in the larynx to produce high-frequency echolocation calls and lower-frequency social calls. Surprisingly, the structures used to make the low-pitched calls are analogous to those used by death metal vocalists in their growls. See our study summary of the findings from Coen Elemans at the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues below, or jump to the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<h5><strong>Background and Study Design</strong></h5>

<p>Echolocating bats have an extremely large vocal range of 7 octaves, compared to just 3 to 4 octaves for most mammals, including humans. Their echolocating calls and social calls range between 1 and 120 kilohertz, making them unique among mammals. To understand how different vocal structures allow bats to create such a wide range of calls, researchers extracted the larynx from five adult Daubenton&rsquo;s bats (<em>Myotis daubentonii</em>), mounted and filmed them at 250,000 frames per second while applying a flow of air to mimic natural vocalization. They then used machine learning to reconstruct the motion of vocal membranes that were obscured by other structures.</p>



<h5><strong>Findings</strong></h5>



<p>They found that air pressure generated self-sustaining vibrations in the vocal membrane at frequencies between 10 and 70 kilohertz, sufficient to produce high-frequency echolocation calls. In contrast, thick folds of membrane just above the vocal cords, called &ldquo;ventricular folds,&rdquo; vibrated at frequencies between 1 and 3 kilohertz, and are likely involved in producing the animals&rsquo; lower-frequency social calls. Some humans also use their ventricular folds to produce low-frequency vocalizations, such as death metal growls and Tuvan throat singing.</p>



<h5><strong>Further Insights</strong></h5>



<p>The study is the first to directly observe self-sustained vibrations in bat vocal structures that can generate echolocation and social calls. Natural selection to produce high-frequency calls for echolocating prey and much lower-frequency calls for social communication have created distinct evolutionary pressures that expanded the vocal range of bats, the authors say.</p>



<p>The authors add, &ldquo;We show that bats vibrate extremely thin and light membranes extending from their vocal folds to make their high-frequency ultrasonic calls for echolocation. To extend their limited lower vocal range, bats make aggressive calls with their ventricular folds &ndash; as in death metal growls.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dry-cat-dog-food-environmentally-friendly-than-wet">Dry pet food may be more environmentally friendly than wet food</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pet owners may have a new reason to reach for the kibble.</p>



<p>Dry cat and dog food tends to be better for the environment than wet food, veterinary nutritionist Vivian Pedrinelli of the University of São Paulo in Brazil and colleagues report. Their analysis of more than 900 hundred pet diets shows that nearly 90 percent of calories in wet chow comes from animal sources. That’s roughly double the share of calories from animal ingredients in dry food.</p>





<p>The team factored in the cost of different pet food ingredients across several environmental measures. The findings, described November 17 in<em> Scientific Reports</em>, suggest that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22631-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wet food production uses more land and water</a> and emits more greenhouse gases than dry food. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">meat-heavy human diets drive greenhouse gas emissions</a> <em>(SN: 5/5/22)</em>. But when it comes to environmental sustainability, “we shouldn’t ignore pet food,” says Peter Alexander, an economist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Just how much various pet foods impact the environment isn’t clear, Alexander says. Commercial cat and canine fares aren’t typically made from prime cuts of meat. Instead, the ingredient lists often include animal byproducts — the gristle and bits people aren’t likely to eat anyway.</p>



<p>How to calculate the carbon cost of these leftovers is an ongoing debate, says Gregory Okin, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Some argue that the byproducts in pet food are essentially free, since they come from animals already raised for human consumption. Others note that any calories require energy and therefore incur an environmental cost. Plus, animal ingredients in pet food might not be just scraps. If they contain even a small amount of human-edible meat, that could add up to a big&nbsp;impact.</p>



<p>Knowing that there’s an environmental difference between moist morsels and crunchier cuisines could be helpful for eco-conscious pet owners, Okin says. Having that info handy at the grocery store is “super important when people are making decisions,” he adds. “There are consumers who want to pay attention.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/researchers-fill-the-gaps-long-covid-data">How researchers are working to fill the gaps in long COVID data</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been more than two years since the first long COVID patients <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called attention to their condition</a>. But researchers are still unable to answer basic questions about it, such as how vaccination impacts one’s chances of long-term symptoms or which groups of people are most at-risk, thanks to gaping holes in long COVID data.</p>



<p>Some data gaps originated early in the pandemic. For instance, in spring 2020, people who lacked a travel history to China or didn’t have typical flulike symptoms were unable to get a PCR test to confirm they were infected. So when some of those people later developed long COVID, their initial illness had not been logged in medical records — making it difficult for them to get care and keeping them off most researchers’ radar.</p>





<p>Other data gaps reveal long-standing problems in how the medical system treats complex, chronic diseases. Doctors weren’t looking out for long-term symptoms, despite warnings from experts in other postviral diseases. And some of the most common long COVID symptoms, such as a dramatic worsening of health after exertion, lack a standard code for documentation in medical charts, making them hard to track.</p>



<p>Filling in those gaps is becoming increasingly crucial. Studies suggest that between 10 and 30 percent of people with COVID-19 may experience long-term symptoms, ranging from a simple loss of smell and taste to debilitating cognitive challenges. In the United States alone, that adds up to millions of people who, long after the pandemic ends, may still be dealing with the consequences of the disease.</p>



<p>The urgency of supporting these patients has led to a push for greater collaboration, new technologies and perhaps most important of all, an openness to really listen to long COVID patients, believing in and using their experiences to shape future research.</p>



<h4>What is long COVID?</h4>



<p>To inform potential treatments, researchers aim to better characterize the causes of and variations in long COVID’s wide range of symptoms. Currently, long COVID tends to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">defined broadly</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention characterizes it as a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“wide range of ongoing health problems”</a> that can last for months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.</p>



<p>The electronic health records that researchers use to study long COVID aren’t comprehensive, however, due to gaps in the data. Records often focus disproportionately on people who could get a PCR or antibody test, were hospitalized and had predominantly respiratory symptoms, says Lisa McCorkell, a public policy researcher and cofounder of <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Patient-Led Research Collaborative</a>, a group of long COVID patients who also have research experience.</p>



<p>What’s more, records “do not document all of the symptoms the patient experiences,” she says. And for many patients, information about different symptoms can be spread across different healthcare systems, making it difficult for researchers to connect the dots.</p>





<p>“A long COVID diagnosis can mean so many different things in your physiology are going wrong,” says David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai healthcare system in New York City and leader of one of the first labs to focus on long COVID. More comprehensive tracking of patients’ symptoms, he says, is crucial to better understand how long COVID presents itself and document how it impacts patients’ lives.</p>



<p>To achieve this goal, experts say, future data collection must be designed collaboratively. Coordination between patients and researchers helps ensure studies are asking the right questions, while coordination between experts with different specialties promotes multidisciplinary, creative approaches to a condition that impacts every organ system in the body. Coordination between research groups in different locations is also important for producing inclusive datasets.</p>



<p>New studies currently in early phases across the United States provide models for how scientists can work with patients and across specialties to investigate long COVID, learning from mistakes made earlier in the pandemic. The results of this work could inform strategies for patients to manage their symptoms and lead to potential treatments.</p>



<h4>Asking the right questions</h4>



<p>Some of the most influential research on long COVID so far has come from patients themselves, including a 2021 study from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents more than 200 potential symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>“Patients know the right questions to ask to properly document their experience,” McCorkell says. This can include which symptoms are studied, how data are collected from patients and how groups of patients are compared.</p>



<p>For example, one common flaw in research design is that potential long COVID patients might be included in a study’s control group (that is, with the assumption that they do not have the condition) because they lack a positive test result or “do not have the exact symptoms a study defines as being long COVID,” McCorkell explains. Since many long COVID patients — especially those who got sick early in the pandemic — lack positive test results, such a control group can skew study findings because researchers are comparing two groups of people that, potentially, both include patients with long COVID.</p>



<p>To avoid these problems, researchers can solicit feedback from patients during all parts of the scientific process. The Patient-Led Research Collaborative required this type of engagement for applicants to <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/projects/patient-led-research-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $5-million research fund</a> run by the collaborative: The <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/press-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning projects</a>, announced on November 22, were reviewed by a panel of patient experts and will incorporate further patient feedback throughout the research process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Putrino’s lab is taking a similar approach in setting up a new clinic focused on long COVID and other complex, chronic illnesses. The lab has a “lived experience advisory board” that responds to questions ranging from how the clinic’s waiting room should be set up to how healthcare workers ask patient survey questions, Putrino says.</p>



<p>Surveys have become a particularly valuable tool in long COVID research, filling the gaps left by electronic health records. Health records are “the clunkiest part of this research,” says Arjun Venkatesh, a patient-reported outcomes researcher at Yale University who is investigating <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/trial/inspire-covid-19-study-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19’s long-term impacts</a>. While new web applications and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/06/health-data-information-blocking-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> have made it easier for patients to access their medical records, researchers still face many technical and data security barriers to connecting datasets from different health systems.</p>



<p>Venkatesh and his colleagues use surveys to collect basic information, such as a patient’s vaccine record, as well as metrics that typically wouldn’t be in an electronic health record, such as their fatigue levels over time. In setting up these surveys, it’s important to solicit input from patients, Venkatesh and others say. Filling out a survey could trigger common long COVID symptoms like brain fog or post-exertion pain and fatigue. Responsible researchers ask a small group of patient volunteers to test surveys before they are widely released.</p>



<p>Input from patients is also crucial in designing clinical trials for long COVID, says Julia Moore Vogel, a program director at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. People living with the condition have spent time reading studies, comparing notes and testing out symptom management techniques. “There’s actually a decent amount of anecdotal data we can use to inform trials,” she says.</p>



<p>Anecdotal data inspired a study that Vogel, a long-hauler herself, is starting. She is aiming to enroll 5,000 patients who will test how well a wearable device helps them manage their symptoms, using a technique called pacing. Some Garmin health trackers have a feature called “body battery,” which combines several measurements to determine the user’s capacity for exertion. Vogel and other long-haulers use this feature to monitor their activity, stopping to rest when their “battery” gets low. Her new study aims to test the strategy on a larger scale.</p>



<h4>Making connections across specialties and locations</h4>



<p>The number of people impacted by long COVID is unprecedented. But the condition shares many characteristics with other complex, chronic diseases that arise after infections and affect multiple organ systems, such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS</a>. These conditions have historically received limited research funding even though they impact millions of people — a problem attributed in part to the diseases’ inability to fit into a specific medical specialty, says Jaime Seltzer, director of scientific and medical outreach at the ME/CFS advocacy group #MEAction, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>



<p>Funding from the National Institutes of Health, for example, is allocated to research groups through the agency’s topic-focused institutes and centers. “Every disease is supposed to neatly and nicely fit into these categories,” Seltzer says. “And if it doesn&#8217;t, everyone goes, ‘It’s not my problem.’” Conditions like ME/CFS and long COVID also are not taught in medical schools, leading to a general lack of awareness among doctors about how to properly diagnose them, she says, which results in incomplete datasets.</p>



<p>To push back against this fractured system, doctors and researchers need to collaborate across specialties, experts say. Scientists with different types of expertise are starting to work together to design comprehensive studies, share data and educate each other about new techniques. The <a href="https://lc19.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long COVID Research Consortium</a> is one such group: Researchers with different specialties are investigating the condition’s underlying biology, with data shared across the participating teams.</p>



<p>“We’re going to be setting up our own data-sharing platform,” says consortium member Richard Scheuermann, director of informatics at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Data from studies of long COVID patients’ microbiomes, immune systems, lungs and other areas will all be in “the same database,” he says, enabling research that connects the different body systems.</p>

<p>Collaboration between scientists in different places is also crucial to producing research that reflects a diverse patient population. One example is the National Institutes of Health’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-risk-nih-recover-symptoms">RECOVER initiative to learn about the long-term health effects</a> of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 10/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>The initiative’s adult study has recruited about 10,000 people from <a href="https://studies.recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 sites all over the United States and Puerto Rico</a>. But Putrino would like to see the federal government go further by recruiting more patients, collaborating more closely with patient advocacy groups, educating providers and integrating research with efforts to directly help long-haulers, such as <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/long-covid-barriers-government-disability-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aid with disability benefits applications</a>.</p>



<p>Create “a set of common data elements that every site collects, so that every site around the country can contribute to a national registry of people with long COVID,” Putrino says. Such a registry, similar to <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/registries/cancer_registry/cancer_registry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing registries for cancer patients</a>, would help researchers better understand the different potential subtypes of long COVID and provide a large population ready to volunteer for clinical trials.</p>



<p>As researchers recruit for large studies of long COVID, they should reach out to communities that are less educated about the condition, says Dona Kim Murphey, a physician, neuroscientist and long-hauler based in Houston. “How do you reach the folks who don&#8217;t even know to come to you?” she asks. Public education campaigns about long COVID — combined with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-clinics-map-locations-prevalence">easier access to healthcare for people facing long-term symptoms</a> — can contribute to more comprehensive patient datasets (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Some long COVID researchers are using new technology to better understand the condition, such as wearable devices, survey apps and machine learning for analysis. But models for comprehensive, collaborative research that includes all patients with a complex condition don’t need to be reinvented. As an example, Seltzer points to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6706a1.htm?s_cid=ss6706a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2014 CDC initiative to study autism</a>, in which 11 sites across the country worked together to diagnose children while simultaneously educating clinicians about autism.</p>



<p>“They basically had diagnostic experts in autism train other people to become diagnostic experts in autism,” she says. The study is a model in creating an inclusive dataset, while simultaneously enabling a new group of researchers to better study a condition in the future. Seltzer hopes to see federal agencies enable similar large-scale studies for long COVID and related conditions.</p>



<p>As some long COVID patients enter their fourth year with the condition and more people continue to get infected, moving toward impactful clinical trials is a top priority for scientists. “Design research in a way that’s going to be most effective to the end users, who are the patients,” says Vogel, the Scripps researcher. Going forward, this research model could be valuable for other complex diseases, too.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Eleonora Bernasconi will talk about a paper &quot;Encoding and retrieval in a model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4- 7 Hz) can
contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and retrieval
of memories into different functional half- cycles (Hasselmo et al. (2002)
Neural Comput 14:793- 817). We investigate, via computer simulations,
the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input
patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1
microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major
cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory
interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells
and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from
the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. The
EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide
context and timing information. Septal input provides timing information for
phasing storage and recall. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated
hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern
on the CA1 pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of
firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in
anesthetized animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for
the different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall
cycles (Klausberger et al., (2003, 2004) Nature 421:844- 848, Nat
Neurosci 7:41- 47). Measures of recall performance of new and
previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various
inhibitory interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of
our model. Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested
as the number of stored patterns is increased.</p>

                <p>The idea that meditation is a "mind science" is popular, but in this interview Canadian philosopher Evan Thompson argues that this claim does not stand up to either scientific or philosophical scrutiny. As one of the pioneers of the Embodied Cognition movement Thompson reminds us that the Mind is not restricted to the Brain and we must also consider how other recent discoveries in neuroscience fail to support the claim that meditation provides neutral scientific insight into how the Mind really works.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li>Evan Thompson's <a href="https://evanthompson.me" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">website</a></li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Why I am not a Buddhist</em></a> by Evan Thompson</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers</em></a> by Kwame Anthony Appiah</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3N7Vwmr" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</em></a> by Francisco J.

                <p>A new analysis of several Roman coins unearthed in 1713 &mdash; long thought to be forgeries &mdash; suggests that they are authentic, providing evidence that the leader portrayed on one of the coins was indeed in power during the 260s CE.

<h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>



<p>For much of ancient Roman history, Roman mints produced coins featuring portraits of current emperors. In 1713, a group of such coins was allegedly discovered in Transylvania, some of them featuring a portrait labeled with the name &ldquo;Sponsian,&rdquo; although there are no other historical records that a Roman emperor named Sponsian ever existed.</p>

<p>While the Transylvanian coins follow the general style of mid-third century Roman coins, they diverge in certain stylistic characteristics and in how they were manufactured, leading many experts to dismiss them as forgeries created to sell to collectors. However, the coins are also uncharacteristic of the forgeries that would have been of interest to past collectors. Additionally, in 1713, &ldquo;Sponsian&rdquo; was not yet known to be a name that had ever existed in ancient Rome.</p>



<h5><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></h5>



<p>To further investigate the Transylvanian coins&rsquo; authenticity, Pearson and colleagues conducted a deeper assessment of the physical characteristics of four of the coins, including the Sponsian coin. They applied visible light microscopy, ultra-violet imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and reflection mode Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy to the four coins and, for comparison, two undoubtedly authentic Roman gold coins.</p>



<p>The analysis revealed deep micro-abrasion patterns typically associated with coins that were in circulation for an extensive period of time. The researchers also analyzed earthen deposits on the coins, finding evidence that after extensive circulation, the coins were buried for a prolonged period before being exhumed. Together, the new evidence strongly suggests the coins are authentic.</p>



<h5><strong>Conclusions</strong></h5>



<p>Considering the historical record alongside the new evidence from the coins, the researchers suggest that Sponsian was an army commander in the Roman Province of Dacia during a period of military strife in the 260s CE.</p>



<p>Lead author of the paper, Paul N. Pearson of University College, London, adds: &ldquo;Scientific analysis of these ultra-rare coins rescues the emperor Sponsian from obscurity. Our evidence suggests he ruled Roman Dacia, an isolated gold mining outpost, at a time when the empire was beset by civil wars and the borderlands were overrun by plundering invaders.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Curator of Numismatics at The Hunterian, Jesper Ericsson, adds: &ldquo;This has been a really exciting project for The Hunterian. Not only do we hope that this encourages further debate about Sponsian as a historical figure, but also the investigation of coins relating to him held in other museums across Europe.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-bright-blazar-space">Here’s why some supermassive black holes blaze so brightly</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed how certain supermassive black holes launch jets of high-energy particles into space — and the process is shocking.</p>



<p>Shock waves propagating along the jet of one such blazar <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05338-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contort magnetic fields that accelerate escaping particles</a> to nearly the speed of light, astronomers report November 23 in <em>Nature</em>. Studying such extreme acceleration can help probe fundamental physics questions that can’t be studied any other way.</p>



<p>Blazars are active black holes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/source-blazars-super-brightness-comes-focus">shoot jets of high-energy particles toward Earth</a>, making them appear as bright spots from millions or even billions of light-years away (<em>SN: 7/14/15</em>). Astronomers knew that the jets’ extreme speeds and tight columnated beams had something to do with the shape of magnetic fields around black holes, but the details were fuzzy.</p>





<p>Enter the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, an orbiting telescope launched in December 2021. Its mission is to measure X-ray polarization, or how X-ray light is oriented as it travels through space. While previous blazar observations of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">polarized radio waves and optical light</a> probed parts of jets days to years after they’d been accelerated, polarized X-rays can see into a blazar’s active core (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>“In X-rays, you’re really looking at the heart of the particle acceleration,” says astrophysicist Yannis Liodakis of the University of Turku in Finland. “You’re really looking at the region where everything happens.”</p>



<p>In March 2022, IPXE looked at an especially bright blazar called Markarian 501, located about 450 million light-years from Earth.</p>



<p>Liodakis and colleagues had two main ideas for how magnetic fields might accelerate Markarian 501’s jet. Particles could be boosted by magnetic reconnection, where magnetic field lines break, reform and connect with other nearby lines. The same process <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">accelerates plasma on the sun</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>). If that was the particle acceleration engine, the polarization of light should be the same along the jet in all wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays.</p>



<p>Another option is a shock wave shooting particles down the jet. At the site of the shock, the magnetic fields suddenly switch from turbulent to ordered. That switch could send particles zooming away, like water through the nozzle of a hose. As the particles leave the shock site, turbulence should take over again. If a shock was responsible for the acceleration, short wavelength X-rays should be more polarized than longer wavelength optical and radio light, as measured by other telescopes.</p>

As they lose energy, the particles emit lower energy light in visible, infrared and radio wavelengths (purple and blue), and the jet becomes more turbulent.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119559">Pablo Garcia/MSFC/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s exactly what the researchers saw, Liodakis says. “We got a clear result,” he says, that favors the shock wave explanation.</p>



<p>There is still work to do to figure out the details of how the particles flow, says astrophysicist James Webb of Florida International University in Miami. For one, it’s not clear what would produce the shock. But “this is a step in the right direction,” he says. “It’s like opening a new window and looking at the object freshly, and we now see things we hadn’t seen before. It’s very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2022/11/23/eeg-microstates-functional-significance-and-short-term-test-retest-reliability.html">EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability</a></h4>

              
                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability&quot; and his related work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>EEG microstates, reflecting discrete topographical organization of the EEG
signal power, may have clinical relevance; however, their functional
significance and test-retest reliability remain unclear. To investigate the
functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes and their
pairwise transitions, and to establish their within-session test-retest
reliability, we recorded 36-channel EEGs in 20 healthy volunteers during three
eyes-closed conditions: mind-wandering, verbalization (silently repeating the
word 'square' every 2 s), and visualization (visualizing a square every 2 s).
Each condition lasted 3 min and the sequence of three conditions was repeated
four times (two runs of two sequence repetitions). The participants' alertness
and their sense of effort during the experiment were rated using
visual-analogue scales. The EEG data were 2textendash 20 Hz bandpassfiltered
and analysed into the four canonical microstate classes: A, B, C, and D. EEG
microstate classes C and D were persistently more dominant than classes A and B
in all conditions. Of the first-order microstate param- eters, average
microstate duration was most reliable. The duration of class D microstate was
longer during mindwandering (106.8 ms) than verbalization (102.2 ms) or
visualization (99.8 ms), with a concomitantly higher coverage (36.4% vs.
34.7% and 35.2%), but otherwise there was no clear association of the four
microstate classes to particular mental states. The test-retest reliability was
higher at the beginning of each run, together with higher average alpha power
and subjective ratings of alertness. Only the transitions between classes C and
D (from C to D in particular) were significantly higher than what would be
expected from the respective micro- states' occurrences. The transition
probabilities, however, did not distinguish between conditions, and their
testretest reliability was overall lower than that of the first-order
parameters such as duration and coverage. Further studies are needed to
establish the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes.
This might be more fruitfully achieved by looking at their complex syntax
beyond pairwise transitions. To ensure greater testretest reliability of
microstate parameters, study designs should allow for shorter experimental runs
with regular breaks, particularly when using EEG microstates as clinical
biomarkers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-bop-their-heads-to-the-beat-music">Rats can bop their heads to the beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans aren’t the only animals known to move to a musical beat.</p>



<p>For instance, parrots do it, too. And now rats have been observed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo7019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bopping their heads</a> in time with the music of Mozart, Lady Gaga, Queen and others, researchers report on November 11 in <em>Science Advances</em>. </p>



<p>What’s more, the animals seem to respond to the same tempos that get humans’ feet tapping. The study could help reveal the evolutionary foundations of humans’ sense of rhythm.</p>





<p>“Some of us believe that music is very special to human culture. But I believe that its origin is somehow inherited from our progenitors,” says Hirokazu Takahashi, a mechanical engineer at the University of Tokyo, who studies how the brain works.</p>



<p>The ability to recognize the beat of a song and synchronize the movements of one’s body to it is known as beat synchronization. It’s a mystery why some species, like humans and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-bust-move-musical-beats">parrots</a>, have the innate ability and others do not (<em>SN: 4/30/09</em>).</p>



<p>For rats in the lab, Takahashi and his colleagues put on Mozart’s “Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major” (K. 448). The team sped up and slowed the tempo, as well as played it at its normal speed, observing the rats’ motions not only visually, but also with wireless accelerometers, which were surgically placed on the rats.</p>



<p>The team initially thought that body size might determine the tempos that triggered any head bopping. Humans tend to prefer foot tapping to music that’s between 120 to 140 beats per minute, but a small animal like a rat would probably need a quicker tempo to get that same reaction, the researchers hypothesized.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of reasons to think maybe [rats] would prefer faster rhythms. But that’s not what they found. And that’s intriguing,” says Aniruddh Patel, a psychologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who was not involved in this research. He studies music cognition, the mental processes involved in perceiving and responding to music.</p>



<p>In the video recordings, the rats’ head bobbing was more pronounced when the sonata played at its usual tempo, around 132 beats per minute. The same was true for 20 people who listened through headphones with accelerometers.</p>





<p>For both humans and rats, the head bopping was consistent at about 120 to 140 bpm. When the music was played faster or slower, then there was no head bopping. That suggests that there is something fundamental about how the animal brain is tuned or wired to respond to rhythm, Takahashi says.</p>



<p>The team also played some of their favorite pop songs for the rats, including Lady Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;Born This Way&#8221; and Michael Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Beat It,&#8221; and saw a similar response.</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers used motion capture cameras to track how rats move to a musical beat. The colored dots indicate markers that helped the cameras track the rodent’s subtle movements as it hears different musical pieces, including a Mozart piano sonata and Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.”</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Patel agrees that rats seem to prefer beats that humans like, he is not convinced that the rats can synchronize to the beat like humans do.</p>



<p>“I think that that study actually raises more questions than answers in some sense,” Patel says. Humans and parrots show beat synchronicity through big, voluntary movements like head bobbing, dancing or foot tapping. The rats displayed very tiny movements that needed to be captured with special devices like a head-mounted accelerometer and motion capture technology. </p>



<p>The behavior was also more observable when the researchers lured the rats to stand on their back legs by putting their water bottle up high, compared with being on all fours.</p>



<p>“The fundamental nature of beat perception and synchronization is that you predict the timing of the beat and you move predictably” he says. “So, we land right on beat or a little ahead of it.” Since the rats’ movements are so tiny, it’s not clear if rats can predict the beats or if they’re just reacting to it.</p>



<p>Both Takahashi and Patel stress that this study does <em>not</em> show that rats like to dance to human music. “Music stimulus is very appealing to the brain,” Takahashi says. “But it is not evidence [that] they enjoy or they perceive music.”</p>



<p>Next, Takahashi is looking to see what other aspects of music we might share with rodents and other animals. “I&#8217;d like to maybe reveal how other properties, like melody and harmony, also relate to the dynamics of the brain.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-monkeys-remains-ancient-diplomacy-maya-mexico">A spider monkey’s remains tell a story of ancient diplomacy in the Americas</a></h4>

              
                <p>A sacrificed spider monkey is shedding new light on an ancient Mesoamerican relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remains of a 1,700-year-old monkey found in the ancient city of Teotihuacan outside modern-day Mexico City suggest the primate was a diplomatic gift from the Maya. The find is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2212431119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the earliest evidence of a primate held in captivity in the Americas</a>, researchers report November 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unearthed in 2018 at the base of a pyramid in Teotihuacan, the monkey’s skeleton lay beside the corpses of other animals — including an eagle and several rattlesnakes — in an area of the city where visiting Maya elites may have resided.</p>





<p>Evidence of animal sacrifices, including of predators like jaguars, have been found in the city before. But “up to that point, we did not have any instances of sacrificed primates in Teotihuacan,” says Nawa Sugiyama, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>Chemical analysis of the spider monkey’s bones and teeth showed that the female had likely been captured in a humid environment at a young age sometime in the third century. The monkey then lived in captivity for a few years before meeting her end between the years 250 and 300.</p>



<p>The highlands around Mexico City are a long way from the natural habitat of spider monkeys (<em>Ateles geoffroy</em>), which require wet tropical forests to thrive. This fact, along with the presence of Maya murals and vessels, suggests to Sugiyama and her colleagues that the spider monkey was a gift from elite Mayas to the people of Teotihuacan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The find is an example of diplomatic relations between two cultures that sometimes had violent interactions. Maya hieroglyphs indicated that military forces from Teotihuacan invaded the Maya city of Tikal in 378, marking the start of a roughly 70-year period in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-lidar-mexican-pyramid-maya-teotihuacan-temple-feathered-serpent-tikal">Teotihuacan meddled in Maya politics</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>The “striking” discovery of the monkey shows that relationship between these two cultures far predates the invasion, says David Stuart, an archaeologist and epigraphist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“The war of 378 had a long history leading up to it,” he says. “The monkey is a really compelling illustration of this long relationship.”</p>

                <p>Marsupials may have richer social lives than previously thought.</p>



<p>Generally considered loners, the pouched animals have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide diversity of social relationships</a> that have gone unrecognized, a new analysis published October 26 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> suggests. The findings could have implications for how scientists think about the lifestyles of early mammals.</p>



<p>“These findings are helpful to move us away from a linear thinking that used to exist in some parts of evolutionary theory, that species develop from supposedly simple into more complex forms,” says Dieter Lukas, an evolutionary ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who was not involved with the study.</p>





<p>Mammals run the gamut of social organization systems, ranging from loose, ephemeral interactions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">aggregations of jaguars</a> in the South American wetlands to the antlike subterranean societies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-mole-rats-colonies-territory-pups">naked mole-rats</a> (<em>SN: 10/13/21</em>; <em>SN: 10/20/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But marsupials — a subgroup of mammals that give birth to relatively underdeveloped young reared in pouches — have traditionally been considered largely solitary. Some kangaroo species were known to form transient or permanent groups of dozens of individuals. But among marsupials, long-term bonds between males and females were thought rare and there were no known examples of group members cooperating to raise young. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous work</a> on patterns of mammalian social evolution regarded about 90 percent of examined marsupial species to be solitary.</p>



<p>“If you look at other [studies] about some specific species, you will see [the researchers] tend to assume that the marsupials are solitary,” says Jingyu Qiu, a behavioral ecologist at CNRS in Strasbourg, France.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Sorting social lives</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues developed a database of field studies that illuminated marsupial social organization, taking into account how populations vary within a species and delving into the evolutionary history of marsupial social lives. The researchers compiled data from 120 studies on 149 populations of 65 marsupial species, categorizing each population as solitary, living in pairs — such as one male and one female — or falling into four kinds of group living, including one male and multiple females (or vice versa), multiple males and females, or single sex groups.</p>



<p>While 19 species, or 31 percent of those studied, appear to go strictly solo, nearly half of the species always live in pairs or groups. The team also found lots of variation within species; 27 of the 65 species — more than 40 percent — fell into multiple social organization classifications.</p>





<p>When the researchers looked at this social variation against climatic conditions in Australia, they found that social variability was more common in drier environments with less predictable rainfall. It’s possible that being able to switch between solitary and group living acts as a buffer against resource unpredictability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ focus on social flexibility “highlights that there is nothing simple even about a supposedly solitary species,” Lukas says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Implications for the earliest mammals</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues also ran computer analyses comparing the evolutionary relationships of the marsupials with how they form social relationships. This let the team predict the social organization of the earliest marsupials, which split from placental mammals about 160 million years ago. Because modern marsupials have been considered solitary, the marsupial ancestors — and the earliest mammals on the whole — have generally been assumed to be solitary as well.</p>



<p>The team found that solitary was the most likely social category of the ancestral marsupials, a 35 percent probability. But Qiu points out that the varied combinations where pair and group living are possible options make up the other 65 percent. So “it is more likely that the ancestor was also non-solitary,” she says. The findings also give insights into the range of possible lifestyles experienced by the earliest mammals, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Robert Voss, a mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, questions the analyses’ insights about a potentially social ancestral marsupial. The uncertainty about the solitary alternative, he says, is largely due to the researchers’ benchmarks for what does and what doesn’t constitute social behavior — thresholds that Voss views as too permissive. For example, Voss disagrees with the team’s characterization of opossum social organization.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Anecdotal observations of [members of the same species] occasionally denning together is not compelling evidence for social behavior,” says Voss. &#8220;None of the cited studies suggest that opossums are anything other than solitary.”</p>



<p>Future work, Qiu says, will involve gathering data on a larger subset of mammals outside of marsupials to get a clearer picture of how social traits have evolved among mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-improve-urinal-nautilus-shell">How physics can improve the urinal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Restroom visitors can expect cleaner knees and tidier floors, if they happen to use a new urinal inspired by curves in nature.</p>



<p>The key to making <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/U12.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a splashless urinal</a> is ensuring that a person’s pee stream hits the porcelain at a shallow angle no matter where it is aimed, researchers report November 22 at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Indianapolis. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a small enough angle, there is no splash,” says mechanical engineer Zhao Pan of the University of Waterloo in Canada. Pan calls the angle where splashing ceases “the critical angle.” Keeping the angle that a fluid strikes the surface at the critical angle or lower prevents the splash.</p>





<p>Pan and colleagues’ design — a tall, narrow urinal with a curving inner surface — employs the same geometry as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-shell-spirals">nautilus shell</a> (<em>SN: 4/1/05</em>). “There’s a smooth flow across the surface,” says Waterloo mechanical engineering student Kaveeshan Thurairajah, which prevents droplets from flying out.</p>



<p>In experiments involving dyed fluids sprayed into conventional urinals, the team found significant splash that, in the real world, would have ended up on a person’s legs and feet and on the floor nearby. When the researchers repeated the experiments with prototypes of the new design and inspected the surrounding surfaces, “I couldn’t find even a single droplet,” Thurairajah says.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether people using the new urinals will still somehow find a way to make a mess. To tell how well the urinals work in eventual real-world tests, Pan says, “just look at the floor.”</p>

                <p>We’ve never seen images of space as astounding as those from the James Webb Space Telescope, which shared its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first cosmic vistas in July</a>. The pictures have left us dazzled, awestruck and excited for more. They also inspired us to reflect on the top space images past and present. These images have moved us because of their drama, beauty or significance. Here’s how eight <em>Science News</em> staffers answered the question: What’s your favorite space image of all time?</p>



<h4>Apollo 8 Earthrise, taken in 1968</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman">Lisa Grossman</a>, astronomy writer, chose Apollo 8’s Earthrise as her top space image. She says: The you-are-there, sci-fi-but-it’s-real feeling of seeing Earth over the edge of the moon gets my imagination going. And something about having the surface of the moon in the image gives me deep chills. I can imagine my own feet in those gray craters, my own eyes looking back at my own Earth. It’s wild. It’s eerie. I love it.</p>



<p>I feel similarly about the selfie images from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">the Mars rovers</a>; here’s NASA’s Curiosity rover at Mont Mercou in 2021. </p>

<p>You can see the rover and the landscape behind it. That’s our robotic avatar on that planet, rolling around doing our work. Though I’m lukewarm about sending people to do extraterrestrial exploration – I think the risks outweigh the scientific benefits – I have always been a sucker for imagining living on another world. Or at least visiting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/nikk-ogasa">Nikk Ogasa</a>, staff writer for physical sciences, says: There are so many awe-inspiring space images out there, but my favorite from this year was the <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Webb Space Telescope&#8217;s</a> heavenly shot of Neptune. It is stunning. The image captures the planet’s near-infrared glow in unprecedented detail. Not only can you see the glorious rings, but you can also pick out high-flying methane clouds as bright streaks. It blows my mind that we can see clouds on another world that is billions of miles away.</p>

<p>Two members of our team selected the Hubble Space Telescope’s second view of the Pillars of Creation, taken in 2014, as their top space image.</p>



<p>Design director <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-otwell">Erin Otwell</a> says: My top space image is the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula. It’s my choice because of the awe-inspiring details and the painterly quality of the composition. To me, this image sums up the feeling of studying the cosmos and of creation itself. The towers of gas and dust where new stars are being born compose an almost solid-looking figure. It looks more like a hand than pillars. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/maria-temming">Maria Temming</a>, assistant editor at <em>Science News Explores</em>, says: I know that claiming the Pillars of Creation as my favorite space image is like saying Starbucks is my favorite coffee. But I don’t care! I love it. I have something of a sentimental attachment to this vista, since it was on the cover of the Great Courses intro to astronomy DVD set that first sparked my interest in space science.</p>

<p>The iconic, candy-colored images of the pillars in visible light are not the only versions that Hubble has captured. In 2014, the space telescope also took a ghostly picture of the scene in infrared light (above). Light at infrared wavelengths shines through the pillars’ gas and dust, revealing the baby stars swaddled inside these clouds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tom-siegfried">Tom Siegfried</a>, contributing correspondent, chose this diagram as his favorite space image. He says: When Copernicus displaced the Earth from the center of the universe, he pictured the stars as occupying a sphere surrounding the planets that orbited on smaller spheres surrounding the sun. But Thomas Digges, an English astronomer who defended Copernicus, believed the stars extended far beyond the solar system. </p>



<p>In this image, published in 1576, Digges depicted numerous stars beyond the spheres of the planets, suggesting that the universe was “garnished with lights innumerable and reaching up in spherical altitude without end.” With these words Digges was the first follower of Copernicus to suggest that the universe encompassed an infinite expanse of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/helen-thompson">Helen Thompson</a>, associate digital editor, says: Is it extremely blurry? Yes. Is it not even the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first time we’ve imaged a black hole</a>? Also yes. But it’s the black hole in our galactic backyard, and we’d never seen it before. There’s something mind-blowing and kind of heartwarming about seeing it for the first time. The Event Horizon Telescope’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">first image of Sagittarius A*</a> might not be as pretty as James Webb’s fancy-schmancy pictures, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">all of the difficulties that come with imaging black holes</a> and especially <em>this</em> black hole make it so compelling.</p>



<h4>Gravitational lensing of quasar 2M1310-1714, captured in 2021</h4>

Treu</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/elizabeth-quill">Elizabeth Quill</a>, special projects editor, says: Within the ring of light at the center of this image are a pair of distant galaxies and a much more distant quasar behind them. The mass of the galactic duo is warping the fabric of spacetime, bending and magnifying the quasar’s light to form what are four separate images of the quasar, each sitting around the ring. It’s a visually powerful example of a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, which was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a> before it was ever observed. </p>



<p>My top space image wows me every time. How incredible that the universe works this way. How incredible that the human mind, a motley product of the universe, could foresee it. And not only foresee it; today’s scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos">use gravitational lensing as a tool</a> to study otherwise inaccessible regions of space. It’s both humbling and empowering.</p>



<h4>Pale Blue Dot, taken in 1990</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/christopher-crockett">Christopher Crockett</a>, associate news editor, says: My favorite space image of all time isn’t of a colorful nebula, or a glittering galaxy, or even a certain supermassive black hole. It’s a single dot, seemingly ensconced in a shaft of light.</p>



<p>After completing its tour of the solar system in 1990, <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Voyager 1</a> looked back and took a series of parting images – a “family portrait,” it was called – of several planets orbiting our sun. One of the images, which came to be known as <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “pale blue dot” photo</a>, captured Earth as seen from roughly 6 billion kilometers away — the most distant image of home anyone has ever taken.</p>





<p>The image, updated with modern image-processing software and re-released in 2020 (above), remains a reminder of why we explore the universe. Yes, we want to better understand how space and time, stars and planets, galaxies and superclusters work, because we’re curious. But all those questions ultimately come back to trying to understand where we come from and how we fit into all that surrounds us. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/top-10-science-popularizers-all-time">Carl Sagan</a> emphasized, nothing better captures just how tiny we are in the grand scheme of things than seeing our entire planet reduced to a mere speck of light. </p>



<p>When I used to give public talks about astronomy, I almost always closed with this image. And I would usually read from Sagan’s reflections on it: </p>



<p>“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.… on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.… There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”</p>
