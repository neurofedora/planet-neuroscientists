<p>A paper that found smoking rates in the United States fell faster than expected as more people started using e-cigarettes has been retracted over the objections of its authors, who have filed a complaint with the journal’s publisher. </p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">reported in July</a>, <em>BMC Public Health</em> informed the authors of “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>” that the editors had decided to retract the article after receiving a critical letter. We reported:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the retracted paper are employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we published our story about the pending retraction, 23 researchers wrote a <a href="https://clivebates.com/documents/ExpertLetterFoxonRetractionAugust2023.pdf">letter</a> to the journal expressing concern about the decision. They wrote: </p>



<span id="more-128004"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors appear to have addressed the various concerns raised in their responses to the prepublication peer reviews and their sensitivity analysis, which shows that the findings are robust under a range of initial assumptions.</p>



<p>We are aware of the authors’ role as consultants for Juul Labs Inc., not least because it has been transparently disclosed by the authors throughout the editorial review process. The reported conflicts justify due skepticism and scrutiny. They do not justify unfair or unequal treatment. The proper way to respond is through the open science concept of <em>replication</em> to confirm, refute, or challenge the findings using the same publicly available datasets.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice does not refer to any conflict of interest, but stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers raised concerns around the methodology. A post-publication review highlighted concerns about the assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data; this assumption is not fully supported by the sensitivity analyses performed by the authors. Therefore, the Editors have lost confidence in the results reported by the article. None of the authors agree to this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the paper “believe that a retraction is not warranted, and we stand by our results,” they said in a statement shared by Floe Foxon, a data analyst at Pinney Associates and the corresponding author of the article. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe the process was wrong, and their interpretation of the data and science is demonstrably wrong. Consistent with open science principles, we believe the journal should have published the Letter it received and our response. Since the journal has not done so, we invite readers and interested parties to read the article and subsequent correspondence with the journal, which we have made available in full on OSF at <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correspondence the authors posted contains their detailed refutations of the concerns mentioned in the retraction notice, and conviction that the decision “is based on fundamental misconceptions regarding basic elements of our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also sent a formal complaint about the “process followed, and scientific judgment” of the journal’s editors to SpringerNature, its publisher, on September 22, and said they have not received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaint, available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BMC-Public-Health-complaint-letter.pdf">here</a>, argued the authors addressed the concerns raised about the paper during the peer review process and in post-publication correspondence with the journal editors, and that the retraction was “inappropriate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than a retraction, the authors said that the journal should publish the original complaint letter it received, as well as the subsequent assessment by an editorial board member and the authors’ reply, “so that interested readers can decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By retracting the paper, the journal denies readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A SpringerNature spokesperson confirmed receipt of the complaint and said the publisher was “currently in the process of providing a detailed response.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Although the journal followed COPE guidelines throughout the retraction and the editors were fully transparent with the authors during the investigation, we hope this response will provide further clarity on the process undertaken.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hippos-ferocious-fighters-teeth">Hippos might be ferocious fighters, but their big teeth make them terrible chewers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippos are horrible at chewing, and their giant tusks and front teeth are to blame.</p>



<p>These intimidating dental features are used by hippos, in part, to protect themselves and their territory. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the gnarly teeth interlock</a> or hinder jaw movements, preventing hippos from efficiently chewing with the side-to-side grinding technique that other herbivores use, researchers report October 4 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plant-eating mammals typically use the broad teeth near the sides of their mouths to grind and shred fibrous vegetation before swallowing it. Since their digestion process barely reduces food particle size, you can gauge chewing efficiency by looking at their feces.</p>





<p>In 2009, veterinarian Marcus Clauss of the University of Zurich and his colleagues compared the sizes of fecal particles across nearly 200 mammal species. They found that hippos were the least effective chewers among herbivores.&nbsp;Years later, he and his colleague Annika Avedik wondered whether hippos’ enormous front teeth were the cause of their meager munching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some herbivores, such as deer and cattle, have lost some of their front incisors during evolution, possibly because they impeded chewing. African rhinos have lost theirs entirely. “Hippos are a case example of a taxon that did not lose them,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>The researchers <a href="https://youtu.be/HMSJX8CatEY?si=gNZrGuCMBsPkwGaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nFa6TyQYZdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> of common (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) and pygmy hippopotamuses (<em>Choeropsis liberiensis</em>) eating, closely tracking how the teeth interacted as the jaws moved. The team also measured physical features of 86 common hippo and 21 pygmy hippo skulls in museum collections, including the spacing and arrangement of the teeth, and tested the side-to-side jaw range of these skulls and measured places where the teeth wore on each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clauss had originally thought that common hippos’ huge tusks, which are modified canine teeth, would be what stopped the animals from proper side-to-side chewing. “Boy, was I wrong,” he says.</p>



<p>Instead, the team found that common hippos’ upper and lower sets of long, spearlike incisors cross and interlock as the lower jaw closes, restricting the back teeth to up-and-down mashing.&nbsp;The herbivores still try some side-to-side movement of the jaw, Clauss says, evidenced by wear marks on the sides of the incisors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a hippo skull on a black background." class="wp-image-3132111" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132111">Skulls of common hippos (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) like this one showed researchers that the top and bottom incisors interlocked during chewing, keeping the jaw from moving side to side.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132111">Michelle Aimée Oesch (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC-BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pygmy hippos’ incisors don’t interlock, but their tusks bump up against the snout, allowing only a limited amount of side sliding. Wear patterns show that the incisors glide past each other when chewing.</p>



<p>Because pygmy hippos show some side-to-side jaw movement when chewing, it hints that “lateral grinding chewing is something [hippos] once did, and that it got lost along the way,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>Hippos now use their rigid jaws, wide gapes and sharp, sturdy tusks and incisors, in part, to combat other hippos over territory and access to mates, and to defend against predators.&nbsp;But the potential shift to less efficient chewing could have come with consequences. Because hippos can’t mulch food into very small pieces, it takes longer for it to be digested, Clauss says.</p>



<p>“If food has to stay longer in the gut, it means one cannot eat more, quickly. Hence hippos are, among mammalian herbivores, characterized by relatively low food intakes,” he explains.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Their comparatively low food intake may put hippos at a competitive disadvantage against other, more efficiently chewing ruminant herbivores such as antelope. An inability to compete with fully land-dwelling species for sufficient food may keep hippos wedded to the African waterways the semiaquatic animals call home.</p>



<p>The study is “a really good reminder of the complexity of organisms, and that when anatomical parts, such as teeth, are viewed in isolation, they may not explain the whole picture,” says comparative biomechanist Susan Williams of Ohio University in Athens.</p>



<p>Studying fossil hippo ancestors could reveal if, and when, hippos’ side-to-side motion during chewing stopped, rounding out understanding of the animals’ evolutionary story. Juvenile hippos also don’t yet have incisors large enough to interlock, so Clauss is curious to see if these youngsters temporarily use side-to-side chewing.</p>

<p>“Quantum dots are a new class of materials, different from molecules,” said Heiner Linke, a member of the Nobel committee. Just adjusting the size of these nanoparticles, roughly a few billionths of a meter across, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-get-second-chance-shine">can change their properties</a> — optical, electric, magnetic, even melting points — thanks to quantum mechanics (<em>SN: 6/29/15</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s also true of color. “If you want to make different colors with molecules, you would choose a new molecule, a new set of atoms” arranged in a different structure, Linke said. But quantum dots of different colors have the exact same arrangement of atoms. The only difference is particle size.</p>





<p>When quantum dots are irradiated by light, electrons within get energized, eventually releasing that energy as fluorescent light. The smaller the dots are, the more they compress the wave function of an electron, increasing its energy so that the dot appears blue. Larger dots appear red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dots of the same size made from different materials may also emit slightly different wavelengths of light, says Jean-Marc Pecourt, a chemist at CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society. Quantum dots are usually made from semiconductor materials, such as graphene, selenite or metal sulfides, Pecourt says. So by adjusting materials or the size of quantum dots, chemists can alter their properties for a wide variety of uses.</p>



<p>The idea that the size of these nanoparticles could alter their properties was predicted nearly a century ago, but at the time it seemed impossible to reproduce that effect in the real world. To do that, researchers would need a perfectly crystalline material, and would need to control the size of the nanomaterial very precisely, sculpting it atom layer by atom layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in the early 1980s, Ekimov and Brus independently showed that it could be done. Ekimov, now at Nanocrystals Technology, Inc., in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., demonstrated this in glass, adding copper chloride to produce tiny crystals and revealing that the color of the glass was linked to the size of those crystals. Brus, of Columbia University, made a similar discovery, but in a different context: He demonstrated the link between size and color for nanoparticles floating freely in a solution <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/creating-crystals-study-quantum-effects">and in gaseous compounds</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/92</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those discoveries triggered intense interest in how to harness these little dots for a variety of applications. But manufacturing them would require being able to control the size of the particles to precise specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade later, Bawendi, of MIT, developed a method to precisely control the speed of the crystals’ growth in a solution, figuring out how to stop them right when they reach a desired size. He did this by first injecting chemical reagents into the solution that instantaneously formed the tiny crystals and then promptly adjusting the temperature of the solution, halting their growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m deeply honored and surprised and shocked by the announcement this morning,” Bawendi said October 4 during an MIT news conference. “I&#8217;m especially honored to share this with Lou Brus, who was my postdoctoral mentor [from] whom I learned so much. I tried to emulate his scholarship and his mentoring style as a professor myself when I came to MIT.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bawendi started working on quantum dots after he met Brus at Nokia Bell Labs, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J. The researchers needed high quality quantum dots to study the physics of the nanoparticles, Bawendi said. “It wasn&#8217;t because I wanted to make the best quantum dots possible for application, it was because we needed to make the best possible quantum dots to study them.” It took years of trial and error to work out the method, he said.</p>



<p>By making it possible to manufacture quantum dots, Bawendi’s method opened up a world of possible uses for the nanoparticles. Quantum dots make it possible to very precisely change the color of LED lights and dramatically improve their efficiency. Dots that glow with fluorescent light, injected into the body and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-light-cancer-cells-mice">attached to immune cells that swarm to cancerous tissues</a>, can help surgeons distinguish even hard-to-see tumors (<em>SN: 8/3/04</em>).&nbsp;The ability to be tuned to absorb different wavelengths of light could also allow the manufacture of customized solar cells that are highly efficient in different light conditions. The dots might also be used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">to build quantum computers</a>, Pecourt says (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biomedical engineer and chemist Warren Chan says the prize is well deserved. “They&#8217;re the ones who built the foundation,” says Chan, of&nbsp;the University of Toronto. “I&#8217;m really happy that the field is getting credit for really changing the world, not just in quantum dots, but in a lot of different areas.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>One of the first applications came in the late 1990s when Chan and colleagues used quantum dots to tag cells in the lab, he says. “The surface modifications that were used for integrating quantum dots for applications were then also adapted for other types of nanoparticles.”</p>



<p>The Nobel committee looks not only at past contributions, but also the effect a discovery may have on the future, Chan says. The ability to tune nanoparticles by changing their size or surface properties could open a wide variety of possibilities that have not yet been explored. Chan and colleagues are now using quantum dots to detect infectious diseases, including HIV, influenza and hepatitis B.</p>



<p>“I was absolutely thrilled to see this,” says Judith Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society. “We have three people recognized who brought this technology from a dream, a hope, a theoretical construct … all the way through synthesis and manufacture.”</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-2023-mrna-vaccine-covid">the development of mRNA vaccines</a> — widely speculated as a candidate for the 2023 chemistry Nobel Prize — received the Nobel in medicine or physiology instead (<em>SN: 10/2/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sometimes chemistry gets a bad rap,” Giordan says. “But here are two magnificent examples of how chemistry has solved problems in the world.”</p>



<p>The three winners will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report">A global report finds amphibians are still in peril. But it’s not all bad news</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 20 years ago, the first global assessment of amphibians found the animals facing widespread declines. Now, a second, updated report shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06578-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many amphibians are still in trouble</a>, but with some silver linings, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“We are realistic and hopeful at the same time,” says Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks extinction risk trends for species around the world.</p>



<p>In particular, the wealth of data in the new report, which includes about 8,000 amphibian species, could help focus conservation efforts for years to come, says Luedtke, who also works from Washington, D.C., for Re:wild, a conservation organization based in Austin, Texas. That’s what happened after the <a href="https://www.iucn-amphibians.org/red-listing/global-amphibian-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Global Amphibian Assessment</a> in 2004, which brought awareness to the amphibian crisis and galvanized researchers to coordinate efforts.</p>





<p>Having two assessments that can be compared is a big deal, experts say. “It’s important not just to have a picture, but actually to have a sequence of pictures … where you can see what’s happening over time,” says conservation ecologist Ana Rodrigues of CNRS in Montpelier, France, who worked on the first assessment but was not involved in the second. “I’m really happy to see this done.”</p>



<p>Here are five big takeaways from the new report.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Amphibians remain more threatened with extinction than any other vertebrate group.</h4>



<p>About 41 percent of amphibian species, which include frogs, toads and salamanders, are threatened with extinction, Luedtke and her colleagues found. That’s more than any other group of vertebrates, beating out sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (27 percent), reptiles (21 percent) and birds (13 percent).</p>



<p>Amphibians held this title in 2004 too, when 39 percent of species were threatened. As part of the 2022 update, researchers also used data to reconstruct the situation in 1980. They found that even in 1980, that number was already high, at 38 percent. Basically, amphibians have been really threatened for a really long time, Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The most common threat that affects amphibians is habitat loss and degradation, with agriculture affecting as many as 77 percent of the studied species. Other threats include climate change and disease, each affecting 29 percent of species. Of course, “these things are never completely isolated,” says Rodrigues, and each threat may increase the likelihood of other threats.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Many of the worst amphibian declines are being caused by climate change now, instead of disease.</h4>



<p>Luedtke and colleagues also wanted to know which threats were most responsible for driving the worst declines. So they looked at a subset of 788 species that, between 1980 and 2022, moved down an <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/#:~:text=It%20divides%20species%20into%20nine,in%20the%20Wild%20and%20Extinct." target="_blank" rel="noopener">IUCN Red List status</a> level — for instance, from vulnerable to endangered. They found that, in 2004, disease was the primary driver behind the drop in conservation status for 58 percent of that species subset. At the time, the fungal pathogen<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-frog-killing-disease-may-not-be-so-new"> chytrid was devastating frog populations</a> around the world (<em>SN: 8/23/02</em>). Climate change, on the other hand, was a significant contributor to declines in only 1 percent of species.</p>



<p>Now, less than 20 years later, climate change is behind a status drop for 39 percent of species. That makes it the most common primary driver of declines across the amphibian group, the researchers found. And still the finding is probably an underestimate, Luedtke says, as studies continue to emerge detailing how climate change–related temperature increases, changes in precipitation, extreme weather events and wildfires impact amphibians.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s very worrying,” Rodrigues says. “We’re at the beginning of climate change.… What’s ahead of us?”</p>

ROJAS-RUNJAIC</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. It’s bad around the world. But amphibians are doing worse in some regions than others.</h4>



<p>Each region faces its own set of threats. The chytrid outbreak, for example, has affected much of the world, but it hit Central and South America especially hard from the 1970s to the 2000s. That likely explains why that region contains the largest proportion of species in the IUCN Red List categories of highest concern, the researchers say. New Guinea and Africa were spared much of the devastation, though the pathogen has recently started to emerge in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>





<p>Across Europe and East Asia, habitat loss is the leading cause of decline, followed by a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fungus-species-found-killing-salamanders">newly emerging fungal pathogen</a> in Europe called <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, this time that affects salamanders (<em>SN: 9/3/13</em>). It hasn’t yet spread to North America, which would be disastrous, Rodrigues says. The continent is home to more than 200 types of salamanders, over a quarter of the world’s salamander species.</p>



<p>For now, North America’s amphibian declines are most associated with climate change, the report found. South and Southeast Asia are seeing an improving trend among their species’ extinction risk, probably due to better management of protected areas.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Scientists know a lot more about amphibians now than they did in 2004.</h4>



<p>One of the assessment’s few bright spots is its sheer amount of data. The update includes more than 2,000 additional species — all newly described since 2004. There was also a decrease in species labeled as “data deficient” by the IUCN, from 23 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent in 2022. By comparison, though, less than 1 percent of bird species are listed as data deficient.</p>



<p>While there’s still a long way to go for amphibians, researchers are thrilled by the new amount of information. “It’s like, wow, all the knowledge!” Rodrigues says. “So that’s absolutely good news.” With more data, she says, conservation efforts can be better focused.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Some amphibian species have improved since 2004.</h4>



<p>The new report didn’t just find declines — 120 species saw their IUCN conservation status improve.</p>



<p>About half of those species recovered unaided. Many of those had suffered declines due to chytrid and are now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-frogs-may-be-bouncing-back-after-killer-chytrid-fungus">bouncing back</a>, possibly as frogs become resistant to the pathogen (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>). It’s a source of hope that “we have these little frogs evolving, in front of our eyes, resistance to chytridiomycosis,” Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The other half improved thanks to conservation efforts, the report found. One of those species is India’s indigo bush frog (<em>Raorchestes indigo</em>), which was classified as critically endangered in 2004. A couple years later, a legal battle led to the end of all mining in the Kudremukh Massif mountain range, and the species’ IUCN status has since improved to vulnerable.</p>



<p>Stories like that are evidence that effective habitat protection can make a noticeable difference, the researchers say, and yet, with most amphibians still facing declines, it’s clear that current efforts are not enough. The assessment’s accompanying State of the World’s Amphibians Report focuses on action steps based on the new findings. Among other things, it identifies 50 target conservation areas around the world — including Jamaica, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and the Central Annamite Highlands in Vietnam — that feature a high density of threatened species.</p>



<p>“Yes, the number of threatened amphibians continues to increase, but our understanding is improving,” Luedtke says. “And because we understand them better, we can act in a more accurate and effective way.”</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from Trust in Medical Research, a </em><a href="https://doi.org/10.26180/23827920.v2"><em>freely available</em></a><em> new book by </em><a href="https://www.monash.edu/alumni/alumni-events/graduation/speaker-profiles/may-2023/professor-warwick-anderson-ao"><em>Warwick P. Anderson</em></a><em>, emeritus professor of physiology and biomedical sciences at Monash University in Victoria, Australia.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It has always been difficult for me to admit that we have a genuine and substantial problem of fraud and rubbish science in medical research. I suspect this is true for most scientists. We want to think of science as being free from half-truths and fake news. We hope that the high moral purpose of medical research will guard against wrongdoing, that it will weigh on our minds so heavily that we all take care to work and publish honestly and competently.</p>



<p>We know that scientists sometimes make unintentional mistakes due to ignorance, but we also know in our hearts that some people are so ambitious that they push the envelope, stretch the truth and take shortcuts. We know, too, that a few others go further and get carried away by the prospects of scientific and financial rewards and so cheat, commit fraud and lie in publications. This is what some humans do in all walks of life.</p>



<p>We know all this, but it is fair to say that we generally do not want to face up to it. Jennifer Byrne at the University of Sydney put it well when <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00439-9">she wrote</a> that we tend to overlook the research fraud issue “because the scientific community has been unwilling to have frank and open discussions about it”:</p>



<span id="more-127991"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Fraud departs from community norms, so scientists do not want to think about it, let alone talk about it … This becomes a vicious cycle: because fraud is not discussed, people don’t learn about it, so they don’t consider it, or they think it’s so rare that it’s unlikely to affect them, and so papers are less likely to come under scrutiny. Thinking and talking about systematic fraud is essential to solving this problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When challenged about the incidence of fraud in medical research, many scientists tend to take defensive positions. We might contend that the usual self-correcting methods of science, replication of experiments and peer review will solve the problem. But we know that peer review is not honed to detect fraud reliably (though it can do), that replication of experiments is something that most of us are not very interested in doing (and it rarely gets supported by funders anyhow) and that a negative result from replication research will struggle to get published. All medical researchers should talk more about research misconduct because it is we who have most at stake: our reputations, the reputation of medical research itself, and our time and resources when we spend months or years on a project based on what turns out to have been fraudulent research.</p>



<p>So, what should we do as scientists to better own the problem and guard medical research? One way, I contend, is for medical research to become a true profession.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Medical research is not a profession, even though it demands a high level of professionalism. Anyone can call themselves a medical researcher. There are no processes that affirm an individual has reached some agreed level of expertise, proficiency and reliability. There is no specific training and no accreditation program. There is no requirement to learn a designated set of skills and knowledge, such as the proper use of statistics, what good research practices are or what the ethical obligations are. There is no equivalent of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and the national- and state-based medical boards. There is no need for registration and demonstration of training. There is not even a set of stated principles that we expect every medical researcher to share.</p>



<p>Other groups of people who train to be expert, whose jobs involve individual responsibilities and can be hazardous to others, have professional bodies that manage accreditation or are accredited by government. Such fields have training and competency entry requirements, and they usually require ongoing training and education. They have formal ways to withdraw recognition and accreditation when their members act in ways that harm their customers or patients and tarnish the reputation of the profession itself. Why should medical research be different to doctors, dentists, physiotherapists and vets? Why don’t we have a professional certification system in medical research that requires achievement and maintenance of competency and ethical standards and could remove accreditation when misconduct is proven?</p>



<p>I have written this chapter with some trepidation. Some of my colleagues fear that any internal criticism of the methods and procedures of medical research will be seized upon by critics, especially politicians, to attack scientists and medical research itself and potentially even take control of funding.</p>



<p>I understand this concern, but the bigger risk in the medium to long term is to not address the problems ourselves. After all, if scientific training teaches us anything, it is how to critically examine everything – methodology, results, applications for funding, proposed publications, PhD theses, seminars and conference presentations – and then to find solutions.</p>



<p>The danger signs are already flashing. Richard Smith, a previous editor of <em>The BMJ</em>, <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/07/05/time-to-assume-that-health-research-is-fraudulent-until-proved-otherwise/">wrote recently</a> about clinical trials: “We have now reached a point where those doing systematic reviews must start by assuming that a study is fraudulent until they can have some evidence to the contrary.” When someone as experienced as Smith makes such a statement, it is past time for us to put our house in order.</p>

                <p>Glimpses of the ultrafast world of electrons are changing scientists’ vision of the inner workings of atoms and molecules. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physics goes to three physicists who illuminated this realm with ultrashort pulses of light, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 3.</p>



<p>Physicists Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier will split the 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million) prize, awarded &#8220;for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within atoms and molecules, electrons zip around at extreme speeds. Capturing their to-and-fro is possible only with pulses of light that are extremely short. It’s akin to a camera flash that lasts mere attoseconds, or billionths of a billionth of a second.</p>



<p>Humans have long strived to measure processes with increasing precision, says Peter Armitage, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University. “With the advent of lasers, the timescales that you could measure became shorter and shorter [because] you&#8217;re doing it with ultrafast light pulses.”</p>





<p>Over decades, researchers have honed the ability to create such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pursuit-briefest-beat">near-instantaneous bursts of light</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/10</em>). In the 1980s, L’Huillier, now at Lund University in Sweden, noticed that infrared laser light sent through a gas would <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/21/3/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create light of a variety of wavelengths</a>, what’s known as high-harmonic generation. The effect is a result of how that light interacts with the electrons in the gas, by a process which L’Huillier’s research helped clarify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These other wavelengths, known as overtones or harmonics, are similar to the overtones that help give musical instruments their distinctive sounds. Adding together the right combinations of overtones results in very short pulses of light. With this method, researchers led by Agostini, now at Ohio State University in Columbus, in 2001 produced <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1059413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of light pulses</a>, each of which lasted just 250 attoseconds. The same year, Krausz, now at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues created single pulses lasting just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35107000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">650 attoseconds</a>. Today, scientists can make much shorter pulses tens of attoseconds long.</p>



<p>“I was personally fascinated by this field from the start, and this is why I continued with it during many, many years,” L’Huillier said in a phone call during the announcement. &nbsp;L’Huillier is only the fifth woman to receive the physics Nobel. “There are not so many women that get this prize, so it’s very, very special,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have used this technique to explore the behavior of electrons inside atoms and molecules. For example, the technique has revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1189401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timescale for the photoelectric effect</a>, in which light knocks an electron out of an atom, and details of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-tunneling-takes-time-new-study-shows">quantum tunneling</a>, in which electrons pass through barriers that seem insurmountable (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>The technique also reveals the behavior of molecules. “You can watch the motions of molecules themselves, essentially to make movies of molecular motion,” Armitage says. “And this is of vast interest for all kinds of things: for [everything from] understanding why some materials are superconductors at high temperatures to photovoltaic applications, harvesting energy from light…. I think it&#8217;s really just right at the beginning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Rosner, a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago, says one application involves designing materials from scratch.“Chemistry is all about how electrons … interact with one another,” he says. “It&#8217;s like building a house, and you need to know what goes first and what&#8217;s the next step.” But in this case, you want to follow what the electrons do during chemical synthesis — which is something ultrashort light pulses can do. “It really opens up an entirely new way of thinking about how we actually make stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/noisy-environs-pied-tamarins-smell-communicate">In noisy environs, pied tamarins are using smell more often to communicate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Native to the Brazilian Amazon, pied tamarins have always used vocal calls to communicate. But noise pollution from car traffic and other human activity are forcing some tamarins to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03949370.2023.2248591?src=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complement those voice calls with smell markings</a> to alert others to dangers, researchers report September 20 in <em>Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Most pied tamarins (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>) live in Manaus, Brazil, inhabiting fragmented patches of forest scattered around urban environments. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this small, black and whitish-yellow primate <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critically endangered</a>.</p>





<p>Vocal communication is crucial for pied tamarins’ survival; they use it to alert other individuals to danger — an important feat considering the urban environment surrounding them. &#8220;Pied tamarins have 12 different types of vocalization with several uses, from pointing to food and cuddling each other to calling out for some danger,&#8221; says Tainara Sobroza, a biologist at the Federal University of Amazonas in Manaus.</p>



<p>The &#8220;danger&#8221; vocalization is particularly important for these animals, Sobroza says, as many are hit by cars and killed when they cross streets to move between forest patches. &#8220;We wanted to understand if this type of vocalization is being affected by the noise of urban environments,&#8221; she says.</p>



<p>Sobroza and colleagues spent about a year observing pied tamarins, which normally wander in groups of less than 10 individuals. Using radio collars, the team tracked nine groups in Manaus for 10 days each from November 2018 to December 2019. While physically following the groups, the researchers measured the loudness of the alpha female’s alert call and visually counted how often individuals rubbed their chest and lower parts on the ground and trees, spreading an odorous, waxy substance to signal which direction they were heading.</p>



<p>The team thought the tamarins would use fewer vocal callings and more smell-spreading to communicate effectively between groups — but that is not what happened. Estimates of the behaviors suggest tamarins complemented one with the other: They maintained the loudness and quantity of their vocal calls while also marking the terrain with their scents.</p>



<p>“It is just like being at a noisy party, and you want to call a friend that can&#8217;t hear you from the other side of the room,” Sobroza says. “Added to calling him or her, you also usually wave and do arm gestures to call the attention of that person.”</p>



<p>The new observations bring extra knowledge about the ecology and behavior of this species, says Luciane Lopes de Souza, a biologist at the University of the State of Amazonas in Manaus who did not take part in the study. &#8220;It is very interesting to see that pied tamarins can adapt to use [a scent-marking] form of communication, which we see much more frequently in other species such as the squirrel monkey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Human activity is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cities-create-accidental-experiments-plant-animal-evolution">changing the behavior of several species</a> such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/city-song-birds-sing-higher-near-urban-traffic">birds</a>, spiders and crabs (<em>SN: 6/26/16, SN: 7/16/03</em>). Understanding these changes is crucial if humans want to mitigate their impacts through conservation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do hope this study goes on, as it is of extreme importance we have research like this running for longer periods,” Souza says. “This way, we can understand annual or seasonal changes in animal behavior and think of evolutionary changes they might be facing.&#8221;</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, David Haydock will talk about the paper entitled &quot;EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state
activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method
involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as
successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field
remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-
scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across
time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these
microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious
mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of
mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes
associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the
temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source
imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-
state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of
EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time
scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available
methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these
microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.</p>

                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>The latest Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset has arrived! And with it, a brand new indicator. Read on for details, and be sure to explore the data for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators identify and quantify instances of specific Open Science practices in published scientific literature using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques applied and developed in partnership with <a href="https://dataseer.ai/">DataSeer</a>. At PLOS, we use indicators as a tool to support our mission to advance Open Science. Other members of the scholarly community use them to <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/">understand trends in their institution</a>; to <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8117154">explore markers of research integrity</a>, and to <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">benchmark new tools for monitoring Open Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The latest Open Science Indicators dataset</h2>



<p>This is the fourth quarterly update to Open Science Indicators since we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">introduced the dataset</a> in December 2022. It covers January 1 2019 to June 30 2023 (four full years, plus the first half of 2023). Like the previous installments, this update measures data-generation and -sharing, code-generation and -sharing, and preprint posting. <strong>It also includes a preliminary version of our first new indicator: protocol sharing</strong>. Watch this space for more on how we developed the protocol sharing indicator in a future post.</p>



<p>OSI Version 4 (Sept 23) also includes an expanded comparator corpus, which has doubled the number of articles from other publishers included in the dataset from 8,176 in version 3 (June 23) to 16,023 today.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=41362998">README</a> for a full list of updates related to version 4.</p>



<h2>Observations</h2>



<p>For the first half of 2023, all four indicators remain stable overall, consistent with patterns observed in 2022. In keeping with previous results, PLOS articles were more likely to link to public research data or code than non-PLOS articles, and equally likely to link to a preprint.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Nobel Prize week, and the work behind mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has just <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/">earned the physiology or medicine prize</a>. But this is Retraction Watch, so that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>



<p>A Nobel prize-winning researcher whose publications have come under scrutiny has retracted his <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSemenza%252c%2bGregg%2bL">10th paper</a> for issues with the data and images. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis had flagged possibly duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s publications on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=gregg+l+semenza">PubPeer</a> before 2019, and other sleuths posted more beginning in October 2020. </p>



<span id="more-127996"></span>



<p>Last September, Semenza and his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/03/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-retracts-four-papers/">pulled four papers</a> from <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Another <em>PNAS</em> paper, one in <em>Oncogene</em>, and two from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> were retracted over the past year, with each notice stating that Semenza requested or agreed to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, <em>Molecular Cancer Research</em> has retracted another of the Nobelist’s articles,&nbsp; “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/11/5/456/89397/Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is-Essential-for">Procollagen Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 Is Essential for Hypoxia-Induced Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” which appeared in 2013. The article has been cited 181 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a 2011 retraction for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 24 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – today’s retraction makes 10 for Semenza. More <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03032-9">may be on the way</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/21/10/1120/729213/Retraction-Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is">notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that lanes 4, 5, and 6 of the HIF-1α immunoblot in Fig. 3A are identical images. An internal review corroborated the authors’ claim, and the editors agreed with the authors’ retraction request. The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article.</p>



<p>A copy of this Retraction Notice was sent to the last known email addresses for all authors. Four authors (Denis Wirtz, Carmen C. Wong, Daniele M. Gilkes, and Gregg L. Semenza) agreed to the retraction; the 3 remaining authors could not be located.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Semenza did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Johns Hopkins would not comment on whether they were investigating the matter when a reporter from <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-gregg-semenza-retractions-20230801-2wv7kspmq5awfes3omkacb4bpy-story.html"><em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asked this summer</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#1">commented</a> that the lanes of the figure identified in the retraction notice were “much more similar than expected.” The first author, Daniele M. Gilkes, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#3">responded</a> by posting an image of the “original uncropped version.” Another commenter raised more concerns about the image, but Gilkes did not respond again. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-citrus-fruits-china-origin">The first citrus fruits may have come from southern China</a></h4>

              
                <p>Citrus fruits’ hometown is in China, a genetic analysis suggests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>An extensive look at wild members of the orange family tree hints that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01516-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first species in the <em>Citrus </em>genus arose around 8 million years ago</a> in what’s now south central China, researchers report October 2 in <em>Nature Genetics</em>. The <em>Citrus </em>lineage’s ancestors may have first arrived in Asia on the Indian tectonic plate around 25 million years ago, when it collided with the Asian plate.</p>





<p>Today, myriad tart fruits — including human-bred versions of oranges, lemons and limes — stockpile grocery store shelves. But it’s unclear where their oldest ancestors evolved. Previous studies pointed to places like northeastern Australia, southern China or the southeastern foothills of the Himalayas. Piecing together citrus evolution could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lemons-kumquats-roots-citrus-variety-dug">help researchers make drought- or disease-resilient plant varieties</a> that still bear tasty fruit, says horticulturalist Qiang Xu (<em>SN: 4/14/15</em>).</p>



<p>To pinpoint <em>Citrus</em>’ origins, Xu, of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China and colleagues built a family tree using the genetic blueprints of 314 <em>Citrus </em>and <em>Citrus-</em>related plants, which included 15 <em>Citrus</em> species. The researchers also trekked into the field to find where the trees grow in the wild. The oldest citrus fruits — including <em>C. trifoliata,</em> the trifoliate orange — are found in south central China, suggesting that region is the genus’ birthplace.</p>



<p><em>Citrus</em> evolution didn’t stop there. Some species have roots in the regions that the earlier studies identified, the team found. Pomelo and citron fruits appear to have sprung up in the Himalayan foothills, and some wild limes evolved in Australia.</p>



<p>The researchers also confirmed that a gene called <em>PH4</em> is linked to the amount of citric acid inside each fruit. <em>PH4</em> turns on a proton pump that allows citric acid to build up inside oranges and their relatives. The more citric acid, the more tart the taste.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-2023-mrna-vaccine-covid">Early mRNA research that led to COVID-19 vaccines wins 2023 medicine Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two scientists who laid the groundwork for what would become among the most influential vaccines of all time have been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biochemist Katalin Karikó, now at the University of Szeged in Hungary, and Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania were honored for their research on modifications of mRNA that made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">the first vaccines against COVID-19</a> possible (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody has experienced the COVID-19 pandemic that affects our life, economy and public health. It was a traumatic event,” said Qiang Pan-Hammarström, a member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which awards the medicine or physiology  prize. Her remarks came on October 2 after a news briefing to announce the winners. “You probably don&#8217;t need to emphasize more that the basic discovery made by the laureates has made a huge impact on our society.”</p>





<p>As of September 2023, more than 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses — including mRNA vaccines as well as other kinds of shots — had been administered since they first became available in December 2020, according to the World Health Organization. In the year after their introduction, the shots are <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to have saved nearly 20 million lives</a> globally. In the United States, where mRNA COVID-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech accounted for the vast majority of vaccinations, the vaccines are estimated to have <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/dec/us-covid-19-vaccination-program-one-year-how-many-deaths-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented 1.1 million additional deaths</a> and 10.3 million hospitalizations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A different kind of vaccine</h4>



<p>RNA is DNA’s lesser-known chemical cousin. Cells make RNA copies of genetic instructions contained in DNA. Some of those RNA copies, known as messenger RNA, or mRNA, are used to build proteins. Messenger RNA “literally tells your cells what proteins to make,” says Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire, a viral immunologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Proteins do much of the important work that keeps cells, and the organisms they’re a part of, alive and well.</p>



<p>The mRNA vaccines work a bit differently than traditional immunizations. Most traditional vaccines use viruses or bacteria — either weakened or killed — or proteins from those pathogens to provoke the immune system into making protective antibodies and other defenses against future infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna instead contain mRNA that carries<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating"> instructions for making</a> one of the coronavirus’s proteins (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). When a person gets an mRNA shot, the genetic material gets into their cells and triggers the cells to produce the viral protein for a short amount of time. When the immune system sees the viral protein, it builds defenses to prevent serious illness if the person later gets infected with the coronavirus. </p>



<p>Vaccines using mRNA were a good choice to combat the pandemic, Corbett-Helaire says. The technology allows scientists to “skip that step of making large amounts of proteins in the laboratory and instead … tell the body to do things that the body already does, except now we make an extra protein,” she says. </p>



<p>In addition to protecting people from the coronavirus, mRNA vaccines may also work against other <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/research/product-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infectious diseases</a> and <a href="https://www.biontech.com/int/en/home/pipeline-and-products/pipeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a>. Scientists might also use the technology to help people with certain rare <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/behind-the-science/unlocking-power-our-bodys-protein-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetic diseases</a> make enzymes or other proteins they lack. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mrna-vaccine-next-viruses-flu-hiv-zika">Clinical trials are under way</a> for many of these uses, but it could take years before scientists know the results (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A long time coming</h4>



<p>The first mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 became available just under a year into the pandemic, but the technology behind it has been decades in the making.</p>





<p>In 1997, Karikó and Weissman met at the copy machine, Karikó said during a news conference October 2 at the University of Pennsylvania. She told him about her work with RNA, and he shared his interest in vaccines. Although housed in separate buildings, the researchers worked together to <a href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/modified-mrna-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solve one fundamental problem</a> that could have derailed mRNA vaccines and therapies: Pumping regular mRNA into the body gets the immune system riled up in bad ways, producing a flood of immune chemicals called cytokines. Those chemicals can trigger damaging inflammation. And this unmodified mRNA produces very little protein in the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found that swapping the RNA building block uridine for modified versions, first pseudouridine and then N1-methylpseudouridine, could dampen the bad immune reaction. That nifty chemistry, <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(05)00211-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported in 2005</a>, allowed researchers to rein in the immune response and safely deliver the mRNA to cells.</p>



<p>“The messenger RNA has to hide and it has to go unnoticed by our bodies, which are very brilliant at destroying things that are foreign,” Corbett-Helaire says. “The modifications that [Karikó and Weissman] worked on for a number of years really were fundamental to allowing the mRNA therapeutics to hide while also being very helpful to the body.”</p>



<p>In addition, the modified mRNA <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/38/17/5884/1031556?login=false#82637740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced lots of protein</a> that could <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(16)32681-8?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spark an immune response</a>, the team showed in 2008 and 2010. It was this work on modifying mRNA building blocks that the prize honors.</p>



<p>For years, “we couldn&#8217;t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said at the Penn news conference. Vaccines using the technology failed clinical trials in the early 1990s, and most researchers gave up. But Karikó “lit the match,” and they spent the next 20 years figuring out how to get it to work, Weissman said. “We would sit together in 1997 and afterwards and talk about all the things that we thought RNA could do, all of the vaccines and therapeutics and gene therapies, and just realizing how important it had the potential to be. That’s why we never gave up.”</p>



<p>In 2006, Karikó and Weissman started a company called RNARx to develop mRNA-based treatments and vaccines. After Karikó joined the German company BioNTech in 2013, she and Weissman continued to collaborate. They and colleagues reported in 2015 that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365915300535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encasing mRNA in bubbles of lipids</a> could help the fragile RNA get into cells without getting broken down in the body. The researchers were developing a Zika vaccine when the pandemic hit, and quickly applied what they had learned toward containing the coronavirus.</p>



<p>The duo’s work was not always so celebrated. Thomas Perlmann, Secretary General of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, asked the newly minted laureates whether they were surprised to have won. He said that Karikó was overwhelmed, noting that just 10 years ago she was terminated from her job and had to move to Germany without her family to get another position. She never won a grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health to support her work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She struggled and didn’t get recognition for the importance of her vision,” Perlmann said, but she had a passion for using mRNA therapeutically. “She resisted the temptation to sort of go away from that path and do something maybe easier.” Karikó is the 61st woman to win a Nobel Prize since 1901, and the 13th to be awarded a prize in physiology and medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though it often takes decades before the Nobel committees recognize a discovery, sometimes recognition comes relatively swiftly. For instance, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2020</a> a mere eight years after the researchers published a description of the genetic scissors CRISPR/Cas 9 (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>“I never expected in my entire life to get the Nobel Prize,” Weissman said, especially not a mere three years after the vaccines demonstrated their medical importance. Perlmann told him the Nobel committee was seeking to be “more current” with its awards, he said.</p>



<p>The timely Nobel highlights that “there are just a million other possibilities for messenger RNA therapeutics … beyond the vaccines,” Corbett-Helaire says.</p>



<p>The researchers said at the Penn news conference that they weren’t sure the early morning phone call from Perlmann was real. On the advice of Weissman’s daughter, they waited for the Nobel announcement. “We sat in bed. [I was] looking at my wife, and my cat is begging for food,” he said. “We wait, and the press conference starts, and it was real. So that’s when we really became excited.”</p>



<p>Karikó and Weissman will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or roughly $1 million.</p>

                <p><strong>In this short interview series, we will be shining a light on inspiring women working in neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. We explore  job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to read new interviews every month from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p>

Her research focuses on the genetics of autism, in particular what underpins aggressive behaviours in some. She previously completed a BSc in Developmental Psychology at the University of East Anglia.</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science/neuroscience? </strong></h6><p><p>I did my undergraduate degree in Developmental Psychology after working for a charity for children and young people with additional needs throughout college and developing an interest in working with young people with neurodevelopmental disorders. During my placement year at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) during this degree, I was most interested in the work done by the Forensic CAMHS team and decided to pursue a Master’s in this field.</p>
</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>My MSc is Forensic Mental Health, which looks at the mental health needs of the offending population and the causes of antisocial behaviour, whether that is mental illness, personality disorders, trauma, substance misuse. For my thesis project, I am investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of two high-risk genetic mutations associated with aggression in Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). Having worked with children and young people with ASC for years, and with the high rates of people with neurodevelopmental disorders in the Criminal Justice system, I was drawn to this thesis project as it allows me to explore the biological causes of the condition and understand this population better. This project is at the forefront of ASC research and its findings will allow for the development of targeted medication to manage aggression in people with ASC, which will be so beneficial to people with ASC and those that care for them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job? </strong></h6>
<h6><p>Being able to observe the link between brain structure and behaviour - I’m fascinated by the ‘nature vs. nurture’ debate, and how genetic makeup and differences in brain structure can predispose some people to certain mental illnesses if they are exposed to particular environmental stressors. I think this allows us to have a better understanding of mental health and what someone is experiencing because their symptoms and behaviours can be somewhat explained by what is happening in their brain, and this can give us an idea of how we can best work with them to improve their symptoms.</p></h6>
<h6>What are the challenges?</h6>
<h6><p>The need to be able to detach from the patients I work with, but still provide empathetic care. You can’t take on what your patients are experiencing as you wouldn’t be able to care for them effectively and it wouldn’t be healthy for myself, but you also must be present with your patients and build good therapeutic relationships! This is a hard thing to learn and is something that I am always consciously practising, especially when working with such vulnerable people that might find it difficult to open up to a professional in the first place.</p></h6><h6><strong>What skills are you currently trying to improve?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I am trying to speak up and not let imposter syndrome keep me back. I am often the youngest in the room when at my placement and this can stop me from contributing to conversations as I feel that I do not have the knowledge or experience to share my opinion, but I do! Finding the balance between my placement, my university work and having a social life and space to relax has been hard over this year, but I think I have become better at it and learnt to enforce boundaries where I need them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>The women I work with in the psychology team at my placement - we are a team of women working in a male inpatient unit aiming to provide psychological care within the medical model of the hospital. These women are knowledgeable, resilient and powerful. They have highlighted the importance of compassion in healthcare, and advocating for your patient’s wider needs, not just those that can be managed by medication, and I have learnt so much from them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I plan to work within the prison system and qualify as a forensic psychologist, ideally working with juvenile offenders. I am passionate about the accessibility of mental health support for all, whether that be for individuals with learning difficulties or those at a socio-economic disadvantage, and I hope to take this forward by opening these spaces up and improving their accessibility.</p>

</h6>
<h6>What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</h6><p><p>Ask questions - most people want to share their knowledge and these can lead to interesting conversations with new perspectives and ideas, and often further opportunities. Don’t be afraid to re-email someone - the majority of the time they are not ignoring you, they are just very busy and it has slipped their mind. Being a woman in a male-dominated field can be daunting but your opinions on things matter, and are needed to make sure all perspectives are heard!</p>
</p>
<h6>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</h6><p><p>The inaccessibility of the field! A lot of positions want experience and a lot of opportunities at an undergraduate and postgraduate level are unpaid, and so excludes those that do not have access to financial support that allows them to take on unpaid work. Recognising that individuals from a lower socio-economic background are being excluded should be a priority of the field and steps should be taken to prevent this from happening. Doing so is so important as it gives a voice to all and benefits the whole field by giving it new perspectives on research areas.</p></p><hr><p>This article was written by Lauren Wallis and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p><strong>A powerful pulse of laser light: Step toward fusion</strong> —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/powerful-pulse-laser-light-step-toward-fusion"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;September 29, 1973</p>



<p>One spur to the development of more powerful lasers is the possibility of using them in projects seeking to gain electric power from controlled thermonuclear fusion. The idea is to use laser light to evaporate, ionize and implosively compress a solid fuel pellet and thus trigger nuclear fusions.… Now the Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque have announced a new laser that appears to be a significant step on the way.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update </h4>



<p>Laser fusion is starting to hit its stride. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California use 192 laser beams to blast a target with millions of joules of energy in an attempt to initiate fusion. Last year, the lab achieved ignition, in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-energy">more energy is released than initially hits the target</a> (<em>SN: 1/14/23, p. 6</em>). Then in July, the lab repeated the feat, achieving the highest energy yield yet. A blast of about 2 million joules resulted in an output of nearly 4 million joules of fusion energy, according to a lab statement. But much more energy is required to power the laser facility, meaning laser fusion still isn’t a net power source.</p>

<p>On Aug. 17, 2022, Nicki Tiffin received a notification that she had published a new study. The problem? She had never submitted an article to the journal in which the paper appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, despite efforts by Tiffin and others, the journal has not responded to retraction requests, and the article remains online. Further investigation by Retraction Watch has revealed other dysfunction at the journal, including falsely representing its editors and a schism from its founders and original sponsor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Triumphs and improvement of Computational Bioinformatics in South</a> <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Africa</a>,” was published in June 2022 in the <em>European Journal of Biomedical Informatic</em>s (EJBI).</p>



<p>Tiffin, a professor at the South African National Bioinformatics Institute at the University of the Western Cape, discovered that the new paper was a plagiarized version of an article she had published in 2016. That paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004395">The Development of Computational Biology in South Africa: Successes Achieved and Lessons Learnt</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s <em>Web of Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, Tiffin was a professor at the University of Cape Town. Although she had no role in publishing the <em>EJBI </em>article, it lists her name as the sole author of the paper, as well as her University of Cape Town affiliation.</p>



<span id="more-127975"></span>



<p>For over a year, Tiffin, editors at <em>PLOS</em>, and Paula Saner, the research integrity manager at the University of Cape Town, have been trying to get <em>EJBI </em>to retract the plagiarized article, with no success.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In an email to Retraction Watch, Saner described the steps she had taken, all fruitless:&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, Saner said she contacted the university’s internal cybersecurity team, who weren’t able to do anything, as well as PLOS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By March 2023, the author name and affiliation on the paper had been changed to “Nicki R Adolf, Kyushu University.” Saner said PLOS agreed to reach out to Kyushu University in Japan, which has no record of a person named Nicki R Adolf having worked there. Since the University of Cape Town affiliation had been removed, Saner said she left the issue to PLOS and others.</p>



<p>But in early September, Tiffin noticed that her name and affiliation reappeared on the PDF of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Renee Hoch, managing editor of the PLOS Publications Ethics Team, told Retraction Watch that practices like the ones employed by <em>EJBI</em> are a “substantial threat to researchers and the integrity of the published record.” Journals and authors have little recourse if the publisher of the concerning article doesn’t respond or act according to standards such as those set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Tiffin’s predicament, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to COPE guidance, in cases of dual publication the first journal may issue a notice of redundant publication and the journal(s) who publish subsequently should retract the redundant article(s). PLOS has not issued a public notice in this case: we do not have any concerns about the PLOS Computational Biology article and would not want a public notice to cast a negative light on the PLOS article or its authors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hoch said the PLOS did attempt to contact <em>EJBI </em>about the article, but that it has not responded or retracted the duplicate article.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Tiffin described discovering the plagiarized paper as “quite a surprise.” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It has been quite hard to understand what the journal gains from this kind of fraud, and it seems most likely that they are attempting to pad out their content with known researchers claimed as authors, to appear more like a bona fide journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tiffin said that although she had absolutely no involvement in publishing the paper, its publication is damaging to her reputation as a researcher and the reputation of the University of Cape Town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also noted how unusual and unnerving it is that an obviously fraudulent article like this could stay published for so long, despite repeated efforts by her, Saner, and PLOS. She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is also disturbing that the journal has not cleaned up properly despite the challenge from the University of Cape Town, and have so blatantly simply altered the fictional author details provided with the paper. They have not taken the fraudulent material offline. This means that they intend to continue with these kind of practices, and this should not be allowed to continue unchecked. It is, however, quite difficult to find a route to ensure this fraud is halted – as Paula has demonstrated through her multiple and very determined efforts to have the fraudulent article taken down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>EJBI </em>was previously the official journal of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), but Saner noted that the organization <a href="https://efmi.org/2020/05/31/special-announcement-european-journal-for-biomedical-informatics-ejbi-no-longer-under-status-official-journal-of-efmi/">withdrew that claim</a> in 2020 because of “completely inappropriate behaviour for a scientific journal and the lack of quality assurance.”</p>



<p>At that time, <em>EJBI </em>had not removed its claim to be an EFMI journal from its website, “despite repeated requests,” according to EFMI’s statement, and the association was “preparing legal action.” <em>EJBI</em>’s <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/">website</a> no longer refers to EFMI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website lists three editors in chief: Mauro Giacomini of the University of Genoa in Italy, Izet Masic of the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bernd Blobel of the University of Regensburg in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when contacted by Retraction Watch, Giacomini said all three editors had resigned from the journal at the same time the EFMI withdrew its support, and elaborated about why. Giacomini said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The [EJBI] has had a great history, starting from the founding [by our] colleague Jana Zvárová. Shortly before her death, Jana sold the magazine to its current ownership. Upon Jana&#8217;s death (2017), in her memory and in agreement with the European Federation for Medical Informatics, Izet Mesic, Bernd Blobel and I took over the title of Editor-in-Chief of the same journal. Until 2019, we tried to manage this journal with the normal rules of the scientific world, but we noticed serious actions against these rules by the owners. For this reason, after the EJBI pHealth 2019 Special Issue, EFMI withdrew its endorsement of the journal and at the same time the three of us resigned from the role of Editor-in-Chief. We have written to the magazine several times to remove our names from the site but have received no response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Blobel, who helped launch the journal, said it was originally a “home-made” publication produced at Charles University in Prague. When Zvárová’s health got worse, she decided to move the journal to the UK, he said. Giacomini added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For years Jana has carried on the journal in a personal way and with great dedication. When the registration mechanism began with the various international bodies (Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, &#8230; ) many persons suggested that Jana find a suitable publishing house that could bring EJBI into these accredited registers. I didn&#8217;t follow the negotiations, I think none of us followed them in detail, but I believe that these people deceived Jana first, certainly promising to work for the registration of EJBI, which was never done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">It is unclear who, if anyone, is currently serving as editor in chief of the journal, or what entity publishes it. Though Blobel said he originally communicated with colleagues in the UK, the <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/contactus.html">journal’s website</a> lists an address in Brussels, Belgium.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>EJBI </em>staff<em> </em>did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch. A message sent to an email address associated with a LinkedIn profile for DJ Uppari, who Blobel said was previously a managing editor for <em>EJBI</em>, also yielded no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also emailed several editors and associate editors listed on the journal’s website. Yasser Mohammed Hassanain Elsayed, a doctor and researcher with the Egyptian Ministry of Health, said he was an editor for the journal but had no knowledge of the article in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two others expressed confusion that they were listed as associate editors. Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeago, who is currently a senior lecturer at Kampala International University in Uganda, said he didn’t “know when my name was listed among the associate [editors].” Diego Mauricio López Gutierrez, a researcher at the University of Cauca in Colombia, said he was invited to serve as an associate editor and agreed, but never heard from the journal after that.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t get the memo, the presidents of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and the Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA) want you to stop talking about sex already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or at least they want anthropologists to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127981"></span>



<p>Ellie Kincaid <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/27/anthropology-groups-cancel-conference-panel-on-why-biological-sex-is-necessary-for-research/">reported last week</a> for Retraction Watch that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">a panel presentation</a> entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology” had been scheduled for November’s joint AAA-CASCA meeting in Toronto. The conference session had been approved by the programming committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then AAA President Ramona Pérez and CASCA president Monica Heller <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">decided</a> “safety and dignity” were threatened by anthropologists who think biological sex is still a category worth considering. Overriding the programming committee, the two leaders canceled the panel.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, gender is okay with the presidents. It’s talking about biological sex as if it matters to human experience that is a strict no-no. It’s particularly not okay if panelists are “gender critical,” i.e., scholars who think females are being harmed in the move to talking only about gender constructs and not in terms of biological sex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panelists had intended to talk about sex identification in skeletons, coeducation, tech-centric pornography, and misogyny using a generally feminist perspective to think about harm to females. You might think these topics are far enough left to pass muster in academe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">statement</a> put out by the AAA and CASCA accuses the panel of committing “one of the cardinal sins of scholarship – it assumes the truth of the proposition that it sets out to prove, namely, that sex and gender are simplistically binary, and that this is a fact with meaningful implications for the discipline.”</p>



<p>“Cardinal sin” is an appropriate choice of language here, because Pérez and Heller are working from dogma so heavy it is worthy of the Vatican. They act as if anytime someone considers the categories of male and female as worthy of study, they must be denying the existence of trans, gender nonbinary, and intersex people. That’s just silly. That’s like saying you can’t compare tangerines and grapefruits because tangelos also exist.</p>



<p>It’s entirely possible – indeed, reasonable – to consider the categories of male and female in science and other forms of scholarship, and doing so does not require denying that not everyone fits those categories. (I say this as someone whose scholarship and activism centered on <a href="https://alicedreger.com/medical_invention/">intersex</a> for <a href="https://alicedreger.com/gmf/">decades</a> as a person who has <a href="https://alicedreger.com/trans/">advocated</a> for trans rights.) Indeed, the canceled panelists alluded to the existence of people who don’t fit those categories in the abstracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the (alleged) risk of endangering safety and dignity, I’m going to say it: The great majority of humans come biologically in one of two forms, male and female. While it’s worth cautioning against simplistic thinking that assumes gendered behaviors and attributes are always biologically inborn and not culturally learned, you can also learn a lot by thinking in terms of categories of sex, especially if you look at the places where genders don’t easily map to sex.</p>



<p>Consider, for example, anthropological research that has focused on cultures that include third-gender categories. Anthropologists have documented how a <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-old-way-to-be-gay-couples-love-evolution-67337">number of traditional cultures</a> around the world provide designated names and pathways for male children who behave in ways identified as feminine. These children are shifted into categories that allow them to live like girls and then like women. (A few cultures also have the opposite, i.e., categories for females who take on masculine cultural roles.)</p>



<p>One might simply think of these categories as “transgender,” but as researchers have documented, there’s definitely a sexed element to all this. Third-gender males in these cultures are recognized as being androphilic (sexually attracted to masculine males), and traditionally no sex-changing interventions have been employed. This is about gender, yes, but it’s also about sex.</p>



<p>Anthropologists have also traced out what two cultures – one in the Dominican Republic and one in Papua New Guinea – have done to deal with an intersex condition that is relatively common in those populations. The condition, 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency, results in a child born looking female but later naturally undergoing a masculinizing puberty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watching what cultures do to preserve gendered (and especially heterosexist) beliefs in the face of recognized sexual minorities helps us understand how humans try to manage sex, including through gendered constructs.</p>



<p>I suppose Presidents Pérez and Heller might allow presentations on what look to them like trans and intersex people; their letter earnestly claims to be defending “members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But policing what scholars can say and think about sex and gender is no way to help minority sex, gender, and sexual-orientation populations. That policing will always end up harming some of them. (The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">letter</a> objecting to the canceling notes that one member of the committee-approved panel is lesbian.) </p>



<p>Moreover, this kind of attempt at silencing feeds the right’s portrayal of academics as hopelessly partisan and the right’s belief that political censorship is fair game.</p>



<p>This is all terribly ironic, too, because historically anthropology was one of the disciplines that taught us sex and gender are not the same thing. Human cultures have created so many different gender-masks for sex, what we learn by allowing free inquiry is just that: that gender (and therefore sex, too) can be a many-splendored thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More irony: the decision by Pérez and Heller silenced women who were making a group argument against the silencing of women. If the presidents want to fight against the core claim of gender-critical scholars – that defense of trans rights is accruing harm to women – can’t they see they’ve just <em>proven</em> the point?</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Any blog about the future of peer review should start with a brief mention of its history. The actual process of peer review can be dated back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century. It has of course evolved since then and one notable step was the introduction of external reviewers in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This model, however, only really became the norm in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>We can only speculate on what the future of peer review will be and how recent challenges and innovations will act to shape it. One thing is however sure: this future will depend on the key players of tomorrow, the ones who will one day hold the reins. The future of scientific research depends on today’s early career researchers (ECRs) and thus they will also play an instrumental role in shaping the future of peer review. Therefore, I decided to reach out to a selection of ECRs to gather their thoughts and hopes about the future of peer review.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging them as this blog would not have been possible without their contribution and time is a very valuable currency nowadays, especially for ECRs in the demanding research world.</p>

<p>Now without further ado, we will dive into their answers to the questions I had prepared.</p>
<p>To set the scene, the participants were first asked how familiar they were with the peer review system and whether they had already reviewed a manuscript or worked as an editor. Unsurprisingly, all of them had already reviewed manuscripts and Partha Sarathi Tripathy mentioned that he is working as an editor for an aquaculture journal in India. I then went on to ask them what their opinion of the current peer review system was.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the current peer review system is working?</strong></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a consensus around the fact that there are currently not enough rewards to motivate researchers to dedicate time in their busy schedule to reviewing manuscripts, given the pressure they are subjected to. This issue then leads to difficulty in finding reviewers and can also result in poor quality review reports. However, as Julia Sanchez-Garrido said, “<em>being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?).”</em> Stephanie Tsai also mentioned that she thought the system would benefit from more double-blind and transparent review.</p>
<p>My next question delved more into the specific aspects of the system that they liked or disliked.</p>
<p><strong> Can you tell me one thing that you like about it and one thing that you dislike?</strong></p>
<p>All the participants answered that they liked the fact that constructive criticism from a reviewer can improve a paper, for example by judiciously suggesting additional experiments, provided this reviewer is unbiased, familiar with the field of research in question and that the suggested changes are reasonable. “<em>Editors and reviewers both should be reasonable about considering the time and necessity of those suggestions to the core findings of the work,</em>” said Tsai. Partha Sarathi Tripathy added: “<em>The thing I like about the system is that it helps to ensure the quality and integrity of scientific literature. By having multiple experts review a paper, errors and inaccuracies can be caught before publication”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?)” </em><strong>Julia Sanchez-Garrido</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In a similar fashion, the aspects that they disliked were also centered around reviewers but this time mentioning the bad aspects that can stem from the anonymous status of reviewers, such as being unfair, letting a bias (conscious or unconscious) influence their judgement or suggesting unnecessary changes that might even be wrong. The commercial aspect of the system was also mentioned as a negative trait: “<em>I dislike the peer-review model of some commercial journals, who charge expensive article processing fees (including open-access charges) from researchers, build paywalls for readers, and ask researchers to review articles for free,</em>” said Yu Wan.</p>
<p>My next question prompted them to identify what changes they would implement if they had the chance to do so.</p>
<p><strong> If you had a magic wand and could change anything/everything about the current peer review system, what would you change?</strong></p>
<p>Here again the answers were homogeneous and similar changes were suggested. The need for better acknowledgment of the work accomplished by the reviewer was an important concern, along with how this work should be publicly displayed &#8211; similarly to platform such as <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> in order to serve as evidence to advance the career of reviewers. Yu Wan stated: “<em>If a researcher&#8217;s academic contribution is measured by the number and quality of papers that they have published, the researcher&#8217;s contribution to peer review should also be recognized in the same way</em>.” Wan then went on to add: “<em>I would also promote open/transparent peer review, with reviewers&#8217; comments, names, affiliations shown (with reviewers&#8217; consent) when the paper gets published. Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.” </em><strong>Yu Wan</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A second change that was mentioned several times was the need for more transparency, better rules or guidelines around the peer review process, or even training courses for reviewers as suggested by Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido to ensure that researchers are aware of predatory journals and ensure that: “<em>the effort and time invested in the review is worthwhile for the field.”</em> Clemens Falker-Gieske also mentioned that the lack of clear rules around what is needed for a paper to be accepted can lead to a feeling of randomness for the researchers: “<em>Often it appears quite random if a paper is accepted or rejected because it 100% depends on the assessment of the reviewers and the editor, which usually is a team of only 3 persons.</em>”</p>
<p>Tsai also added that: <em>“agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Several of the participants actually anticipated my next question, which was centered around transparent peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the recent changes such as transparent peer review? Do you like this principle and would you like to see more of it?</strong></p>
<p>A very strong &#8220;yes&#8221; was received from all the participants, which was heartening, as transparent peer review is becoming increasingly more present and is already the norm at many journals.</p>
<p>They liked the fact that the history of the review of a manuscript is now accessible and allows a better understanding of the manuscript and a deeper dive. Many ECRs mentioned that they would like to see more transparent review and that all journals should adopt it. The fact that it contributes to research integrity was also mentioned and Tripathy added that: “<em>knowing that their reviews will be public might motivate reviewers to be more thorough and constructive in their feedback,</em>” and then went on to say that “<em>transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”</p>
<p>However, Sanchez-Garrido also discussed issues that can stem from open peer review: “<em>On the other hand I would say open peer review, where the reviewer’s identities are revealed, can be problematic as it has the potential to lead to resentment and/or gratefulness towards specific individuals. In my opinion the process should be anonymous in both directions, to also avoid </em><i>favoritism.</i>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.</em>” <strong>Stephanie Tsai</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>My next question focused more on the future of peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the future of peer review? Do you think the current model will continue <em>ad eternum</em> or do you foresee changes?</strong></p>
<p>Different points of view were shared here. Sanchez-Garrido mentioned that “<em>we have yet to find a better system that works as well and that is sustainable.</em>” Falker-Gieske mentioned the problems of “<em>fake AI-generated papers</em>” and how “<em>the detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em>Tsai hoped for more transparent peer review and “<em>policies to reduce individual reviewer biases such as double blinded review.</em>” Wan stated that “<em>the current model of peer review is not sustainable given the increasing pressure that researchers are facing and therefore, changes must be taken.”</em> Tripathy added:<em> “it&#8217;s clear that the demands of the modern scientific community, combined with technological advancements, will drive changes. The ultimate goal will always be to uphold the quality, integrity, and advancement of scientific knowledge.”</em></p>
<p>My next question was then centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and what they thought of employing it.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think about the inclusion of artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>The general response was that caution was required with the use of AI and how its use, if permitted, should be limited. Sanchez-Garrido said that she did not think it had reached a stage where it could be used but that it would likely be used in the future. Falker-Gieske mentioned that it could be used for quality checks: language, plagiarism, authenticity. Tsai cautiously stated: “<em>completely removing the scientist would be less than ideal given how peer review is critical for assessing the quality of research being published and the reality of reviewer experiments (time, feasibility etc.).”</em> Wan had a similar answer and mentioned it should be used with caution but that “<em>AI would be a powerful tool for checking plagiarism and image manipulations or to assist reviewers in summarizing the work or searching for relevant publications.</em>” Wan also added that “<em>human&#8217;s expertise, experience, and accountability will always be pivotal in peer review,</em>” a point that was also made by Tripathy: “<em>the human touch – the expertise, intuition, and critical thinking that researchers bring to the table – will remain invaluable.</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”<strong> Partha Sarathi Tripathy</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I went on to ask them about what changes would be implemented in the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the peer review system will be like 10 years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido postulated on a Hybrid Review System combining human experts in the field with AI use at the initial steps in order to streamline the process. They also mentioned an increase in transparent review, as did Tsai.</p>
<p>My next question was to ask them what changes they would implement if they had the choice.</p>
<p><strong> How would you like it to be if it were up to you?</strong></p>
<p>Sanchez-Garrido answered that she “<em>would like junior researchers to get more of a chance to see how the publishing process goes and get involved in reviewing.</em>” Falker-Gieske added “<em>more transparent, fair and comparable between journals.</em>” Tsai suggested that “<em>editors and reviewers altogether discuss the manuscript in question at the end of their review briefly to come up with a plan for what they envision being required for revisions.</em>”</p>
<p>Wan suggested key points: “<em>1. Fair and transparent review models. 2. Diverse and effective motivations for reviewers. 3. Recognition of peer review in researcher&#8217;s promotion processes and grant applications. 4. Use of AI review assistants.” </em>Finally Tripathy added that “<em>Platforms might emerge that give reviewers formal credit for their contributions, possibly even considering reviews as a form of scholarly output.</em>”</p>
<p>And to conclude I asked them if they had any further comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>The detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em><strong>Clemens Falker-Gieske</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you have any comments/advice to give us (BMC/Springer Nature) about the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>An encouraging comment from Sanchez-Garrido: “<em>I like the fact that transparent peer review has become the norm!</em>”; a recommendation from Falker-Gieske: “<em>Make sure editors keep an eye on the quality of reviewer reports.</em>”; and a request from Tripathy: “<em>the system needs to be a faster and accurate.</em>”</p>
<p>To conclude, I feel very hopeful after writing this interview piece. When I set out with the plan to conduct these interviews, I did not know what to expect, whether anyone would actually be interested to share their opinion with me and whether they would be worth reading. It has been so refreshing and helpful to collect all these opinions and write this blog. ECRs have many useful ideas and suggestions and they care! As long as we, publishers, editors and the likes, keep the dialog open, I am confident that we will work together towards a bright future for peer review!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pedestrian-stops-police-civilian-encounters">Curbing pedestrian stops might not reduce police-civilian encounters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any encounter between police and civilians has the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">potential to go awry</a> (<em>SN: 11/17/21</em>). Stop and frisk, where police pat down pedestrians suspected of carrying contraband, can be particularly fraught, leading to some efforts to limit the practice.</p>



<p>But simply curbing foot stops may not reduce the likelihood of such contentious encounters, suggests a case study of Chicago. A steep decline in pedestrian stops in the Windy City eight years ago <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coincided with a lasting spike in traffic stops</a>, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Advances. </em>While the rate of pedestrian stops plummeted by roughly 80 percent over five months in 2015, the rate of traffic stops grew by about the same amount over the next few years.</p>





<p>“This is a really dramatic shift in police activity,” says political scientist Dorothy Kronick of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>The analysis doesn’t prove that the change in pedestrian stops caused the subsequent spike in traffic stops; nor does it delve into the implications of the change. The Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>But the data do suggest that studying a single change might not tell the whole story about police tactics, the researchers say. “We want to … think about the way that police agencies or other government agencies are going to respond strategically to these changes,” says Kronick, who coauthored the study with Berkeley immigration and criminal law expert David Hausman.</p>



<p>Stop-and-frisk policing peaked in popularity in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s before declining in the 2010s as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/police/paac098/6989602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice’s ill effects became clear</a>, researchers noted in January in <em>Policing: A Journal of Policy and Practice.</em> Officers disproportionately targeted Black and other minority populations, the practice reduced well-being among affected residents and crime did not drop by as much as expected.</p>



<p>Pedestrian stops plummeted in New York City from roughly 700,000 stops in 2011 to fewer than 25,000 stops in 2015 — a 97 percent drop. In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois released a report showing that the rate of pedestrian stops in Chicago <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/2015-stop-and-frisk-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quadruple that of pre-reform New York City</a>. That report prompted the Chicago police to require more stringent documentation of pedestrian stops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A stop that might have taken two or three minutes now took 20 with the appropriate paperwork,” administrators for Second City Cop, an anonymous blogging site for Chicago police officers, explained in an email to <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>The impact of that policy change was stark: As of August 2015, Chicago officers were stopping more than 20 pedestrians for every 100 Chicagoans per year, the new study reports. Five months later, that rate had dropped to less than 4 out of 100. The proportion of Black civilians stopped remained the same, at about 60 to 70 percent.</p>



<p>Traffic stops over the next four years, meanwhile, climbed. In 2016, Chicago officers were stopping roughly 3 drivers out of every 100 residents per year. Three years later, they were stopping roughly 22 out of 100, Kronick and Hausman report. The demographics of stopped drivers shifted, from 45 percent Black in 2016 to 60 percent Black in 2019.</p>



<p>Police beats once marked by pedestrian stops saw the greatest increase in traffic stops, the authors note. They did not observe a similar jump in traffic stops among Illinois State Police, whose jurisdiction partially overlaps with the Chicago police, or among neighboring suburban police departments.</p>



<p>The findings don’t surprise criminologist Wesley G. Skogan, who observed the same substitution while researching his 2022 book, <em>Stop &amp; Frisk and the Politics of Crime in Chicago</em>. “When you work with the data, you certainly notice the shift from one to the other,” says Skogan, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The crux of this paper is that policing strategies are to a certain degree fungible, that is, you can switch from one to the other.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Showing cause and effect, however, is tricky. In the new study, Kronick and Hausman draw on posts and comments on Second City Cop suggesting that officers understood that they were supposed to make this substitution.</p>



<p>Current blog administrators concur, noting that the shift to traffic stops seemed like a clear change in policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an observational study, the methodology is sound, says criminologist David Weisburd of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Ruling out all the underlying reasons for the switch is impossible, though. For instance, were there other changes within the police department that led to this shift in priorities? Were residents demanding proactive policies to thwart crime?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the dramatic rise in traffic stops alone raises questions, Weisburd says. “Why would you switch to traffic stops that have the same problems for the public and greater safety problems for police officers?”</p>



<p>Evidence for similar substitutions in other cities is scant. But the push for proactive policing to thwart crime suggests this sort of switch may not be unusual.</p>



<p>“From research, we know that proactive policing is really the best way to manage crime and manage problems in communities,” says criminologist William Sousa of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. But the line between problematic stop-and-frisk practices and proactive policing, where police increase surveillance in high-crime neighborhoods to keep residents safe, can be fuzzy, he says.</p>



<p>And how to prevent racial profiling in proactive policing remains a thorny question. For instance, the authors of the new study cite a 2019 news story in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describing how the city’s police drastically increased driver stops to root out people carrying guns or drugs. As with antagonistic foot stops, police disproportionately targeted Black civilians, leading one lawyer to dub the practice “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-traffic-stops-20190124-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop and frisk in a car</a>.”</p>



<p>The study raises many questions, including about the generalizability of the findings, why this switch occurred and, crucially, whether the shift reduced problems associated with pedestrian stops, Hausman says. But it illuminates why looking at a single change in police tactics could cause researchers and policy makers to miss whether the change worked as intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s important to take this first step,” Hausman says. “It’s very easy to assume that reducing this particular type of police-civilian interaction will reduce police-civilian interactions overall.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-mix-frogs-heat-microbiome">The right bacterial mix could help frogs take the heat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of a green frog’s heat tolerance might come from its microbiome.</p>



<p>Put a wood frog tadpole and a green frog tadpole in water and turn up the heat. The two species live in similar environments, but green frog tadpoles just keep swimming in water that’s up to 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer.</p>



<p>But when scientists transferred the gut microbiome of a green frog (<em>Lithobates clamitans</em>) to the eggs of a wood frog (<em>L. sylvaticus</em>), the wood frog larvae <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.07.556683v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could handle short stints at higher water temperatures</a>, Jason Dallas and colleagues report September 7 on bioRxiv.org. The study reveals one reason some species might be more, or less, sensitive to climate change.</p>





<p>Green frogs and wood frogs are closely related but lead different lives. Wood frogs go from egg to adult in only three months in the spring. Green frog larvae can remain as tadpoles through the whole summer, swimming in higher water temperatures as a result. Dallas, a herpetologist at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, was particularly interested in the frogs’ critical thermal maxima — the hottest temperature at which the animal can continue to move.</p>



<p>“Amphibians [and] reptiles are globally imperiled, but still remain understudied,” Dallas says, and it’s not clear just how their microbiomes contribute to how they live their lives. To find out what role the microbiome might play in frog temperature tolerance, Dallas headed out to a local wetland in early spring in search of wood frog eggs. Timing is key. “They’ll breed, and it’ll all be over in basically one or two nights,” he says. “The next day you go, [and] there’s hundreds of egg masses, if not thousands.”</p>



<p>Dallas scooped a few egg masses into a large plastic tub and drove back to campus. Slowly. “You go a little bit slow, which the other drivers may not appreciate but the wood frogs like.” Back at the lab, he and his colleagues washed the eggs in an antibiotic solution to rid them of their own microbiome and inoculated some of them with gut bacteria from green frogs.</p>



<p>When the eggs hatched, the tadpoles ate a little of their egg jelly — gaining a dose of pond water or green frog bacteria in the process. Dallas found that those who had received a dose of green frog gut bacteria could take short periods of water heated to 38.3° C, while those inoculated with their normal pond water or no bacteria at all topped out at 37.7° C. When the researchers analyzed the microbiomes of the larvae, they found that larvae inoculated with green frog bacteria had more diverse microbiomes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092023_BB_frog-microbiome_eggs_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of wood frog larvae floating in a body of water." class="wp-image-3131681" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092023_BB_frog-microbiome_eggs_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092023_BB_frog-microbiome_eggs_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092023_BB_frog-microbiome_eggs_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092023_BB_frog-microbiome_eggs_inline-280x186.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131681">Grown wood frogs gather together at ponds in early spring, and after a wild night, the water is loaded with egg masses (seen here floating on the water).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131681">Jason W. Dallas</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The temperature difference is small, but could be meaningful, says Timothy Colston, a herpetologist at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez who was not involved in the study. “Even 1 degree of difference over a short period of time, if that gives you an advantage to being able to survive and reproduce, then that&#8217;s going to increase your fitness,” he says.</p>



<p>How exactly a frog’s microbiome helps the animals take more heat remains a bit of a mystery. The right bacterial population could be good for the frog’s overall health. If they’re protected, say from viruses or fungal infections, they might be better able to resist a heatwave or two, Colston says. Gut microbes could also affect how a frog’s metabolism functions, or whether and how they express proteins that resist heat.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s probably a lot of cellular mechanisms and other mechanisms in play,” Dallas says. Certainly, this is not an excuse to go around dosing frog populations with bacteria during heatwaves; he and his colleagues were only able to identify broad groups of microbes involved. But it does show one way that some frogs might get hot — or not — in the face of climate change.</p>

<p>The editor in chief, managing editors, and entire editorial board of a mathematics journal all resigned earlier this year following a dispute with their publisher over special issues and article volume. </p>



<p>Changes the publisher wanted to make to the journal “would have the effect of jeopardizing scientific integrity for the sake of financial gain,” the editors wrote in their announcement of their resignations, which took place on January 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignation at the <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em>, previously published by the <a href="https://www.aimsciences.org/index/AboutAIMS">American Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS), is one of at least five such collective actions journal editors took in 2023, according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">list Retraction Watch has compiled</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former editors have started a new journal named <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/gm"><em>Geometric Mechanics</em></a> with World Scientific. </p>



<span id="more-127952"></span>



<p>The editors’ announcement, which was emailed to a few colleagues, stated that AIMS “introduced numerous special issues with no consultation with, nor control from, the Editor-in-Chief nor the Editorial Board,” and “insisted that the Board increase by five-fold the number of published papers over the next few years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the managing editors tried negotiating with the publisher “their attempts were largely ignored,” according to the announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5V0GD7IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Manuel de Leon</a>, the editor in chief, told us AIMS had made the journal open access with author fees without consulting the editorial board. In addition to increasing the number of accepted papers, AIMS was giving non-specialist staff editors some control over publications and requiring the editors to publish submitted and accepted papers within two months, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors perceived that the two-month period for submission to publication was “pressure to sacrifice the integrity of the editorial process to increase the number of accepted papers,” de Leon said. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the Editorial Board, we felt that these new operational and editorial policies for the journal were not commensurate with our view of how to run JGM for the benefit of the geometric mechanics community—and the mathematical community as a whole—by maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The old <a href="http://aimspress.com/journal/jgm"><em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em></a> is now named <em>Communications in Analysis and Mechanics</em>, and has a new <a href="http://aimspress.com/cam/news/solo-detail/editorialboard">editorial board</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>De Leon said AIMS was operating “under directorship” of <a href="https://math.missouristate.edu/profile-display.aspx?p=shu">Shouchuan Hu</a>, an emeritus faculty member at Missouri State University in Springfield. Hu is the registered agent for <a href="https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BusinessEntityDetail.aspx?ID=3878143&amp;page=beSearch">AIMS, LLC</a>, a limited liability company based in Missouri.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu told us the editors’ version of events was “untrue.” But in his correspondence with editorial board members, which he shared with Retraction Watch, he described the planned shift to open access and increased publication volume target as changes to make the journal financially sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email sent to board members after their resignations, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It appears there might be a communicational [sic] issue between us.&nbsp; Therefore, please view the following facts:</p>



<p>1. the journal has been around for 14 years;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. the journal has 52 editors&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. the journal publishes about 20 articles each year;&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. the journal has less than 10 subscriptions in total;&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. thus the publishing model is not sustainable financially;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. the trend of journal transformation is weeping the entire industry;&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. thus, we need to follow the trend to develop the journal into Open Access, sooner or later;&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. it has been offered that all papers recruited by any board member will be APC waived;&nbsp;</p>



<p>9. all special issues papers arranged by any board members will be APC waived.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hu also wrote that since some of the journal’s editors had published their work in <em>Mathematics</em>, an open access publication from MDPI, “this approach should be acceptable.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If for any reason you should feel that we modify the approach to make it work better, please let me know. We can also offer the possibility of moving the journal back to be a regular publication again, no more Open Access, if the majority feel it might be a better alternative after the miscommunication is clarified.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Hu said de Leon had published in <em>Mathematics</em>, “therefore, he accepts the model of OA clearly.”</p>



<p>De Leon has not responded to our follow-up request for comment on Hu’s claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email de Leon wrote to Hu last September that Hu shared with us, de Leon elaborated on his concerns, emphasizing the importance “that no quality paper cannot be published because the authors do not have the funds to pay the [open access fee].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Today I saw that there are two special issues to be published in the JGM. This is the first news I have of this; and we cannot work like this. There cannot be a JGM parallel to the current one, every paper or special issue must be previously approved by the director and the managing editors, and the consultation to the editor or editors who are closer to the topics of those papers or special issues. And it must be us, with the help of the EB members, who indicate the referees for each paper. Because if this is not done, all the work of these 15 years will be thrown away, and we will have lost all the prestige we have gained. It is no longer a problem of economics, of [open access], it is a problem of quality and procedures in the publication process. Without the usual standards in mathematics journals that have a prestige of years, the JGM cannot be continued.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Sure, I agree with you in principle,” Hu’s reply began. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On the other hand, as we agreed we need to target about publication of 100 papers next year and the cycle from submission to publication should be within 2 months. Thus, there needs to be a much better communication and efficiency.&nbsp; We will make sure the in house staff editors communicate with you and the board timely, but they need instructions and feedback from the board in days, not weeks, in order for them to perform. Therefore, they should be given some flexibility.&nbsp; Otherwise, the targets next year will not be achieved, and the journal will not be sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We of course do not wish to create a JGM within JGM.&nbsp; We just need to follow others on how to develop an OA journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another follow up, Hu told de Leon he “did not realize that the solicited two special issues are causing an alarm till now,” and “we should then stop the two issues from further development.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu also wrote that “any future actions should be under your supervision,” and asked de Leon to confer with other board members to develop ideas for potential special issues and contributors, which staff editors for the publisher would handle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After several more emails from Hu, de Leon responded that he was busy with meetings and a student defending his doctoral thesis, and wanted “to think quietly about the future of the JGM.” He proposed meeting over Zoom, as Hu had suggested, in October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next email in the chain, dated December 7, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am sure we could iron out our differences and move forward when we have a talk.&nbsp; I don’t feel like intervening with the editorial structure of the journal unless I have to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 26, Hu sent another email complaining de Leon had not replied to him. He called the journal “dysfunctional,” and said he “may intervene if this dysfunction should continue into 2023.” He reiterated an earlier invitation for de Leon to speak at an upcoming AIMS conference, and proposed a meeting at the conference “so that we can try to come up with a working plan for the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weeks later, de Leon and the rest of the editorial board resigned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/j.montaldi/">James Montaldi</a>, a reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester and formal editorial board member, told us the previous <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics </em>“was a specialized journal which reported much of the best material in the area,” and published special issues proposed and curated by members of the editorial board (rather than the publisher).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal worked well from an academic point of view before,” he said, and “we had enough warning of the changes to all resign before they were realized.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid">New computer analysis hints volcanism killed the dinosaurs, not an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, scientists have vigorously debated whether an asteroid strike or massive volcanic eruptions ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Roughly three-quarters of all life on Earth, including all nonbird dinosaurs, went extinct at that time, putting a dramatic end to the Cretaceous Period.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have devised a new way to identify the true dino killer: Let computers take a crack at it.</p>



<p>The result of that computational effort suggests that massive bursts of gas produced by the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh3875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deccan Traps eruptions were solely capable of causing the extinction event</a>, the team reports in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. Those eruptions, which lasted roughly a million years, spewed massive amounts of gas-ridden lava across what’s now western India.</p>





<p>“Rather than come at it from the perspective of ‘let’s blame the volcanoes and explain why’ or ‘let’s blame asteroids and explain why,’” the goal was to have as little human input or bias in the process as possible, says Dartmouth computational geologist Alexander Cox.</p>



<p>The idea was to work backward using evidence from the scene of the crime. Scientists do have a smoking gun: Cores drilled into deep-ocean sediments contain geologic data pointing to deadly bursts of gas to the atmosphere, particularly planet-warming carbon dioxide and ocean-acidifying sulfur dioxide.</p>



<p>But such gases could have come from the asteroid strike, as it incinerated rocks on the planet’s surface, Cox says, or from the Deccan Traps eruptions.</p>



<p>Previous efforts to understand the source of the gases have focused on timing, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dueling-dates-volcanic-eruption-debate-dinosaurs-death">examining pulses of lava emplacement during the Deccan Traps</a> eruptions, Cox says (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/21/19</em>). But “we only have best guesses about how much initial gas was in [the lava].” Estimated carbon dioxide concentrations in the lava, for example, vary by an order of magnitude, he says. “So that’s why we approached this from a gas-emissions perspective rather than a lava-flow perspective.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="420" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092823_CG_-dino-demise_deccan-traps_inline.jpg" alt="An image of the Deccan Traps." class="wp-image-3131904" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092823_CG_-dino-demise_deccan-traps_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092823_CG_-dino-demise_deccan-traps_inline-620x383.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092823_CG_-dino-demise_deccan-traps_inline-301x186.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131904">Vast hardened lava flows, known as the Deccan Traps, cover much of what’s now western India. The lava is the remnant of a massive volcanic event about 66 million years ago. New computer analyses suggest that gases emitted during this event were enough to shift Earth’s temperature and may have led to the demise of nonbird dinosaurs.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131904"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Baajhan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Baajhan</strong></a><strong> at </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>English Wikipedia</strong></a></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To disentangle the relative contributions of each potential culprit, Cox and Dartmouth geologist C. Brenhin Keller used a statistical model called a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. That approach systematically considers the probability of different scenarios of gas emissions from the different sources, converging toward possible solutions as the results of the simulations move closer and closer to geologic observations.</p>



<p>What made the researchers’ approach particularly powerful is that they harnessed 128 different processors to run scenarios in parallel, Cox says. “All the processors then compared how they’re doing at the end of every model run, like classmates comparing answers.” That parallel computing meant that computations that would otherwise have taken a year took only a few days.</p>



<p>The observations Cox and Keller used were data collected from three cores drilled into deep-sea sediments, each spanning 67 million to 65 million years ago. In those sediments are foraminifera, ocean-dwelling microorganisms whose carbonate shells contain different isotopes, or forms, of carbon and oxygen. The shells’ chemical makeup records the ocean chemistry at the time of their formation, and so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-gas-bursts-probably-didnt-kill-off-the-dinosaurs">can be used as a proxy to infer past global temperatures as well as how many creatures were thriving in the oceans</a>, and how much carbon was moving between the atmosphere, ocean and land (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>The computer simulations determined that the amount of gas spewed into the atmosphere from the volcanism alone was enough to account for the changes in temperature and carbon cycling determined from the foraminifera data in the drill cores.</p>



<p>As for the asteroid strike, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">formed the massive Chicxulub crater in what’s now Mexico</a>, it probably did not produce a big spike in carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, the analysis found (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>).</p>





<p>But many scientists are not convinced that these findings provide the ultimate answer to this long-standing, complex question. “It’s an elegant way to address this problem,” says Sierra Petersen, a geochemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Modeling in this way “gives the freedom to find the consensus solution, taking multiple proxy records into account. However, like any model, output depends on input.”</p>



<p>Petersen notes that foraminifera shells are not an ideal proxy for ancient temperatures: The oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera shells can change not only due to temperature but also due to seawater composition. Different temperature proxies would likely lead to different patterns of gas release reproduced in models, Petersen says.</p>



<p>As for the mass extinction culprit, she adds, “it’s a bit of a leap to say that this study shows the impact didn’t cause the extinction. I think what they show is that the impact was likely not associated with a large [gas] release.” But the asteroid, she says, still could have had other deadly impacts on the planet’s environment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, “the Chicxulub impact led to many devastating effects beyond the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions explored in this study,” says Clay Tabor, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.</p>



<p>Those include massive clouds of soot and dust kicked up from pulverized rocks due to the impact, he says. Previous research has suggested this dust may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impact-volcanism-earth-dinosaurs-deccan-mass-extinction">dimmed the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth</a> by as much as 20 percent, inducing a frigid winter that swiftly killed off plants and destroyed habitats (<em>SN: 7/17/20</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, the new study suggests that the asteroid impact didn’t have a long-term effect on the planet’s carbon cycle, based on carbon isotope data recorded in the foraminifera shells for the million years after the extinction. But there was an abrupt drop in the abundance of those creatures corresponding to the time of the impact, Tabor says. “The rapid rate of change caused by the Chicxulub impact was likely responsible for its effects on life.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Many geochemical records spanning the [extinction event], as well as this modeling work, cannot capture well the rates of change associated with the Chicxulub impact,” he says. “The impact may have released significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> than the Deccan Traps, but it did so almost instantaneously.” So even if the asteroid impact released fewer gases overall, Tabor says, the speediness of that release could have been devastating all the same.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-sticking-skin-surfaces">How a deadly fungus is so good at sticking to skin and other surfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Candida auris</em>, a fungus that causes sometimes deadly infections, can stick to almost any surface.</p>



<p>In hospitals, “it&#8217;s very tenacious, very difficult to get rid of and ends up on all the surfaces around patients,” where it can fuel outbreaks, says Darian Santana, a microbiologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. The fungus has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">spreading rapidly</a> since cases first emerged in several locations around the world in 2012 (<em>SN: 3/20/23</em>).</p>





<p>Santana and colleagues have discovered how the fungi stick to a wide variety of surfaces. Most fungi make adhesive proteins that rely on hydrophobic interactions to glom onto surfaces. Think oil and water, says Teresa O’Meara, a microbiologist and geneticist in whose lab Santana works. Oil droplets congregate with other oil droplets, while water is attracted to water. Similarly, hydrophobic fungal proteins attach themselves to hydrophobic, or water-repellent, surfaces.</p>



<p><em>C. auris</em> has hydrophobic adhesion proteins too, but it mainly <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf8972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastes itself to surfaces</a> using electrical charges, the researchers report in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. The fungus makes protein called SCF1, which contains many positively charged amino acids. The positive charge creates attraction with negative charges on surfaces, including skin and medical devices. It’s similar to the way barnacles stick to boats, Santana says.</p>



<p>The protein allowed the fungus to infect skin samples and colonize catheters in the lab, the team found. Without SCF1, the fungus was unable to spread in infected mice. </p>



<p>The finding may eventually lead to new ways to prevent or treat <em>C. auris</em> infections, O’Meara says. For instance, treatments may turn off production of the protein to prevent the fungus from spreading more widely in infected people, or a vaccine or antibody might stop the fungus from binding to surfaces and head off illness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-images-cosmos-universe-hubble-constant-tension">New JWST images suggest our understanding of the cosmos is flawed</a></h4>

              
                <p>The greatest puzzle in cosmology just got even more puzzling.</p>



<p>Images from the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed that the universe appears to be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15806.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding significantly faster</a> than it should be, researchers report in a study accepted in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The observation is in conflict with an esteemed theory, the standard model of cosmology, that describes how the universe has evolved since the first moments after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The conflict comes down to calculations of the Hubble constant, a number that describes how fast everything in the universe is flying apart. One calculation, based on Planck satellite observations of the oldest light in the universe in conjunction with the standard model of cosmology, suggests the Hubble constant is 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is about 3 million light-years). Hubble Space Telescope images of stars at various distances from us provide a fundamentally incompatible value — 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>





<p>The discrepancy is known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">Hubble tension</a>, and new JWST data hasn’t done anything to ease it (<em>SN: 7/30/19)</em>. The telescope took images of the same stars as the Hubble telescope and calculated a very similar Hubble constant. Although the Planck number disagrees from the Hubble telescope and JWST number by less than 10 percent, the discrepancy in the measurements implies that there’s something terribly wrong with our understanding of the universe. Unless an error turns up in one of the measurements, it will take strange new physics to explain the tension.</p>



<p>“Papers in the literature over the last 10 years have invoked anything from weird dark matter to weird dark energy, to another [exotic] particle, to a magnetic field in the early universe to a new field, all kinds of things” to explain the Hubble tension, says cosmologist Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Some of these explanations “look semi-successful, some of them look like failures, some of them would cause other problems,” he says. Developing a theory that might resolve the tension “is still very much in the skunkworks [or extremely speculative] stage of trying to understand what [the tension] could mean.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST looks to the stars to calculate the Hubble constant</h4>



<p>With the Hubble telescope and JWST, astronomers calculate the Hubble constant by observing flashing stars known as Cepheid variables. The stars flare up periodically at rates that indicate how much light they’re putting out. Comparing a star’s brightness in telescope images with its expected brightness, based on the flare-up rates, gives a measure of the distance to the stars. Shifts in the color of the light coming from the stars reveal how fast they’re moving. Combining distance and speed observations of Cepheid stars leads to a measure of the expansion of the universe.</p>



<p>But Cepheid variable stars tend to sit deep inside galaxies, surrounded by crowds of other stars. That can make it difficult to get good measurements of the Cepheids’ speeds and locations. One simple resolution for the Hubble tension could have been that the Hubble telescope measurements were simply off.</p>



<p>Enter JWST, which can peer through the stellar crowds to clearly make out the color and brightness of Cepheid variables. The higher-resolution JWST images provide data with dramatically lower uncertainties and reduced confusion with nearby stars than the Hubble telescope could manage. The result: The Hubble telescope measurements have been right all along, Riess and colleagues report in their new paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>This study alone isn’t enough to convince astronomer Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. The two galaxies studied are comparatively close to us, on cosmic scales, with the farthest one about 75 million light-years away, she notes. The relative proximity makes it easier to pick out the Cepheids from the stellar crowds. Freedman suspects it will be harder to distinguish Cepheids from the crowds of surrounding stars in more distant galaxies, even with JWST.</p>



<p>“The problem is only going to be worse,” Freedman says. “Because the resolution, it gets worse as you go to a higher distance.” For very distant galaxies, she suspects, stars could appear too close together to pick out the Cepheids from neighboring stars, even for JWST. As a result, &nbsp;Freedman says that Riess’ confirmation of the higher Hubble constant may crumble with analysis of more distant Cepheids.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST’s images leave the Hubble tension untouched</h4>



<p>Hints that the measurements might hold up at larger distances arose in a Sept. 12 presentation at a conference in Baltimore dedicated to the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2023/september/the-first-year-of-jwst-science-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first year of JWST science</a>. Riess showed preliminary Cepheid data from four more galaxies. One of them is 140 million light-years away — among the most distant galaxies in the Hubble telescope Cepheid studies. JWST data from those stars also line up with the Hubble telescope measurements. Although still awaiting peer review, the images strongly suggest that the JWST has indeed overcome the uncertainties that resulted when light from Cepheids got mixed up with light from nearby stars in the lower resolution Hubble telescope images.</p>





<p>University of Cambridge astrophysicist George Efstathiou, who was not involved in the study, is both convinced that Riess has gotten the measurements right and confounded by the implications. “When they showed me all of that [data],” Efstathiou says, “my reaction was, ‘Well, you know, I&#8217;m stumped.’”</p>



<p>Efstathiou is a member of the Planck satellite collaboration, which studied the oldest light in the universe, called the cosmic microwave background, and found the lower value for the expansion of the universe. The satellite’s calculation is based on images of the patterns in light from the early universe. Together with the standard model of cosmology, the images show that the universe is expanding with a Hubble constant that’s lower than the JWST measurement by about 5.6 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>



<p>As it stands, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the Planck measurement of the Hubble constant or with the JWST observations. The tension between the measurements points a finger at the standard model of cosmology as the problem. But the standard model also appears to be unimpeachable; it’s withstood numerous other challenges without breaking down. The model came about in part due to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-acceleration-discovery-wins-physics-nobel">discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe</a>, which earned Riess and others a Nobel Prize in physics (<em>SN: 10/4/11</em>). The revelation was a key piece in shaping the model to include dark matter, dark energy and other factors, making it the simplest theory that can accurately describe the universe.</p>



<p>Now, though, Riess’ Cepheid-based studies of the Hubble constant show that there’s still more to learn.</p>



<p>“This is a crack, or a surprise that doesn&#8217;t fit,” Riess says. “It&#8217;s left us more in a kind of confused or purgatory state.” The implication, he says, is “there&#8217;s a problem with the standard model. You can revise it, but we don&#8217;t know how to revise it, which direction or in what way.”</p>



<p>People shouldn’t mistake the tension over the Hubble tension as despair. “It&#8217;s more of an opportunity to learn something about the universe with these telescopes,” Riess says.</p>



<p>One possibility is completely new physics.</p>



<p>“If there&#8217;s new physics, that&#8217;d be fun,” Freedman says. “We&#8217;d all like to see something new and interesting&#8230;. Either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be an exciting result — either confirming the [standard] model or showing that there&#8217;s something still in the model that&#8217;s missing.”</p>

<p>Two anthropology organizations co-hosting a conference this fall have removed from the program a panel presentation entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel had been slated for the joint <a href="https://annualmeeting.americananthro.org/general-info/">annual meeting</a> of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA), to be held in Toronto in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">letter</a> informing the panelists of the decision, Ramona Pérez and Monica Heller, presidents of the AAA and CASCA, respectively, wrote that the executive boards of the two groups had reviewed the submission “at the request of numerous members” and decided to remove it from the conference program. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127933"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision was based on extensive consultation and was reached in the spirit of respect for our values, the safety and dignity of our members, and the scientific integrity of the program(me). The reason the session deserved further scrutiny was that the ideas were advanced in such a way as to cause harm to members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While there were those who disagree with this decision, we would hope they know their voice was heard and was very much a part of the conversation. It is our hope that we continue to work together so that we become stronger and more unified within each of our associations. Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pérez and Heller did not respond directly to our request for comment, but forwarded our message to an association spokesperson, who sent us a statement titled &#8220;<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">No Place For Transphobia in Anthropology</a>.&#8221; The association writes, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The function of the “gender critical” scholarship advocated in this session, like the function of the “race science” of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, is to advance a “scientific” reason to question the humanity of already marginalized groups of people, in this case, those who exist outside a strict and narrow sex / gender binary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The AAA/CASCA decision was a “shock,” according to an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">open letter</a> written by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/klowrey">Kathleen Lowrey</a>, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta who organized the panel, and her co-panelists. In the letter, they said none of the panelists had heard from AAA or CASCA with any concerns about the panel until the letter notifying them of the decision to cancel the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They defended the content of the panel against what they said was the “false accusation” the ideas were harmful. The letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Your suggestion that our panel would somehow compromise “&#8230;the scientific integrity of the programme” seems to us particularly egregious, as the decision to anathematize our panel looks very much like an anti-science response to a politicized lobbying campaign. Had our panel been allowed to go forward, we can assure you that lively contestation would have been welcomed by the panelists and may even have occurred between us, as our own political commitments are diverse. Instead, your letter expresses the alarming hope that the AAA and CASCA will become “more unified within each of our associations” to avoid future debates. Most disturbingly, following other organizations, such as the Society for American Archaeology, the AAA and CASCA have promised that “Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.” Anthropologists around the world will quite rightly find chilling this declaration of war on dissent and on scholarly controversy. It is a profound betrayal of the AAA’s principle of “advancing human understanding and applying this understanding to the world’s most pressing problems”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey’s directory page at the University of Alberta states the institution “has reacted <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/06/12/from-south-american-anthropology-to-gender-crit-cancel-culture-my-strange-feminist-journey/">punitively</a> to my outspoken criticisms of trans activism and gender ideology.” In 2020, Lowrey was removed from an administrative role as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology, <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions">which she attributed</a> to her views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us that several of the panelists had “spent quite a lot of money on travel arrangements, as the panel was accepted in July, and we were all stunned to receive the letter &#8220;removing&#8221; us on Monday.”</p>



<p>She said she was not aware of another instance when AAA or CASCA had removed a panel&nbsp; from the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us the implications of the cancellation were “quite unsettling”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The AAA is the largest professional association of anthropologists in the world, and the joint conference with CASCA (which happens every third year, I believe) is the Big Kahuna of anthropology conferences.&nbsp; I organized the panel in order to bring together two kinds of anthropologists concerned with the replacement of biological sex by &#8220;gender&#8221;:&nbsp; one the one hand, scholars like Elizabeth Weiss and Carole Hooven who have an interest in human evolution (for which sexual reproduction is a relevant process!) and on the other, scholars like Silvia Carrasco, Michele Sirois, and Kathleen Richardson who have an interest in feminist issues (for which sex based oppression is a relevant process!).&nbsp; I have interests in both domains, and thought it would be great to bring together scholars concerned for very different reasons with sex as a category of anthropological analysis in order to see where our concerns overlap and where they diverge.</p>



<p>I truly do not understand why anyone who disagrees with any of this wouldn&#8217;t simply turn up to the panel and engage us in discussion. That&#8217;s what conferences are for.&nbsp; I would be sincerely interested to hear AAA and CASCA representatives elaborate on why they think talking about biological sex is threatening and harmful to trans identified people or to what they term the &#8220;LGBTQI&#8221; community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">panel description</a> contained this summary:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While it has become increasingly common in anthropology and public life to substitute &#8216;sex&#8217; with &#8216;gender&#8217;, there are multiple domains of research in which biological sex remains irreplaceably relevant to anthropological analysis. Contesting the transition from sex to gender in anthropological scholarship deserves much more critical consideration than it has hitherto received in major diciplinary [sic] fora like AAA / CASCA. This diverse international panel brings together scholars from socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology who describe why in their work gender is not helpful and only sex will do. This is particularly the case when the work is concerned with equity and the deep analysis of power, and which has as an aim the achievement of genuine inclusivity. With research foci from hominin evolution to contemporary artificial intelligence, from the anthropology of education to the debates within contemporary feminism about surrogacy, panelists make the case that while not all anthropologists need to talk about sex, baby, some absolutely do.</p>

<p>Lowrey added:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rise in anthropology of multiple schools of thought that cannot withstand any scrutiny, any challenge, or even sustained contentious inquiry, is a growing disaster for the entire discipline.&nbsp; I feel like I&#8217;m trying to shout that the bridge is out ahead and no one is listening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very frustrating.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trilobite-fossil-hints-scavengers-ate">A one-of-a-kind trilobite fossil hints at what and how these creatures ate</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious, prehistoric marine creature has spilled its guts. For the first time, scientists have unearthed a fossilized trilobite whose final meals were preserved within its digestive system.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Valéria Vaškaninová and colleagues discovered the partially digested meals when they looked at a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06567-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-resolution 3-D scan of <em>Bohemolichas incola</em></a>, a previously known but relatively rare trilobite species that lived 465 million years ago. The contents include fragments of thin-walled shells, bits of echinoderms (a group that includes modern-day sea urchins and starfish), and other bottom-dwellers small enough to be swallowed whole, the researchers report online September 27 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Many of the more than 20,000 described species of trilobites, a group that existed between 520 million and 252 million years ago, were prominent members of marine ecosystems. Some species may have even had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-trilobites-sported-dual-digestive-tracts">dual digestive tracts</a>, though <em>B. incola</em> did not (<em>SN: 10/31/14</em>). The new find not only provides direct evidence of what some trilobites may have eaten, but it also hints about their physiology and how they foraged.</p>

<p>Tightly packed clumps of shelly bits throughout the tubelike gut suggest that the trilobite fed almost continuously before it died, perhaps by scavenging the seafloor for broken remains of shelled creatures and digesting the soft tissues still attached to them. Trilobites typically didn’t have sturdy mouthparts and thus wouldn’t have had a powerful bite, says Vaškaninová, of Charles University in Prague.</p>



<p>And since the calcium-rich shells in the gut show no signs of being dissolved, the trilobite probably had a gut environment with an alkaline or neutral pH, Vaškaninová and colleagues suggest. That sort of biochemistry would have reduced the amount of dissolved calcium entering its bloodstream, which would be metabolically difficult to get rid of, the team proposes.</p>



<p>In a small bit of turnabout-is-fair-play, the scan also revealed that <em>B. incola</em>’s carcass had been scavenged by other organisms before fossilizing.</p>
