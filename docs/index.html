<p>It&#8217;s Nobel Prize week, and the work behind mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has just <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/">earned the physiology or medicine prize</a>. But this is Retraction Watch, so that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>



<p>A Nobel prize-winning researcher whose publications have come under scrutiny has retracted his <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSemenza%252c%2bGregg%2bL">10th paper</a> for issues with the data and images. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis had flagged possibly duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s publications on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=gregg+l+semenza">PubPeer</a> before 2019, and other sleuths posted more beginning in October 2020. </p>



<span id="more-127996"></span>



<p>Last September, Semenza and his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/03/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-retracts-four-papers/">pulled four papers</a> from <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Another <em>PNAS</em> paper, one in <em>Oncogene</em>, and two from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> were retracted over the past year, with each notice stating that Semenza requested or agreed to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, <em>Molecular Cancer Research</em> has retracted another of the Nobelist’s articles,&nbsp; “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/11/5/456/89397/Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is-Essential-for">Procollagen Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 Is Essential for Hypoxia-Induced Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” which appeared in 2013. The article has been cited 181 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a 2011 retraction for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 24 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – today’s retraction makes 10 for Semenza. More <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03032-9">may be on the way</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/21/10/1120/729213/Retraction-Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is">notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that lanes 4, 5, and 6 of the HIF-1α immunoblot in Fig. 3A are identical images. An internal review corroborated the authors’ claim, and the editors agreed with the authors’ retraction request. The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article.</p>



<p>A copy of this Retraction Notice was sent to the last known email addresses for all authors. Four authors (Denis Wirtz, Carmen C. Wong, Daniele M. Gilkes, and Gregg L. Semenza) agreed to the retraction; the 3 remaining authors could not be located.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Semenza did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Johns Hopkins would not comment on whether they were investigating the matter when a reporter from <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-gregg-semenza-retractions-20230801-2wv7kspmq5awfes3omkacb4bpy-story.html"><em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asked this summer</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#1">commented</a> that the lanes of the figure identified in the retraction notice were “much more similar than expected.” The first author, Daniele M. Gilkes, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#3">responded</a> by posting an image of the “original uncropped version.” Another commenter raised more concerns about the image, but Gilkes did not respond again. </p>

Her research focuses on the genetics of autism, in particular what underpins aggressive behaviours in some. She previously completed a BSc in Developmental Psychology at the University of East Anglia.</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science/neuroscience? </strong></h6><p><p>I did my undergraduate degree in Developmental Psychology after working for a charity for children and young people with additional needs throughout college and developing an interest in working with young people with neurodevelopmental disorders. During my placement year at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) during this degree, I was most interested in the work done by the Forensic CAMHS team and decided to pursue a Master’s in this field.</p>
</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>My MSc is Forensic Mental Health, which looks at the mental health needs of the offending population and the causes of antisocial behaviour, whether that is mental illness, personality disorders, trauma, substance misuse. For my thesis project, I am investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of two high-risk genetic mutations associated with aggression in Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). Having worked with children and young people with ASC for years, and with the high rates of people with neurodevelopmental disorders in the Criminal Justice system, I was drawn to this thesis project as it allows me to explore the biological causes of the condition and understand this population better. This project is at the forefront of ASC research and its findings will allow for the development of targeted medication to manage aggression in people with ASC, which will be so beneficial to people with ASC and those that care for them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job? </strong></h6>
<h6><p>Being able to observe the link between brain structure and behaviour - I’m fascinated by the ‘nature vs. nurture’ debate, and how genetic makeup and differences in brain structure can predispose some people to certain mental illnesses if they are exposed to particular environmental stressors. I think this allows us to have a better understanding of mental health and what someone is experiencing because their symptoms and behaviours can be somewhat explained by what is happening in their brain, and this can give us an idea of how we can best work with them to improve their symptoms.</p></h6>
<h6>What are the challenges?</h6>
<h6><p>The need to be able to detach from the patients I work with, but still provide empathetic care. You can’t take on what your patients are experiencing as you wouldn’t be able to care for them effectively and it wouldn’t be healthy for myself, but you also must be present with your patients and build good therapeutic relationships! This is a hard thing to learn and is something that I am always consciously practising, especially when working with such vulnerable people that might find it difficult to open up to a professional in the first place.</p></h6><h6><strong>What skills are you currently trying to improve?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I am trying to speak up and not let imposter syndrome keep me back. I am often the youngest in the room when at my placement and this can stop me from contributing to conversations as I feel that I do not have the knowledge or experience to share my opinion, but I do! Finding the balance between my placement, my university work and having a social life and space to relax has been hard over this year, but I think I have become better at it and learnt to enforce boundaries where I need them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>The women I work with in the psychology team at my placement - we are a team of women working in a male inpatient unit aiming to provide psychological care within the medical model of the hospital. These women are knowledgeable, resilient and powerful. They have highlighted the importance of compassion in healthcare, and advocating for your patient’s wider needs, not just those that can be managed by medication, and I have learnt so much from them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I plan to work within the prison system and qualify as a forensic psychologist, ideally working with juvenile offenders. I am passionate about the accessibility of mental health support for all, whether that be for individuals with learning difficulties or those at a socio-economic disadvantage, and I hope to take this forward by opening these spaces up and improving their accessibility.</p>

</h6>
<h6>What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</h6><p><p>Ask questions - most people want to share their knowledge and these can lead to interesting conversations with new perspectives and ideas, and often further opportunities. Don’t be afraid to re-email someone - the majority of the time they are not ignoring you, they are just very busy and it has slipped their mind. Being a woman in a male-dominated field can be daunting but your opinions on things matter, and are needed to make sure all perspectives are heard!</p>
</p>
<h6>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</h6><p><p>The inaccessibility of the field! A lot of positions want experience and a lot of opportunities at an undergraduate and postgraduate level are unpaid, and so excludes those that do not have access to financial support that allows them to take on unpaid work. Recognising that individuals from a lower socio-economic background are being excluded should be a priority of the field and steps should be taken to prevent this from happening. Doing so is so important as it gives a voice to all and benefits the whole field by giving it new perspectives on research areas.</p></p><hr><p>This article was written by Lauren Wallis and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p>On Aug. 17, 2022, Nicki Tiffin received a notification that she had published a new study. The problem? She had never submitted an article to the journal in which the paper appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, despite efforts by Tiffin and others, the journal has not responded to retraction requests, and the article remains online. Further investigation by Retraction Watch has revealed other dysfunction at the journal, including falsely representing its editors and a schism from its founders and original sponsor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Triumphs and improvement of Computational Bioinformatics in South</a> <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Africa</a>,” was published in June 2022 in the <em>European Journal of Biomedical Informatic</em>s (EJBI).</p>



<p>Tiffin, a professor at the South African National Bioinformatics Institute at the University of the Western Cape, discovered that the new paper was a plagiarized version of an article she had published in 2016. That paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004395">The Development of Computational Biology in South Africa: Successes Achieved and Lessons Learnt</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s <em>Web of Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, Tiffin was a professor at the University of Cape Town. Although she had no role in publishing the <em>EJBI </em>article, it lists her name as the sole author of the paper, as well as her University of Cape Town affiliation.</p>



<span id="more-127975"></span>



<p>For over a year, Tiffin, editors at <em>PLOS</em>, and Paula Saner, the research integrity manager at the University of Cape Town, have been trying to get <em>EJBI </em>to retract the plagiarized article, with no success.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In an email to Retraction Watch, Saner described the steps she had taken, all fruitless:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I… went about writing to the EJBI asking them to retract the article/correct the publication record. I wrote to the website domain hosts to notify them of the fraudulent publication, requesting that they remove the website and I wrote to stop predatory journals to ask them to add the EJBI to their list.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Saner said she contacted the university’s internal cybersecurity team, who weren’t able to do anything, as well as PLOS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By March 2023, the author name and affiliation on the paper had been changed to “Nicki R Adolf, Kyushu University.” Saner said PLOS agreed to reach out to Kyushu University in Japan, which has no record of a person named Nicki R Adolf having worked there. Since the University of Cape Town affiliation had been removed, Saner said she left the issue to PLOS and others.</p>



<p>But in early September, Tiffin noticed that her name and affiliation reappeared on the PDF of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Renee Hoch, managing editor of the PLOS Publications Ethics Team, told Retraction Watch that practices like the ones employed by <em>EJBI</em> are a “substantial threat to researchers and the integrity of the published record.” Journals and authors have little recourse if the publisher of the concerning article doesn’t respond or act according to standards such as those set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Tiffin’s predicament, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to COPE guidance, in cases of dual publication the first journal may issue a notice of redundant publication and the journal(s) who publish subsequently should retract the redundant article(s). PLOS has not issued a public notice in this case: we do not have any concerns about the PLOS Computational Biology article and would not want a public notice to cast a negative light on the PLOS article or its authors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hoch said the PLOS did attempt to contact <em>EJBI </em>about the article, but that it has not responded or retracted the duplicate article.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Tiffin described discovering the plagiarized paper as “quite a surprise.” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It has been quite hard to understand what the journal gains from this kind of fraud, and it seems most likely that they are attempting to pad out their content with known researchers claimed as authors, to appear more like a bona fide journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tiffin said that although she had absolutely no involvement in publishing the paper, its publication is damaging to her reputation as a researcher and the reputation of the University of Cape Town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also noted how unusual and unnerving it is that an obviously fraudulent article like this could stay published for so long, despite repeated efforts by her, Saner, and PLOS. She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is also disturbing that the journal has not cleaned up properly despite the challenge from the University of Cape Town, and have so blatantly simply altered the fictional author details provided with the paper. They have not taken the fraudulent material offline. This means that they intend to continue with these kind of practices, and this should not be allowed to continue unchecked. It is, however, quite difficult to find a route to ensure this fraud is halted – as Paula has demonstrated through her multiple and very determined efforts to have the fraudulent article taken down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>EJBI </em>was previously the official journal of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), but Saner noted that the organization <a href="https://efmi.org/2020/05/31/special-announcement-european-journal-for-biomedical-informatics-ejbi-no-longer-under-status-official-journal-of-efmi/">withdrew that claim</a> in 2020 because of “completely inappropriate behaviour for a scientific journal and the lack of quality assurance.”</p>



<p>At that time, <em>EJBI </em>had not removed its claim to be an EFMI journal from its website, “despite repeated requests,” according to EFMI’s statement, and the association was “preparing legal action.” <em>EJBI</em>’s <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/">website</a> no longer refers to EFMI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website lists three editors in chief: Mauro Giacomini of the University of Genoa in Italy, Izet Masic of the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bernd Blobel of the University of Regensburg in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when contacted by Retraction Watch, Giacomini said all three editors had resigned from the journal at the same time the EFMI withdrew its support, and elaborated about why. Giacomini said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The [EJBI] has had a great history, starting from the founding [by our] colleague Jana Zvárová. Shortly before her death, Jana sold the magazine to its current ownership. Upon Jana&#8217;s death (2017), in her memory and in agreement with the European Federation for Medical Informatics, Izet Mesic, Bernd Blobel and I took over the title of Editor-in-Chief of the same journal. Until 2019, we tried to manage this journal with the normal rules of the scientific world, but we noticed serious actions against these rules by the owners. For this reason, after the EJBI pHealth 2019 Special Issue, EFMI withdrew its endorsement of the journal and at the same time the three of us resigned from the role of Editor-in-Chief. We have written to the magazine several times to remove our names from the site but have received no response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Blobel, who helped launch the journal, said it was originally a “home-made” publication produced at Charles University in Prague. When Zvárová’s health got worse, she decided to move the journal to the UK, he said. Giacomini added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For years Jana has carried on the journal in a personal way and with great dedication. When the registration mechanism began with the various international bodies (Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, &#8230; ) many persons suggested that Jana find a suitable publishing house that could bring EJBI into these accredited registers. I didn&#8217;t follow the negotiations, I think none of us followed them in detail, but I believe that these people deceived Jana first, certainly promising to work for the registration of EJBI, which was never done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">It is unclear who, if anyone, is currently serving as editor in chief of the journal, or what entity publishes it. Though Blobel said he originally communicated with colleagues in the UK, the <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/contactus.html">journal’s website</a> lists an address in Brussels, Belgium.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>EJBI </em>staff<em> </em>did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch. A message sent to an email address associated with a LinkedIn profile for DJ Uppari, who Blobel said was previously a managing editor for <em>EJBI</em>, also yielded no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also emailed several editors and associate editors listed on the journal’s website. Yasser Mohammed Hassanain Elsayed, a doctor and researcher with the Egyptian Ministry of Health, said he was an editor for the journal but had no knowledge of the article in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two others expressed confusion that they were listed as associate editors. Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeago, who is currently a senior lecturer at Kampala International University in Uganda, said he didn’t “know when my name was listed among the associate [editors].” Diego Mauricio López Gutierrez, a researcher at the University of Cauca in Colombia, said he was invited to serve as an associate editor and agreed, but never heard from the journal after that.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t get the memo, the presidents of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and the Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA) want you to stop talking about sex already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or at least they want anthropologists to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127981"></span>



<p>Ellie Kincaid <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/27/anthropology-groups-cancel-conference-panel-on-why-biological-sex-is-necessary-for-research/">reported last week</a> for Retraction Watch that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">a panel presentation</a> entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology” had been scheduled for November’s joint AAA-CASCA meeting in Toronto. The conference session had been approved by the programming committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then AAA President Ramona Pérez and CASCA president Monica Heller <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">decided</a> “safety and dignity” were threatened by anthropologists who think biological sex is still a category worth considering. Overriding the programming committee, the two leaders canceled the panel.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, gender is okay with the presidents. It’s talking about biological sex as if it matters to human experience that is a strict no-no. It’s particularly not okay if panelists are “gender critical,” i.e., scholars who think females are being harmed in the move to talking only about gender constructs and not in terms of biological sex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panelists had intended to talk about sex identification in skeletons, coeducation, tech-centric pornography, and misogyny using a generally feminist perspective to think about harm to females. You might think these topics are far enough left to pass muster in academe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">statement</a> put out by the AAA and CASCA accuses the panel of committing “one of the cardinal sins of scholarship – it assumes the truth of the proposition that it sets out to prove, namely, that sex and gender are simplistically binary, and that this is a fact with meaningful implications for the discipline.”</p>



<p>“Cardinal sin” is an appropriate choice of language here, because Pérez and Heller are working from dogma so heavy it is worthy of the Vatican. They act as if anytime someone considers the categories of male and female as worthy of study, they must be denying the existence of trans, gender nonbinary, and intersex people. That’s just silly. That’s like saying you can’t compare tangerines and grapefruits because tangelos also exist.</p>



<p>It’s entirely possible – indeed, reasonable – to consider the categories of male and female in science and other forms of scholarship, and doing so does not require denying that not everyone fits those categories. (I say this as someone whose scholarship and activism centered on <a href="https://alicedreger.com/medical_invention/">intersex</a> for <a href="https://alicedreger.com/gmf/">decades</a> as a person who has <a href="https://alicedreger.com/trans/">advocated</a> for trans rights.) Indeed, the canceled panelists alluded to the existence of people who don’t fit those categories in the abstracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the (alleged) risk of endangering safety and dignity, I’m going to say it: The great majority of humans come biologically in one of two forms, male and female. While it’s worth cautioning against simplistic thinking that assumes gendered behaviors and attributes are always biologically inborn and not culturally learned, you can also learn a lot by thinking in terms of categories of sex, especially if you look at the places where genders don’t easily map to sex.</p>



<p>Consider, for example, anthropological research that has focused on cultures that include third-gender categories. Anthropologists have documented how a <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-old-way-to-be-gay-couples-love-evolution-67337">number of traditional cultures</a> around the world provide designated names and pathways for male children who behave in ways identified as feminine. These children are shifted into categories that allow them to live like girls and then like women. (A few cultures also have the opposite, i.e., categories for females who take on masculine cultural roles.)</p>



<p>One might simply think of these categories as “transgender,” but as researchers have documented, there’s definitely a sexed element to all this. Third-gender males in these cultures are recognized as being androphilic (sexually attracted to masculine males), and traditionally no sex-changing interventions have been employed. This is about gender, yes, but it’s also about sex.</p>



<p>Anthropologists have also traced out what two cultures – one in the Dominican Republic and one in Papua New Guinea – have done to deal with an intersex condition that is relatively common in those populations. The condition, 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency, results in a child born looking female but later naturally undergoing a masculinizing puberty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watching what cultures do to preserve gendered (and especially heterosexist) beliefs in the face of recognized sexual minorities helps us understand how humans try to manage sex, including through gendered constructs.</p>



<p>I suppose Presidents Pérez and Heller might allow presentations on what look to them like trans and intersex people; their letter earnestly claims to be defending “members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But policing what scholars can say and think about sex and gender is no way to help minority sex, gender, and sexual-orientation populations. That policing will always end up harming some of them. (The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">letter</a> objecting to the canceling notes that one member of the committee-approved panel is lesbian.) </p>



<p>Moreover, this kind of attempt at silencing feeds the right’s portrayal of academics as hopelessly partisan and the right’s belief that political censorship is fair game.</p>



<p>This is all terribly ironic, too, because historically anthropology was one of the disciplines that taught us sex and gender are not the same thing. Human cultures have created so many different gender-masks for sex, what we learn by allowing free inquiry is just that: that gender (and therefore sex, too) can be a many-splendored thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More irony: the decision by Pérez and Heller silenced women who were making a group argument against the silencing of women. If the presidents want to fight against the core claim of gender-critical scholars – that defense of trans rights is accruing harm to women – can’t they see they’ve just <em>proven</em> the point?</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Any blog about the future of peer review should start with a brief mention of its history. The actual process of peer review can be dated back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century. It has of course evolved since then and one notable step was the introduction of external reviewers in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This model, however, only really became the norm in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>We can only speculate on what the future of peer review will be and how recent challenges and innovations will act to shape it. One thing is however sure: this future will depend on the key players of tomorrow, the ones who will one day hold the reins. The future of scientific research depends on today’s early career researchers (ECRs) and thus they will also play an instrumental role in shaping the future of peer review. Therefore, I decided to reach out to a selection of ECRs to gather their thoughts and hopes about the future of peer review.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging them as this blog would not have been possible without their contribution and time is a very valuable currency nowadays, especially for ECRs in the demanding research world.</p>

<p>Now without further ado, we will dive into their answers to the questions I had prepared.</p>
<p>To set the scene, the participants were first asked how familiar they were with the peer review system and whether they had already reviewed a manuscript or worked as an editor. Unsurprisingly, all of them had already reviewed manuscripts and Partha Sarathi Tripathy mentioned that he is working as an editor for an aquaculture journal in India. I then went on to ask them what their opinion of the current peer review system was.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the current peer review system is working?</strong></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a consensus around the fact that there are currently not enough rewards to motivate researchers to dedicate time in their busy schedule to reviewing manuscripts, given the pressure they are subjected to. This issue then leads to difficulty in finding reviewers and can also result in poor quality review reports. However, as Julia Sanchez-Garrido said, “<em>being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?).”</em> Stephanie Tsai also mentioned that she thought the system would benefit from more double-blind and transparent review.</p>
<p>My next question delved more into the specific aspects of the system that they liked or disliked.</p>
<p><strong> Can you tell me one thing that you like about it and one thing that you dislike?</strong></p>
<p>All the participants answered that they liked the fact that constructive criticism from a reviewer can improve a paper, for example by judiciously suggesting additional experiments, provided this reviewer is unbiased, familiar with the field of research in question and that the suggested changes are reasonable. “<em>Editors and reviewers both should be reasonable about considering the time and necessity of those suggestions to the core findings of the work,</em>” said Tsai. Partha Sarathi Tripathy added: “<em>The thing I like about the system is that it helps to ensure the quality and integrity of scientific literature. By having multiple experts review a paper, errors and inaccuracies can be caught before publication”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?)” </em><strong>Julia Sanchez-Garrido</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In a similar fashion, the aspects that they disliked were also centered around reviewers but this time mentioning the bad aspects that can stem from the anonymous status of reviewers, such as being unfair, letting a bias (conscious or unconscious) influence their judgement or suggesting unnecessary changes that might even be wrong. The commercial aspect of the system was also mentioned as a negative trait: “<em>I dislike the peer-review model of some commercial journals, who charge expensive article processing fees (including open-access charges) from researchers, build paywalls for readers, and ask researchers to review articles for free,</em>” said Yu Wan.</p>
<p>My next question prompted them to identify what changes they would implement if they had the chance to do so.</p>
<p><strong> If you had a magic wand and could change anything/everything about the current peer review system, what would you change?</strong></p>
<p>Here again the answers were homogeneous and similar changes were suggested. The need for better acknowledgment of the work accomplished by the reviewer was an important concern, along with how this work should be publicly displayed &#8211; similarly to platform such as <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> in order to serve as evidence to advance the career of reviewers. Yu Wan stated: “<em>If a researcher&#8217;s academic contribution is measured by the number and quality of papers that they have published, the researcher&#8217;s contribution to peer review should also be recognized in the same way</em>.” Wan then went on to add: “<em>I would also promote open/transparent peer review, with reviewers&#8217; comments, names, affiliations shown (with reviewers&#8217; consent) when the paper gets published. Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.” </em><strong>Yu Wan</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A second change that was mentioned several times was the need for more transparency, better rules or guidelines around the peer review process, or even training courses for reviewers as suggested by Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido to ensure that researchers are aware of predatory journals and ensure that: “<em>the effort and time invested in the review is worthwhile for the field.”</em> Clemens Falker-Gieske also mentioned that the lack of clear rules around what is needed for a paper to be accepted can lead to a feeling of randomness for the researchers: “<em>Often it appears quite random if a paper is accepted or rejected because it 100% depends on the assessment of the reviewers and the editor, which usually is a team of only 3 persons.</em>”</p>
<p>Tsai also added that: <em>“agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Several of the participants actually anticipated my next question, which was centered around transparent peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the recent changes such as transparent peer review? Do you like this principle and would you like to see more of it?</strong></p>
<p>A very strong &#8220;yes&#8221; was received from all the participants, which was heartening, as transparent peer review is becoming increasingly more present and is already the norm at many journals.</p>
<p>They liked the fact that the history of the review of a manuscript is now accessible and allows a better understanding of the manuscript and a deeper dive. Many ECRs mentioned that they would like to see more transparent review and that all journals should adopt it. The fact that it contributes to research integrity was also mentioned and Tripathy added that: “<em>knowing that their reviews will be public might motivate reviewers to be more thorough and constructive in their feedback,</em>” and then went on to say that “<em>transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”</p>
<p>However, Sanchez-Garrido also discussed issues that can stem from open peer review: “<em>On the other hand I would say open peer review, where the reviewer’s identities are revealed, can be problematic as it has the potential to lead to resentment and/or gratefulness towards specific individuals. In my opinion the process should be anonymous in both directions, to also avoid </em><i>favoritism.</i>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.</em>” <strong>Stephanie Tsai</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>My next question focused more on the future of peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the future of peer review? Do you think the current model will continue <em>ad eternum</em> or do you foresee changes?</strong></p>
<p>Different points of view were shared here. Sanchez-Garrido mentioned that “<em>we have yet to find a better system that works as well and that is sustainable.</em>” Falker-Gieske mentioned the problems of “<em>fake AI-generated papers</em>” and how “<em>the detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em>Tsai hoped for more transparent peer review and “<em>policies to reduce individual reviewer biases such as double blinded review.</em>” Wan stated that “<em>the current model of peer review is not sustainable given the increasing pressure that researchers are facing and therefore, changes must be taken.”</em> Tripathy added:<em> “it&#8217;s clear that the demands of the modern scientific community, combined with technological advancements, will drive changes. The ultimate goal will always be to uphold the quality, integrity, and advancement of scientific knowledge.”</em></p>
<p>My next question was then centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and what they thought of employing it.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think about the inclusion of artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>The general response was that caution was required with the use of AI and how its use, if permitted, should be limited. Sanchez-Garrido said that she did not think it had reached a stage where it could be used but that it would likely be used in the future. Falker-Gieske mentioned that it could be used for quality checks: language, plagiarism, authenticity. Tsai cautiously stated: “<em>completely removing the scientist would be less than ideal given how peer review is critical for assessing the quality of research being published and the reality of reviewer experiments (time, feasibility etc.).”</em> Wan had a similar answer and mentioned it should be used with caution but that “<em>AI would be a powerful tool for checking plagiarism and image manipulations or to assist reviewers in summarizing the work or searching for relevant publications.</em>” Wan also added that “<em>human&#8217;s expertise, experience, and accountability will always be pivotal in peer review,</em>” a point that was also made by Tripathy: “<em>the human touch – the expertise, intuition, and critical thinking that researchers bring to the table – will remain invaluable.</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”<strong> Partha Sarathi Tripathy</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I went on to ask them about what changes would be implemented in the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the peer review system will be like 10 years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido postulated on a Hybrid Review System combining human experts in the field with AI use at the initial steps in order to streamline the process. They also mentioned an increase in transparent review, as did Tsai.</p>
<p>My next question was to ask them what changes they would implement if they had the choice.</p>
<p><strong> How would you like it to be if it were up to you?</strong></p>
<p>Sanchez-Garrido answered that she “<em>would like junior researchers to get more of a chance to see how the publishing process goes and get involved in reviewing.</em>” Falker-Gieske added “<em>more transparent, fair and comparable between journals.</em>” Tsai suggested that “<em>editors and reviewers altogether discuss the manuscript in question at the end of their review briefly to come up with a plan for what they envision being required for revisions.</em>”</p>
<p>Wan suggested key points: “<em>1. Fair and transparent review models. 2. Diverse and effective motivations for reviewers. 3. Recognition of peer review in researcher&#8217;s promotion processes and grant applications. 4. Use of AI review assistants.” </em>Finally Tripathy added that “<em>Platforms might emerge that give reviewers formal credit for their contributions, possibly even considering reviews as a form of scholarly output.</em>”</p>
<p>And to conclude I asked them if they had any further comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>The detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em><strong>Clemens Falker-Gieske</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you have any comments/advice to give us (BMC/Springer Nature) about the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>An encouraging comment from Sanchez-Garrido: “<em>I like the fact that transparent peer review has become the norm!</em>”; a recommendation from Falker-Gieske: “<em>Make sure editors keep an eye on the quality of reviewer reports.</em>”; and a request from Tripathy: “<em>the system needs to be a faster and accurate.</em>”</p>
<p>To conclude, I feel very hopeful after writing this interview piece. When I set out with the plan to conduct these interviews, I did not know what to expect, whether anyone would actually be interested to share their opinion with me and whether they would be worth reading. It has been so refreshing and helpful to collect all these opinions and write this blog. ECRs have many useful ideas and suggestions and they care! As long as we, publishers, editors and the likes, keep the dialog open, I am confident that we will work together towards a bright future for peer review!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pedestrian-stops-police-civilian-encounters">Curbing pedestrian stops might not reduce police-civilian encounters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any encounter between police and civilians has the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">potential to go awry</a> (<em>SN: 11/17/21</em>). Stop and frisk, where police pat down pedestrians suspected of carrying contraband, can be particularly fraught, leading to some efforts to limit the practice.</p>



<p>But simply curbing foot stops may not reduce the likelihood of such contentious encounters, suggests a case study of Chicago. A steep decline in pedestrian stops in the Windy City eight years ago <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coincided with a lasting spike in traffic stops</a>, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Advances. </em>While the rate of pedestrian stops plummeted by roughly 80 percent over five months in 2015, the rate of traffic stops grew by about the same amount over the next few years.</p>





<p>“This is a really dramatic shift in police activity,” says political scientist Dorothy Kronick of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>The analysis doesn’t prove that the change in pedestrian stops caused the subsequent spike in traffic stops; nor does it delve into the implications of the change. The Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>But the data do suggest that studying a single change might not tell the whole story about police tactics, the researchers say. “We want to … think about the way that police agencies or other government agencies are going to respond strategically to these changes,” says Kronick, who coauthored the study with Berkeley immigration and criminal law expert David Hausman.</p>



<p>Stop-and-frisk policing peaked in popularity in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s before declining in the 2010s as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/police/paac098/6989602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice’s ill effects became clear</a>, researchers noted in January in <em>Policing: A Journal of Policy and Practice.</em> Officers disproportionately targeted Black and other minority populations, the practice reduced well-being among affected residents and crime did not drop by as much as expected.</p>



<p>Pedestrian stops plummeted in New York City from roughly 700,000 stops in 2011 to fewer than 25,000 stops in 2015 — a 97 percent drop. In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois released a report showing that the rate of pedestrian stops in Chicago <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/2015-stop-and-frisk-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quadruple that of pre-reform New York City</a>. That report prompted the Chicago police to require more stringent documentation of pedestrian stops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A stop that might have taken two or three minutes now took 20 with the appropriate paperwork,” administrators for Second City Cop, an anonymous blogging site for Chicago police officers, explained in an email to <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>The impact of that policy change was stark: As of August 2015, Chicago officers were stopping more than 20 pedestrians for every 100 Chicagoans per year, the new study reports. Five months later, that rate had dropped to less than 4 out of 100. The proportion of Black civilians stopped remained the same, at about 60 to 70 percent.</p>



<p>Traffic stops over the next four years, meanwhile, climbed. In 2016, Chicago officers were stopping roughly 3 drivers out of every 100 residents per year. Three years later, they were stopping roughly 22 out of 100, Kronick and Hausman report. The demographics of stopped drivers shifted, from 45 percent Black in 2016 to 60 percent Black in 2019.</p>



<p>Police beats once marked by pedestrian stops saw the greatest increase in traffic stops, the authors note. They did not observe a similar jump in traffic stops among Illinois State Police, whose jurisdiction partially overlaps with the Chicago police, or among neighboring suburban police departments.</p>



<p>The findings don’t surprise criminologist Wesley G. Skogan, who observed the same substitution while researching his 2022 book, <em>Stop &amp; Frisk and the Politics of Crime in Chicago</em>. “When you work with the data, you certainly notice the shift from one to the other,” says Skogan, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The crux of this paper is that policing strategies are to a certain degree fungible, that is, you can switch from one to the other.” &nbsp;</p>

Kronick/<em>Science Advances </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Showing cause and effect, however, is tricky. In the new study, Kronick and Hausman draw on posts and comments on Second City Cop suggesting that officers understood that they were supposed to make this substitution.</p>



<p>Current blog administrators concur, noting that the shift to traffic stops seemed like a clear change in policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an observational study, the methodology is sound, says criminologist David Weisburd of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Ruling out all the underlying reasons for the switch is impossible, though. For instance, were there other changes within the police department that led to this shift in priorities? Were residents demanding proactive policies to thwart crime?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the dramatic rise in traffic stops alone raises questions, Weisburd says. “Why would you switch to traffic stops that have the same problems for the public and greater safety problems for police officers?”</p>



<p>Evidence for similar substitutions in other cities is scant. But the push for proactive policing to thwart crime suggests this sort of switch may not be unusual.</p>



<p>“From research, we know that proactive policing is really the best way to manage crime and manage problems in communities,” says criminologist William Sousa of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. But the line between problematic stop-and-frisk practices and proactive policing, where police increase surveillance in high-crime neighborhoods to keep residents safe, can be fuzzy, he says.</p>



<p>And how to prevent racial profiling in proactive policing remains a thorny question. For instance, the authors of the new study cite a 2019 news story in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describing how the city’s police drastically increased driver stops to root out people carrying guns or drugs. As with antagonistic foot stops, police disproportionately targeted Black civilians, leading one lawyer to dub the practice “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-traffic-stops-20190124-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop and frisk in a car</a>.”</p>



<p>The study raises many questions, including about the generalizability of the findings, why this switch occurred and, crucially, whether the shift reduced problems associated with pedestrian stops, Hausman says. But it illuminates why looking at a single change in police tactics could cause researchers and policy makers to miss whether the change worked as intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s important to take this first step,” Hausman says. “It’s very easy to assume that reducing this particular type of police-civilian interaction will reduce police-civilian interactions overall.”</p>

<p>Put a wood frog tadpole and a green frog tadpole in water and turn up the heat. The two species live in similar environments, but green frog tadpoles just keep swimming in water that’s up to 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer.</p>



<p>But when scientists transferred the gut microbiome of a green frog (<em>Lithobates clamitans</em>) to the eggs of a wood frog (<em>L. sylvaticus</em>), the wood frog larvae <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.07.556683v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could handle short stints at higher water temperatures</a>, Jason Dallas and colleagues report September 7 on bioRxiv.org. The study reveals one reason some species might be more, or less, sensitive to climate change.</p>





<p>Green frogs and wood frogs are closely related but lead different lives. Wood frogs go from egg to adult in only three months in the spring. Green frog larvae can remain as tadpoles through the whole summer, swimming in higher water temperatures as a result. Dallas, a herpetologist at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, was particularly interested in the frogs’ critical thermal maxima — the hottest temperature at which the animal can continue to move.</p>



<p>“Amphibians [and] reptiles are globally imperiled, but still remain understudied,” Dallas says, and it’s not clear just how their microbiomes contribute to how they live their lives. To find out what role the microbiome might play in frog temperature tolerance, Dallas headed out to a local wetland in early spring in search of wood frog eggs. Timing is key. “They’ll breed, and it’ll all be over in basically one or two nights,” he says. “The next day you go, [and] there’s hundreds of egg masses, if not thousands.”</p>



<p>Dallas scooped a few egg masses into a large plastic tub and drove back to campus. Slowly. “You go a little bit slow, which the other drivers may not appreciate but the wood frogs like.” Back at the lab, he and his colleagues washed the eggs in an antibiotic solution to rid them of their own microbiome and inoculated some of them with gut bacteria from green frogs.</p>



<p>When the eggs hatched, the tadpoles ate a little of their egg jelly — gaining a dose of pond water or green frog bacteria in the process. Dallas found that those who had received a dose of green frog gut bacteria could take short periods of water heated to 38.3° C, while those inoculated with their normal pond water or no bacteria at all topped out at 37.7° C. When the researchers analyzed the microbiomes of the larvae, they found that larvae inoculated with green frog bacteria had more diverse microbiomes.&nbsp;</p>

Dallas</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The temperature difference is small, but could be meaningful, says Timothy Colston, a herpetologist at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez who was not involved in the study. “Even 1 degree of difference over a short period of time, if that gives you an advantage to being able to survive and reproduce, then that&#8217;s going to increase your fitness,” he says.</p>



<p>How exactly a frog’s microbiome helps the animals take more heat remains a bit of a mystery. The right bacterial population could be good for the frog’s overall health. If they’re protected, say from viruses or fungal infections, they might be better able to resist a heatwave or two, Colston says. Gut microbes could also affect how a frog’s metabolism functions, or whether and how they express proteins that resist heat.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s probably a lot of cellular mechanisms and other mechanisms in play,” Dallas says. Certainly, this is not an excuse to go around dosing frog populations with bacteria during heatwaves; he and his colleagues were only able to identify broad groups of microbes involved. But it does show one way that some frogs might get hot — or not — in the face of climate change.</p>

<p>The editor in chief, managing editors, and entire editorial board of a mathematics journal all resigned earlier this year following a dispute with their publisher over special issues and article volume. </p>



<p>Changes the publisher wanted to make to the journal “would have the effect of jeopardizing scientific integrity for the sake of financial gain,” the editors wrote in their announcement of their resignations, which took place on January 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignation at the <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em>, previously published by the <a href="https://www.aimsciences.org/index/AboutAIMS">American Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS), is one of at least five such collective actions journal editors took in 2023, according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">list Retraction Watch has compiled</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former editors have started a new journal named <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/gm"><em>Geometric Mechanics</em></a> with World Scientific. </p>



<span id="more-127952"></span>



<p>The editors’ announcement, which was emailed to a few colleagues, stated that AIMS “introduced numerous special issues with no consultation with, nor control from, the Editor-in-Chief nor the Editorial Board,” and “insisted that the Board increase by five-fold the number of published papers over the next few years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the managing editors tried negotiating with the publisher “their attempts were largely ignored,” according to the announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5V0GD7IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Manuel de Leon</a>, the editor in chief, told us AIMS had made the journal open access with author fees without consulting the editorial board. In addition to increasing the number of accepted papers, AIMS was giving non-specialist staff editors some control over publications and requiring the editors to publish submitted and accepted papers within two months, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors perceived that the two-month period for submission to publication was “pressure to sacrifice the integrity of the editorial process to increase the number of accepted papers,” de Leon said. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the Editorial Board, we felt that these new operational and editorial policies for the journal were not commensurate with our view of how to run JGM for the benefit of the geometric mechanics community—and the mathematical community as a whole—by maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The old <a href="http://aimspress.com/journal/jgm"><em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em></a> is now named <em>Communications in Analysis and Mechanics</em>, and has a new <a href="http://aimspress.com/cam/news/solo-detail/editorialboard">editorial board</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>De Leon said AIMS was operating “under directorship” of <a href="https://math.missouristate.edu/profile-display.aspx?p=shu">Shouchuan Hu</a>, an emeritus faculty member at Missouri State University in Springfield. Hu is the registered agent for <a href="https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BusinessEntityDetail.aspx?ID=3878143&amp;page=beSearch">AIMS, LLC</a>, a limited liability company based in Missouri.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu told us the editors’ version of events was “untrue.” But in his correspondence with editorial board members, which he shared with Retraction Watch, he described the planned shift to open access and increased publication volume target as changes to make the journal financially sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email sent to board members after their resignations, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It appears there might be a communicational [sic] issue between us.&nbsp; Therefore, please view the following facts:</p>



<p>1. the journal has been around for 14 years;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. the journal has 52 editors&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. the journal publishes about 20 articles each year;&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. the journal has less than 10 subscriptions in total;&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. thus the publishing model is not sustainable financially;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. the trend of journal transformation is weeping the entire industry;&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. thus, we need to follow the trend to develop the journal into Open Access, sooner or later;&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. it has been offered that all papers recruited by any board member will be APC waived;&nbsp;</p>



<p>9. all special issues papers arranged by any board members will be APC waived.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hu also wrote that since some of the journal’s editors had published their work in <em>Mathematics</em>, an open access publication from MDPI, “this approach should be acceptable.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If for any reason you should feel that we modify the approach to make it work better, please let me know. We can also offer the possibility of moving the journal back to be a regular publication again, no more Open Access, if the majority feel it might be a better alternative after the miscommunication is clarified.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Hu said de Leon had published in <em>Mathematics</em>, “therefore, he accepts the model of OA clearly.”</p>



<p>De Leon has not responded to our follow-up request for comment on Hu’s claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email de Leon wrote to Hu last September that Hu shared with us, de Leon elaborated on his concerns, emphasizing the importance “that no quality paper cannot be published because the authors do not have the funds to pay the [open access fee].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Today I saw that there are two special issues to be published in the JGM. This is the first news I have of this; and we cannot work like this. There cannot be a JGM parallel to the current one, every paper or special issue must be previously approved by the director and the managing editors, and the consultation to the editor or editors who are closer to the topics of those papers or special issues. And it must be us, with the help of the EB members, who indicate the referees for each paper. Because if this is not done, all the work of these 15 years will be thrown away, and we will have lost all the prestige we have gained. It is no longer a problem of economics, of [open access], it is a problem of quality and procedures in the publication process. Without the usual standards in mathematics journals that have a prestige of years, the JGM cannot be continued.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Sure, I agree with you in principle,” Hu’s reply began. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On the other hand, as we agreed we need to target about publication of 100 papers next year and the cycle from submission to publication should be within 2 months. Thus, there needs to be a much better communication and efficiency.&nbsp; We will make sure the in house staff editors communicate with you and the board timely, but they need instructions and feedback from the board in days, not weeks, in order for them to perform. Therefore, they should be given some flexibility.&nbsp; Otherwise, the targets next year will not be achieved, and the journal will not be sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We of course do not wish to create a JGM within JGM.&nbsp; We just need to follow others on how to develop an OA journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another follow up, Hu told de Leon he “did not realize that the solicited two special issues are causing an alarm till now,” and “we should then stop the two issues from further development.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu also wrote that “any future actions should be under your supervision,” and asked de Leon to confer with other board members to develop ideas for potential special issues and contributors, which staff editors for the publisher would handle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After several more emails from Hu, de Leon responded that he was busy with meetings and a student defending his doctoral thesis, and wanted “to think quietly about the future of the JGM.” He proposed meeting over Zoom, as Hu had suggested, in October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next email in the chain, dated December 7, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am sure we could iron out our differences and move forward when we have a talk.&nbsp; I don’t feel like intervening with the editorial structure of the journal unless I have to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 26, Hu sent another email complaining de Leon had not replied to him. He called the journal “dysfunctional,” and said he “may intervene if this dysfunction should continue into 2023.” He reiterated an earlier invitation for de Leon to speak at an upcoming AIMS conference, and proposed a meeting at the conference “so that we can try to come up with a working plan for the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weeks later, de Leon and the rest of the editorial board resigned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/j.montaldi/">James Montaldi</a>, a reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester and formal editorial board member, told us the previous <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics </em>“was a specialized journal which reported much of the best material in the area,” and published special issues proposed and curated by members of the editorial board (rather than the publisher).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal worked well from an academic point of view before,” he said, and “we had enough warning of the changes to all resign before they were realized.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid">New computer analysis hints volcanism killed the dinosaurs, not an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, scientists have vigorously debated whether an asteroid strike or massive volcanic eruptions ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Roughly three-quarters of all life on Earth, including all nonbird dinosaurs, went extinct at that time, putting a dramatic end to the Cretaceous Period.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have devised a new way to identify the true dino killer: Let computers take a crack at it.</p>



<p>The result of that computational effort suggests that massive bursts of gas produced by the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh3875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deccan Traps eruptions were solely capable of causing the extinction event</a>, the team reports in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. Those eruptions, which lasted roughly a million years, spewed massive amounts of gas-ridden lava across what’s now western India.</p>





<p>“Rather than come at it from the perspective of ‘let’s blame the volcanoes and explain why’ or ‘let’s blame asteroids and explain why,’” the goal was to have as little human input or bias in the process as possible, says Dartmouth computational geologist Alexander Cox.</p>



<p>The idea was to work backward using evidence from the scene of the crime. Scientists do have a smoking gun: Cores drilled into deep-ocean sediments contain geologic data pointing to deadly bursts of gas to the atmosphere, particularly planet-warming carbon dioxide and ocean-acidifying sulfur dioxide.</p>



<p>But such gases could have come from the asteroid strike, as it incinerated rocks on the planet’s surface, Cox says, or from the Deccan Traps eruptions.</p>



<p>Previous efforts to understand the source of the gases have focused on timing, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dueling-dates-volcanic-eruption-debate-dinosaurs-death">examining pulses of lava emplacement during the Deccan Traps</a> eruptions, Cox says (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/21/19</em>). But “we only have best guesses about how much initial gas was in [the lava].” Estimated carbon dioxide concentrations in the lava, for example, vary by an order of magnitude, he says. “So that’s why we approached this from a gas-emissions perspective rather than a lava-flow perspective.”</p>

<p>To disentangle the relative contributions of each potential culprit, Cox and Dartmouth geologist C. Brenhin Keller used a statistical model called a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. That approach systematically considers the probability of different scenarios of gas emissions from the different sources, converging toward possible solutions as the results of the simulations move closer and closer to geologic observations.</p>



<p>What made the researchers’ approach particularly powerful is that they harnessed 128 different processors to run scenarios in parallel, Cox says. “All the processors then compared how they’re doing at the end of every model run, like classmates comparing answers.” That parallel computing meant that computations that would otherwise have taken a year took only a few days.</p>



<p>The observations Cox and Keller used were data collected from three cores drilled into deep-sea sediments, each spanning 67 million to 65 million years ago. In those sediments are foraminifera, ocean-dwelling microorganisms whose carbonate shells contain different isotopes, or forms, of carbon and oxygen. The shells’ chemical makeup records the ocean chemistry at the time of their formation, and so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-gas-bursts-probably-didnt-kill-off-the-dinosaurs">can be used as a proxy to infer past global temperatures as well as how many creatures were thriving in the oceans</a>, and how much carbon was moving between the atmosphere, ocean and land (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>The computer simulations determined that the amount of gas spewed into the atmosphere from the volcanism alone was enough to account for the changes in temperature and carbon cycling determined from the foraminifera data in the drill cores.</p>



<p>As for the asteroid strike, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">formed the massive Chicxulub crater in what’s now Mexico</a>, it probably did not produce a big spike in carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, the analysis found (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>).</p>





<p>But many scientists are not convinced that these findings provide the ultimate answer to this long-standing, complex question. “It’s an elegant way to address this problem,” says Sierra Petersen, a geochemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Modeling in this way “gives the freedom to find the consensus solution, taking multiple proxy records into account. However, like any model, output depends on input.”</p>



<p>Petersen notes that foraminifera shells are not an ideal proxy for ancient temperatures: The oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera shells can change not only due to temperature but also due to seawater composition. Different temperature proxies would likely lead to different patterns of gas release reproduced in models, Petersen says.</p>



<p>As for the mass extinction culprit, she adds, “it’s a bit of a leap to say that this study shows the impact didn’t cause the extinction. I think what they show is that the impact was likely not associated with a large [gas] release.” But the asteroid, she says, still could have had other deadly impacts on the planet’s environment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, “the Chicxulub impact led to many devastating effects beyond the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions explored in this study,” says Clay Tabor, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.</p>



<p>Those include massive clouds of soot and dust kicked up from pulverized rocks due to the impact, he says. Previous research has suggested this dust may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impact-volcanism-earth-dinosaurs-deccan-mass-extinction">dimmed the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth</a> by as much as 20 percent, inducing a frigid winter that swiftly killed off plants and destroyed habitats (<em>SN: 7/17/20</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, the new study suggests that the asteroid impact didn’t have a long-term effect on the planet’s carbon cycle, based on carbon isotope data recorded in the foraminifera shells for the million years after the extinction. But there was an abrupt drop in the abundance of those creatures corresponding to the time of the impact, Tabor says. “The rapid rate of change caused by the Chicxulub impact was likely responsible for its effects on life.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Many geochemical records spanning the [extinction event], as well as this modeling work, cannot capture well the rates of change associated with the Chicxulub impact,” he says. “The impact may have released significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> than the Deccan Traps, but it did so almost instantaneously.” So even if the asteroid impact released fewer gases overall, Tabor says, the speediness of that release could have been devastating all the same.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-sticking-skin-surfaces">How a deadly fungus is so good at sticking to skin and other surfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Candida auris</em>, a fungus that causes sometimes deadly infections, can stick to almost any surface.</p>



<p>In hospitals, “it&#8217;s very tenacious, very difficult to get rid of and ends up on all the surfaces around patients,” where it can fuel outbreaks, says Darian Santana, a microbiologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. The fungus has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">spreading rapidly</a> since cases first emerged in several locations around the world in 2012 (<em>SN: 3/20/23</em>).</p>





<p>Santana and colleagues have discovered how the fungi stick to a wide variety of surfaces. Most fungi make adhesive proteins that rely on hydrophobic interactions to glom onto surfaces. Think oil and water, says Teresa O’Meara, a microbiologist and geneticist in whose lab Santana works. Oil droplets congregate with other oil droplets, while water is attracted to water. Similarly, hydrophobic fungal proteins attach themselves to hydrophobic, or water-repellent, surfaces.</p>



<p><em>C. auris</em> has hydrophobic adhesion proteins too, but it mainly <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf8972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastes itself to surfaces</a> using electrical charges, the researchers report in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. The fungus makes protein called SCF1, which contains many positively charged amino acids. The positive charge creates attraction with negative charges on surfaces, including skin and medical devices. It’s similar to the way barnacles stick to boats, Santana says.</p>



<p>The protein allowed the fungus to infect skin samples and colonize catheters in the lab, the team found. Without SCF1, the fungus was unable to spread in infected mice. </p>



<p>The finding may eventually lead to new ways to prevent or treat <em>C. auris</em> infections, O’Meara says. For instance, treatments may turn off production of the protein to prevent the fungus from spreading more widely in infected people, or a vaccine or antibody might stop the fungus from binding to surfaces and head off illness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-images-cosmos-universe-hubble-constant-tension">New JWST images suggest our understanding of the cosmos is flawed</a></h4>

              
                <p>The greatest puzzle in cosmology just got even more puzzling.</p>



<p>Images from the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed that the universe appears to be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15806.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding significantly faster</a> than it should be, researchers report in a study accepted in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The observation is in conflict with an esteemed theory, the standard model of cosmology, that describes how the universe has evolved since the first moments after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The conflict comes down to calculations of the Hubble constant, a number that describes how fast everything in the universe is flying apart. One calculation, based on Planck satellite observations of the oldest light in the universe in conjunction with the standard model of cosmology, suggests the Hubble constant is 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is about 3 million light-years). Hubble Space Telescope images of stars at various distances from us provide a fundamentally incompatible value — 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>





<p>The discrepancy is known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">Hubble tension</a>, and new JWST data hasn’t done anything to ease it (<em>SN: 7/30/19)</em>. The telescope took images of the same stars as the Hubble telescope and calculated a very similar Hubble constant. Although the Planck number disagrees from the Hubble telescope and JWST number by less than 10 percent, the discrepancy in the measurements implies that there’s something terribly wrong with our understanding of the universe. Unless an error turns up in one of the measurements, it will take strange new physics to explain the tension.</p>



<p>“Papers in the literature over the last 10 years have invoked anything from weird dark matter to weird dark energy, to another [exotic] particle, to a magnetic field in the early universe to a new field, all kinds of things” to explain the Hubble tension, says cosmologist Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Some of these explanations “look semi-successful, some of them look like failures, some of them would cause other problems,” he says. Developing a theory that might resolve the tension “is still very much in the skunkworks [or extremely speculative] stage of trying to understand what [the tension] could mean.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST looks to the stars to calculate the Hubble constant</h4>



<p>With the Hubble telescope and JWST, astronomers calculate the Hubble constant by observing flashing stars known as Cepheid variables. The stars flare up periodically at rates that indicate how much light they’re putting out. Comparing a star’s brightness in telescope images with its expected brightness, based on the flare-up rates, gives a measure of the distance to the stars. Shifts in the color of the light coming from the stars reveal how fast they’re moving. Combining distance and speed observations of Cepheid stars leads to a measure of the expansion of the universe.</p>



<p>But Cepheid variable stars tend to sit deep inside galaxies, surrounded by crowds of other stars. That can make it difficult to get good measurements of the Cepheids’ speeds and locations. One simple resolution for the Hubble tension could have been that the Hubble telescope measurements were simply off.</p>



<p>Enter JWST, which can peer through the stellar crowds to clearly make out the color and brightness of Cepheid variables. The higher-resolution JWST images provide data with dramatically lower uncertainties and reduced confusion with nearby stars than the Hubble telescope could manage. The result: The Hubble telescope measurements have been right all along, Riess and colleagues report in their new paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>This study alone isn’t enough to convince astronomer Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. The two galaxies studied are comparatively close to us, on cosmic scales, with the farthest one about 75 million light-years away, she notes. The relative proximity makes it easier to pick out the Cepheids from the stellar crowds. Freedman suspects it will be harder to distinguish Cepheids from the crowds of surrounding stars in more distant galaxies, even with JWST.</p>



<p>“The problem is only going to be worse,” Freedman says. “Because the resolution, it gets worse as you go to a higher distance.” For very distant galaxies, she suspects, stars could appear too close together to pick out the Cepheids from neighboring stars, even for JWST. As a result, &nbsp;Freedman says that Riess’ confirmation of the higher Hubble constant may crumble with analysis of more distant Cepheids.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST’s images leave the Hubble tension untouched</h4>



<p>Hints that the measurements might hold up at larger distances arose in a Sept. 12 presentation at a conference in Baltimore dedicated to the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2023/september/the-first-year-of-jwst-science-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first year of JWST science</a>. Riess showed preliminary Cepheid data from four more galaxies. One of them is 140 million light-years away — among the most distant galaxies in the Hubble telescope Cepheid studies. JWST data from those stars also line up with the Hubble telescope measurements. Although still awaiting peer review, the images strongly suggest that the JWST has indeed overcome the uncertainties that resulted when light from Cepheids got mixed up with light from nearby stars in the lower resolution Hubble telescope images.</p>





<p>University of Cambridge astrophysicist George Efstathiou, who was not involved in the study, is both convinced that Riess has gotten the measurements right and confounded by the implications. “When they showed me all of that [data],” Efstathiou says, “my reaction was, ‘Well, you know, I&#8217;m stumped.’”</p>



<p>Efstathiou is a member of the Planck satellite collaboration, which studied the oldest light in the universe, called the cosmic microwave background, and found the lower value for the expansion of the universe. The satellite’s calculation is based on images of the patterns in light from the early universe. Together with the standard model of cosmology, the images show that the universe is expanding with a Hubble constant that’s lower than the JWST measurement by about 5.6 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>



<p>As it stands, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the Planck measurement of the Hubble constant or with the JWST observations. The tension between the measurements points a finger at the standard model of cosmology as the problem. But the standard model also appears to be unimpeachable; it’s withstood numerous other challenges without breaking down. The model came about in part due to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-acceleration-discovery-wins-physics-nobel">discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe</a>, which earned Riess and others a Nobel Prize in physics (<em>SN: 10/4/11</em>). The revelation was a key piece in shaping the model to include dark matter, dark energy and other factors, making it the simplest theory that can accurately describe the universe.</p>



<p>Now, though, Riess’ Cepheid-based studies of the Hubble constant show that there’s still more to learn.</p>



<p>“This is a crack, or a surprise that doesn&#8217;t fit,” Riess says. “It&#8217;s left us more in a kind of confused or purgatory state.” The implication, he says, is “there&#8217;s a problem with the standard model. You can revise it, but we don&#8217;t know how to revise it, which direction or in what way.”</p>



<p>People shouldn’t mistake the tension over the Hubble tension as despair. “It&#8217;s more of an opportunity to learn something about the universe with these telescopes,” Riess says.</p>



<p>One possibility is completely new physics.</p>



<p>“If there&#8217;s new physics, that&#8217;d be fun,” Freedman says. “We&#8217;d all like to see something new and interesting&#8230;. Either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be an exciting result — either confirming the [standard] model or showing that there&#8217;s something still in the model that&#8217;s missing.”</p>

<p>Two anthropology organizations co-hosting a conference this fall have removed from the program a panel presentation entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel had been slated for the joint <a href="https://annualmeeting.americananthro.org/general-info/">annual meeting</a> of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA), to be held in Toronto in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">letter</a> informing the panelists of the decision, Ramona Pérez and Monica Heller, presidents of the AAA and CASCA, respectively, wrote that the executive boards of the two groups had reviewed the submission “at the request of numerous members” and decided to remove it from the conference program. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127933"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision was based on extensive consultation and was reached in the spirit of respect for our values, the safety and dignity of our members, and the scientific integrity of the program(me). The reason the session deserved further scrutiny was that the ideas were advanced in such a way as to cause harm to members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While there were those who disagree with this decision, we would hope they know their voice was heard and was very much a part of the conversation. It is our hope that we continue to work together so that we become stronger and more unified within each of our associations. Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pérez and Heller did not respond directly to our request for comment, but forwarded our message to an association spokesperson, who sent us a statement titled &#8220;<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">No Place For Transphobia in Anthropology</a>.&#8221; The association writes, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The function of the “gender critical” scholarship advocated in this session, like the function of the “race science” of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, is to advance a “scientific” reason to question the humanity of already marginalized groups of people, in this case, those who exist outside a strict and narrow sex / gender binary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The AAA/CASCA decision was a “shock,” according to an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">open letter</a> written by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/klowrey">Kathleen Lowrey</a>, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta who organized the panel, and her co-panelists. In the letter, they said none of the panelists had heard from AAA or CASCA with any concerns about the panel until the letter notifying them of the decision to cancel the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They defended the content of the panel against what they said was the “false accusation” the ideas were harmful. The letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Your suggestion that our panel would somehow compromise “&#8230;the scientific integrity of the programme” seems to us particularly egregious, as the decision to anathematize our panel looks very much like an anti-science response to a politicized lobbying campaign. Had our panel been allowed to go forward, we can assure you that lively contestation would have been welcomed by the panelists and may even have occurred between us, as our own political commitments are diverse. Instead, your letter expresses the alarming hope that the AAA and CASCA will become “more unified within each of our associations” to avoid future debates. Most disturbingly, following other organizations, such as the Society for American Archaeology, the AAA and CASCA have promised that “Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.” Anthropologists around the world will quite rightly find chilling this declaration of war on dissent and on scholarly controversy. It is a profound betrayal of the AAA’s principle of “advancing human understanding and applying this understanding to the world’s most pressing problems”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey’s directory page at the University of Alberta states the institution “has reacted <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/06/12/from-south-american-anthropology-to-gender-crit-cancel-culture-my-strange-feminist-journey/">punitively</a> to my outspoken criticisms of trans activism and gender ideology.” In 2020, Lowrey was removed from an administrative role as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology, <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions">which she attributed</a> to her views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us that several of the panelists had “spent quite a lot of money on travel arrangements, as the panel was accepted in July, and we were all stunned to receive the letter &#8220;removing&#8221; us on Monday.”</p>



<p>She said she was not aware of another instance when AAA or CASCA had removed a panel&nbsp; from the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us the implications of the cancellation were “quite unsettling”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The AAA is the largest professional association of anthropologists in the world, and the joint conference with CASCA (which happens every third year, I believe) is the Big Kahuna of anthropology conferences.&nbsp; I organized the panel in order to bring together two kinds of anthropologists concerned with the replacement of biological sex by &#8220;gender&#8221;:&nbsp; one the one hand, scholars like Elizabeth Weiss and Carole Hooven who have an interest in human evolution (for which sexual reproduction is a relevant process!) and on the other, scholars like Silvia Carrasco, Michele Sirois, and Kathleen Richardson who have an interest in feminist issues (for which sex based oppression is a relevant process!).&nbsp; I have interests in both domains, and thought it would be great to bring together scholars concerned for very different reasons with sex as a category of anthropological analysis in order to see where our concerns overlap and where they diverge.</p>



<p>I truly do not understand why anyone who disagrees with any of this wouldn&#8217;t simply turn up to the panel and engage us in discussion. That&#8217;s what conferences are for.&nbsp; I would be sincerely interested to hear AAA and CASCA representatives elaborate on why they think talking about biological sex is threatening and harmful to trans identified people or to what they term the &#8220;LGBTQI&#8221; community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">panel description</a> contained this summary:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While it has become increasingly common in anthropology and public life to substitute &#8216;sex&#8217; with &#8216;gender&#8217;, there are multiple domains of research in which biological sex remains irreplaceably relevant to anthropological analysis. Contesting the transition from sex to gender in anthropological scholarship deserves much more critical consideration than it has hitherto received in major diciplinary [sic] fora like AAA / CASCA. This diverse international panel brings together scholars from socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology who describe why in their work gender is not helpful and only sex will do. This is particularly the case when the work is concerned with equity and the deep analysis of power, and which has as an aim the achievement of genuine inclusivity. With research foci from hominin evolution to contemporary artificial intelligence, from the anthropology of education to the debates within contemporary feminism about surrogacy, panelists make the case that while not all anthropologists need to talk about sex, baby, some absolutely do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The rise in anthropology of multiple schools of thought that cannot withstand any scrutiny, any challenge, or even sustained contentious inquiry, is a growing disaster for the entire discipline.&nbsp; I feel like I&#8217;m trying to shout that the bridge is out ahead and no one is listening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very frustrating.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trilobite-fossil-hints-scavengers-ate">A one-of-a-kind trilobite fossil hints at what and how these creatures ate</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious, prehistoric marine creature has spilled its guts. For the first time, scientists have unearthed a fossilized trilobite whose final meals were preserved within its digestive system.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Valéria Vaškaninová and colleagues discovered the partially digested meals when they looked at a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06567-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-resolution 3-D scan of <em>Bohemolichas incola</em></a>, a previously known but relatively rare trilobite species that lived 465 million years ago. The contents include fragments of thin-walled shells, bits of echinoderms (a group that includes modern-day sea urchins and starfish), and other bottom-dwellers small enough to be swallowed whole, the researchers report online September 27 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Many of the more than 20,000 described species of trilobites, a group that existed between 520 million and 252 million years ago, were prominent members of marine ecosystems. Some species may have even had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-trilobites-sported-dual-digestive-tracts">dual digestive tracts</a>, though <em>B. incola</em> did not (<em>SN: 10/31/14</em>). The new find not only provides direct evidence of what some trilobites may have eaten, but it also hints about their physiology and how they foraged.</p>

<p>Tightly packed clumps of shelly bits throughout the tubelike gut suggest that the trilobite fed almost continuously before it died, perhaps by scavenging the seafloor for broken remains of shelled creatures and digesting the soft tissues still attached to them. Trilobites typically didn’t have sturdy mouthparts and thus wouldn’t have had a powerful bite, says Vaškaninová, of Charles University in Prague.</p>



<p>And since the calcium-rich shells in the gut show no signs of being dissolved, the trilobite probably had a gut environment with an alkaline or neutral pH, Vaškaninová and colleagues suggest. That sort of biochemistry would have reduced the amount of dissolved calcium entering its bloodstream, which would be metabolically difficult to get rid of, the team proposes.</p>



<p>In a small bit of turnabout-is-fair-play, the scan also revealed that <em>B. incola</em>’s carcass had been scavenged by other organisms before fossilizing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-falls-down-matter-einsteins-gravity">Antimatter falls like matter, upholding Einstein’s theory of gravity</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: Antimatter falls down, not up.</p>



<p>In a first-of-its-kind experiment, scientists dropped antihydrogen atoms and watched them fall, showing that gravity attracts antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</p>



<p>The study confirms a pillar of Einstein’s general theory of relativity known as the weak equivalence principle. According to that principle, gravity pulls on every object in the same way, no matter what it’s made of. “This concept is at the heart of our comprehension of gravitation,” says physicist Ruggero Caravita, who was not involved with the new work.</p>





<p>Antimatter is the mirror image of matter, carrying the opposite electric charge but the same mass. An electron’s antiparticle, for example, is a positively charged particle called a positron. A proton’s alter ego is a negatively charged antiproton, and so on.</p>



<p>Most physicists didn’t seriously entertain the idea that antimatter could fall up instead of down, says Jeffrey Hangst of Aarhus University in Denmark. But scientists had never been able to directly test it before. “Antimatter is kind of mysterious … so we want to actually confirm that behavior,” says Hangst, who is the spokesperson for the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus, or ALPHA, collaboration, which reported the new result.</p>



<p>Not only did <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06527-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the antimatter fall as expected</a>, but it also dropped with roughly the same acceleration as normal matter, the team found.</p>



<p>The results, described in the Sept. 28 <em>Nature</em>, showcase scientists’ growing control over antimatter, and antihydrogen in particular. Antimatter is a wily substance that can be difficult to work with. If it touches anything made of matter — the walls of a storage container or molecules of air — it quickly annihilates. It has taken decades of work to measure any effect of gravity on antimatter at all, Hangst says.</p>



<p>In the experiment, performed at the European laboratory CERN near Geneva, scientists trapped antihydrogen atoms with strong magnetic fields. Those antihydrogen atoms were made by mixing antiprotons, created at CERN, with positrons from a radioactive source.</p>



<p>The researchers then released the antihydrogen from its magnetic cage, counting how many atoms went up versus down. If gravity treats antimatter and matter equally, most atoms should fall down, with a few flying upward due to the initial jostling motions of the atoms. That’s just what the researchers found.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Just like matter, antimatter falls under gravity’s pull | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnDXj_5Cb0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Researchers contained antihydrogen atoms within the ALPHA-g apparatus using magnetic fields. The team measured how the atoms fell when they were released. As the antimatter escaped, it hit the walls of the apparatus and annihilated. The researchers counted how many atoms went up and down by detecting those annihilations, as depicted in this animation. Most atoms went down, confirming that gravity pulls antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s a very nice, very neat and very simple concept,” says theoretical physicist Yunhua Ding of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>To further confirm that the antihydrogen behaved as expected, the researchers altered the magnetic fields to push atoms upward, canceling out gravity’s effect. In that test, roughly equal numbers of atoms went up and down. Further varying the magnetic fields likewise matched expectations.</p>



<p>Previous experiments already hinted that gravity treats matter and antimatter the same. In 2022, the BASE experiment, also at CERN, reported that oscillations of confined antiprotons indirectly confirmed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiprotons-protons-matter-antimatter-differences-physics">matter and antimatter feel the same tug of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/22</em>). But ALPHA’s experiment is the first to directly observe antimatter particles falling.</p>





<p>The idea that different types of objects fall with the same acceleration far predates Einstein. Legend states that in the 16th century, Galileo dropped different objects off the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate this effect. Scientists have since tested it in a variety of situations, even with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">objects in orbit around Earth</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But they’d never done the test with antimatter until now.</p>



<p>Although physicists didn’t expect the antimatter to fall up, some researchers have proposed that antimatter may fall with a slightly different acceleration than normal matter. “If we find even the tiniest difference, this would be an indication that something new is happening,” says Caravita, of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Trento, Italy, who is the spokesperson of the AEgIS collaboration at CERN. AEgIS is one of a cadre of experiments there also working toward measuring gravity’s effect on antimatter.</p>



<p>The current experiment isn’t precise enough to suss out those subtle differences. But new techniques, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-cooled-antimatter-foundations-physics-einstein-gravity">cooling antihydrogen atoms with lasers</a>, could make future tests more precise (<em>SN: 4/5/21</em>). That could help scientists see, when it comes to matter and antimatter, whether gravity is truly agnostic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-ring-galaxies-eye-wallaby-space">This ‘polar ring’ galaxy looks like an eye. Others might be hiding in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s big. It’s beautiful. It looks a bit like a sparkly, starry, slightly smooshed Eye of Sauron.</p>



<p>It’s the galaxy NGC 4632, and new radio telescope images suggest that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/525/3/4663/7264229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it sports a rare “polar ring”</a> — a halo of mostly hydrogen gas tilted about 90 degrees from the plane of the galaxy’s disk.</p>



<p>These spectacular structures, which can also contain dust and stars, are thought to encircle only about 1 in 1,000 galaxies. But now it seems that many more — possibly 30 times as many — could be hiding in plain sight, researchers report in the November <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>





<p>“The implication would be that there are tons of these things out there, masquerading as normal galaxies,” says astronomer Ronald Buta of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Astronomers are still puzzling out how any galaxies have polar rings at all. But they’re thought to form as galaxies grow, either by colliding with other galaxies or by gobbling up gas.</p>



<p>“The rings give us clues about how [galaxies] can grow and evolve,” says astronomer Nathan Deg of Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston, Canada.</p>



<p>Deg and colleagues spotted the ringlike structure around NGC 4632 — and one encircling another galaxy, NGC 6156 — in data from the WALLABY survey, a project that is scanning half of the southern sky with the ASKAP radio telescope in Western Australia.</p>



<p>“It immediately strikes you that, hey, look, there&#8217;s something funny going on right here that kind of looks like a ring,” Deg says.</p>



<p>It can be tough to tell rings from warped galactic disks, depending on how galaxies are oriented with respect to Earth. So the team used virtual reality visualizations to help distinguish the galaxies’ disks from the potential rings, and compared the real data with simulated observations of perfect polar rings viewed at different angles.</p>



<p>The scientists report that the stunning structures sported by the two galaxies are indeed probably polar rings, with NGC 4632’s ring spanning roughly 60,000 light-years.</p>



<p>And these two may have plenty of company. The fact that the team has already spotted two potential polar rings in the 592 galaxies included in these first bits of WALLABY data suggests that earlier estimates of the frequency of such structures were too low.</p>



<p>The team’s simulations, which tested how polar ring galaxies look to telescopes when viewed at different angles, indicate a similar conclusion. Altogether, the observations and simulations suggest that as many as 3 percent of nearby galaxies could have overlooked rings, too.</p>



<p>A fruit of these combined efforts is a striking composite image of NGC 4632’s starry disk, viewed in visible light, and the radio glow of its hydrogen halo. Hydrogen emits mostly radio light, so the structure is invisible in visible-light images of the galaxy previously taken by the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. Larger telescopes taking closer looks, Deg says, might be able to spot stars in the halo too.</p>





<p>Thanks to large surveys like WALLABY, Deg says, “we&#8217;re in an era where we can discover these and figure out the rings in a way that we never could before.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The significant growth of genomic data and bioinformatics tools to analyze them has led, inevitably, to discussions around reproducibility and robustness of software.</p>
<p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p>
<blockquote><p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean</a> is one platform that can be used to peer review code.  It provides “compute capsules” for researchers to upload their code and reviewers to access anonymously to test it. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00388-w">A small cluster of Nature journals</a> have now integrated Code Ocean into their submission system.</p>
<p>However, is this welcomed in the computational science community? How do researchers feel about the peer review of code in general? After all, as we don’t ask reviewers to try and reproduce experimental results in the laboratory during manuscript assessment, so perhaps we shouldn’t ask them to test code either.</p>
<p>I reached out to a number of researchers that serve on the editorial board for the journal <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Bioinformatics</em></a> to find out, inviting them to share their views in response to a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on mandating the sharing of previously unreported code described in a manuscript submitted to a computational journal such as <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em>?</strong></p>
<p>There was a, possibly unsurprisingly, consensus that this was a good idea and that all authors should be required to deposit their code in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or similar platform.</p>
<p>Dimitris Polychronopoulos from Ochre Bio stated that, in his view,<em> “publishing previously unreported code in code repositories such as Github, Bitbucket or others is a prerequisite for any work that involves computational analyses.”</em></p>
<p>He then went on to explain that this was for two reasons – to <em>“ensure code reproducibility and code robustness for people running on different computer architectures”</em> and <em>“disseminate the work and potentially integrate findings generated from a pipeline to another under development, promoting this way scientific progress.”</em></p>
<p>Miha Moškon from the University of Ljubljana went one step further, mentioning the importance of documentation, <em>“ … a code published without a proper documentation is sometimes as useless as no code at all. The requirement to share the code should thus be complemented with the requirement to also document it appropriately.”</em></p>
<p>Timothy Shaw from the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute points out that it <em>“ … should be a priority of requiring authors to submit ready-to-run code, which should include examples of inputs and outputs.”</em>  Hence platforms such as Code Ocean of course, although interestingly all but one of my respondents hadn’t heard of it.</p>
<p>But were my respondents as keen on the actual process of testing code as part of the peer review process?  Did they see any benefit to it? I asked them.</p>
<p><strong>What might </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>advantages of peer review of code be?</strong></p>

<p>All respondents agreed that peer review would lead to improvements in the code prior to publication.</p>
<p>Bashar Ibrahim from the Gulf University for Science and Technology and University of Jena said that “<em>Peer review of code is a valuable practice in software development that enhances code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. It helps identify and address issues early, leading to more efficient development and better overall tools.”</em></p>
<p>Shaw stated that he <em>“personally benefitted from having users test our software.”</em></p>
<p>Johann Rohwer from Stellenbosch University was of a similar opinion but also cautioned that it may not be possible to inspect everything in detail if the code base is particularly large.</p>
<p>This statement lent itself nicely to my next question.</p>
<p><strong>Can you think of any disadvantages of including the assessment of code in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>As with the previous question, there was a general theme, that is, concerns focusing on finding peer reviewers that can test code and the additional time that may be required, which may lead to delays in publication.</p>
<p>Moškon, for example, stated that “<em>finding reviewers with appropriate expertise who are willing to provide timely reviews with high standard is already a challenging task, which editors are facing every day. And finding a reviewer who is competent in assessing, e.g., the biological significance of the results as well as the quality and reproducibility of the published code will sometimes be an impossible task.”</em></p>
<p>Anil Kesarwani from The Jackson Laboratory pointed out that <em>&#8220;reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available&#8221;</em> and that <em>&#8220;code review can be subjective as different reviewers may have varying opinions on code style and quality.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Boyang Ji from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, who was the one respondent that had any experience of using Code Ocean to peer review code, said <em>“usually I just have a look the core part of the algorithm part. For machine learning projects, I usually have a check to make sure the pipeline is as authors described in the manuscript. Usually, I cannot review the code line by line.”</em></p>
<p>So, perhaps using automated AI-tools such as ChatGPT can help solve the issues around additional resources needed to peer review code. I asked my respondents what they thought about this.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><strong>Anil Kesarwani, The Jackson Laboratory (USA)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What are you</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> views on using a ChatGPT tool to assess code automatically?</strong></p>
<p>Here, Ibrahim voiced the opinion shared by almost everyone:</p>
<p><em>“AI-based tools can be highly beneficial for improving code quality, and consistency. However, it is a valuable tool within the broader code review but not a complete replacement for human expertise. The best practice is to combine automated code assessments with regular human code reviews for code quality assurance.”</em></p>
<p>Jia Meng from Xi&#8217;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University was more cautious, stating that they were not convinced that ChatGPT is currently able to perform peer review of code well at present, but this might change in the future.</p>
<p>Polychronopoulos was particularly enthusiastic, stating “<em>I am a big fan. In my mind, assessing code can be largely broken down into two steps; first you check out the whole pipeline to familiarize yourself and get a general idea of what’s going on and then you delve into the specifics. I see ChatGPT being particularly useful at the first step.”</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you see the future of peer review of code?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, most respondents do feel that AI will have a role to play.</p>
<p>Ibrahim commented that <em>“Ultimately, the future of peer review of code review will be shaped by advances in AI, collaboration, and on improving code quality. Embracing these trends can help development teams deliver higher-quality software more efficiently.”</em></p>
<p>Moškon was a little more circumspect: “… <em>the future of peer review of code will rely on the automatic assessment tools. To what degree can we trust these tools is another question. Are we willing to transfer the peer review process to artificial intelligence?”</em></p>
<p>And Sri Krishna Subramanian from the Institute of Microbial Technology concludes the discussion with<em> &#8220;in the foreseeable future, I anticipate widespread adoption of code peer review as a standard practice across reputable journals in all major fields. The task is to find the sweet spot by balancing the integration of AI-driven tools for automated code evaluation, fostering community involvement for comprehensive code testing, and establishing standardized protocols. This approach should be complemented by the expertise of human reviewers to assess both the code and its accompanying manuscript, aligning with the principles of open science and adhering to ethical standards governing code and its associated data.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, in summary, what do the researchers I reached out to think about the future of peer view of code? In essence, it is laudable and something that should be considered essential when assessing papers describing computational research.  It should lead to higher quality and robust researcher-developed software and algorithms. There are some challenges, such as the difficulties in finding suitable reviewers and authors may have to wait longer for a decision, due to the time it takes to assess the code.  The advent of ChatGPT may, in part, be a solution to these, but it is important that human reviewers are still involved and gudelines incorporated to ensure that the peer review is suitably robust.</p>

<p>A new editor&#8217;s note in <em>Nature</em> highlights concerns about a paper by Google researchers who claimed computer chips designed in just a few hours using artificial intelligence beat chip plans that human experts took months to develop.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w#change-history">the note</a>, published September 20, the journal stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that the performance claims in this article have been called into question. The Editors are investigating these concerns, and, if appropriate, editorial action will be taken once this investigation is complete.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-127920"></span>



<p>The day after the editor’s note, <em>Nature</em> pulled an accompanying News &amp; Views <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01515-9">article extolling Google’s results</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01515-9#correction-0">retraction notice</a>, the article&#8217;s author, <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/people/faculty-profiles/andrew-b-kahng">Andrew B. Kahng</a> of the University of California, San Diego, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-design-controversy">who was also a reviewer</a> of the internet company&#8217;s research, had changed his assessment of the work following publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kahng was not available for an interview. A spokesperson for <em>Nature</em> told us the journal<em> </em>takes <em>&#8220;</em>all concerns raised about papers we have published seriously,&#8221; adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are currently assessing concerns that have been raised with us, but we cannot discuss the specifics of those concerns relating to any particular paper while such post-publication assessments are underway.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google&#8217;s paper, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w#change-history">A graph placement methodology for fast chip design</a>,&#8221; has been embroiled in controversy since it was published in 2021. It has been cited well over 100 times, but critics argue the article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09633">didn&#8217;t include enough detail</a> to allow others to vet the findings and say <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s decision to publish it <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/271439-more-details-but-not-enough/fulltext">was a mistake</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an effort to reproduce the results using reverse-engineering, Kahng and his colleagues found <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/271439-more-details-but-not-enough/fulltext">human experts typically beat Google&#8217;s machine-learning system</a>, as they reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11014">a preprint</a> published earlier this year. However, they had no way &#8220;to replicate the pre-training described in the Nature paper,&#8221; they wrote.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, a Google researcher who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html">fired after he questioned the paper in <em>Nature</em></a> alleged in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/satrajit_vs_google.pdf">lawsuit</a> earlier this year that the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; claims to have revolutionized chip layout using AI were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/27/google_ai_chip_paper_nature/">tied to efforts to commercialize its software</a>, as reported by <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company referred us to a statement issued earlier to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-brain-ai-researcher-fired-tension/"><em>Wired</em></a> by Zoubin Ghahrahmani, vice president at Google DeepMind:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We thoroughly vetted the original Nature paper and stand by the peer-reviewed results &#8212; the authors’ many contributions to chip design have already helped us design more energy-efficient and useful AI hardware. We&#8217;ve open-sourced this work for the external research community, and multiple teams continue to advance this important area of research.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/">Anna Goldie</a>, one of the corresponding authors of the paper and formerly a researcher at Google Brain, pointed us to <a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/home/statement">a statement</a> she issued in March with first author <a href="http://azaliamirhoseini.com/">Azalia Mirhoseini</a>, also a former Google researcher.</p>



<p>They noted, among other things:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our [reinforcement learning] method has been used in production for multiple generations of Google’s flagship AI accelerator (TPU), including the latest, and chips with layouts generated by our method have been manufactured and are currently running in Google datacenters.</p>



<p>Being physically manufactured at sub-10 nm is a level of validation that goes far beyond what is present in almost any paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair also took issue with Kahng&#8217;s preprint, which they said &#8220;mischaracterizes&#8221; their work for a number of reasons laid out in their statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; they added, &#8220;we believe that this is just the beginning and that learning-based methods for chip design will have profound impact on both hardware and machine learning itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bigfoot-loch-ness-monster-data-pseudoscience">Seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster? Data suggest the odds are low</a></h4>

              
                <p>There were drones, there were boats. There were spotters on land and a hydrophone listening for suspicious sounds underwater. In what may have been the biggest search of its kind in 50 years, crowds of people gathered this summer in Scotland to hunt for any sign of a legendary creature: the Loch Ness Monster.</p>



<p>Nearly 6,000 kilometers away, data scientist Floe Foxon emailed the event’s organizers and wished them good luck. “I’m sure it’s going to be a fun weekend,” he said. Foxon wasn’t joining them, but from his home office in Pittsburgh, he has examined Nessie’s lore in his own way — with statistics.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In July, Foxon published a study on <a href="https://xbio.jmir.org/2023/1/e49063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the probability of finding a giant eel in the loch</a>, one of many hypotheses for sightings of the storied sea monster. The answer: Essentially zero. Even the chances of finding a 1-meter-long eel are low, about 1 in 50,000, Foxon reported in <em>JMIRx Bio</em>. But once you get much longer than that — into monster-sized eel territory — the probability plummets.</p>



<p>But don’t call Foxon a myth buster or a debunker. “Absolutely not,” he says. “I think you should approach these things with an open mind and let the data influence your decision-making.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though monsters have captured Foxon’s imagination, his background is in physics, and by day, he’s a data analyst for a health consulting firm. In his free time, he flits through far-flung fields of science, including astronomy, paleontology and cryptology, the study of ciphers. “When you learn data science,” Foxon says, “you find that it can be applied to more or less anything.” Even monsters.</p>



<p>For his Nessie study, Foxon analyzed the mass distribution of eels caught in Loch Ness and other freshwater bodies in Europe. He converted that data to eel length and then calculated the odds of finding eels of different sizes. And in a separate monster study posted online July 20 at biorXiv.org, Foxon looked at data on Big Foot sightings and black bear populations across the United States and Canada. As <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.14.524058v4.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of black bears in a region goes up, Bigfoot sightings tend to increase as well</a>, he found. That doesn’t tell you whether Bigfoot is real, though, Foxon says. “You can’t answer that sort of question without a specimen.” Instead, he thinks about it from a probability standpoint. If you think you’ve seen a sasquatch, he says, it’s probably just a bear.</p>



<p>But people claiming glimpses of Bigfoot or other extraordinary beasts probably aren’t hoaxers, Foxon says. “Most people are very earnest and honest about having an experience that they personally cannot explain.” He thinks scientists should listen to them and take them seriously.</p>

This image depicts the purported creature from footage shot in 1967.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131689">Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin, Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Off the top of his head, Foxon can rattle off the names of supernatural attractions he’s visited around the world, from a museum of curiosities in London to the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Sutton, W. Va. He’s even been boating on Loch Ness (though no sign of Nessie).</p>



<p>Foxon considers his study of sea monsters, sasquatches and other mythical beings folk zoology. He describes the field as the intersection between zoology and indigenous knowledge of animals in folklore. Though Foxon’s work has roots in cryptozoology, which once used the tools of science to investigate mysterious animals, that field has since been “overrun by a lot of pseudoscience,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s not so much the monsters that pushed the field to the fringe, though. Foxon, for instance, investigates all sorts of cryptic creatures, including giant snakes and a hypothetical aquatic animal dubbed Champy, reported to live in North America’s Lake Champlain. But his quest for answers takes a strictly scientific tack that relies on established mathematical methods.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not what you study, it’s how you study it,” says Charles Paxton, a statistician and fish biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who has published papers on the Loch Ness Monster. Still, when people find out what Paxton studies, some assume he’s a pseudoscientist. “That’s quite frustrating, actually,” he says. “The methods of science can be more widely used than people might think.”</p>





<p>Foxon’s latest study, posted online August 8 at biorxiv.org, uses a statistical method to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.07.552261v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examine eyewitness sightings of a long extinct bird, the New Zealand moa (Dinornithiformes)</a>. Though scientists think the ostrichlike bird went extinct hundreds of years ago, people have reported seeing moa as recently as the 1990s. In an analysis that factored in the reliability of 97 separate moa sightings, Foxon estimated that moa probably were extinct by 1770.</p>



<p>“I’m greatly disappointed by all of my findings,” Foxon says with a laugh. “I really wish that there was a giant eel in Loch Ness,” or a hairy apelike monster in North America’s woods or moa living in modern times, he says. But “there seems to be a very, very low probability.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-renaming-magellanic-clouds">Astronomers call for renaming the Magellanic Clouds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Names have significance, especially when they’re written in the stars.</p>



<p>A group of astronomers is coalescing around an idea to rename two neighbors of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.</p>



<p>Named after explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the satellite galaxies are visible with the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere. But Magellan&#8217;s name is not fitting, astronomer Mia de los Reyes and colleagues argue. The leader of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-circling-globe-has-evolved-500-years-since-magellan-voyage">first expedition to successfully circle the globe</a>, Magellan enslaved and killed Indigenous people encountered on the voyage, which set out from Spain in 1519 (<em>SN: 9/17/19</em>).</p>





<p>“Because we’re naming things in the night sky, which belongs to everyone, we think that it’s important to have names that reflect all of humanity,” says de los Reyes, of Amherst College in Massachusetts. She <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls for the name change</a> in an opinion piece published September 12 in <em>Physics</em>. Magellan’s voyage helped pave the way for Spanish colonialism in South America, Guam and the Philippines, says de los Reyes, who is Filipino American. “Many people see Magellan as a villain in the Philippines.”</p>



<p>The Magellanic clouds loom large in the field of astronomy. They’re independent galaxies, but close enough that astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magellanic-clouds-star-formation-birth-galaxy">can observe the individual stars</a> within (<em>SN: 4/1/22</em>). “The Magellanic Clouds are this amazing laboratory for seeing things up close and personal,” says astronomer Sally Oey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, a supporter of the name change.</p>



<p>Magellan wasn’t an astronomer. The clouds were noted by a member of his expedition, but they were already well-known to many cultures in the Southern Hemisphere, and even to previous European explorers. “It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have them named after any one person, let alone a person who never actually studied them,” says astronomer Gurtina Besla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>The galaxies have been known scientifically by Magellan’s name <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since only the end of the 19th century</a> — well after Magellan’s voyage. That’s just a blip in the history of astronomy, the researchers argue.</p>



<p><a></a>More than 100 astronomers have expressed interest in the campaign, anchored by a core group of about 50, de los Reyes says. The group aims to bring the proposal to the International Astronomical Union, in hopes of eventually holding a vote on the name change. Other fields of science are undergoing similar debates, with groups of researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">pushing to revise offensive names for certain plants and animals</a>, for example (<em>SN: 8/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>The astronomers are now trying out new names.&nbsp; One popular suggestion is to call them the “Milky Clouds.” That would maintain the commonly used acronyms, LMC and SMC. And it would reflect the galaxies’ connection to something much bigger than any one person — the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/future-of-collaboration/">This Peer Review Week, PLOS looks ahead to a future of cooperation and collaboration at all levels of scholarship and scholarly communications</a></h4>

              
                <p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Peer Review Week 2023 will focus on Peer Review and the Future of Publishing. At PLOS, we envision a future in which researchers, institutions, and organizations collaborate fluidly across disciplines and distances. A future of team science, collaborative peer review, multidisciplinary research, and collaboration between researchers in different regions, institutions, and even with the public. We believe Openness and collaboration work hand-in-hand. By removing the walls around research we can improve equity and discoverability, facilitate connections that lead to more innovative approaches, accelerate discovery, and support rigor and reproducibility. The end result is better for science, and society.</p>



<p>And we&rsquo;re not alone. In celebration of Peer Review Week, we asked our community what they think about collaboration, community, and the future of publishing and peer review. Here is just a little of what they had to say.</p>



<h2>International collaboration is key to addressing big global challenges</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Many of the most significant challenges facing our planet&mdash;such as climate change, biodiversity decline, and land degradation/desertification&mdash;require that scientists from different countries work together collaboratively.&nbsp; As an example, COVID19 saw almost unprecedented levels of international scientific cooperation (often on very short and urgent timeframes), where scientists shared knowledge, data, and findings relevant to understanding and treating an emerging issue where we had very little information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>International cooperation amongst scientists remains no less urgent today, as we move towards critical points in our ability to provide the evidence to (hopefully) support real change and decision-making in addressing these challenges at the global level. This is, of course, a central driver of the efforts to achieve Open Science.&nbsp; In making scientific findings more accessible (and hopefully understandable) to a wider audience, we also hope to better support international scientific collaboration.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Transparent, collaborative peer review builds trust</h2>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been puzzled by the closed and opaque nature of peer review. If it serves as a community and public scrutiny mechanism, then why should it transpire in isolation, behind closed curtains?</p>



<p>I therefore greatly support experimentation with and evaluation of transparent, open and collaborative review models, which hold the potential to strengthen scholarly communication, fostering greater collegiality and fairness.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>When it comes to multidisciplinary research communication is key</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Working in multidisciplinary teams in biomedical research requires effective communication and bridging diverse perspectives, necessitating a deep understanding of each other&rsquo;s terminology. Harmonizing diverse voices and integrating varied viewpoints enables efficient project design, ensuring every piece contributes to the overarching aim.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Diverse perspectives generate stronger feedback and help us see our work in a new light</h2>



<p>&ldquo;There is no single good/best way to write. That&rsquo;s one principle we emphasize from the beginning, so we are effectively obligated to provide students with diverse writing coaches who come from different areas of science and who have different (sometimes strikingly different) habits and practices in writing. We all enjoy our collaboration very much, which is good because the retreat would be ineffective without that diversity.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Other researchers may have pieces of the puzzle you are trying to solve</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Mapping neural circuits requires a singular drive to complete a particular part of the brain you&rsquo;re focusing on. When done, you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised that your work is worth far more than expected. Turns out, neurons mapped by others elsewhere in the brain reach out and synapse with the ones you&rsquo;ve mapped. These synapses let you make sense of the structure of your neural circuits of interest&mdash;now you know its inputs and outputs&mdash;and enables others to likewise enrich their analysis. A huge win-win.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Collaboration isn&rsquo;t just useful for research&mdash;it helps in skills-building too</h2>



<p>&ldquo;[In our writing workshops] we intentionally create groups so that, as much as possible, people are working on similar things (manuscripts, grants, fellowships, job applications, etc.) and are from very different subdisciplines. There&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers what you do well when writing, and there&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers in different subdisciplines what might be confusing in your writing.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Researchers aren&rsquo;t the only ones</h2>



<p>Just like the researchers we serve, we&rsquo;re not doing it alone, but through collaboration with like-minded partners.

<p>Set to launch in Autumn 2023, <em>BMC Methods</em> will be the first Springer Nature open access, peer reviewed journal that will focus on providing updates in methods and lab protocols across various scientific disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, computational and biomedical sciences. In line with BMC’s ethos the journal will champion open science, supported by <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review </a>and <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/open-data">open data policies</a>.</p>
<p>In a world where innovation and transparency are paramount, <em>BMC Methods</em> will serve as a valuable resource for researchers who seek to enhance their experimental techniques, improve study reproducibility, and stay informed about the latest advancements in methodology.</p>
<blockquote><p>At <em>BMC Methods</em> our mission is clear: to facilitate the dissemination of experimental procedures, novel techniques, and innovative methodologies in the natural sciences field to elevate the quality and rigour of scientific research.</p></blockquote>
<p>The journal welcomes submissions of both lab protocols and methodology articles. We particularly welcome lab protocols that have a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive explanations for each step. We’re very happy to receive submissions with links to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or from pre-print servers. Our goal is to empower fellow researchers to replicate and build upon your work. As with other <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals">BMC Series journals</a>, <em>BMC Methods</em> does not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. However, submissions to <em>BMC Methods</em> should directly address questions within their respective disciplines as we want to publish methods that contribute to meaningful scientific advancements. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate their method&#8217;s performance compared to existing approaches to allow the scientific community to gauge the true impact and advantages of the work. We are open to manuscripts that explore the theoretical foundations of methods and propose enhancements or optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Join us on this exciting journey!</strong></p>
<p><em>BMC Methods</em> aspires to be more than just a journal; our goal is to build a community of scientists dedicated to advancing the scientific method. Efforts are now underway to recruit an international Editorial Board with broad and diverse expertise. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey towards greater transparency, reproducibility, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-infected-covid-19-exhale">Here’s how much coronavirus people infected with COVID-19 may exhale</a></h4>

              
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through the air. But just how much virus people breathe out over the course of infection isn’t well-defined.</p>



<p>To pin the numbers down, olfactory researcher Gregory Lane and colleagues analyzed over 300 breath samples from 43 people with COVID-19, following them for nearly three weeks. Levels varied between and within individuals, but some people shed a lot, releasing over 800 copies of viral RNA per minute at times.</p>



<p>On average, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participants breathed out 80 copies per minute</a> for a full eight days after symptoms began, the team reports September 8 in a preprint posted at medRxiv.org. Only after that point did the viral particles drop to nearly undetectable levels.</p>





<p>Lane, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, and colleagues still need to confirm what percentage of that exhaled viral RNA comes from viruses that can still replicate in another person’s body. And scientists don’t yet know how much virus is required for infection.</p>



<p>But, based on the new data, the team estimates that a high shedder could potentially exhale enough virus to infect someone in a closed space in about 20 seconds, making even elevator rides risky. With an average shedder, infection could take a little under four minutes.</p>



<p>The new study, which will be published in <em>eLife</em>, provides valuable information that both nasal swab studies and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-detect-coronavirus-air">one-time aerosol experiments</a> cannot, says infectious diseases researcher Kristen Coleman (<em>SN: 7/16/23</em>).&nbsp; Swabs sample only one part of the respiratory tract. And many aerosol experiments measure the amount of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">virus people spewed while talking, singing or reading aloud</a>, as well as while while breathing, at just a single point during infection <em>(SN: 08/17/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Lane’s team devised a simple and cheap tool — essentially a plastic mouthpiece attached to a closed tube — that participants took home with them and breathed into for 10 minutes at a time. That allowed the team to easily collect samples over an extended period of time and track how emissions changed during infection.&nbsp;But the makeshift tool lacks the precision of advanced machines in laboratories and hospitals, says Coleman, of the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. Even the spike of 876 viral RNA copies per minute seen in the new study may be an underestimate by several orders of magnitude, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, those who reported more severe symptoms tended to emit more virus. Yet even asymptomatic people or those with mild cases breathed out substantial amounts of viral RNA. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people exhaled similar levels.</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people who are mildly ill or asymptomatic isolate for at least five days and then mask for another five. Lane would offer different advice: “If my friends or family asked me, I’d say you should isolate through day eight.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541702899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Fragile Moment</a><br><em>Michael Mann</em><br><em>PublicAffairs, $30</em></p>



<p>Over four millennia ago, in the final days of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, a drought swept over the region, afflicting lands as far away as Greece and what’s now Pakistan. Probably driven by the eruption of a distant volcano, the drying climate devastated local agriculture. A contemporary text, <em>The Curse of Akkad</em>, noted that “the large arable tracts yielded no grain … the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, thick clouds did not rain.”</p>





<p>As once-prosperous farmlands collapsed in the northern part of the empire, people fled to the south. The southern Akkadians’ response? Build a more than 150-kilometer-long wall between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, barring entry to any migrants. Soon after, history’s first empire crumbled, dying of thirst in the cradle of civilization.</p>



<p>Climate systems and civilizations are stable only up to a point. In <em>Our Fragile Moment</em>, climate scientist Michael Mann reminds us that today we are pushing the limits of both.</p>



<p>In the book, Mann looks back at episodes of global climate change over the last 4.5 billion years, from eras of deadly heat to wastelands of widespread ice. With each instance, he draws out lessons about what happens to Earth in periods of changing climate. Sometimes, the result is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-activity-convicted-permian-extinction">dramatic mass extinctions</a> or geologic upheavals (<em>SN: 8/28/15</em>). Other times, as with the Akkadians, it’s societal collapse.</p>



<p>Earth’s climate system includes regulating forces that tend to buffer against small shifts in climate; ice caps and low clouds reflect sunlight and help cool the planet, for instance. But pushed too far, regulating forces can be overwhelmed, causing the climate to spiral out of control.</p>



<p>This was the case 55 million years ago. As a steady set of volcanic eruptions spewed carbon dioxide into the air, Earth warmed. The heat may have contributed to thinner and less reflective clouds. This in turn would have made the planet even hotter. Eventually, the low-lying clouds disappeared, and average global temperatures soared to 32° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit) in what is referred to as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eocene-temperature-spike-caused-half-much-co2-once-thought">Hothouse Earth</a> (<em>SN: 11/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>Today, with unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, we may face a similar, though less sweltering, spiral with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">disappearance of our reflective ice caps</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>But what makes current climate change different is its source — humankind — and our ability to stop it. This is a benefit that is unique to our changing climate. It comes with blame, but it also comes with agency.</p>



<p>That agency is an important source of hope for Mann. Melting ice caps could raise sea levels and displace some 40 percent of the global population. Rising <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">heat could make swaths of the planet uninhabitable</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/20</em>). But if we act, we can preserve a world that looks much like ours. The limit is not geologic or even technological, Mann argues; it is political.</p>



<p>Despite the far-reaching themes Mann weaves throughout the book, it may not be for everyone. There is a strong academic bend to the writing, which leans heavily on jargon. The book also features a dizzying parade of researchers, and Mann often emphasizes his connection to climate researchers and events, at one point reminiscing about how he “was known as a bit of a statistics guru.” The technical terms, acronyms, initialisms and self-referential tangents can distract from the book’s broader arguments and message.</p>



<p>Even though Mann’s dedication to precise academic language comes at the expense of some clarity, climate buffs will appreciate the deep dives into the scientific process. Many of the dense sections reward the reader with a satisfying tidbit of fascinating information or an illuminating insight. On occasion, I laughed out loud at Mann’s puns, jokes and barbs. (A reference to <em>The Princess Bride</em>’s ROUSs — Rodents of Unusual Size — landed particularly well.)</p>





<p>After journeying through the past, Mann brings us to the present and looks toward the future. Though past climates may offer lessons, those lessons only go so far. We are unlikely to bring about another Hothouse Earth, but the climate is warming faster than it has in millennia, thanks to human actions. If current climate policy holds, the best scientific predictions show things will be painful, but civilization won’t end. But climate scientists are not oracles. They can’t be sure. </p>



<p>That uncertainty, rather than being a cause for complacency, should spur us to action, Mann argues. “The impacts of climate change, no doubt, constitute an existential threat if we fail to act,” Mann concludes. “But we <em>can</em> act. Our fragile moment can still be preserved.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/code-policy-interview/">How does mandated code-sharing change peer review?</a></h4>

              
                <p>On March 31 2021, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new journal requirement: mandated code sharing. If the research process included the creation of custom code, the authors were required to make it available during the peer review assessment, and to make it public upon the publication of their research article&mdash;similar to the longstanding data sharing requirement for all PLOS journals. The aim, of course, is to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">improve reproducibility and increase understanding of research</a>.</p>



<p>At the end of the year-long trial period, code sharing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">had risen from 53% in 2019 to 87%</a> for 2021 articles submitted after the policy went into effect. Evidence in hand, the journal Editors-in-Chief decided to make code sharing a permanent feature of the journal. Today, the sharing rate is 96%.</p>

<p>In addition to increasing reproducibility, <em>Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s mandated code policy has had other, unexpected impacts on the journal process and publication stream. In advance of Peer Review Week we caught up with the senior editorial team, Editors-in-Chief Felim Mac Gabhann and Jason Papin, and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Virginia Pitzer to get their thoughts on the experience, and changes observed at the journal.</p>



<h6><strong>Please tell us a bit about </strong><strong><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></strong><strong> and your roles there.&nbsp;</strong></h6>

<p><em>Feilim</em>: <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>is a leading journal in the field of Computational Biology, both for sharing new research results and for describing and disseminating novel methods and software tools. In addition, our journal continues to be a leader in open science (OS), driven by our mission and by our community to, for example, increase the sharing of code used in the studies we publish. As Editors-in-Chief, we provide support and guidance for the editors, reviewers, and authors that make our journal possible. One of our roles is to nurture and broaden the best practices in our field so that the studies we publish can have the highest likelihood of re-use and reproducibility.</p>



<h6><strong>Why is OS/code sharing important to your journal specifically?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Code is an integral part of the research process for all those who publish in our journal and I would say increasingly integral to all research in biology. For research to truly be &ldquo;open&rdquo; and reproducible, we need to know how scientists arrive at the conclusions that are drawn, and where code is a necessary part of that research process, it becomes imperative that the code be shared to evaluate the results and subsequent conclusions.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: That&rsquo;s right, code is every bit as much a key research reagent as an antibody or plasmid would be for experimental work&mdash;and as a research reagent, it should be available for sharing, validation, and reuse. Other researchers should be able to trust it and be able to build upon it in future studies.</p>



<h6><strong>What are the implications of code sharing to the future of peer review?</strong>&nbsp;</h6>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="253" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21614" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1024x864.jpeg 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-768x648.jpeg 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1536x1295.jpeg 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-2048x1727.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Jason Papin, University of Virginia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Peer review will need to account for code as it does for all reported methods in a paper. Where reported research does not have proper experimental controls or an experimental design does not properly account for the key characteristics of a method, peer review becomes a necessary part of a process of correction and refinement. Similarly, as the code is evaluated during peer review, it can be corrected and refined in a way that improves the scientific contribution.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: Sharing can also potentially shorten the cycles of review&mdash;for example, where previously a reviewer might have to ask particular questions to probe methods, algorithms, parameters and more, now they can go directly to the code to find what they need and potentially even run the code themselves.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As code sharing becomes a standard part of the peer review process, it will enhance the reproducibility of computational biology research. If a reviewer finds they cannot understand or run the code underlying an analysis, it will compel the authors to be clearer in their approach and sharing of necessary resources.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you noticed any changes to how editors or reviewers handle peer review since code policies have been introduced? For example, has there been an increase in desk rejects?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Reviewers certainly are much more deliberate in judging whether there is sufficient code with the submission to reproduce the reported results, and editors will desk-reject papers when code is not provided. But most of the time when an editor or reviewer notes the absence of code, the authors are notified and can readily provide the requested code. I believe the code sharing policy is very much in the ethos of the journal and consequently rarely is the request a surprise to the authors.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: There has not been an increase in desk rejects, but rather an increased ability of the editors to require that code be shared before a manuscript moves forward; and an increased likelihood that authors think about this code sharing before submission. Most of our authors, as members of our Computational Biology community, are in favor of increased sharing and intend to share their code; having the requirement up front helps the authors to get this done earlier instead of relying on post-publication sharing.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you seen changes in behavior to the definition of authorship as a result, such as lab technicians or programmers who assist in cleaning up code receiving credit? Would you like to?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: We certainly encourage authorship to include all those who contributed to the study that is being published. We see the sharing of code, and improving code to increase re-use and reproducibility, as central to a good computational process and study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Pitzer-YSPH-headshot.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21617" width="220"><figcaption>Virginia Pitzer, Yale School of Public Health</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think at this point, most code is written by one of the lead authors, since it is integral to the analysis. But that may change as it becomes more common for labs to hire people who specialize in programming, and as increasingly diverse or complex datasets come into common use &ndash; this is particularly true for my own work in epidemiology.</p>



<h6><strong>What were the top lessons or surprises each of you learned in implementation among stakeholders?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: I think that the response to implementation shows that the requirement for code sharing really reflected the goals and interests of the authors, and that instituting the requirement just encouraged or facilitated the authors to follow through on what they already wanted and intended to do. The outcome has been a continued increase in code sharing, even above the already-high baseline of code sharing in our field.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think reviewers and editors have been nearly universally supportive of the policy. Authors have occasionally questioned aspects of the policy, but there are usually simple clarifications that assuage any concerns. For example, the journal helps authors navigate concerns around code sharing and protected intellectual property or code that involves protected health information.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think there is still quite a bit of variation in how in-depth reviewers will go in reviewing the code. But now at least most reviewers will check that the code is provided, whereas others may do a more thorough review and actually try to run the code.</p>



<h6><strong>Do you think Computational Biology&rsquo;s policy has influenced data/code sharing outside of PLOS? What would wider adoption of the policy look like to you?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As an author, I have become more conscientious about sharing my code regardless of what journal I am submitting to and whether or not they have a code-sharing requirement. I think others are also seeing this as a standard part of the publication process.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: While code has always been a key component of our journal&rsquo;s papers, in recent years we can see that codes, whether for data analysis, complex visualization, or other uses, has become a much more common part of papers in all areas of biology and other sciences. There is no reason that the policy would not benefit all fields just as it has ours. The hard part &ndash; writing the code &ndash; has already been done by the authors; and sharing code is now so easy through free publicly available websites. So wider adoption of this policy would benefit the reproducibility and reuse of code throughout science, without imposing substantial additional effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>What changes in a manuscript submission system (MSS) would facilitate better code sharing, and how might this be a barrier with our current publishing tools?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: It would be helpful if the MSS could have a required field in which authors provide the link to the code depository, rather than having this only included within the manuscript itself.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>As an evolving policy, where would you like code sharing to go &mdash; what are the next steps, or dream next steps, both for your journal and more widely?</strong>.</h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: The policy empowers the editors and reviewers to do what they already wanted to do, which is review code and encourage sharing of code. Moving the requirement up front in the review process is essential for adoption; a post-review requirement is simply too difficult and time consuming, and doesn&rsquo;t reflect the realities of our busy scientific lives.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think we would like to see the policy evolve to involve measures of reproducibility; there&rsquo;s a difference between sharing code and sharing code usable code, however the burden on the author to make it usable would likely be a limiting factor.&nbsp;</p>
