              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trauma-distorts-time-self-new-therapy">Trauma distorts our sense of time and self. A new therapy might help</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Trish Tran narrates her life in staccato notes.</p>



<p>“I remember carrying my little sister on my back because she’s too tired and walking through the huge sunflower fields … and me feeling so tired I didn’t think I could walk another step.”</p>



<p>“I remember being in a taxi with my mother, coming back to the man who had been violently abusive to all of us…. Her words to me were, ‘Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.’ ”</p>





<p>“I’m waiting at a train station … to meet my mother who I haven’t seen in many years…. Hours pass and eventually I try to call her … and she says to me, ‘I’m sorry, Trish. My neighbor was upset, and I needed to stay back with them.’ And her voice was slurring quite a lot, so I knew she had been drinking.”</p>



<p>Tran, who lives in Perth, Australia, is dispassionate as she describes a difficult childhood. Her account lacks what are generally considered classic signs of trauma: She makes no mention of flashbacks, appears to have a generally positive outlook and speaks with relative ease about distressing events. Yet she narrates her life growing up and living in the Australian Outback as a series of disconnected events; her life story lacks connective glue.</p>

TRAN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That disjointed style is not how people, at least people in the West, tend to talk about themselves, says psychologist Christin Camia. Autobiographical accounts, like any good narrative, typically contain a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">curation of key past experiences</a>, transitions linking those experiences and larger arcs about where life is headed. People use these stories to make sense of their lives, says Camia, of Zayed University’s Abu Dhabi campus in the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<p>But a growing body of evidence from fields as wide-ranging as psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy and literary studies suggests that, as with Tran, trauma can shatter the narrative coherence of one’s life. People lose the plot.</p>



<p>Life’s crises can trigger an existential crisis, Camia says. People think: “I don’t know who I am, and I don’t know where I go from here.”</p>





<p>One therapy now in testing aims to re-tether traumatized individuals to their mental timelines, or their sense of themselves as connected across past, present and future. The therapy focuses on the future, which once rife with possibilities now appears as a void. It asks: What would it take for someone like Tran, or anyone traumatized by war, abuse, mass shootings, the ongoing pandemic and other calamities, to flip their life script, to say that they know who they are and where they go from here?</p>



<h4>People maintain a sense of self across time</h4>



<p>In a nod to an established research approach, I have asked Tran to tell me her story in two parts. First, she should narrate seven snapshots of key moments in her life. Second, Tran, who is a lecturer on mental health recovery at Curtin University in Perth, should stitch those snapshots together to tell me how she became who she is today.</p>



<p>The first task comes easy. The second task eludes her. She switches to generalities. “I’ve always been a highly reflective person,” she says. “I’ve had to rely on my brains to keep myself and my family alive.”</p>



<p>I try to nudge her toward specifics, but her timeline disintegrates. She repeatedly attempted suicide. Her mother brought home many violent men.</p>



<p>The developer of this two-question approach, psychologist Tilmann Habermas, wasn’t focused on people who had experienced trauma. Habermas, now at Goethe University Frankfurt, wanted to understand how adolescents develop a narrative identity and then sustain that sense of self over time.</p>



<p>In 2003, Habermas launched a study that would follow participants for up to 16 years. Participants came into the lab every four years and dictated their life story in roughly 20-minute increments, using the two-task format I tried with Tran. Habermas analyzed the resulting transcripts line by line, coding them for emotion, tense, transitions and other features.</p>



<p>With few psychologists at the time studying autobiography as a window into the mind, Habermas turned to theorists from other fields for guidance. “After I read psychology, I read narratology, literary theory, linguistics, social linguistics,” he says. “I had to steal … all these concepts from the other areas.”</p>



<p>One of Habermas’ questions was how people retain their sense of self in the face of life’s many disturbances, such as divorce, illness, job loss or moving to a new location.</p>



<p>Philosophers have been puzzling over this question for millennia. “Your body has changed. Your experiences have changed. Your knowledge has changed. And yet, people generally think of themselves as being the same person … in the past and future,” says psychologist Yosef Sokol of Touro University in New York City. “That’s a hard problem.”</p>



<p>This general belief in self-continuity appears universal, even though how it is constructed may differ across cultures.</p>

<h3>An autobiographical outlook</h3>



<p>Autobiographical reasoning is a type of thinking that links the self across space and time. Below are three categories of this reasoning and example arguments for each.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: &#8220;After that I told myself, when I fall in love the next time, I must take care that school doesn&#8217;t suffer.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Developmental status</strong>: &#8220;At the time I wasn&#8217;t aware of any that, after all, I was still too young for that.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Formative experience</strong>: &#8220;My burnout has led me to no longer attach so much importance to money today.&#8221;</p>

</div>



<p>In the third wave of Habermas’ long-term study, when 150 participants were ages 16, 20, 28, 44 and 69, Habermas and Camia, who joined Habermas’ lab in 2009, also analyzed the transcripts for a type of thinking called autobiographical reasoning. This reasoning links the self across space and time.</p>



<p>“Autobiographical reasoning is this conscious reflection. How did my past impact me? How did I become the person I am today, and what does it mean for my future?” Camia says. Such reasoning tends to stem from change, she adds. “If there is perfect stability in life, you don’t do a lot of autobiographical reasoning … it’s the changes and the crises that compel meaning-making.”</p>



<p>The researchers divvied such reasoning into eight categories, such as turning points, lessons learned, generalized insights and using an event to explain a change in personality.</p>



<p>Participants also filled out two surveys. One survey summed up the number of big life changes experienced over the previous four years. The other gauged self-continuity, with participants rating the truth of statements such as, “When I look at pictures of myself four years back, it feels a little unfamiliar” and “I have the feeling that at the core I am the same person I was four years ago.”</p>



<p>Researchers then compared the three variables: autobiographical reasoning, levels of life change and sense of self-continuity. As expected, levels of autobiographical reasoning showed no discernible pattern among participants who experienced few changes in life, the team reported in 2015 in <em>Memory</em>.</p>



<p>But when the researchers zoomed in on the quarter of participants reporting the greatest level of change, more autobiographical reasoning <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24912017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came with higher levels of self-continuity</a>. “Constructing continuity in the life story buffers against the effect of change in your life,” Habermas says. Other teams have made similar findings.</p>

<h3>Finding life’s plot</h3>



<p>As part of a long-term study, participants shared their life stories in roughly 20-minute increments. Researchers analyzed those stories for autobiographical arguments — statements about how the past influences a person today. Among those who experienced the most life changes (quartile 4 in the chart), more autobiographical reasoning correlated with a greater sense of self-continuity.</p>

<p>Most disruptions, however, do not rise to the level of trauma — such as that experienced by Tran. Several years later, Camia would study how traumatic events, notably being forced to flee one’s home and the resulting isolation and bereavement, affect people’s sense of self.</p>



<h4>Trauma messes with our sense of time</h4>



<p>“What does war change first? <a href="https://lithub.com/poetry-after-bucha-serhiy-zhadan-on-ukraine-russia-and-the-demands-war-makes-of-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One’s sense of time</a>, one’s sense of space,” said Ukrainian writer Serhiy Zhadan in an October speech translated to English in the online magazine LitHub.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks from experience. But the idea that trauma disrupts time perception is also borne out by research. Researchers have found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> frequently dictate whether we experience time as passing fast or slow. And traumatic events, which come with intense emotions, can cause people to experience time in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00196/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow motion</a>, researchers reported in 2012 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>During a car accident, for instance, a person’s whole body is ready to act, says Marc Wittmann, a psychologist with the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany. “Your inner workings, your processing, is speeded up. Relative to that, your outside slows down.”</p>



<p>What’s more, says health psychologist Alison Holman of the University of California, Irvine, in that moment or moments of crisis, you do not think about the past or future. All that matters is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-living-distorts-time-sense">survival</a>.</p>



<p>Zhadan speaks directly to this idea in his speech: “People in a war-torn space try not to plan for the future or think too much about what the world will be like tomorrow. What’s happening to you here and now is all that matters, just the people and things that will be with you tomorrow morning — tops. That’s if you survive and wake up.”</p>



<p>That narrow focus can wreak havoc on mental health. “[When] that present moment is so intense that it sears into your mind … it may set up the likelihood that you will have a hard time moving past it,” Holman says. “The past never passes.”</p>



<p>Such breakdowns in time can show up in language, particularly among those most severely affected by trauma. For instance, Habermas and his team compared the speech patterns of 14&nbsp;women diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a singular shocking event, such as physical or sexual abuse, and 14 women without such a diagnosis. The women with PTSD used more <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-45140-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immersive language</a>. They quoted people directly and spoke of the past as if it was ongoing, says Habermas, who reported the findings in 2014. “Instead of saying, ‘He hit me,’ they would say, ‘He hits me.’ ”</p>



<p>This immersive language dominates Tran’s narration. She is “carrying” her little sister. Her mother is “coming” back to the violent man. She is “walking many kilometers to school in the rain and then opening up my newspaper-wrapped wet and warm tomato sandwiches. They’re so wet, but I’m so hungry that I know I have to eat them otherwise I’ll never make the walk back.”</p>



<p>And always there, her mother’s voice: “Just trust me, Trish. Just trust me.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think I will ever forget those words,” Tran says.</p>



<h4>Traumatized people can lose their life story</h4>



<p>Tran remembers her mother’s words exactly, but other details of the abuse she experienced as a child are fuzzier. That’s common among people who experience trauma. People with trauma “have both an excess and depletion of memory,” says cognitive neuroscientist Elisa Ciaramelli of the University of Bologna in Italy.</p>



<p>How <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624707/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory changes among trauma survivors</a> remains controversial, write the authors of a 2021 opinion piece in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. But mounting evidence suggests that people tend to remember stressful memories in detail. As the mind fixates on those traumatic memories, memories unrelated to the trauma seem to fade, while new memories fail to register.</p>



<p>For example, when asked to describe memories associated with a specific word, such as “beach,” people who do not have PTSD offer detailed reports, describing what they were wearing, what they said and who they were with, Ciaramelli says. People who have PTSD, on the other hand, typically provide general memories with little color.</p>



<p>Other memories can’t find a foothold. In one study, researchers asked 52 participants — 26 people with PTSD and 26 people who had experienced trauma but not developed PTSD — to keep a diary recording their memories over the course of a week. Participants also responded to questions about the memory, such as whether or not it related to their trauma, how central it was to their current life and how far away in time the memory felt.</p>



<p>Participants without PTSD recorded an average of 21.4 memories across the week while participants with PTSD recorded an average of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5528199/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 11 memories</a>, the team reported in 2017 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>. The PTSD participants had more trauma-related memories than the non-PTSD group.</p>



<p>Tran recognizes this paucity of detail in her own life story. “My memories are lightbulb memories,” she says. “They are always attached to significant events like trauma or happy times. I may have 57&nbsp;years of life, but you could truncate them into a chapter.”</p>



<p>Everyone’s memory has imprecision of course. That imprecision allows us to cut extraneous details and make sense of our story. The traumatized person’s relative lack of memories, though, both in clarity and quantity, means they struggle to construct a cohesive narrative of their past and to envision themselves moving forward.</p>



<p>“Ten years ago, people have found that the same brain regions that are activated and are necessary for remembering the past are also necessary to imagine the future,” Ciaramelli says. “We need memories to imagine the future.”</p>



<p>Camia’s work with refugees shows what can happen to the sense of self as people struggle and fail to reconcile a traumatic experience with the larger story of their life. Her central aim, which built on work with Habermas, was to see if the same autobiographical arguments people used to buffer against life’s everyday changes could help those facing traumatic disruptions. She and Rida Zafar, a psychology student at New York University Abu Dhabi, recruited 31 refugees living in Germany and asked them to narrate their life stories, plus fill out the life change and self-continuity surveys used in the 2015 study.</p>



<p>Among the 16 refugees who experienced relatively less change since arriving in Germany, such as fewer upheavals in relationships and fewer moves, more autobiographical reasoning did correlate with higher self-continuity, the team reported in 2021 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. Refugees who experienced high change also used autobiographical reasoning, but their sense of self-continuity remained low.</p>



<p>These individuals cannot settle their trauma, Camia explains, so their reckoning with the past leads not to resolution but <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.618343/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumination</a>. They are stuck.</p>



<h4>Therapy could restore the future self</h4>



<p>For most of her adult life, Tran grappled with that sense of stagnation. “My identity was rooted in the past, and I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “Time was this eternal loop. Every time a problem came up, it felt like a replication of a past problem. I couldn’t see that I could change anything.”</p>



<p>Over and over again, unable to envision a viable escape, Tran tried to kill herself.</p>



<p>Suicide attempts serve as the clearest signal that a person’s future has gone blank, says Sokol, the psychologist at Touro University. The thinking here is intuitive. “If you think you have a meaningful life into the future, you’re not going to kill yourself,” he says.</p>



<p>Conventional therapies for treating people struggling with suicidal thinking often fail to meet their needs because the therapies do not directly address <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397785/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people’s future self</a>, Sokol and his team wrote in 2021 in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy</em>. For instance, dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes focusing on the present to cope with stress and manage emotions. Narrative therapy likewise aims to help patients incorporate traumatic and other events into a continuous timeline, but focuses on linking past to present, not present to future.</p>



<p>So Sokol developed a therapy that incorporates elements of past- and present-oriented treatments but prioritizes future thinking. It’s known as continuous identity cognitive therapy. His goal is to help military veterans struggling with mental illness re-create the plot in the mental timeline of their lives, to answer those foundational questions: Who am I? Where do I go from here?</p>



<p>Sokol tested an initial version of the therapy in a four-week pilot study with 17 veterans. The program contains many work-arounds for participants struggling to access or make sense of their memories. The specific memory is less important than the larger story, or the broader values contained within that memory, Sokol says. “I have all sorts of techniques to help people tap into something that they find important, meaningful.”</p>



<p>In the first week, participants are asked to define their core values. The hope is that those values, rather than specific past events, will form the core of a person’s life story. To get to that core, participants review negative and positive experiences from their past and identify choices they made.</p>



<p>Many veterans struggle with what are called moral injuries — choices they made that don’t seem to align with who they wish to be, Sokol says. So veterans push those memories away. With the values approach, he hopes participants can start to see that they made the best choices they could under challenging circumstances. One way to access those values is to have participants identify people they admire, and the values those people embody. Participants can then use those people’s experiences to identify their own core values.</p>



<p>The focus of the second week shifts to the future. Participants assemble possible futures by reflecting on how life might play out if they work with, or against, their stated values. Participants also actively construct self-continuity. For instance, they write letters to themselves across different time points, such as from their present self to their future self or vice versa.</p>



<p>In week three, participants learn to differentiate between external life stories, the series of events outside their control, and internal life stories made up of choices in line with their stated values. By week four, participants should be able to visualize their future self overcoming an issue that their present self faces.</p>

<h3>Thinking of the future</h3>



<p>In a small pilot study with veterans, a new treatment for mental illness that focuses on future thinking, called continuous identity cognitive therapy, appeared to decrease levels of suicidal ideation and depression.</p>

<p>Tran came across Sokol’s research while embarking on her own journey to healing. That process began when Tran realized how her trauma was hurting the people she loved most. “I’m just causing my children and everybody near and dear trauma. I’m going to take [suicide] off the table,” she eventually realized. “This is not my pathway anymore. If it’s not my pathway, what am I going to do with the next 50 years of my life?”</p>



<p>Tran felt lost. So she dug into research on trauma survivors, eventually stumbling upon Sokol’s project. She was moved by the idea that participants did not have to reconstruct the past to build a new future. “This is true. My soul knows this to be true,” she remembers thinking.</p>



<p>Tran, who is also a trainer with DISCHARGED, a nonprofit organization that provides peer group support for people experiencing suicidal thoughts, and an occasional adviser to researchers writing about suicide, reached out to Sokol and offered to help him make the language used in his program more sensitive to people who have experienced trauma. For instance, she suggested changing references to “you” to “we” to give people a greater sense of belonging and agency. The two still work together.</p>



<p>Research on the therapy remains limited to Sokol’s lab, but initial results are promising. The pilot study showed that the program decreased previously reported levels of suicidal ideation and depression. Those levels stayed low one month after completion. Now Sokol has received a five-year, $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to scale up the program and eventually roll out a randomized controlled trial. In its newer iteration, the program will run for three months instead of one.</p>



<p>With input from Tran and veterans in the program, Sokol made another substantial modification to the pilot program. Participants will now identify how their own story intersects with the stories of other people in their lives. That addition makes sense to Tran, who has become engrossed in research showing the intergenerational nature of trauma. She now sees her life as part of a larger story with many characters, each on their own often troubled journey.</p>



<p>She says her story will always be truncated. But even without a clean narrative arc, she has managed to sever time’s eternal loop. “You can change your relationship with your past experiences in a way that makes living a future possible,” Tran says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-biomaterial-heals-heart-attack-damage">A new biomaterial heals heart attack damage in animals. Humans could be next</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new biomaterial delivered to the heart soon after a heart attack can heal damaged tissue from the inside out.</p>



<p>Heart attacks kill cardiac muscle tissue, scarring the heart and leaving permanent damage after just six hours. The damage prevents the heart from functioning properly. If there was a way to begin healing damaged tissue soon after a heart attack, doctors could prevent scar tissue from developing.</p>



<p>“In an ideal world, you treat a patient immediately when they’re having a heart attack to try to salvage some of the tissue and promote regeneration,” says Karen Christman, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego.</p>





<p>The pursuit of this ideal inspired Christman, along with a team of researchers, to develop the biomaterial. In rodents and pigs, it<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00964-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> appears to repair tissue damage and reduce inflammation directly after a heart attack</a>, Christman and colleagues report December 29 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p><a></a>“I think it has a lot of potential,” Vimala Bharadwaj, a biomedical scientist at Stanford University who was not involved in the research. The paper&nbsp; “is definitely good proof of concept for what they’re trying to do.”</p>



<p>Previously, researchers found that<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-fat-mend-bone-cartilage-muscle-and-even-heart"> stem cells derived from body fat can be used to heal bones, muscles and the heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/9/16</em>). Christman wanted to work with the extracellular matrix, the lattice of proteins that provide structural support to the cells in cardiac muscle tissue. Like stems cells, it has regenerative abilities but is much less expensive, she says.</p>



<p>In 2009, Christman’s team produced a hydrogel using particles from this matrix. Trials in rats and later in humans showed that the material bonded to damaged areas and promoted cell repair and growth. However, due to relatively large particles of the hydrogel, it could be delivered to the heart only via a needle.</p>



<p>“Poking the heart with a needle could set off an arrhythmia,” says Christman. To use this treatment, doctors would need to wait a few weeks until the heart is more stable and the chance of these irregular heartbeats decreases. And that would be too late to prevent scarring.</p>



<p>The team took the previously created hydrogel, sifted out the larger particles with a centrifuge so only nanoparticles remained, and added water to dilute the mixture. That created a material thin enough to deliver to heart blood vessels intravenously.</p>





<p>Based on the nanoparticles&#8217; size, the team expected the mixture would slip through any gaps in cardiac blood vessels caused by the heart attack and adhere to the surrounding tissue. Once there, it would create a protective barrier while the heart healed. </p>



<p>Instead, animal experiments showed that the extracellular matrix material bound to the leaky vessels, preventing some inflammatory cells from moving into the heart tissue in the first place and causing further damage. The material reduced inflammation in the heart and stimulated the healing process by encouraging cell growth, the team reports.</p>



<p>Further safety studies will be needed to get the biomaterial ready for clinical trials. The first trial in humans will most likely be for repairing cardiac tissue post–heart attack. “A lot of my motivation is moving things out of the lab, actually into the real world,” Christman says.</p>



<p>Another real-world application of the biomaterial could be treatment for leaky blood vessels in other hard-to-access organs, including in the brain after a traumatic injury, Christman notes.</p>



<p>While Bharadwaj finds that application potentially promising, she says tests are needed to see whether the biomaterial improves headaches and cognitive or memory deficits in the brain after a traumatic injury. That’s needed to gauge whether it really is an effective TBI treatment.</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission? We recently launched the </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em></p>



<p>Certain legitimate journal types are particularly susceptible to hijacking, including niche or trade journals published in English or local languages, print-only journals, and journals indexed in international databases like Web of Science or Scopus. Hijackers typically avoid journals from big,<s> </s>reputable publishers such as Springer, Wiley, and Elsevier. </p>



<p>As a result, multiple networks of hijacked journals created by different cybercriminals target the same legitimate journals, potentially causing the same legitimate journals to have multiple clone websites.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a> contains a few examples of journals that have been hijacked twice, such as&nbsp; the journal <em>Gorteria</em> (ISSN 0017-2294)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But hijackers have created at least five clone websites for <a href="http://thejossgroup.com/newsletters/">the <em>Seybold Report</em></a>, a trade publication focused on graphic arts technology. The <a href="https://seyboldjournal.com/">first clone</a> website was created in 2020 by an Indian network and continued to deceive scholars until 2021. The content of the hijacked journal ended up in Scopus, similar to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/12/meet-the-hijacked-journal-that-keeps-rising-from-the-ashes/">other</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/26/how-hijacked-journals-keep-fooling-one-of-the-worlds-leading-databases/">cases</a> of hijacked journals. That clone website has since been deactivated and Scopus has deleted the unauthorized content.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3joqO2oAGS7k3YL_jj7NCuIP5XB-DsJ6Odi1mvFIiPBmkCvXj8XNs5fTvV_2AhDi62GYID0zQ7D0IisxyqYitcuSaig4N42ZT6f2LtisbWrLssjwTiyjqdrkZWxUNGL0ALWV4t6tT-KPeAKEnsJdrM0" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Unauthorized content from a hijacked journal Seybold in Scopus</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2022, at least four other websites cloning the <em>Seybold Report</em> were registered. It appears that at least two of these websites were created by the same fraudulent publishers, as their contact addresses are identical.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Date of registration</td><td>Editorial board</td><td>Contact email</td><td>Journal warning</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreport.net</td><td>03 March 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.org, seybold-report.com</td><td>info@seyboldreport.net</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.org to be fake</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreports.org</td><td>28 Apr 2022</td><td>Not available</td><td>editor@seyboldreport.org</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>seyboldreport.org</td><td>5 May 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.net, seybold-report.com</td><td>editor@seyboldreport.org</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.net to be fake</td></tr><tr><td>seybold-report.com&nbsp;</td><td>23 Dec 2022</td><td>Identical to seyboldreport.org, seyboldreport.net</td><td>editor@seybold-report.com</td><td>Accuse seyboldreport.org and seyboldreport.net to be fake</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Various clone websites of Seybold Report</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Three clone websites share identical editorial boards that include the names of prominent scholars without their permission. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/d/jonathan-dingel">Jonathan Dingel</a>, an associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is <a href="https://seyboldreport.net/Editorial%20Board.html">listed as</a> editor-in-chief of a hijacked <em>Seybold Report,</em> but confirmed that he has nothing to do with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, three of the newly created clones are accusing each other of being fake and claiming to be the original journal. It is unclear whether these three clones were created by two or three different networks of hijackers, or if this is just a marketing ploy of a single fraudulent publisher.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7VW8-1dP4Sjm6exEtPCZWdrhhdmR3K_7dQWCx6C1d6BIK1L2TE0l4E68QygtduSZCcX2iG3iylMTHSiuYsqP6gxfwiSPJpiWB_AA9H2QwStLKBLM95QjWTpaOeogxpTsAEYvEZRi391Fu_MPFk-IrZo" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The clone website seyboldreport.net alerts users that the website seyboldreport.org is fake</figcaption></figure>



<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">one of us tweeted</a> about the fraudsters accusing each other of being frauds, we found <a href="https://twitter.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1610216468943364098">&nbsp;</a>even more cloned versions.&nbsp;For those who know the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/MAHC.2019.2926975">history of the journal</a>, how the original journal looks (such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recent-issue-seybold-report-molly-joss">this example</a> from 2015), and&nbsp;its purpose as a trade publication instead of a scientific journal, then the fraud is pretty obvious. But the hijackers accusing each other of fraud is next-level deception.</p>

<p><strong>The chances of contacting</strong> <strong>extraterrestrial civilizations seem poor</strong> – <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chances-contacting-extraterrestrial-civilizations-seem-poor">Science News</a></em>, February 24, 1973</p>



<p>The possibility of life … on other planets has stimulated many people’s i­maginations…. In the Feb. 9 <em>Nature</em>, James&nbsp;C.&nbsp;G. Walker of Yale University studies the possible parameters of such a search and comes to some pessimistic conclusions.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Walker estimated it could take 1,400 to 14 million years to contact E.T. with the available technology. That’s way longer than researchers have spent listening for alien radio signals and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">scouring the sky with telescopes and satellites</a> (<em>SN: 11/21/20, p. 18</em>).</p>





<p>Despite the silence, scientists have sent their own messages into the void. In 1974, Earth sent a string of binary code from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Years later, arguably the most famous message — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/world-record">the Golden Record</a> — made its way to space aboard NASA spacecraft (<em>SN: 8/20/77, p. 124</em>).</p>



<p>If aliens ever reach out, they may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">send quantum dispatches</a>, scientists say (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p.&nbsp;5</em>). Even so, the aliens are likely so far from Earth that their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drake-equation-alien-extraterrestrial-civilizations">civilization will have collapsed</a> by the time we get the message (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 9</em>).</p>

                <p>For the first time, researchers have harnessed the body’s own chemistry to “grow” electrodes inside the tissues of living fish, blurring the boundary between biology and machines.</p>



<p>The technique uses the body’s sugars to turn an injected gel into a flexible electrode without damaging tissues, experiments show. Zebrafish with these <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electrodes grown in their brains, hearts and tail fins</a> showed no signs of ill effects, and ones tested in leeches successfully stimulated a nerve, researchers report in the Feb. 24 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Someday, these electrodes could be useful for applications ranging from studying how biological systems work to improving human-machine interfaces. They also could be used in “bioelectronic medicine,” such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">brain stimulation therapies for depression</a>, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>Soft electronics aim to bridge the gap between soft, curvy biology and electronic hardware. But these electronics typically still must carry certain parts that can be prone to cracks and other issues, and inserting these devices inevitably causes damage to tissues.</p>



<p>“All the devices we have made, even though we have made them flexible, to make them more soft, when we introduce them, there will still be a scar. It’s like sticking a knife into the organ,” says Magnus Berggren, a materials scientist at Linköping University in Sweden. That scarring and inflammation can degrade electrode performance over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous efforts to grow soft electronics inside tissues have drawbacks. One approach uses electrical or chemical signals to power the transformation from chemical soup to conducting electrodes, but these zaps also cause damage. A 2020 study got around this problem by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay4866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically modifying cells in worms to produce an engineered enzyme</a> that does the job, but the new method achieves its results without genetic alterations.</p>



<p>Berggren and colleagues’ electrodes instead exploit a natural energy source already present in the body: sugars. The gel cocktail contains molecules called oxidases that react with the sugars — glucose or lactate — to produce hydrogen peroxide. That then activates another ingredient in the cocktail, an enzyme called hydrogen peroxidase, which is the catalyst needed to transform the gel into a conducting electrode.</p>



<p>“The approach leverages elegant chemistry to overcome many of the technical challenges,” says biomedical engineer Christopher Bettinger of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To test the technique, the researchers injected the cocktail into the brains, hearts and tail fins of transparent zebrafish. The gel turns blue when it becomes conductive, giving a visual readout of its success.</p>





<p>“The beautiful thing is you can see it: The zebrafishes’ tail changes color, and we know that blue indicates a conducting polymer,” says materials scientist Xenofon Strakosas, also of Linköping University. “The first time I saw it, I thought ‘Wow, it’s really working!’”</p>



<p>The fish appeared to suffer no ill effects, and the researchers saw no evidence of tissue damage. In partially dissected leeches, the team showed that delivering a current to a nerve via a soft electrode could induce muscle contractions. Ultimately, devices like this could be paired with various wireless technologies in development.</p>



<p>Long-term implant performance remains to be determined, however. “The demonstrations are impressive,” Bettinger says. “What remains to be seen is the stability of the electrode.” Over time, substances in the body could react with the electrode materials, degrading it or even producing toxic substances.</p>



<p>The team still needs to refine how precisely the electrodes can stimulate nerves, says chemical engineer Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, who was not involved in the work. She and colleagues developed the way to “grow” electrical components using genetic modifications. Ensuring stimulation is concentrated where it’s needed for a treatment, while preventing the leakage of current to unwanted regions will be important, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, the relative abundance of different sugars in different tissues determines exactly where electrodes form. But in the future, a component of the main ingredient could be swapped out for elements that attach to specific bits of biology to make targeting much more precise, Berggren says. “We’re conducting experiments right now where we’re trying to bind these materials directly on individual cells.” Notes Strakosas: “There are some applications where precision is really important; that’s where we have to invest effort.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-star-formation-astronomy">The Milky Way may be spawning many more stars than astronomers had thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way is churning out far more stars than previously thought, according to a new estimate of its star formation rate.</p>



<p>Gamma rays from aluminum-26, a radioactive isotope that arises primarily from massive stars, reveal that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Milky Way converts four to eight solar masses of interstellar gas and dust into new stars each year</a>, researchers report in work submitted to arXiv.org on January 24. That range is two to four times the conventional estimate and corresponds to an annual birthrate in our galaxy of about 10 to 20 stars, because most stars are less massive than the sun.</p>





<p>At this rate, every million years — a blink of the eye in astronomical terms — our galaxy spawns 10 million to 20 million new stars. That’s enough to fill roughly 10,000 star clusters like the beautiful Pleiades cluster in the constellation Taurus. In contrast, many galaxies, including most of the ones that orbit the Milky Way, make no new stars at all.</p>



<p>“The star formation rate is very important to understand for galaxy evolution,” says Thomas Siegert, an astrophysicist at the University of Würzburg in Germany. The more stars a galaxy makes, the faster it enriches itself with oxygen, iron and the other elements that stars create. Those elements then alter star-making gas clouds and can change the relative number of large and small stars that the gas clouds form.</p>



<p>Siegert and his colleagues studied the observed intensity and spatial distribution of emission from aluminum-26 in our galaxy. A massive star creates this isotope during both life and death. During its life, the star blows the aluminum into space via a strong wind. If the star explodes when it dies, the resulting supernova forges more. The isotope, with a half-life of 700,000 years, decays and gives off gamma rays.</p>



<p>Like X-rays, and unlike visible light, gamma rays penetrate the dust that cloaks the youngest stars. “We’re looking through the entire galaxy,” Siegert says. “We’re not X-raying it; here we’re gamma-raying it.”</p>



<p>The more stars our galaxy spawns, the more gamma rays emerge. The best match with the observations, the researchers find, is a star formation rate of four to eight solar masses a year. That is much higher than <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/197/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the standard estimate for the Milky Way of about two solar masses a year</a>.</p>



<p>The revised rate is very realistic, says Pavel Kroupa, an astronomer at the University of Bonn in Germany who was not involved in the work. “I’m very impressed by the detailed modeling of how they account for the star formation process,” he says. “It’s a very beautiful work. I can see some ways of improving it, but this is really a major step in the absolutely correct direction.”</p>



<p>Siegert cautions that it is difficult to tell how far the gamma rays have traveled before reaching us. In particular, if some of the observed emission arises nearby — within just a few hundred light-years of us — then the galaxy has less aluminum-26 than the researchers have calculated, which means the star formation rate is on the lower side of the new estimate. Still, he says it’s unlikely to be as low as the standard two solar masses per year.</p>





<p>In any event, the Milky Way is the most vigorous star creator in a collection of more than 100 nearby galaxies called the Local Group. The largest Local Group galaxy, Andromeda, converts only a fraction of a solar mass of gas and dust into new stars a year. Among Local Group galaxies, the Milky Way ranks second in size, but its high star formation rate means that we definitely try a lot harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/standard-model-particle-physics">The standard model of particle physics passed one of its strictest tests yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>No one has ever probed a particle more stringently than this.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, scientists measured a magnetic property of the electron more carefully than ever before, making the most precise measurement of any property of an elementary particle, ever. Known as the electron magnetic moment, it’s a measure of the strength of the magnetic field carried by the particle.</p>



<p>That property is predicted by the standard model of particle physics, the theory that describes particles and forces on a subatomic level. In fact, it’s the most precise prediction made by that theory.</p>





<p>By comparing the new ultraprecise measurement and the prediction, scientists gave the theory one of its strictest tests yet. The new measurement <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.071801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agrees with the standard model’s prediction</a> to about 1 part in a trillion, or 0.1 billionths of a percent, physicists report in the February 17 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>When a theory makes a prediction at high precision, it’s like a physicist’s Bat Signal, calling out for researchers to test it. “It’s irresistible to some of us,” says physicist Gerald Gabrielse of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>To measure the magnetic moment, Gabrielse and colleagues studied a single electron for months on end, trapping it in a magnetic field and observing how it responded when tweaked with microwaves. The team determined the electron magnetic moment to 0.13 parts per trillion, or 0.000000000013 percent.</p>



<p>A measurement that exacting is a complicated task. “It’s so challenging that nobody except the Gabrielse team dares to do it,” says physicist Holger Müller of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline.jpg" alt="A team of physicists stand behind their experimental apparatus which captured a single electron in a trap." class="wp-image-3121888" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021323_ec_electron-magnetism_inline-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121888">A team of physicists (pictured) captured a single electron in a trap (experimental apparatus shown) and studied it for months to measure a property called the electron magnetic moment.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121888">Laura Nevins</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The new result is more than twice as precise as the previous measurement, which stood for over 14 years, and which was also made by Gabrielse’s team. Now the researchers have finally outdone themselves. “When I saw the [paper] I said, ‘Wow, they did it,’” says Stefano Laporta, a theoretical physicist affiliated with University of Padua in Italy, who works on calculating the electron magnetic moment according to the standard model.</p>



<p>The new test of the standard model would be even more impressive if it weren’t for a conundrum in another painstaking measurement. Two recent experiments, one led by physicist Saïda Guellati-Khélifa of Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris and the other by Müller, disagree on the value of a number called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/key-constants-new-measurement-casts-doubt-dark-photons">fine-structure constant</a>, which characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interactions (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). That number is an input to the standard model’s prediction of the electron magnetic moment. So the disagreement limits the new test’s precision. If that discrepancy were sorted out, the test would become 10 times as precise as it is now. <a></a></p>





<p>The stalwart standard model has stood up to a barrage of experimental tests for decades. But scientists don’t think it’s the be-all and end-all. That’s in part because it doesn’t explain observations such as the existence of dark matter, an invisible substance that exerts gravitational influence on the cosmos. And it doesn’t say why the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">universe contains more matter than antimatter</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). So physicists keep looking for cases where the standard model breaks down.</p>



<p>One of the most tantalizing hints of a failure of the standard model is the magnetic moment not of the electron, but of the muon, a heavy relative of the electron. In 2021, a measurement of this property hinted at a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">possible mismatch with standard model predictions</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Some people believe that this discrepancy could be the signature of new physics beyond the standard model,” says Guellati-Khélifa, who wrote a commentary on the new electron magnetic moment paper in <em>Physics </em>magazine. If so, any new physics affecting the muon could also affect the electron. So future measurements of the electron magnetic moment might also deviate from the prediction, finally revealing the standard model’s flaws.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-archery-europe-neandertal">Homo sapiens may have brought archery to Europe about 54,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Homo sapiens</em> who reached Europe around 54,000 years ago introduced bows and arrows to that continent, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Researchers examined tiny triangular stone points and other artifacts excavated at a rock-shelter in southern France called Grotte Mandrin. <em>H. sapiens</em> on the move probably <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought archery techniques from Africa to Europe</a>, archaeologist Laure Metz of Aix-Marseille University in France and colleagues report February 22 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Metz and colleagues demonstrate bow hunting [at Grotte Mandrin] as convincingly as possible without being caught bow-in-hand,” says archaeologist Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>No bows were found at the site. Wooden items such as bows preserve poorly. The oldest intact bows, found in northern European bogs, date to around 11,000 years ago, Metz says.</p>



<p>Previous stone and bone point discoveries suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bow-and-arrow hunting originated in Africa</a> between about 80,000 and 60,000 years ago. And previously recovered fossil teeth indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter"><em>H. sapiens</em> visited Grotte Mandrin as early as 56,800 years ago</a>, well before Neandertals’ demise around 40,000 years ago and much earlier than researchers had thought that &nbsp;<em>H. sapiens</em> first reached Europe (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve shown that the earliest known <em>Homo sapiens</em> to migrate into Neandertal territories had mastered the use of the bow,” Metz says.</p>



<p>No evidence suggests that Neandertals already present in Europe at that time launched arrows at prey. It’s also unclear whether archery provided any substantial hunting advantages to <em>H. sapiens</em> relative to spears that were thrust or thrown by Neandertals.</p>

<p>Among 852 stone artifacts excavated in a <em>H. sapiens</em> sediment layer at Grotte Mandrin dated to about 54,000 years ago, 196 triangular stone points displayed high-impact damage. Another 15 stone points showed signs of both high-impact damage and alterations caused by butchery activities, such as cutting.</p>



<p>Comparisons of those finds were made to damage on stone replicas of the artifacts that the researchers used as arrowheads shot from bows and as the tips of spears inserted in handheld throwing devices. Additional comparative evidence came from stone and bone arrowheads used by recent and present-day hunting groups.</p>





<p>Impact damage along the edges of stone points from the French site indicated that these implements had been attached at the bottom to shafts.</p>



<p>The smallest Grotte Mandrin points, many with a maximum width of no more than 10 millimeters, could have pierced animals’ hides only when shot from bows as the business ends of arrows, the researchers say. Experiments they conducted with replicas of the ancient stone points found that stone points less than 10 millimeters wide reach effective hunting speeds only when attached to arrow shafts propelled by a bow.</p>



<p>Larger stone points, some of them several times the size of the smaller points, could have been arrowheads or might have tipped spears that were thrown or thrust by hand or launched from handheld spear throwers, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>Lombard, the University of Johannesburg archaeologist, suspects that the first <em>H. sapiens</em> at the French rock-shelter hunted with bows and arrows as well as with spears, depending on where and what they were hunting. Earlier studies directed by Lombard indicated that sub-Saharan Africans similarly alternated between these two types of hunting weapons starting between about 70,000 and 58,000 years ago.</p>



<p><em>H. sapiens</em> newcomers to Europe may have learned from Neandertals that spear hunting in large groups takes precedence on frigid landscapes, where bow strings can easily snap and long-distance pursuit of prey is not energy efficient, Lombard says.</p>



<p>But learning about archery from <em>H. sapiens</em> may not have been in the cards for Neandertals. Based on prior analyses of brain impressions on the inside surfaces of fossil skulls, Lombard suspects that Neandertals’ brains did not enable the enhanced visual and spatial abilities that <em>H. sapiens</em> exploited to hunt with bows and arrows.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility, though other controversial evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">Neandertals behaved no differently from Stone Age <em>H. sapiens</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>).If Grotte Mandrin Neandertals never hunted with bows and arrows but still survived just fine alongside <em>H. sapiens</em> archers for roughly 14,000 years, reasons for Neandertals’ ultimate demise remain as mysterious as ever.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">The James Webb telescope found six galaxies that may be too hefty for their age</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope’s first peek at the distant universe unveiled galaxies that appear too big to exist.</p>



<p>Six galaxies that formed in the universe’s first 700 million years seem to be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05786-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 times more massive</a> than standard cosmological theories predict, astronomer Ivo Labbé and colleagues report February 22 in <em>Nature</em>. “Adding up the stars in those galaxies, it would exceed the total amount of mass available in the universe at that time,” says Labbé, of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. “So you know that something is afoot.”</p>





<p>The telescope, also called JWST, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">released its first view of the early cosmos</a> in July 2022 (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). Within days, Labbé and his colleagues had spotted about a dozen objects that looked particularly bright and red, a sign that they could be massive and far away.</p>



<p>“They stand out immediately, you see them as soon as you look at these images,” says astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Measuring the amount of light each object emits in various wavelengths can give astronomers an idea of how far away each galaxy is, and how many stars it must have to emit all that light. Six of the objects that Nelson, Labbé and colleagues identified look like their light comes from no later than about 700 million years after the Big Bang. Those galaxies appear to hold up to 10 billion times the mass of our sun in stars. One of them might contain the mass of 100 billion suns.</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t have had time to make things that have as many stars as the Milky Way that fast,” Nelson says. Our galaxy contains about 60 billion suns’ worth of stars — and it’s had more than 13 billion years to grow them. “It’s just crazy that these things seem to exist.”</p>



<p>In the standard theories of cosmology, matter in the universe clumped together slowly, with small structures gradually merging to form larger ones. “If there are all these massive galaxies at early times, that’s just not happening,” Nelson says.</p>



<p>One possible explanation is that there’s another, unknown way to form galaxies, Labbé says. “It seems like there’s a channel that’s a fast track, and the fast track creates monsters.”</p>



<p>But it could also be that some of these galaxies host supermassive black holes in their cores, says astronomer Emma Curtis-Lake of the University of Hertfordshire in England, who was not part of the new study. What looks like starlight could instead be light from the gas and dust those black holes are devouring. JWST has already seen a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidate for an active supermassive black hole</a> even earlier in the universe’s history than these galaxies are, she says, so it’s not impossible.</p>





<p>Finding a lot of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">supermassive black holes at such an early era</a> would also be challenging to explain (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). But it wouldn’t require rewriting the standard model of cosmology the way extra-massive galaxies would.</p>



<p>“The formation and growth of black holes at these early times is really not well understood,” she says. “There’s not a tension with cosmology there, just new physics to be understood of how they can form and grow, and we just never had the data before.”</p>



<p>To know for sure what these distant objects are, Curtis-Lake says, astronomers need to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">confirm the galaxies’ distances and masses using spectra</a>, more precise measurements of the galaxies’ light across many wavelengths (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>).</p>



<p>JWST has taken spectra for a few of these galaxies already, and more should be coming, Labbé says. “With luck, a year from now, we’ll know a lot more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-sycamore-milestone">Google’s quantum computer reached an error-correcting milestone</a></h4>

              
                <p>To shrink error rates in quantum computers, sometimes more is better. More qubits, that is.</p>



<p>The quantum bits, or qubits, that make up a quantum computer are prone to mistakes that could render a calculation useless if not corrected. To reduce that error rate, scientists aim to build a computer that can correct its own errors. Such a machine would combine the powers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">multiple fallible qubits</a> into one improved qubit, called a “logical qubit,” that can be used to make calculations (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>). &nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists now have demonstrated a key milestone in quantum error correction. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05434-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scaling up the number of qubits in a logical qubit can make it less error-prone</a>, researchers at Google report February 22 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Future quantum computers could solve problems <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">impossible for even the most powerful traditional computers</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>). To build those mighty quantum machines, researchers agree that they’ll need to use error correction to dramatically shrink error rates. While scientists have previously demonstrated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computer-error-correction-multiple-qubits-detect-mistakes">they can detect</a> and correct simple errors in small-scale quantum computers, error correction is still in its early stages (<em>SN: 10/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>The new advance doesn’t mean researchers are ready to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, “however, it does demonstrate that it is indeed possible, that error correction fundamentally works,” physicist Julian Kelly of Google Quantum AI said in a news briefing February 21.</p>

<p>Logical qubits store information redundantly in multiple physical qubits. That redundancy allows a quantum computer to check if any mistakes have cropped up and fix them on the fly. Ideally, the larger the logical qubit, the smaller the error rate should be. But if the original qubits are too faulty, adding in more of them will cause more problems than it solves.</p>



<p>Using Google’s Sycamore quantum chip, the researchers studied two different sizes of logical qubits, one consisting of 17 qubits and the other of 49 qubits. After making steady improvements to the performance of the original physical qubits that make up the device, the researchers tallied up the errors that still slipped through. The larger logical qubit had a lower error rate, about 2.9 percent per round of error correction, compared to the smaller logical qubit’s rate of about 3.0 percent, the researchers found.</p>





<p>That small improvement suggests scientists are finally tiptoeing into the regime where error correction can begin to squelch errors by scaling up. “It’s a major goal to achieve,” says physicist Andreas Wallraff&nbsp;of ETH Zurich, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>However, the result is only on the cusp of showing that error correction improves as scientists scale up. A computer simulation of the quantum computer’s performance suggests that, if the logical qubit’s size were increased even more, its error rate would actually get worse. Additional improvement to the original faulty qubits will be needed to enable scientists to really capitalize on the benefits of error correction.</p>



<p>Still, milestones in quantum computation are so difficult to achieve that they’re treated like pole jumping, Wallraff says. You just aim to barely clear the bar.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">Chemical signals from fungi tell bark beetles which trees to infest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fungi may help some tree-killer beetles turn a tree’s natural defense system against itself.</p>



<p>The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (<em>Ips typographus</em>) has massacred millions of conifers in forests across Europe. Now, research suggests that fungi associated with these bark beetles are key players in the insect’s hostile takeovers. These fungi warp the chemical defenses of host trees <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to create an aroma that attracts beetles to burrow</a>, researchers report February 21 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<p>This fungi-made perfume might explain why bark beetles tend to swarm the same tree. As climate change makes Europe’s forests more vulnerable to insect invasions, understanding this relationship could help scientists develop new countermeasures to ward off beetle attacks.</p>





<p>Bark beetles are a type of insect found around the world that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bugged-forests-bad-climate">feed and breed inside trees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/10</em>). In recent years, several bark beetle species have aggressively attacked forests from North America to Australia, leaving ominous strands of dead trees in their wake.</p>



<p>But trees aren’t defenseless. Conifers — which include pine and fir trees — are veritable chemical weapons factories. The evergreen smell of Christmas trees and alpine forests comes from airborne varieties of these chemicals. But while they may smell delightful, these chemicals’ main purpose is to trap and poison invaders.</p>



<p>Or at least, that’s what they&#8217;re meant to do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Conifers are full of resin and other stuff that should do horrible things to insects,” says Jonathan Gershenzon, a chemical ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. “But bark beetles don’t seem to mind at all.”</p>



<p>This ability of bark beetles to overcome the powerful defense system of conifers has led some scientists to wonder if fungi might be helping. Fungi <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-carbon-storage-soil-earth-warm-climate">break down compounds in their environment</a> for food and protection (<em>SN: 11/30/21</em>). And some type of fungi — including some species in the genus <em>Grosmannia</em> — are always found in association with Eurasian spruce bark beetles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1.jpg" alt="image of a cross section of wood showing Eurasian spruce bark beetle larvae inside their burrows" class="wp-image-3122122" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122122">Eurasian spruce bark beetles (larvae seen here) have killed millions of trees in their quest to feed and breed inside Europe’s conifers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122122">Dineshkumar Kandasamy (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gershenzon and his colleagues compared the chemicals released by spruce bark infested with <em>Grosmannia </em>and other fungi to the chemical profile of uninfected trees. The presence of the fungi fundamentally changed the chemical profile of spruce trees, the team found. More than half the airborne chemicals — made by fungi breaking down monoterpenes and other chemicals that are likely part of the tree defense system — were unique to infected trees after 12 days.</p>



<p>This is surprising because researchers had previously assumed that invading fungi hardly changed the chemical profile of trees, says Jonathan Cale, a fungal ecologist at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada, who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>Later experiments revealed that bark beetles can detect many of these fungi-made chemicals. The team tested this by attaching tiny electrodes on bark beetles’ heads and detecting electrical activity when the chemicals wafted passed their antennae. What’s more, the smell of these chemicals combined with beetle pheromones led the insects to burrow at higher rates than the smell of pheromones alone.</p>



<p>The study suggests that these fungi-made chemicals can help beetles tell where to feed and breed, possibly by advertising that the fungi has taken down some of the tree’s defenses. The attractive nature of the chemicals could also explain the beetle’s swarming behavior, which drives the death of healthy adult trees.</p>



<p>But while the fungi aroma might doom trees, it could also lead to the beetles’ demise. Beetle traps in Europe currently use only beetle pheromones to attract their victims. Combining pheromones with fungi-derived chemicals might be the secret to entice more beetles into traps, making them more effective.</p>



<p>The results present “an exciting direction for developing new tools to manage destructive bark beetle outbreaks” for other beetle species as well, Cale says. In North America, mild winters and drought have put conifer forests at greater risk from mountain pine beetle (<em>Dendroctonus pendersoae</em>) attacks. Finding and using fungi-derived chemicals might be one way to fend off the worst of the bark beetle invasions in years to come.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-work-burnout-depression-wellness">Lots of people feel burned out. But what is burnout exactly?</a></h4>

              
                <p>When New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who garnered international praise for how she handled the pandemic in her country, recently announced her <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jacindaardernresignationspeech.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intention to resign</a>, here’s how she summed up her surprise decision: “I know what the job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.”</p>



<p>Social scientists and journalists worldwide largely interpreted Ardern’s words in her January 19 speech as a reference to burnout.</p>





<p>“She’s talking about an empty tank,” says Christina Maslach, a psychological researcher who has been interviewing and observing workers struggling with workplace-related distress for decades. In almost 50 years of interviews, says Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, “that phrase [has come] up again and again and again.”</p>



<p>Numerous studies and media reports suggest that burnout, already high before the pandemic, has since skyrocketed worldwide, particularly among workers in certain professions, such as health care, teaching and service. The pandemic makes clear that the jobs needed for a healthy, functioning society are burning people out, Maslach says.</p>



<p>But disagreement over how to define and measure burnout is pervasive, with some researchers even questioning if the syndrome is simply depression by another name. Such controversy has made it difficult to estimate the prevalence of burnout or identify how to best help those who are suffering.</p>



<p>Here are some key questions researchers are asking to get a handle on the problem.</p>



<h4>When did today’s understanding of burnout emerge?</h4>



<p>Some researchers argue that burnout is a strictly modern-day phenomenon, brought on by overwork and hustle culture. But others contend that burnout is merely the latest iteration of a long line of exhaustion disorders, starting with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/acedia-the-lost-name-for-the-emotion-were-all-feeling-right-now-144058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancient Greek concept of <em>acedia</em></a>. This condition, wrote 5th century monk and theologian John Cassian, is marked by “bodily listlessness and yawning hunger.”</p>



<p>The more contemporary notion of burnout originated in the 1970s. Herbert Freudenberger, the consulting psychologist for volunteers working with drug addicts at St. Mark’s Free Clinic in New York City, used the term to describe the volunteers’ gradual loss of motivation, emotional depletion and reduced commitment to the cause.</p>





<p>Roughly simultaneously, Maslach was interviewing social service workers in California and began observing similar characteristics. That prompted Maslach and her then–graduate student, Susan Jackson, now at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., to develop the first tool to measure burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The duo defined burnout as comprising of three components: exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy, or persistent feelings of low personal accomplishment.</p>



<p>Respondents rated statements on a scale from 0 (“never”) to 6 (“daily”). Sample statements read: “I feel emotionally drained from my work” for exhaustion; “I doubt the significance of my work” for cynicism; and “I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job” for inefficacy. High scores for exhaustion and cynicism, and low scores for inefficacy, indicated that a person was struggling with burnout.</p>



<p>Maslach’s scale turned burnout into a legitimate area of inquiry, says Renzo Bianchi, an occupational health psychologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “Before [the Maslach Burnout Inventory], burnout was pop psychology.”</p>



<h4>What is the best way to define burnout?</h4>



<p>Maslach’s inventory remains the most widely used tool to study burnout. But many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-sciences-definitions-terms-research-measurment">criticize that definition</a> of the syndrome (<em>SN: 10/26/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Conceptualizing burnout as a combination of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Burnout-Companion-To-Study-And-Practice-A-Critical-Analysis/Schaufeli-Enzmann/p/book/9780748406982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy is “arbitrary,”</a> wrote organizational psychologists Wilmar Schaufeli and Dirk Enzmann in their 1998 book, <em>The Burnout Companion to Study and Practice: A Critical Analysis</em>. “What would have happened if other items had been included? Most likely, other dimensions would have appeared.”</p>



<p>Moreover, those three components and what&#8217;s causing them are themselves poorly defined, says work and organizational psychologist Evangelia Demerouti of Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. For instance, numerous nonwork factors can trigger exhaustion, such as health problems and caregiving responsibilities.</p>



<p>Disagreements over what constitutes burnout, and how to measure the phenomenon, has led to a chaotic body of literature. A key point of contention is how to use Maslach’s inventory. Maslach never designated a cutoff point at which a worker tips from not burnt out to burnt out. Rather the inventory was designed as a tool to help researchers identify patterns of burnout within a given work environment or profession.</p>



<p>But in practice, Maslach has little control over how researchers use the inventory. A review of 182 studies on physician burnout in 45 countries reported in September 2018 in <em>JAMA </em>is illustrative. Almost 86 percent of studies in that review used a version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. But roughly a quarter of those studies used unofficial versions of Maslach’s scale, such as halving the number of statements or measuring exhaustion only. Those versions are clinically invalid, Maslach contends. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, most researchers using the inventory, or a modified version, did designate cutoff scores, though teams’ definitions for high, medium and low burnout showed little agreement. Consequently, estimates for the prevalence of physician burnout varied from 0 to 80.5 percent — figures that are impossible to interpret, the researchers note.</p>



<p>What’s more, across all the studies, the <em>JAMA</em> team identified <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2702871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">142 definitions of burnout</a>. And among the subset of studies not using a version of the inventory, the researchers identified 11 unique methods for measuring burnout. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those many concerns are prompting some researchers to call for a return to the drawing board on how to define and measure burnout. That process should start with qualitative interviews to see how people struggling at work speak about their own experiences, Demerouti says. “We don’t [have] a good conceptualization and diagnosis of burnout.… We need to start from scratch.”</p>



<h4>Do researchers agree on any features of burnout?</h4>



<p>Surprisingly, yes. Researchers concur that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702620979597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion is a core feature</a> of the syndrome, wrote Bianchi and his team in March 2021 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science.</em></p>



<p>Research in the past two decades &nbsp;is also converging on the idea that burnout appears to involve changes to cognition, such as problems with memory and concentration. Those cognitive problems can take the form of people becoming forgetful — missing a recurring meeting or struggling to perform routine tasks, for instance, says Charlie Renaud, an occupational health psychologist at the University of Rennes in France. Such struggles can carry over into people’s personal lives, causing leisure activities, such as reading and watching movies, to become laborious.</p>



<p>As these findings mount, some researchers have begun to incorporate questions on cognitive changes into their burnout scales, Renaud says.</p>

<h4>Is burnout a form of depression?</h4>



<p>At first glance, the two concepts appear contradictory. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">Depression</a> is typically seen as stemming from within the individual and burnout as stemming from societal forces, chiefly the workplace (<em>SN: 2/12/23</em>). &nbsp;But some researchers have begun to question if burnout exists as a standalone diagnosis. The concepts are not mutually exclusive, research shows. Chronic stress in one’s environment can trigger depression and certain temperaments can make one more prone to burnout.</p>



<p>For instance, scoring high for the personality trait <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178118310230?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuroticism</a> — characterized by irritability and a tendency to worry — better predicted a person’s likelihood of experiencing burnout than certain work-related factors, such as poor supervisor support and lack of rapport with colleagues, Bianchi and his team reported in 2018 in <em>Psychiatry Research.</em></p>



<p>Moreover, exhaustion occurred together with depression more frequently than with either cynicism or inefficacy, Bianchi and his team reported in the 2021 paper<em>.</em> If burnout is characterized by a suite of symptoms, then exhaustion and depression appear a more promising combination than the Maslach trifecta, the team reported.</p>



<p>“The real problem is that we want to believe that burnout is not a depressive condition, [or] as severe as a depressive condition,” Bianchi says. But that, he adds, simply isn’t true.</p>



<h4>Should people be able to get a diagnosis of “burnout”?</h4>



<p>Not everyone thinks that’s a good idea. “Burnout was never, ever thought of as a clinical diagnosis,” Maslach says.</p>



<p>Bianchi and his team disagree. The researchers have developed their own scale, the Occupational Depression Inventory, which assesses nine core symptoms associated with major depression, including cognitive impairment and suicidal thinking, through the lens of work. For instance, instead of rating a statement like “I feel like a failure,” participants rate the statement, “My experience at work made me feel like a failure.” <em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>If burnout is a form of depression, then it can be treated as such, Bianchi says. And, unlike burnout, treatments for depression, such as therapy and, in severe cases, medication, are already established. “Hopefully the interventions, the treatments, the forms of support that exist for depressed people can then be applied for occupational depression,” he says.</p>



<p>But treating the individual, while often a necessary first step, does nothing to alleviate the work-related stress that triggered the crisis, says occupational health psychologist Kirsi Ahola of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki. “[Imagine] the person is on sick leave, for example, for a few weeks and recuperates and rests … and he comes back to the exactly same situation where the demands are too high and no support and whatever. Then he or she starts burning out again.” That cycle is difficult to break.</p>



<p>Burnout is not included in the American Psychiatric Association’s current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The World Health Organization adopted Maslach’s conceptualization of burnout when they outlined the syndrome in their 2019 International Classification of Diseases. Burnout constitutes “an <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occupational phenomenon,” </a>not a medical condition, the agency noted. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>With the evidence so murky, is there any help for people struggling at work?</h4>



<p>Most researchers agree that interventions must target work-related distress at all levels, from the individual to the workplace to governing bodies.</p>



<p>Interventions at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid">the individual level</a> include therapy, exercise, developing hobbies outside of work and crafting one’s job to better fit one’s goals (<em>SN: 1/10/23</em>). Additionally, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-32813-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive training programs</a> that help restore memory, attention and other cognitive deficits have shown promise in alleviating the cognitive problems associated with burnout, Renaud and University of Rennes developmental psychologist Agnès Lacroix reported January 2 in the <em>International Journal of Stress Management. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the workplace level, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">simple fixes</a>, such as fewer video meetings and reducing distractions during the workday, can alleviate distress (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>). It’s time to chip away at all the little changes that have increased people’s workload over time, Maslach says. “Everybody adds stuff to people’s work. They never subtract.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, though, it may take systemic changes, such as more stringent labor laws, to combat burnout in countries like the United States, where sick leave is seldom guaranteed and few rules protect employees from overwork and job insecurity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But even without regulations forcing employers’ hands, governments and companies that prioritize healthy workplaces have a competitive advantage. “When people are feeling well and cope well and have energy, they are also better workers,” Ahola says. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">Fungi don’t turn humans into zombies. But The Last of Us gets some science right</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like so many others, I’ve been watching the HBO series <em>The Last of Us.</em> It’s a classic zombie apocalypse drama following Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they make their way across the former United States (now run by a fascist government called Fedra).</p>



<p>I’m a big fan of zombie and other post-apocalyptic fiction. And my husband had told me how good the storyline is in the video game that inspired the series, so I was prepared for interesting storytelling. What I didn’t expect was to be so intrigued by the science behind the sci-fi.</p>





<p>In the opening minutes of the series, two scientists on a fictional 1968 talk show discuss the microbes that give them pandemic nightmares. One says it’s fungi — not viruses or bacteria — that keep him awake. Especially worrisome, he says, are the fungi that control rather than kill their hosts. He gives the example of fungi that turns ants into living zombies, puppeteering the insects by flooding their brains with hallucinogens.</p>



<p>He goes on to warn that even though human body temperature keeps us fungus-free, that might not be true if the world got a little bit warmer. He predicts that as the thermostat climbs, a fungus that hijacks insects could mutate a gene allowing it to burrow into human brains and take control of our minds. Such a fungus could induce its human puppets to spread the fungus “by any means necessary,” he says. What’s worse, there are no preventatives, treatments or cures, nor any way to make them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a brief segment, but it had me hooked. It all sounded so chilling and … <em>plausible</em>. After all, fungi like ones that cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/nail-infections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nail infections</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeast infections</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ringworm</a> already infect people.</p>



<p>So I consulted some experts on fungal infections to find out whether this could actually happen.</p>



<p>I’ve got good news and bad news.</p>



<p>First, the bad news.</p>



<h4>Bad news: Climate change has already helped one fungus mutate to infect humans</h4>





<p>I wanted to know if warming has spurred any fungi to mutate and become infectious. So I called Arturo Casadevall. He has been thinking about fungi and heat for a long time. He’s proposed that the need to avoid fungal infections may have provided the evolutionary pressure that drove mammals and birds to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/just-warm-enough">evolve warm-bloodedness</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>).</p>



<p>Most fungal species simply can’t reproduce at human body temperature (37° Celsius, or 98.6° Fahrenheit). But as the world warms, “these strains either have to die or adapt,” says Casadevall, a microbiologist who specializes in fungal infections at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That raises the possibility that fungi that now infect insects or reptiles could evolve to grow at temperatures closer to human body temperature.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans&#8217; average body temperature has been falling</a> since the 19th century, at least in high-income countries, researchers reported in <em>eLife</em> in 2020. One study from the United Kingdom pegs average body temperature at 36.6° C (97.9° F). And some of us are even cooler.</p>



<p>Fungi’s possible adaptation to higher heat and humans’ cooling body temperature are on a collision course, Casadevall says.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="525" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1.jpg" alt="An illustration of Candida auris as purple oval bubbles floating on a dark blue background." class="wp-image-3122054" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-496x383.jpg 496w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-583x450.jpg 583w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne1-241x186.jpg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122054">Climate change helped the fungus <em>Candida auris </em>(illustrated) gain the ability to infect people.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122054">Stephanie Rossow/CDC</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>He and colleagues presented evidence of one such crash. Climate change may have allowed a deadly fungus called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans"><em>Candida auris</em> to acclimate to human body temperatures</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/19</em>). A version of the fungus that could infect humans independently emerged on three continents from 2012 to 2015. “It’s not like someone took a plane a spread it. These things came out of nowhere simultaneously,” Casadevall says.</p>



<p>Some people argue that the planet hasn’t warmed enough to make fungi a problem, he says. “But you have to think about all the really hot days [that come with climate change]. Every really hot day is a selection event,” in which many fungi will die. But some of those fungi will have mutations that help them handle the heat. Those will survive. Their offspring may be able to survive future even hotter heat waves until human body temperature is no challenge.</p>



<p>Fungi that infect people are usually not picky about their hosts, Casadevall says. They will grow in soil or — if given an opportunity — in people, pets or in other animals. The reason fungi don’t infect people more often is that “the world is much colder than we are, and they have no need of us,” he says.</p>



<p>When people do get infected, the immune system usually keeps the fungi in check. But fungal infections can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">cause serious illness</a> or be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">deadly, particularly to people with weakened immune systems</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21; SN: 1/10/23</em>).</p>



<p>The second episode of <em>The Last of Us</em> reveals that the zombie-creating fungi initially spread through people eating contaminated flour. Then, the infected people attack and bite others, spreading the fungus.</p>



<p>In real life, most human infections arise from breathing in spores. But Casadevall says it’s “not implausible” that people could get infected by eating spores or by being bitten.</p>



<h4>Also bad: Fungal genes can adapt to higher heat</h4>



<p>I also wondered exactly <em>how</em> a fungus could evolve in response to heat. Asiya Gusa, a fungal researcher at Duke University School of Medicine, has published one possibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, she and colleagues reported in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> on how one fungus mutated at elevated temperature to become harder to fight.</p>



<p><em>Cryptococcus deneoformans,</em> which already infects humans (though it’s no zombie-maker), <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2001451117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became resistant to some antifungal drugs</a> when grown at human body temperature. The resistance was born when mobile bits of DNA called transposons (often called jumping genes) hopped into a few genes needed for the antifungals to work.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study, Gusa and colleagues grew <em>C. deneoformans</em> at either 30° C or 37° C for 800 generations, long enough to detect multiple changes in their DNA. Fungi had no problem growing at the balmy 30° C (86° F), the temperature at which researchers typically grow fungi in the lab. But their growth slowed at the higher temperature, a sign that the fungi were under stress from the heat.</p>



<p>In <em>C. deneoformans</em>, that heat stress really got things jumping. One type of transposon accumulated a median of 12 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2209831120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra copies</a> of itself in fungi grown at body temperature. By contrast, fungi grown at 30° C tended to pick up a median of only one extra copy of the transposon. The team reported those results January 20 in <em>PNAS</em>. The researchers don’t yet know the effect the transposon hops might have on the fungi’s ability to infect people, cause disease or resist fungus-fighting drugs.</p>



<p>So yeah, the bad news is not great. Fungi are mutating in the heat and at least one species has gained the ability to infect people thanks to climate change. Other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">fungi that infect people are more widespread</a> than they were in the 1950s and 1960s, also thanks to a warming world (<em>SN: 1/4/23</em>).</p>



<p>But I promised good news. And here it is.</p>



<h4>Good news: Human brains may resist zombification</h4>



<p>It may not be our body temperature, but our brain chemistry, that protects us from being hijacked by zombifying fungi.</p>



<p>I consulted Charissa de Bekker and Jui-Yu Chou, two researchers who study the <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> fungi that are the model for the TV show’s fungal menace. These fungi infect ants, flooding the insects with a cocktail of chemicals that steer the ants to climb plants. Once in position, the ants chomp down and the chemicals keep the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">jaw muscles locked</a> in place (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike most fictional zombies, the ants are alive during this process. “A lot of people get the misconception that we work on undead ants,” says de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She’s glad to see the show “stick to the story of the host being very much alive while its behaviors change.” The fungi even help preserve the ant, keeping it alive even while feeding on it. But eventually the ant dies. Then a mushroom rises from the corpse, showering spores onto the ground where other ants may become infected.</p>



<p>Related species of <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> infect various species of ants and other insects. But each fungal species is very specific to the host it infects. That’s because the fungi had to individualize the chemicals they use to control the particular species they infect. The ability to manipulate behavior comes at the cost of not being able to infect multiple species.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2.jpg" alt="A close up photo of ant infected by Ophiocordyceps fungi on a leaf." class="wp-image-3122055" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122055"><em>Ophiocordyceps</em> fungi that infect ants (shown here) are the inspiration for the fictional zombifying fungus on the show.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122055">Jui-Yu Chou</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A fungus that specializes in infecting ants probably can’t get past humans’ immune systems, says Chou, a fungal researcher at the National Changhua University of Education in Taiwan. “Think of a key that fits into a specific lock. It is only this unique combination that will trigger the lock to open,” he says.</p>



<p>Even if the fungi evolved to withstand human body temperature and immune system attacks, they probably couldn’t take control of our minds, de Bekker says. “Manipulation is like a whole different ballgame. You need a ton of additional tools to get there.” It took millions of years of coevolution for the fungi to master piloting ants, after all.</p>



<p>While fungi do make mind-altering chemicals that can affect human behavior (LSD and psilocybin, for instance), Casadevall agrees that fungi that mind control insects probably won’t turn humans into zombies. “It’s not one of my worries,” he says.</p>



<p>Infected ants don’t turn into vicious, biting zombies either, de Bekker says. “If anything, we actually see the healthy ants being aggressive toward infected individuals, once they figure out that they&#8217;re infected, to basically get rid of them.” That “social immunity” helps protect the rest of the nest from infection.</p>



<h4>Also good: Humans are innovative enough to develop treatments</h4>



<p>The fictional scientist&#8217;s assertion that we couldn’t prevent, treat or cure these fungal infections is also a stretch.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs exist and they cure many fungal infections, though some infections may persist.&nbsp;Some that spread to the brain may be particularly difficult to clear.Some fungi are also evolving resistance to the drugs. And a few <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00294-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fungal vaccines are in the works</a>, although they may not be ready for years.</p>



<p>The experts I talked to say they hope the show will bring attention to real fungal diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gusa was especially glad to see fungi in the limelight. And she shares my fondness for that retro series opening in which the scientist predicts climate change could spawn mind-controlling fungi bent on infecting every person on the planet.</p>



<p>“I was pretty much yelling at the TV when I watched the [show’s] intro,” in an excited kind of way, she says. “This is the foundation of a lot of my grant funding … the threat of thermal adaptation of fungi.… To see it played out on the screen was something kind of fun.”</p>

<p>A paper that caught flak for its claims that an ancient city in the Middle East was destroyed by an exploding celestial body – and the authors’ suggestion that the event could have inspired the Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah – now has an editor’s note acknowledging the journal is looking into concerns about its data and conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The note follows a litany&nbsp; of criticism on Twitter, PubPeer, and in a “Matters Arising” response, as well as an extensive correction published last year. It appeared just days after Retraction Watch asked the publisher for an update on the case.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>,” was published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title, in September 2021. It has been cited six times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/113737860#score">Altmetric shows</a> it has gotten more online attention than most other papers of a similar age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after the article’s publication, its claims attracted scrutiny on Twitter, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/01/criticism-engulfs-paper-claiming-an-asteroid-destroyed-biblical-sodom-and-gomorrah/">we reported at the time</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Boslough">Mark Boslough</a>, a <s>retired </s>physicist at the University of New Mexico and expert in planetary impacts and airbursts (when celestial bodies explode above the earth’s surface) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440097126856282113?s=20">kicked off the criticism</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MTB_Archaeology/status/1440473335687630865?s=20">other scientists</a> quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/petrabonegirl/status/1440833392006688768?s=20">joined in</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a> <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/">examined images</a> of the dig site published in the paper and found that many had signs of tampering. One of the authors, Philip J. Silvia of Trinity Southwest University in Albuquerque, N.M., told us at the time that “the accusation that the image was photoshopped is categorically false.” But another author later acknowledged in a blog post that a graphic artist “made minor, cosmetic corrections to five of 53 images.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trinity Southwest University <a href="https://trinitysouthwest.com/about-tsu/#mission">describes itself</a> as “a trans-denominational institution in the evangelical mainstream of the historic Christian Faith” that has “chosen to remain non-aligned” with respect to “traditional accreditation.” Its <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trinity+Southwest+University/@35.1656068,-106.5910497,21z/data=!3m1!5s0x8722744ee3b147c9:0x342e3a70ddff1067!4m5!3m4!1s0x87189fd9594699ad:0x4340490ded8f3dd3!8m2!3d35.1656276!4d-106.5909719">address</a> appears to be located in a strip mall between a cannabis dispensary and a bubble tea shop in Albuquerque.</p>



<p>In response to comments about the images on PubPeer, corresponding author Allen West, whose affiliation is listed as “Comet Research Group,” located in Prescott, Ariz., <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#18">posted original versions</a> of seven images in the paper alongside the altered versions to show what was changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#21">Silvia wrote</a> on PubPeer:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We maintain that we have correctly represented the key original data &#8212; nothing of importance to the conclusion was changed. We have asked Scientific Reports to weigh in, and now it is up to them to decide.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06266-9">correction</a> to the paper in February 2022 listed several dozen figures that had been altered, and published original versions of them. The erratum stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Some of the figure panels have been manipulated to remove the features irrelevant to the scientific content depicted in those (e.g. measuring tape, previous image labels, visible fingers etc.). The Authors recognise that this level of manipulation was inappropriate, and provide original images.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next month, the journal published a “Matters Arising” in response to the original paper, titled, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08216-x">No mineralogic or geochemical evidence of impact at Tall el-Hammam, a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversation continued on PubPeer, sometimes with West and Silvia replying to questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last&nbsp; September, Boslough collected four outstanding issues with the paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#74">in a PubPeer post</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; Among these, he wrote, was “an egregious misrepresentation of my own work” in the paper’s figure 53, a depiction of an airburst simulation Boslough had presented at a conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>West <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#82">responded in detail</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Some of the issues that you raise in your Comment are questions that are answered here. Others can be resolved with corrections in Bunch et al., and I have already asked Scientific Reports for guidance on how to proceed. We will consult with you once I hear from them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">West and his collaborators have previously published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/447256a">controversial claims</a> about other putative comet impacts, including one about 13,000 years ago that they say led to the extinction of wooly mammoths and the Clovis culture in North America. But, as Rex Dalton <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180">reported in 2011</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>West is Allen Whitt — who, in 2002, was fined by California and convicted for masquerading as a state-licensed geologist when he charged small-town officials fat fees for water studies. After completing probation in 2003 in San Bernardino County, he began work on the comet theory, legally adopting his new name in 2006 as he promoted it in a popular book. Only when questioned by this reporter last year did his co-authors learn his original identity and legal history. Since then, they have not disclosed it to the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to archives of <em>Scientific Reports</em>’ website, West had been a member of the journal’s editorial board as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306181639/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors#earthenvironment">March of 2020</a>, but was no longer listed on the site as of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210801042155/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">August 2021</a>. He has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Beginning soon after the Tall el-Hammam article’s publication, Boslough has been in contact with Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, about the issues he saw in the paper, his posts on PubPeer, and critical articles he was working on for the publication <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/12/sodom-meteor-strike-claims-should-be-taken-with-a-pillar-of-salt/"><em>Skeptical Inquirer</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boslough emailed Marszalek again in December, following West’s PubPeer comment about working with <em>Scientific Reports</em> on corrections to the article, and asked if the paper couldn’t at least be marked with an editor’s note while the journal considered what to do:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Forgive me for my increasing rate of messages asking for Bunch et al (2021) to either be retracted or corrected, but this is becoming urgent. It has been a year and a quarter since it has been published and there are still many instances of false claims and wrong data that have not yet been corrected. In some cases, the authors agree that the information is false (such as their incorrect labeling of my simulation in Figure 53, and the false claims about trees at Tunguska). Allen West acknowledged these problems three months ago and promised to work with you to correct them.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek responded the next day:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am incredibly sorry for the lack of responses from me. I am working on this, but my recent business travels have slowed me down. The urgency is not lost on me, but as you can imagine it takes time to piece together all of the information here, esp. given the rate at which the exchange progressed on PubPeer earlier this year going beyond what your early comments as well as authors replies to us may have covered (and diverging into directions that while important, are not something we can address editorially, as I explained in the past).</p>



<p>I hope you can bear with me for a while longer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this month, Boslough copied Retraction Watch on his latest email to Marszalek, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>​​As I&#8217;ve noted several times since we started corresponding in 2021, Scientific Reports needs to either retract or make several more immediate corrections to the paper by Bunch et al (2021). Most important to me is the removal from your journal of their Figure 53, which shows a photoshopped version of one of my airburst simulations with added labels that are wrong and a caption that misrepresents it and changes its meaning in an apparent attempt to use my model to support their hypothesis. I do not want their false claims to be misattributed to me… ​​Can you please put a statement of concern on this paper until it is retracted or until these and other corrections are made?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We also emailed Springer Nature’s press office to ask if correction was indeed underway, and on February 10 got the following response attributed to Marszalek:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation into this paper is still ongoing. The editors are looking into the concerns raised, which include but are not limited to those issues raised in the PubPeer comments. This process may take some time while we carefully consider available evidence and give all parties involved the chance to respond.</p>



<p>We will update our readers with further information as soon as we are able to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This editor’s note was posted on February 15:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that concerns raised about the data presented and the conclusions of this article are being considered by the Editors. A further editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what prompted the note’s publication, given the longstanding critiques of the paper. Marszalek responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When concerns are raised about papers we have published, we look into them carefully, following an established process. These issues are often complex and as a result, it can take time for editors and authors to fully investigate them.&nbsp; Given that it is taking significant time to unravel the concerns in this case, we felt it was in the best interests of the readership to add a note at this stage.&nbsp; For confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment further at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Responding to the editor’s note, Boslough told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is a positive development that is long overdue. Frankly, I think the paper is unsalvageable and no amount of correction would be sufficient to make it publishable. For example, data points in their map of debris directionality (Fig. 17) appear to be fabricated and the authors don&#8217;t seem to be capable of providing the raw data or methods so others can see how they arrived at their claimed wind vectors on which their conclusions are based. I hope this expression of concern leads to more scrutiny on the same group&#8217;s other papers with similarly troublesome claims based on data and methods that they have never revealed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stroke-recovery-new-treatment-implant-patient-paralysis">A new treatment could restore some mobility in people paralyzed by strokes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sitting in an exam room, surrounded by doctors and scientists, Heather Rendulic opened her left hand for the first time since suffering a series of strokes nine years earlier when she was in her early 20s.</p>



<p>“It was an amazing feeling for me to be able to do that again,” Rendulic says. “It’s not something I ever thought was possible.”</p>



<p>But immediately after a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02202-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surgically implanted device sent electrical pulses into her spinal cord</a>, Rendulic could not only open her hand but also showed other marked improvements in arm mobility, researchers report February 20 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. “We all started crying,” Marco Capogrosso, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a February 15 news conference. “We didn’t really expect this could work as fast as that.”</p>





<p>The approach is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">similar to that recently used for patients paralyzed by spinal cord injuries</a> (<em>SN: 08/03/22</em>). It represents a promising new technique for restoring voluntary movement to those left with upper-body paralysis following strokes, the team says.</p>



<p>A stroke occurs when blood supply to parts of the brain is cut off, often causing short-term or long-term issues with movement, speech and vision. Stroke is a leading, and often underappreciated, cause of paralysis; in the United States alone, 5 million people are living with some form of motor deficit due to stroke. While physical therapy can provide some improvements, no treatment exists to help these patients regain full control of their limbs — and their lives.</p>



<p>Strokes cause paralysis because the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged; the brain tries to tell the spinal cord to move certain muscles, but the message is muddled.</p>



<p>So, taking advantage of techniques already existing for spinal injections of anesthetics, the team invented an electrical device that can be placed along the spinal cord to stimulate the nerves there. The stimulation “does not hurt whatsoever,” Rendulic says. “It feels like a vibration.”</p>



<p>By aligning the electrodes on the device with sensory nerves, “we can enhance the activation of muscles that are weakened by the stroke,” Douglas Weber, an engineer and neuroscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said at the news conference. Pulses from these electrodes seek to amplify signals from the brain, stimulating sensory nerves that go on to activate muscles, restoring voluntary body control to patients.</p>



<p>Rendulic and the other patient in the study both showed improvement in mobility tasks, including drawing a spiral, opening a lock and gripping and lifting a soup can while the device was on. Treatment sessions of continuous electrical stimulation were held for four hours per day, five days a week, over 29 days, and the improvements persisted for as long as four weeks after treatment stopped. This makes the researchers optimistic that they can get even stronger results if the treatment were paired with intensive physical training, Elvira Pirondini, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said at the news conference.</p>

Here, she feeds herself and sorts blocks while the device is on, but has trouble doing those tasks when the stimulation is turned off. The implant sends electrical pulses into spinal nerves, circumventing the damaged connection between the brain and the spinal cord. (Devices on her arm are just for monitoring.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>She and the rest of the team are actively testing the device with other patients, and also exploring if pairing it with physical training can improve outcomes. The researchers are hopeful that it will be widely accessible because the surgery to implant it is minimally invasive and routine, and the value of the procedure can be clearly demonstrated, which is important to convince insurance companies to cover it.</p>





<p>The treatment might not work well for patients with severe mobility impairment, says UCLA neurologist Bruce Dobkin, who was not involved with the study. But it could serve as a “new tool to try to maximize the recovery” of stroke patients with more moderate paralysis, in combination with other therapies.</p>



<p>For Rendulic, the proven potential of using spinal cord stimulation to treat paralysis caused by stroke gives her hope for the future. “I really hope and pray that this becomes widely available,” she says, “because I know it’s going to change so many lives.”</p>

<h4>Fungi Q&amp;A</h4>



<p><em>Three types of fungi — </em>Histoplasma<em>, </em>Coccidioides<em> and </em>Blastomyces <em>— that cause serious lung infections were thought to be confined to certain regions of the United States. But now they are widespread in the country, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">Where fungal lung infections have spread</a>” (</em>SN: 1/14/23, p. 32<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story prompted so many questions from readers about the symptoms, treatments and testing for these fungal infections that <strong>Saey</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">answered them in a follow-up article online</a>. An abridged version appears below.</p>





<p><strong>How do you get infected?</strong></p>



<p>People generally get infected by inhaling fungal spores. Human activities such as farming, gardening and construction can disturb the soil where these fungi live, stirring up spores. Bird droppings and bat guano can also be sources of <em>Histoplasma</em>. Sweeping dried droppings increases the risk that spores will get kicked into the air and inhaled.</p>



<p>When cleaning up bird and bat droppings, it’s best to first wet them with a hose. Wearing a mask can also help limit exposure.</p>



<p><strong>What are the symptoms and treatments?</strong></p>



<p>People with healthy immune systems may show no symptoms or may develop mild flulike symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, chills and body aches. Other symptoms may include chest pain or discomfort, weight loss, headache, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath or night sweats.</p>





<p>People with coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever — the disease caused by <em>Coccidioides</em> — may also get a rash on their legs or upper body.</p>



<p>Symptoms can take time to appear. Those of histoplasmosis, the disease caused by <em>Histoplasma</em>, can develop between three and 17 days after exposure. Valley fever symptoms can appear between one and three weeks after exposure. For blastomycosis, the disease caused by <em>Blastomyces</em>, symptom onset can take anywhere from three weeks to three months.</p>



<p>Mild cases of all three infections usually clear up on their own in a few weeks to a few months. But some people may have lingering symptoms, especially if the infection becomes severe. Some people may develop severe or chronic pneumonia. And in a small number of people, the infections may spread to other parts of the body. For instance, <em>Histoplasma</em> tends to spread to the liver, spleen, bone marrow, adrenal glands and intestines. <em>Blastomyces</em> and<em> Coccidioides</em> often target joints. All three fungi can spread to the brain, where they may cause abscesses or meningitis — an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>Doctors can order blood or urine tests, chest X-rays or CT scans to help diagnose fungal infections. In some cases, doctors may need to test a small amount of body tissue or fluid from the spine or lungs.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs and other medications can help treat infections and manage symptoms. If caught early, most people fully recover.</p>



<p><strong>Who’s at risk?</strong></p>



<p>Infections and severe disease from all three fungi occur more often in men than in women, but the reason is unclear. People who are pregnant, living with HIV/AIDS or have weakened immune systems for other reasons are at higher risk of severe disease. So are older people and those with diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-the-science-of-rocks-is-like-the-science-of-humans">How the science of rocks is like the science of humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>What field of science could be more solid than geology? Rocks are visible, tangible. You can bang on them with a hammer, drill them, compress them, zap them with X-rays, ultraviolet light and radar, analyze their chemistry, extract their secrets.</p>



<p>The study of human behavior, by contrast, is the story of science’s struggle to identify the ineffable. Researchers have taken wildly different approaches to trying to figure out how people think and behave, from Sigmund Freud’s notion of the Oedipus complex to making behavioral science more “scientific” through efforts such as the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> and fMRI brain scans. Human life is messy, and no hammer tap will reveal the brain’s workings.</p>





<p>This issue of <em>Science News</em> articulates that duality in two features. Our cover story reports on the geology and chemistry of Mars, with NASA’s Perseverance rover scouting the Red Planet for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-perseverance-rover-nasa-water-life">rocks that could reveal signs of past life</a>. In “Broken timelines,” social sciences writer Sujata Gupta investigates efforts to understand how life crises can cause some people to lose their sense of self and vision of the future. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3122086">Helping people restore that vision</a>, some researchers believe, could be a balm for PTSD and suicidal thinking.</p>



<p>As I read Gupta’s article, I could sense the scientists’ effort to quantify people’s experiences through definitions — self-continuity, autobiographical reasoning. These terms were new to me, and I found myself having to read closely to be sure I understood what the scientists meant. I took comfort in Gupta’s observation that philosophers have been wrestling with these questions for millennia. There are no easy answers.</p>



<p>When I turned to freelance writer Liz Kruesi’s account of the first two years of the Perseverance mission, I thought, “Ah, easy.” Find rocks, study rocks, confirm or reject hypotheses. NASA scientists directed the rover to the Jezero crater, the site of a dry lake bed that they presumed would be made of sedimentary rocks — the type of rock most likely to preserve evidence of ancient life. To their astonishment, the rover, affectionately known as Percy, instead found igneous rocks from past magmatic activity. The story was more complicated than most scientists thought.</p>



<p>Percy has since rolled on to a new location, the front of a dried-up delta, where it has found the sedimentary rocks the scientists were hoping for. The rover continues in its work as a robot geologist and astrobiologist, taking photos and collecting samples that are revealing the chemistry of the rocks. Bit by bit, that information will help scientists piece together the complex story of the planet’s history. Someday, they may even be able to answer the big question of whether life once thrived on Mars.</p>



<p>So maybe rocks and humans aren’t such different research subjects after all. Simple questions lead to complicated and contradictory data, with new discoveries challenging what we thought we knew to be true. As we learn, we rewrite the story of the past and get a clearer sense of what the future may hold. And so many questions remain to be answered.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-perseverance-rover-nasa-water-life">What has Perseverance found in two years on Mars?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In August 2021 on a lonely crater floor, the newest Mars rover dug into one of its first rocks.</p>



<p>The percussive drill attached to the arm of the Perseverance rover scraped the dust and top several millimeters off a rocky outcrop in a 5-centimeter-wide circle. From just above, one of the rover’s cameras captured what looked like broken shards wedged against one another. The presence of interlocking crystal textures became obvious. Those textures were not what most of the scientists who had spent years preparing for the mission expected.</p>





<p>Then the scientists watched on a video conference as the rover’s two spectrometers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103522002809?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the chemistry</a> of those meshed textures. The visible shapes along with the chemical compositions showed that this rock, dubbed Rochette, was volcanic in origin. It was not made up of the layers of clay and silt that would be found at a former lake bed.</p>



<p>Nicknamed Percy, the rover <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">arrived at the Jezero crater two years ago</a>, on February 18, 2021, with its sidekick helicopter, Ingenuity. The most complex spacecraft to explore the Martian surface, Percy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">builds on the work</a> of the Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars since 2012, the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers, the Sojourner rover and other landers.</p>



<p>But Perseverance’s main purpose is different. While the earlier rovers focused on Martian geology and understanding the planet’s environment, Percy is looking for signs of past life. Jezero was picked for the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars 2020 mission</a> because it appears from orbit to be a former lake environment where microbes could have thrived, and its large delta would likely preserve any signs of them. Drilling, scraping and collecting pieces of the Red Planet, the rover is using its seven science instruments to analyze the bits for any hint of ancient life. It’s also collecting samples to return to Earth.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where on Mars is Perseverance?</h3>



<p>After landing on the Red Planet, Perseverance tested its movements and instruments for several months before exploring the floor of the Jezero crater. Percy then journeyed to the delta, arriving in April 2022. The rover explored the delta front through December, before carefully depositing samples on the surface. Next, it’s headed to the top of the delta.</p>

<p>Since landing, “we’ve been able to start putting together the story of what has happened in Jezero, and it’s pretty complex,” says Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who helps plan Percy’s day-to-day and long-term operations.</p>



<p>Volcanic rock is just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">one of the surprises the rover has uncovered</a>. Hundreds of researchers scouring the data Perseverance has sent back so far now have some clues to how the crater has evolved over time. This basin has witnessed flowing lava, at least one lake that lasted perhaps tens of thousands of years, running rivers that created a mud-and-sand delta and heavy flooding that brought rocks from faraway locales.</p>



<p>Jezero has a more dynamic past than scientists had anticipated. That volatility has slowed the search for sedimentary rocks, but it has also pointed to new alcoves where ancient life could have taken hold.</p>



<p>Perseverance has turned up carbon-bearing materials — the basis of life on Earth — in every sample it has abraded, Horgan says. “We’re seeing that everywhere.” And the rover still has much more to explore.</p>

<h4>Perseverance finds unexpected rocks</h4>



<p>Jezero is a shallow impact crater about 45&nbsp;kilo­meters in diameter just north of the planet’s equator. The crater formed sometime between 3.7&nbsp;billion and 4.1&nbsp;billion years ago, in the solar system’s first billion years. It sits in an older and much larger impact basin known as Isidis. At Jezero’s western curve, an etched ancient riverbed gives way to a dried-out, fan-shaped delta on the crater floor. </p>



<p>That delta “is like this flashing signpost beautifully visible from orbit that tells us there was a standing body of water here,” says astrobiologist Ken Williford of Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle.</p>



<p>Perseverance landed on the crater floor about two kilometers from the front of the delta. Scientists thought they’d find compacted layers of soil and sand there, at the base of what they dubbed Lake Jezero. But the landscape immediately looked different than expected, says planetary geologist Kathryn Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Stack Morgan is deputy project scientist for Perseverance.</p>

<p>For the first several months after the landing, the Mars 2020 mission team tested the rover’s movements and instruments, slowly, carefully. But from the first real science drilling near the landing location, researchers back on Earth realized what they had found. The texture of the rock, Stack Morgan says, was “a textbook igneous volcanic rock texture.” It looked like volcanic lava flows.</p>



<p>Over the next six months, several more rocks on the crater floor revealed igneous texture. Some of the most exciting rocks, including Rochette, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed olivine crystals throughout</a>. “The crystal fabric was obviously cooled from a melt, not transported grains,” as would be the case if it were a sedimentary sample, says Abigail Allwood of the Jet Propulsion Lab. She leads the rover’s PIXL instrument, which uses an X-ray beam to identify each sample’s composition.</p>



<p>Mission scientists now think the crater floor is filled with igneous rocks from two separate events — both after the crater was created, so more recently than the 3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago time frame. In one, magma from deep within the planet pushed toward the surface, cooled and solidified, and was later exposed by erosion. In the other, smaller lava flows streamed at the surface.</p>

<h3>Seeking signs of ancient life</h3>



<p>X-ray spectrometry of an abraded rock from the floor of the Jezero crater offers clues to the rock&#8217;s chemistry. These and other data can help scientists in the search for ancient life.</p>

<p>Sometime after these events, water flowed from the nearby highlands into the crater to form a lake tens of meters deep and lasting tens of thousands of years at least, according to some team members. Percy’s instruments have revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways that water altered the igneous rocks</a>: For example, scientists have found sulfates and other minerals that require water to form, and they’ve seen empty pits within the rocks’ cracks, where water would have washed away material. As that water flowed down the rivers into the lake, it deposited silt and mud, forming the delta. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flooding delivered 1.5-meter-wide boulders</a> from that distant terrain. All of these events preceded the drying of the lake, which might have happened about 3&nbsp;billion years ago.</p>



<p>Core samples, which Perseverance is collecting and storing on board for eventual return to Earth, could provide dates for when the igneous rocks formed, as well as when the Martian surface became parched. During the time between, Lake Jezero and other wet environments may have been stable enough for microbial life to start and survive.</p>



<p>“Nailing down the geologic time scale is of critical importance for us understanding Mars as a habitable world,” Stack Morgan says. “And we can’t do that without samples to date.”</p>



<p>About a year after landing on Mars, Perseverance rolled several kilometers across the crater floor to the delta front — where it encountered a very different geology.</p>



<h4>The delta might hold signs of ancient life</h4>



<p>Deltas mark standing, lasting bodies of water — stable locales that could support life. Plus, as a delta grows over time, it traps and preserves organic matter.</p>



<p>Sand and silt deposited where a river hits a lake get layered into sedimentary material, building up a fan-shaped delta. “If you have any biological material that is trapped between that sediment, it gets buried very quickly,” says Mars geologist Eva Scheller of MIT, a researcher with the Percy team. “It creates this environment that is very, very good for preserving the organic matter.”</p>



<p>While exploring the delta front between April 2022 and December 2022, Perseverance found some of the sedimentary rocks it was after.</p>

<p>Several of the rover’s instruments zoomed in on the textures and shapes of the rocks, while other instruments collected detailed spectral information, revealing the elements present in those rocks. By combining the data, researchers can piece together what the rocks are made of and what processes might have changed them over the eons. It’s this chemistry that could reveal signs of ancient Martian life — biosignatures. Scientists are still in the early stages of these analyses.</p>



<p>There won’t be one clear-cut sign of life, Allwood says. Instead, the rover would more likely reveal “an assemblage of characteristics,” with evidence slowly building that life once existed there.</p>



<p>Chemical characteristics suggestive of life are most likely to hide in sedimentary rocks, like those Perseverance has studied at the delta front. Especially interesting are rocks with extremely fine-grained mud. Such mud sediments, Horgan says, are where — in deltas on Earth, at least — organic matter is concentrated. So far, though, the rover hasn’t found those muddy materials.</p>



<p>But the sedimentary rocks studied have revealed carbonates, sulfates and unexpected salts — all <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materials indicating interaction with water</a> and important for life as we know it. Percy has found carbon-based matter in every rock it has abraded, Horgan says.</p>



<p>“We’ve had some really interesting results that we’re pretty excited to share with the community,” Horgan says about the exploration of the delta front. Some of those details may be revealed in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.</p>



<h4>Perseverance leaves samples for a future mission</h4>



<p>As of early February, Perseverance <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-rock-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has collected 18&nbsp;samples</a>, including bits of Mars debris and cores from rocks, and stored them on board in sealed capsules for eventual return to Earth. The samples come from the crater floor, delta front rocks and even the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the final weeks of 2022 and the first weeks of 2023, the rover dropped — or rather, carefully set down — half of the collected samples, as well as a tube that would reveal whether samples contained any earthly contaminants. These captured pieces of Mars are now sitting at the front of the delta, at a predetermined spot called the Three Forks region.</p>

If the rover isn’t operable when a future mission arrives at Mars, the samples can still be collected and returned to Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121933">JPL-CALTECH/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If Perseverance isn’t functioning well enough to hand over its onboard samples when a future sample-return spacecraft arrives, that mission will collect these samples from the drop site to bring back to Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers are currently working on designs for a joint Mars mission between NASA and the European Space Agency that could retrieve the samples. Launching in the late 2020s, it would land near the Perseverance rover. Percy would transfer the samples to a small rocket to be launched from Mars and returned to Earth in the 2030s. Lab tests could then confirm what Perseverance is already uncovering and discover much more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Percy is climbing up the delta</a> to explore its top, where muddy sedimentary rocks may still be found. The next target is the edge of the once-lake, where shallow water long ago stood. This is the site Williford is most excited about. Much of what we know about the history of how life has evolved on Earth comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">environments with shallow water</a>, he says. “That’s where really rich, underwater ecosystems start to form,” he says. “There’s so much going on there chemically.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-limbs-ants-locomotion">This robot automatically tucks its limbs to squeeze through spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inspired by how ants move through narrow spaces by shortening their legs, scientists have built a robot that draws in its limbs to navigate constricted passages.</p>



<p>The robot was able to hunch down and walk quickly through passages <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that were narrower and shorter than itself</a>, researchers report January 20 in <em>Advanced Intelligent System</em>s. It could also climb over steps and move on grass, loose rock, mulch and crushed granite.</p>



<p>Such generality and adaptability are the main challenges of legged robot locomotion, says robotics engineer Feifei Qian, who was not involved in the study. Some robots have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-legged-robot-hints-how-ancient-tetrapods-walked">specialized limbs</a> to move over a particular terrain, but they cannot squeeze into small spaces (<em>SN: 1/16/19</em>).</p>





<p>“A design that can adapt to a variety of environments with varying scales or stiffness is a lot more challenging, as trade-offs between the different environments need to be considered,” says Qian, of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>For inspiration, researchers in the new study turned to ants. “Insects are really <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-robots-could-learn-fire-ants">a neat inspiration for designing robot systems</a> that have minimal actuation but can perform a multitude of locomotion behaviors,” says Nick Gravish, a roboticist at the University of California, San Diego (<em>SN: 8/16/18</em>). Ants adapt their posture to crawl through tiny spaces. And they aren’t perturbed by uneven terrain or small obstacles. For example, their legs collapse a bit when they hit an object, Gravish says, and the ants continue to move forward quickly.</p>



<p>Gravish and colleagues built a short, stocky robot — about 30 centimeters wide and 20 centimeters long — with four wavy, telescoping limbs. Each limb consists of six nested concentric tubes that can draw into each other. What’s more, the limbs do not need to be actively powered or adjusted to change their overall length. Instead, springs that connect the leg segments automatically allow the legs to contract when the robot navigates a narrow space and stretch back out in an open space. The goal was to build mechanically intelligent structures rather than algorithmically intelligent robots.</p>



<p>“It’s likely faster than active control, [which] requires the robot to first sense the contact with the environment, compute the suitable action and then send the command to its motors,” Qian says, about these legs. Removing the sensing and computing components can also make the robots small, cheap and less power hungry.</p>



<p>The robot could modify its body width and height to achieve a larger range of body sizes than other similar robots. The leg segments contracted into themselves to let the robot wiggle through small tunnels and sprawled out when under low ceilings. This adaptability let the robot squeeze into spaces as small as 72 percent its full width and 68 percent its full height.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Like ants, a new type of robot can contract its legs to move through narrow spaces and hunch down to traverse spaces shorter than itself. It can also climb over steps and move on grass and loose rock.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, the researchers plan to actively control the stiffness of the springs that connect the leg segments to tune the motion to terrain type without consuming too much power. “That way, you can keep your leg long when you are moving on open ground or over tall objects, but then collapse down to the smallest possible shape in confined spaces,” Gravish says.</p>





<p>Such small-scale, minimal robots are easy to produce and can be quickly tweaked to explore complex environments. However, despite being able to walk across different terrains, these robots are, for now, too fragile for search-and-rescue, exploration or biological monitoring, Gravish says.</p>



<p>The new robot takes a step closer to those goals, but getting there will take more than just robotics, Qian says. “To actually achieve these applications would require an integration of design, control, sensing, planning and hardware advancement.”</p>



<p>But that’s not Gravish’s interest. Instead, he wants to connect these experiments back to what was observed in the ants originally and use the robots to ask more questions about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-robot-pigeon-can-bend-wings-like-real-bird">the rules of locomotion in nature</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>). </p>



<p>“I really would like to understand how small insects are able to move so rapidly across certain unpredictable terrain,” he says. “What is special about their limbs that enables them to move so quickly?”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593492307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Climate Book</a><br><em>Greta Thunberg</em><br><em>Penguin Press, $30</em></p>



<p>The best shot we have at minimizing the future impacts of climate change is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since the Industrial Revolution began, humankind has already raised the average global temperature by about 1.1 degrees. If we continue to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate, the world will probably surpass the 1.5-degree threshold by the end of the decade.</p>



<p>That sobering fact makes clear that climate change isn’t just a problem to solve someday soon; it’s an emergency to respond to now. And yet, most people don’t act like we’re in the midst of the greatest crisis humans have ever faced — not politicians, not the media, not your neighbor, not myself, if I’m honest. That’s what I realized after finishing <em>The Climate Book</em> by Greta Thunberg.</p>





<p>The urgency to act now, to kick the addiction to fossil fuels, practically jumps off the page to punch you in the gut. So while not a pleasant read — it’s quite stressful — it’s a book I can’t recommend enough. The book’s aim is not to convince skeptics that climate change is real. We’re well past that. Instead, it’s a wake-up call for anyone concerned about the future.</p>



<p>A collection of bite-size essays, <em>The Climate Book</em> provides an encyclopedic overview of all aspects of the climate crisis, including the basic science, the history of denialism and inaction, and what to do next. Thunberg, who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">became the face of climate activism</a> after starting the Fridays For Future protests as a teenager (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>), assembles an all-star roster of experts to write the essays.</p>



<p>The first two sections of the book lay out how a small amount of warming can have major, far-reaching effects. For some readers, this will be familiar territory. But as each essay builds on the next, it becomes clear just how delicate Earth’s climate system is. What also becomes clear is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the significance of 1.5 degrees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). Beyond this point, scientists fear, various aspects of the natural world might reach tipping points that usher in irreversible changes, even if greenhouse gas emissions are later brought under control. Ice sheets could melt, raise sea levels and drown coastal areas. The Amazon rainforest could become a dry grassland.</p>



<p>The cumulative effect would be a complete transformation of the climate. Our health and the livelihood of other species and entire ecosystems would be in danger, the book shows. Not surprisingly, essay after essay ends with the same message: We must cut greenhouse gas emissions, now and quickly.</p>



<p>Repetition is found elsewhere in the book. Numerous essays offer overlapping scientific explanations, stats about emissions, historical notes and thoughts about the future. Rather than being tedious, the repetition reinforces the message that we know what the climate change threat is, we know how to tackle it and we’ve known for a long time.</p>





<p>Thunberg’s anger and frustration over the decades of inaction, false starts and broken pledges are palpable in her own essays that run throughout the book. The world has known about human-caused climate change for decades, yet about half of all human-related carbon dioxide emissions ever released have occurred since 1990. That’s the year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its first report</a> and just two years before world leaders met in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to sign the first international treaty to curb emissions (<em>SN: 6/23/90</em>).</p>



<p>Perversely, the people who will bear the brunt of the extreme storms, heat waves, rising seas and other impacts of climate change are those who are least culpable. The richest 10 percent of the world’s population accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions while the top 1 percent emits more than twice as much as the bottom half. But because of a lack of resources, poorer populations are the least equipped to deal with the fallout. “Humankind has not created this crisis,” Thunberg writes, “it was created by those in power.”</p>



<p>That injustice must be confronted and accounted for as the world addresses climate change, perhaps even through reparations, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a philosopher at Georgetown University, argues in one essay.</p>



<p>So what is the path forward? Thunberg and many of her coauthors are generally skeptical that new tech alone will be our savior. Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, for example, has been heralded as one way to curb emissions. But less than a third of the roughly 150 planned CCS projects that were supposed to be operational by 2020 are up and running. </p>



<p>Progress has been impeded by expenses and technology fails, science writer Ketan Joshi explains. An alternative might be “rewilding,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">restoring damaged mangrove forests</a>, seagrass meadows and other ecosystems that naturally suck CO<sub>2</sub> out of the air (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>), suggest environmental activists George Monbiot and Rebecca Wrigley.</p>



<p>Fixing the climate problem will not only require transforming our energy and transportation systems, which often get the most attention, but also our economies (endless growth is not sustainable), political systems and connection to nature and with each other, the book’s authors argue.</p>



<p>The last fifth of the book lays out how we could meet this daunting challenge. What’s needed is a critical mass of individuals who are willing to make lifestyle changes and be heard. This could trigger a social movement strong enough to force politicians to listen and create systemic and structural change. In other words, it’s time to start acting like we’re in a crisis. Thunberg doesn’t end the book by offering hope. Instead, she argues we each have to make our own hope.</p>



<p>“To me, hope is not something that is given to you, it is something you have to earn, to create,” she writes. “It cannot be gained passively, through standing by and waiting for someone else to do something. Hope is taking action.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassy-eyes-young-crustaceans-predators">Glassy eyes may help young crustaceans hide from predators in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fledgling crustaceans have eyes like the sea, a peculiarity that could help them hide from predators.</p>



<p>Young shrimp, crab or lobster larvae already rock nearly translucent bodies to stay out of view. But dark eye pigments essential for vision pose the risk of exposing the animals anyway.</p>



<p>Some see-through ocean animals rely on mirrored irises or minuscule eyes to avoid detection. Young shrimp and prawns, on the other hand, camouflage their dark pigments behind light-reflecting <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass made of tiny, crystalline spheres</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Variations in the size and placement of the orbs allow the crustaceans’ eyes to shine light that precisely matches the color of the surrounding water, possibly rendering them invisible to predators on the hunt for a meal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Technologies that mimic the nanospheres’ structure could one day inspire more efficient solar energy or bio-friendly paints, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“I’ve often wondered what’s going on with [these animals&#8217;] eyeshine,” says evolutionary biologist Heather Bracken-Grissom of Florida International University in Miami, who was not involved in the study. She and colleagues often collect crustaceans from the deep sea, giving them nicknames like “blue-eyed arthropod” or “green-eyed, weird-looking shrimp” because the creatures don’t resemble their adult forms. Now, she says, that eye color makes sense.</p>



<p>In the study, chemist Keshet Shavit and colleagues used an electron microscope to peer into the eyes of lab-raised and wild crustaceans. Inside shrimp and prawn eyes, the team found crystalline nanospheres made of isoxanthopterin, a molecule that reflects light.</p>



<p>The spheres are a bit like disco balls, with highly reflective surfaces pointing outward, says study coauthor Benjamin Palmer, a chemist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel. Each sphere is made of thin, isoxanthopterin plates that stick together to form balls that range in size from around 250 to 400 nanometers in diameter.</p>



<p>These balls are arranged in clusters at the base of protein-dense cones that focus light on the animal’s light-sensing nerves, and form a protective cover over the pigmented cells. But crustacean larvae can still see because there are small holes in the glass, Palmer says. “It’s basically allowing light to go down to the retina on some specific angles, but on other angles, it’s reflecting light back.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>The size and order of the spheres seem to influence the color of the reflected light, the team’s observations and computer simulations show.</p>



<p>“The correlation between the particle size and the eyeshine color is beyond amazing,” says Shavit, also at Ben-Gurion University. Nanosphere size appears to help the animals’ eyes match the color of their native habitat, helping the critters blend into the background. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Blue-eyed shrimp that inhabit the Gulf of Aqaba’s clear blue waters off the coast of Israel, for instance, have spheres that are approximately 250 to 325 nanometers in diameter. The 400-nanometer-wide spheres of a freshwater prawn (<em>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</em>)<em> </em>glitter yellow-green, mimicking muddy waters found in the salty estuaries where they live.</p>

Shavit</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The prawn’s eyes also seem to be able to reflect different colors in different environments. Individuals exposed to sunlight for four hours in the lab had silvery yellow eyes, possibly a result of nanospheres arranged in a disorganized jumble. But individuals left in the dark overnight had green eyes. Their nanospheres are arranged in layers — though the orbs within each layer are still disorganized, Palmer says.</p>



<p>Such adaptable eyes could help larvae move undetected through different parts of the ocean as changing light levels alter the color of the water, Bracken-Grissom says. At night, young crustaceans migrate to shallow waters to feed and dive back down when the sun rises. “If they are in fact using it as a form of camouflage, it would be an ingenious way to camouflage themselves as they move through these different light environments.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelics-improve-mental-health-nerve-cells">Psychedelics may improve mental health by getting inside nerve cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Psychedelics go beneath the cell surface to unleash their potentially therapeutic effects.</p>



<p>These drugs are showing promise in clinical trials as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">treatments for mental health disorders</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/21</em>). Now, scientists might know why. These substances <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can get inside nerve cells in the cortex</a> — the brain region important for consciousness — and tell the neurons to grow, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Several mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are tied to chronic stress, which degrades neurons in the cortex over time. Scientists have long thought that repairing the cells could provide therapeutic benefits, like lowered anxiety and improved mood.</p>





<p>Psychedelics — including psilocin, which comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-treat-depression-mushrooms-psychedelic">magic mushrooms</a>, and LSD — do that repairing by promoting the growth of nerve cell branches that receive information, called dendrites (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>). The behavior might explain the drugs’ positive outcomes in research. But how they trigger cell growth was a mystery.</p>



<p>It was already known that, in cortical neurons, psychedelics activate a certain protein that receives signals and gives instructions to cells. This protein, called the 5-HT2A receptor, is also stimulated by serotonin, a chemical made by the body and implicated in mood. But a study in 2018 determined that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serotonin doesn’t make these neurons grow</a>. That finding “was really leaving us scratching our heads,” says chemical neuroscientist David Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>To figure out why these two types of chemicals affect neurons differently, Olson and colleagues tweaked some substances to change how well they activated the receptor. But those better equipped to turn it on didn’t make neurons grow. Instead, the team noticed that “greasy” substances, like LSD, that easily pass through cells’ fatty outer layers resulted in neurons branching out.</p>



<p>Polar chemicals such as serotonin, which have unevenly distributed electrical charges and therefore can’t get into cells, didn’t induce growth. Further experiments showed that most cortical neurons’ 5-HT2A receptors are located inside the cell, not at the surface where scientists have mainly studied them.</p>



<p>But once serotonin gained access to the cortical neurons’ interior — via artificially added gateways in the cell surface — it too led to growth. It also induced antidepressant-like effects in mice. A day after receiving a surge in serotonin, animals whose brain cells contained unnatural entry points didn’t give up as quickly as normal mice when forced to swim. In this test, the longer the mice tread water, the more effective an antidepressant is predicted to be, showing that inside access to 5-HT2A receptors is key for possible therapeutic effects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It seems to overturn a lot about what we think should be true about how these drugs work,” says neuroscientist Alex Kwan of Cornell University, who was not involved in the study. “Everybody, including myself, thought that [psychedelics] act on receptors that are on the cell surface.”</p>





<p>That’s where most receptors that function like 5-HT2A are found, says biochemist Javier González-Maeso of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who was also not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Because serotonin can’t reach 5-HT2A receptors inside typical cortical neurons, Olson proposes that the receptors might respond to a different chemical made by the body. “If it’s there, it must have some kind of role,” he says. DMT, for example, is a naturally occurring psychedelic made by plants and animals, including humans, and can reach a cell’s interior.</p>



<p>Kwan disagrees. “It’s interesting that psychedelics can act on them, but I don’t know if the brain necessarily needs to use them when performing its normal function.” Instead, he suggests that the internal receptors might be a reserve pool, ready to replace those that get degraded on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Either way, understanding the cellular mechanisms behind psychedelics’ potential therapeutic effects could help scientists develop safer and more effective treatments for mental health disorders.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, I hope this leads to better medicines,” Olson says. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Setting sail into a plastic sea</strong> —<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environment-190"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 10, 1973</p>



<p>Scientists on an oceanographic voyage in the Central North Pacific last August became startled about the number of manmade objects littering the ocean surface. [Far from civilization and shipping lanes], they recorded 53 manmade objects in 8.2&nbsp;hours of viewing. More than half were plastic. They go on to compute that there are between 5 million and 35&nbsp;million plastic bottles adrift in the North Pacific.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is larger now than it was in 1973, containing an estimated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-pacific-garbage-patch-new-size-estimates">1.8 trillion pieces of plastic</a> within an area twice the size of Texas (<em>SN Online: 3/22/18</em>). In recent years, marine biologists have started seeing evidence that garbage is disrupting ocean ecosystems. For instance, large pieces of trash have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heres-breakdown-animals-crossed-pacific-2011-tsunami-debris">helped species cross into new territories</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/17, p. 32</em>). But an even greater threat may lurk beneath the waves. Tiny bits of plastic concentrate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">hundreds of meters deep</a> where they can be eaten by filter feeders and potentially make their way into the guts of larger predators (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 5</em>).</p>

<p>A university investigation in Hong Kong found that a professor used the email account of a former student to conduct all the correspondence needed to edit special issues of two journals, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two special issues, which were published last year, are full of articles with the hallmarks of paper mills, said Dorothy Bishop, an Oxford psychologist and scientific sleuth who flagged the matter to the institution involved in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, Bishop emailed the president of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with the information that Kaifa Zhao, a PhD student at the university, was listed as the lead editor for two special issues of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, </em>both journals published by Hindawi. The nearly 300 articles in the special issues were “mostly meaningless gobbledegook” that suggested they came from a paper mill, she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The episode is the latest of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/27/disbelief-researchers-watch-out-for-this-new-scam-involving-journal-special-issues/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/journal-run-by-new-ama-president-elect-caught-in-special-issue-scam/">problems</a> involving <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">questionable</a> peer review of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">special issues</a> – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/06/publisher-retracts-400-papers-at-once-for-violations-of-peer-review-process-policies/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retractions</a> – we’ve covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126561"></span>



<p>“There is no question that whoever is letting these fraudulent papers into the literature is guilty of serious academic fraud,” Bishop wrote, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. “The only possible defense that I can imagine is if Mr Zhao Kaifa is a victim of identity theft.”</p>



<p>According to the university’s response to Bishop, that’s indeed what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">PolyU’s Department of Computing convened a panel to meet with Zhao and his supervisor 10 days after receiving Bishop’s email. In the meeting, Zhao said that Yizhang Jiang, one of the supervisors of his master’s degree studies at Jiangnan University in Wuxi, China, “borrowed” his Hindawi journal account and PolyU email account and passwords and used them to edit the special issues. It’s unclear why he did so.</p>



<p>“According to Mr Zhao, he was not aware of relevant emails from Hindawi and has never responded to emails that are related to the two special issues,” a university staffer wrote to Bishop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university contacted Jiang, who confirmed that he had been “managing” Zhao’s accounts. The researcher said that Zhao did not know he was named an editor of the journal special issues until Bishop’s emails. Both Zhao and Jiang told the university that Zhao didn’t receive any payments related to the special issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for consequences, the university’s email stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The panel reminded Mr Zhao regarding proper use of his email account and personal data protection in the meeting. Mr Zhao admitted and understood that he should not have shared information of his PolyU account email and password with others.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email also said that the department would refer the matter to the university’s IT office “to further investigate if Mr. Zhao has been involved in any misconduct related to these two journal special issues through the usage of his PolyU email account, and will consider proper penalty to be imposed onto the student.”</p>



<p>Neither Zhao nor Jiang has responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to Hindawi for comment on PolyU’s findings, as well as the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Advanced+Big+Data+Analysis+Technologies+for+Environmental+Monitoring+Data%22%2C">PubPeer</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22BCI-based+Mobile+Computing+in+the+Internet+of+Medical+Things%22">posts</a> about papers in the two special issues, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/si/870528/">Advanced Big Data Analysis Technologies for Environmental Monitoring Data</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/si/736482/">BCI-based Mobile Computing in the Internet of Medical Things</a>.&#8221; A spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are investigating these papers and will take appropriate action on the articles and author in question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The whole thing is a huge mess,” Bishop told us when we asked for her take on the situation.&nbsp;She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My personal view is that where we have editor of a special issue that contains clearly weird content – with inappropriate citations, gobbledegook text, content that is way off topic – then the default assumption should be that the editor is working for a paper mill and all content of the special issue is suspect and needs to be retracted. If more evidence is needed, it should be obtained from the peer review record – my guess is that this would reveal superficial and very rapid reviews that totally fail to engage with the content (such as it is) and may come from reviewers with fake email addresses.</p>



<p>Instead, we seem to have a system where the publisher is slowly going through articles one at a time, checking with the authors and editors (who may be using fake email addresses from paper mills, and so can slow things down by delayed replies or silence), and using a very high bar of evidence for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Separately, last October Bishop contacted the <a href="https://doaj.org/about/">Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a>, an index of journals that publish papers without paywalls, about Hindawi titles on its list with paper mill content. One of those journals was the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em>, for which Zhao had appeared to edit a special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bishop told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think DOAJ, and indeed other indices, could play an important role in delisting journals found to have more than a minimal level of paper mill content, as this would remove the value to those placing articles there.</p>



<p>The only issue then is the collateral damage to honest authors who have published in those journals – I’m sure these do exist, and it is very unfortunate that they will find themselves&nbsp; published in a journal that has a tainted reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Within a few days of Bishop’s email, a DOAJ staffer told her by email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to work with you and other members of the research community to be able to identify these problems sooner, remove offending journals from DOAJ and try to ensure these practices are eliminated as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, months later, no Hindawi journals seem to have been removed from DOAJ’s index. Bishop said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I always hope organisations will act more quickly than they do, but I think DOAJ behaved reasonably, but were perhaps too trusting that Hindawi would take the initiative in getting paper mill content removed quickly.&nbsp; To my mind the key question is whether DOAJ will now act quickly to suspend from the register the journals that have been identified as having a very large number of PubPeer comments by paper mill sleuths.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about Consciousness and Information Theory based on selection of 3 papers. For more information, please see the list of papers and an abstract below.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which
incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological
axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it
differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to
non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular
spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how
physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate
experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as
&quot;differences that make a difference&quot; within a system, and integrated information as
information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By
applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of
systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally
irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and
the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS
specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information Φ_Max its quantity.
From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense
into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the
quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to
the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated
MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can
be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true
&quot;zombies&quot; - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious
complexes.</p>
