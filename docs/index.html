              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">Rare earth elements could be pulled from coal waste</a></h4>

              
                <p>In Appalachia’s coal country, researchers envision turning toxic waste into treasure. The pollution left behind by abandoned mines is an untapped source of rare earth elements.</p>



<p>Rare earths are a<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology"> valuable set of 17 elements</a> needed to make everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to fluorescent bulbs and lasers. With global demand skyrocketing and China having a near-monopoly on rare earth production — the United States <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">has only one active mine</a> — there’s a lot of interest in finding alternative sources, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycling-rare-earth-elements-hard-new-methods">ramping up recycling</a>.</p>





<p>Pulling rare earths from coal waste offers a two-for-one deal: By retrieving the metals, you also help clean up the pollution.</p>



<p>Long after a coal mine closes, it can leave a dirty legacy. When some of the rock left over from mining is exposed to air and water, sulfuric acid forms and pulls heavy metals from the rock. This acidic soup can pollute waterways and harm wildlife.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/3FE0D2F4-1001-44FF-B0C1-9B535DA41935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recovering rare earths from what’s called acid mine drainage</a> won’t single-handedly satisfy rising demand for the metals, acknowledges Paul Ziemkiewicz, director of the West Virginia Water Research Institute in Morgantown. But he points to several benefits.</p>



<p>Unlike ore dug from typical rare earth mines, the drainage is rich with the most-needed rare earth elements. Plus, extraction from acid mine drainage also doesn’t generate the radioactive waste that’s typically a by-product of rare earth mines, which often contain uranium and thorium alongside the rare earths. And from a practical standpoint, existing facilities to treat acid mine drainage could be used to collect the rare earths for processing. “Theoretically, you could start producing tomorrow,” Ziemkiewicz says.</p>



<p>From a few hundred sites already treating acid mine drainage, nearly 600 metric tons of rare earth elements and cobalt — another in-demand metal — could be produced annually, Ziemkiewicz and colleagues estimate.</p>



<p>Currently, a pilot project in West Virginia is taking material recovered from an acid mine drainage treatment site and extracting and concentrating the rare earths.</p>



<p>If such a scheme proves feasible, Ziemkiewicz envisions a future in which cleanup sites send their rare earth hauls to a central facility to be processed, and the elements separated. Economic analyses suggest this wouldn’t be a get-rich scheme. But, he says, it could be enough to cover the costs of treating the acid mine drainage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycling-rare-earth-elements-hard-new-methods">Recycling rare earth elements is hard. Science is trying to make it easier</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Our modern lives depend on rare earth elements, and someday soon we may not have enough to meet growing demand.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology">their special properties</a>, these 17 metallic elements are crucial ingredients in computer screens, cell phones and other electronics, compact fluorescent lamps, medical imaging machines, lasers, fiber optics, pigments, polishing powders, industrial catalysts – the list goes on and on (<em>SN Online: 1/16/23</em>). Notably rare earths are an essential part of the high-powered magnets and rechargeable batteries in the electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies needed to get the world to a low- or zero-carbon future.</p>





<p>In 2021, the world <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2022/mcs2022-rare-earths.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mined 280,000 metric tons of rare earths</a> — roughly 32 times as much as was mined in the mid-1950s. And demand is only going to increase. By 2040, experts estimate, we’ll need up to seven times as much rare earths as we do today.</p>



<p>Satisfying that appetite won’t be easy. Rare earth elements are not found in concentrated deposits. Miners must excavate huge amounts of ore, subject it to physical and chemical processes to concentrate the rare earths, and then separate them. The transformation is energy intensive and dirty, requiring toxic chemicals and often generating a small amount of radioactive waste that must be safely disposed of. Another concern is access: China has a near monopoly on both mining and processing; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">the United States has just one active mine</a> (<em>SN Online: 1/1/23</em>).</p>



<p>For most of the jobs rare earths do, there are no good substitutes. So to help meet future demand and diversify who controls the supply — and perhaps even make rare earth recovery “greener” — researchers are looking for alternatives to conventional mining.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals include everything from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">extracting the metals from coal waste</a> to really out-there ideas like mining the moon. But the approach most likely to make an immediate dent is recycling. “Recycling is going to play a very important and central role,” says Ikenna Nlebedim, a materials scientist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Institute. “That’s not to say we’re going to recycle our way out of the critical materials challenge.” </p>



<p>Still, in the rare earth magnets market, for instance, by about 10 years from now, recycling could satisfy as much as a quarter of the demand for rare earths, based on some estimates. “That’s huge,” he says.</p>



<p>But before the rare earths in an old laptop can be recycled as regularly as the aluminum in an empty soda can, there are technological, economic and logistical obstacles to overcome.</p>



<h4>Why are rare earths so challenging to extract?</h4>





<p>Recycling seems like an obvious way to get more rare earths. It’s standard practice in the United States and Europe to recycle from 15 to 70 percent of other metals, such as iron, copper, aluminum, nickel and tin. Yet today, only about 1 percent of rare earth elements in old products are recycled, says Simon Jowitt, an economic geologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>



<p>“Copper wiring can be recycled into more copper wiring. Steel can just be recycled into more steel,” he says. But a lot of rare earth products are “inherently not very recyclable.”</p>

<p>The scheme would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coal-waste-rare-earth-elements-recycling">provide valuable rare earth metals</a> and help clean up coal mining’s dirty legacy.</p>
</div>



<p>Rare earths are often blended with other metals in touch screens and similar products, making removal difficult. In some ways, recycling rare earths from tossed-out items resembles the challenge of extracting them from ore and separating them from each other. Traditional rare earth recycling methods also require hazardous chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and a lot of heat, and thus a lot of energy. On top of the environmental footprint, the cost of recovery may not be worth the effort given the small yield of rare earths. A hard disk drive, for instance, might contain just a few grams; some products offer just milligrams.</p>



<p>Chemists and materials scientists, though, are trying to develop smarter recycling approaches. Their techniques put microbes to work, ditch the acids of traditional methods or attempt to bypass extraction and separation.</p>



<h4>Microbial partners can help recycle rare earths</h4>



<p>One approach leans on microscopic partners. <em>Gluconobacter</em> bacteria naturally produce organic acids that can pull rare earths, such as lanthanum and cerium, from spent catalysts used in petroleum refining or from fluorescent phosphors used in lighting. The bacterial acids are less environmentally harmful than hydrochloric acid or other traditional metal-leaching acids, says Yoshiko Fujita, a biogeochemist at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. Fujita leads research into reuse and recycling at the Critical Materials Institute. “They can also be degraded naturally,” she says.</p>



<p>In experiments, the bacterial acids can recover only about a quarter to half of the rare earths from spent catalysts and phosphors. Hydrochloric acid can do much better — in some cases extracting as much as 99 percent. But bio-based leaching <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might still be profitable</a>, Fujita and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering</em>. <a></a></p>



<p>In a hypothetical plant recycling 19,000 metric tons of used catalyst a year, the team estimated annual revenues to be roughly $1.75 million. But feeding the bacteria that produce the acid on-site is a big expense. In a scenario in which the bacteria are fed refined sugar, total costs for producing the rare earths are roughly $1.6 million a year, leaving around just $150,000 in profits. Switching from sugar to corn stalks, husks and other harvest leftovers, however, would slash costs by about $500,000, raising profits to about $650,000.</p>

This reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory prepares an organic acid mixture for such recycling.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121115">Idaho National Lab</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Other microbes can also help extract rare earths and take them even further. A few years ago, researchers discovered that some bacteria that metabolize rare earths produce a protein that preferentially grabs onto these metals. This protein, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.1c00724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lanmodulin, can separate rare earths</a> from each other, such as neodymium from dysprosium — two components of rare earth magnets. A lanmodulin-based system might eliminate the need for the many chemical solvents typically used in such separation. And the waste left behind — the protein — would be biodegradable. But whether the system will pan out on a commercial scale is unknown.</p>



<h4>How to pull rare earths from discarded magnets</h4>



<p>Another approach already being commercialized skips the acids and uses copper salts to pull the rare earths from discarded magnets, a valuable target. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets are about 30 percent rare earth by weight and the single largest application of the metals in the world. One projection suggests that recovering the neodymium in magnets from U.S. hard disk drives alone could meet up about 5 percent of the world’s demand outside of China before the end of the decade.</p>



<p>Nlebedim led a team that developed a technique that uses copper salts to leach rare earths out of shredded electronic waste that contains magnets. Dunking the e-waste in a copper salt solution at room temperature dissolves the rare earths in the magnets. Other can be scooped out for their own recycling, and the copper can be reused to make more salt solution. Next, the rare earths are solidified and, with the help of additional chemicals and heating, transformed into powdered minerals called rare earth oxides. The process, which has also been used on material left over from magnet manufacturing that typically goes to waste, can recover 90 to 98 percent of the rare earths, and the material is pure enough to make new magnets, Nlebedim’s team has demonstrated.</p>



<p>In a best-case scenario, using this method to recycle 100 tons of leftover magnet material might produce 32 tons of rare earth oxides and net more than $1 million in profits, an economic analysis of the method suggests.</p>



<p>That study also evaluated the approach’s environmental impacts. Compared with producing one kilogram of rare earth oxide via one of the main types of mining and processing currently used in China, the copper salt method has <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than half the carbon footprint</a>. It produces an average of about 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of rare earth oxide versus 110, Nlebedim’s team reported in 2021 in <em>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering</em>.</p>

<p>But it’s not necessarily greener than all forms of mining. One sticking point is that the process requires toxic ammonium hydroxide and roasting, which consumes a lot of energy, and it still releases some carbon dioxide. Nlebedim’s group is now tweaking the technique. “We want to decarbonize the process and make it safer,” he says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the technology seems promising enough that TdVib, an Iowa company that designs and manufactures magnetic materials and products, has licensed it and built a pilot plant. The initial aim is to produce two tons of rare earth oxides per month, says Daniel Bina, TdVib’s president and CEO. The plant will recycle rare earths from old hard disk drives from data centers.</p>



<p>Noveon Magnetics, a company in San Marcos, Texas, is already making recycled neodymium-iron-boron magnets. In typical magnet manufacturing, the rare earths are mined, transformed into metal alloys, milled into a fine powder, magnetized and formed into a magnet. Noveon knocks out those first two steps, says company CEO Scott Dunn.</p>



<p>After demagnetizing and cleaning discarded magnets, Noveon directly mills them into a powder before building them back up as new magnets. Unlike with other recycling methods, there’s no need to extract and separate the rare earths out first. The final product can be more than 99 percent recycled magnet, Dunn says, with a small addition of virgin rare earth elements — the “secret sauce,” as he puts it — that allows the company to fine-tune the magnets’ attributes.</p>



<p>Compared with traditional magnet mining and manufacturing, Noveon’s method <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352186416300025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cuts energy use by about 90 percent</a>, Miha Zakotnik, Noveon’s chief technology officer, and other researchers reported in 2016 in <em>Environmental Technology &amp; Innovation</em>. Another 2016 analysis estimated that for every kilogram of magnet produced via Noveon’s method, about 12 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent are emitted. That’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827116006508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about half as much of the greenhouse gas as conventional magnets</a>.</p>



<p>Dunn declined to share what volume of magnets Noveon currently produces or how much its magnets cost. But the magnets are being used in some industrial applications, for pumps, fans and compressors, as well as some consumer power tools and other electronics.</p>

<h4>Rare earth recycling has logistical hurdles</h4>



<p>Even as researchers clear technological hurdles, there are still logistical barriers to recycling. “We don’t have the systems for collecting end-of-life products that have rare earths in them,” Fujita says, “and there’s the cost of dismantling those products.” For a lot of e-waste, before rare earth recycling can begin, you have to get to the bits that contain those precious metals.</p>



<p>Noveon has a semiautomated process for removing magnets from hard disk drives and other electronics.</p>



<p>Apple is also trying to automate the recycling process. The company’s Daisy robot can dismantle iPhones. And in 2022, Apple announced a pair of robots called Taz and Dave that facilitate the recycling of rare earths. Taz can gather magnet-containing modules that are typically lost during the shredding of electronics. Dave can recover magnets from taptic engines, Apple’s technology for providing users with tactile feedback when, say, tapping an iPhone screen.</p>



<p>Even with robotic aids, it would still be a lot easier if companies just designed products in a way that made recycling easy, Fujita says.</p>



<p>No matter how good recycling gets, Jowitt sees no getting around the need to ramp up mining to feed our rare earth–hungry society. But he agrees recycling is necessary. “We’re dealing with intrinsically finite resources,” he says. “Better we try and extract what we can rather than just dumping it in the landfill.”</p>

<p>With retractions piling up and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?sort=date&amp;term=Safarinejad%20MR&amp;cauthor_id=36626347">more than a dozen expressions</a> of concern now added to the list of his publishing woes, a urologist in Iran claims his research is being targeted by American drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<p>Mohammad Reza Safarinejad, who offered no evidence for his allegations, says he retired from academia about 10 years ago and now runs a <a href="http://safarinejad.com/">private clinic</a> in Tehran. He has published scores of studies on topics ranging from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.WNF.0000228210.12194.46">treatments for premature ejaculation</a> to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.3294">saffron&#8217;s effect on semen</a>, some of which have garnered hundreds of citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in 2011, however, journals began pulling his papers over such issues as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/12/31/urology-researcher-in-iran-has-third-paper-retracted/">failure to verify data</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/04/24/urology-researcher-in-iran-up-to-six-retractions/">inappropriate statistical analyses</a>. The <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477-5131(22)00279-0">latest retraction</a>, from August 2022, brings the tally up to 15, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSafarinejad%252c%2bMohammad%2bReza">Retraction Watch Database</a>. And on January 10, <em>The Journal of Urology</em> issued expressions of concern for 14 of his papers, which have been cited a total of nearly 800 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The journal states:</p>



<span id="more-126427"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Until the authors and their institutions can fully provide additional information, readers should interpret the findings presented with caution. An update will be provided when our investigation is complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Retraction Watch emailed Safarinejad for comments, he responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since 2006 after publishing two articles about Dapoxetine, Johnson &amp; Johnson Company is all trying to hit and retract my articles. During these years I have received too many fake emails and letters. I don&#8217;t know who you are and who do you work for.. But I know well that if the author&#8217;s rights are lost, he/she can do nothing. Most likely you are also from Johnson &amp; Johnson Company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He elaborated in another email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Publishing two articles about Dapoxetine had great impact in drop down of this drug as a drug of choice for treatment of premature of ejaculation by FDA. Despite extensive efforts of J&amp;J company using hired physicians and Editor-in Chiefs of dependent journals to hit me in any way I was among 2 percent of world scientists in 2020.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. But Jennifer Regala, director of publications at the American Urological Association, which publishes <em>The Journal of Urology</em>, told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm that the Journal&#8217;s Editorial Office and Dr. [Robert] Siemens [the journal’s editor] have not been contacted by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<p>We have also reached out to Dr. Safarinejad as part of our investigation but have not received a response.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern statements will remain on these articles until our investigation is complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal’s actions come on the heels of a letter to the editor in <em>Andrologia </em>by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">data sleuth Ben Mol</a> and his colleagues that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.14573">spotlighted suspicious numbers</a> in seven of the Iranian researcher&#8217;s clinical trials (none of them was published in <em>The Journal of Urology</em>, but one is the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Abstract/2006/09000/Comparison_of_Dapoxetine_Versus_Paroxetine_in.1.aspx">2006 study on dapoxetine</a> that Safarinejad said set off his troubles). Two of those studies, for instance, include rows of six data points that are entirely identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month after the letter was published, Mol brought his concerns to editors and publishers of several journals, including <em>The Journal of Urology</em>. He pointed out that Safarinejad&#8217;s top papers had been cited hundreds of times. &#8220;Through these citations,&#8221; he wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch, &#8220;fake data is continuously being implemented into reviews that are used for clinical practice.&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked if he had any financial ties to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mol told us, &#8220;Nope, not at all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On his LinkedIn profile, Safarinejad <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-reza-safarinejad-4382bb40">claims</a> that he has &#8220;been selected among the list that represents the top 2 percent of the most-cited scientists in the world&#8221; and has an H-index of 41. This <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/15/why-misconduct-could-keep-scientists-from-earning-highly-cited-researcher-designations-and-how-our-database-plays-a-part/">could change</a> if he is found to have committed scientific misconduct.</p>



<p>Safarinejad told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All of my articles have been retracted with reason of “Inappropriate Analyses”!!??&nbsp; The related journals didn’t accept to publish my reply. I proposed that all the article data be published on the Journal site as supplementary materials and the readers be the final judges. In addition we invite three well known independent statisticians and comment on the statistical analysis of the articles.&nbsp; Now we face a new scenario (expressions of concern) . I have not even received any letters or emails in this regard. Do you know what is their concern? I don’t know what is the subject. The Journal of Urology was the only journal that had resisted all the pressures so far. This journal seems to have surrendered too. Do you know what can I do? There is close relationship between pharmaceutical company and scientists and journals, there are many ghost writers, there are many hired writers and scientists etc.</p>

                <p>arXiv has pioneered open access for more than 30 years by removing financial, institutional, and geographic barriers to research. No paywalls or fees, no login required for reading. This approach – which gives researchers maximum control over the release of their results and broad visibility – transformed the research process and launched the open access movement.</p>
<p>However, access is not the same as accessibility, which is the practice of ensuring access regardless of disability. The vast majority of research papers posted to any journal or platform do not meet basic accessibility standards.</p>
<p>In 2022, arXiv completed intensive user research with over 40 people to determine the extent of the problem, evaluate current mitigation efforts, and consider solutions. This work, informed by arXiv staff, accessibility experts, and arXiv readers and authors who use assistive technology, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07286">posted on arXiv</a> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07286">PDF</a> and <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html">HTML</a> formats (arXivID: 2212.07286).</p>
<p>In extensive interviews, our research participants shared that finding research, reading it, preparing documents, and submitting work are all steps in the research process where people encounter barriers. In particular, interpreting math equations, figures, and charts is problematic.</p>
<p>Flexible content can help address these issues. Offering well-formatted HTML, alongside PDF and TeX source, will lead to critical accessibility gains. <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/21/arxiv-articles-as-responsive-web-pages/">arXiv’s collaboration with ar5iv</a>, which currently renders HTML for approximately 70% of arXiv papers, is a first step in this process. Next, we expect to reduce the error rate and add a link to HTML on arXiv abstract pages.</p>
<p>Accessibility of research papers is not a problem that arXiv can solve alone, and this will be an iterative, collaborative process.</p>
<p>In the words of arXiv users who generously shared their perspectives with us:</p>
<p><strong>“I prefer HTML versions. As an assistive tech user I find it much faster to navigate.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“HTML also works for the deaf community. English is a second language to deaf readers… they would rather get ASL. There are tools for converting HTML to ASL.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“In a dream world every technical document will just work [with screen readers]. In a smaller dream world, it just works on arXiv.”</strong></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-dna-jungle-fowl-genetics">Chicken DNA is replacing the genetics of their ancestral jungle fowl</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today’s red jungle fowl — the wild forebears of the domesticated chicken — are becoming more chickenlike. New research suggests that a large proportion of the wild fowl’s DNA has been inherited from chickens, and relatively recently.</p>



<p>Ongoing interbreeding between the two birds may threaten wild jungle fowl populations’ future, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and even hobble humans’ ability to breed better chickens</a>, researchers report January 19 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red jungle fowl (<em>Gallus gallus</em>) are forest birds native to Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. Thousands of years ago, humans domesticated the fowl, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-domestication-bones-origin-asia-rice-fields-exotic-animals">possibly in the region’s rice fields</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/6/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Chickens are arguably the most important domestic animal on Earth,” says Frank Rheindt, an evolutionary biologist at the National University of Singapore. He points to their global ubiquity and abundance.&nbsp; Chicken is also one of the cheapest sources of animal protein that humans have.</p>



<p>Domesticated chickens (<em>G. gallus domesticus</em>) were known to be interbreeding with jungle fowl near human settlements in Southeast Asia. Given the unknown impacts on jungle fowl and the importance of chickens to humankind, Rheindt and his team wanted to gather more details. Wild jungle fowl contain a store of genetic diversity that could serve as a crucial resource for breeding chickens resistant to diseases or other threats.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed and compared the genomes — the full complement of an organism’s DNA — of 63 jungle fowl and 51 chickens from across Southeast Asia. Some of the jungle fowl samples came from museum specimens collected from 1874 through 1939, letting the team see how the genetic makeup of jungle fowl has changed over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last century or so, wild jungle fowl’s genomes have become increasingly similar to chickens’. Between about 20 and 50 percent of the genomes of modern jungle fowl originated in chickens, the team found. In contrast, many of the roughly 100-year-old jungle fowl had a chicken-ancestry share in the range of a few percent.</p>



<p>The rapid change probably comes from human communities expanding into the region’s wilderness, Rheindt says. Most modern jungle fowl live in close vicinity to humans’ free-ranging chickens, with which they frequently interbreed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such interbreeding has become “almost the norm now” for any globally domesticated species, Rheindt says, such as dogs hybridizing with wolves and house cats crossing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with wildcats</a>. Pigs, meanwhile, are mixing with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-022-00517-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild boars</a> and ferrets <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/113/5/500/6657699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with polecats</a>.</p>





<p>Wild populations that interbreed with their domesticated counterparts could pick up physical or behavioral traits that change how the hybrids function in their ecosystem, says Claudio Quilodrán, a conservation geneticist at the University of Geneva not involved with this research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effect is likely to be negative, Quilodrán says, since some of the traits coming into the wild population have been honed for human uses, not for survival in the local environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wild jungle fowl have lost their genetic diversity as they’ve interbred too. The birds’ heterozygosity — a measure of a population’s genetic diversity — is now just a tenth of what it was a century ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This result is initially counterintuitive,” Rheindt says. “If you mix one population with another, you would generally expect a higher genetic diversity.”</p>



<p>But domesticated chickens have such low genetic diversity that certain versions of jungle fowl genes are being swept out of the population by a tsunami of genetic homogeneity.&nbsp;The whittling down of these animals’ genetic toolkit may leave them vulnerable to conservation threats.</p>



<p>“Having lots of genetic diversity within a species increases the chance that certain individuals contain the genetic background to adapt to a varied range of different environmental changes and diseases,” says Graham Etherington, a computational biologist at the Earlham Institute in Norwich, England, who was not involved with this research.</p>



<p>A shallower jungle fowl gene pool could also mean diminished resources for breeding better chickens.&nbsp;The genetics of wild relatives are sometimes used to bolster the disease or pest resistance of domesticated crop plants. Jungle fowl genomes could be similarly valuable for this reason.</p>



<p>“If this trend continues unabated, future human generations may only be able to access the entirety of ancestral genetic diversity of chickens in the form of museum specimens,” Rheindt says, which could hamper chicken breeding efforts using the wild fowl genes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some countries such as Singapore, Rheindt says, have started managing jungle fowl populations to reduce interbreeding with chickens.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-night-sky-bright-citizen-science">New data show how quickly light pollution is obscuring the night sky</a></h4>

              
                <p>The night sky has been brightening faster than researchers realized, thanks to the use of artificial lights at night. A study of more than 50,000 observations of stars by citizen scientists reveals that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf4952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the night sky grew about 10 percent brighter</a>, on average, every year from 2011 to 2022.</p>



<p>In other words, a baby born in a region where roughly 250 stars were visible every night would see only 100 stars on their 18th birthday, researchers report in the Jan. 20 Science.</p>





<p>The perils of light pollution go far beyond not being able to see as many stars. Too much brightness at night can <a href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harm people’s health</a>, send <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-lights-out-philly-save-migrating-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migrating birds flying into buildings</a>, disrupt food webs by drawing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-foil-plant-insect-hookups-and-not-just-night">pollinating insects</a> toward lights instead of plants and may even interrupt <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-may-disrupt-firefly-sex">fireflies trying to have sex</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/17</em>; <em>SN: 8/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>“In a way, this is a call to action,” says astronomer Connie Walker of the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory in Tucson. “People should consider that this does have an impact on our lives. It’s not just astronomy. It impacts our health. It impacts other animals who cannot speak for themselves.”</p>



<p>Walker works with the <a href="https://www.globeatnight.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globe at Night</a> campaign, which began in the mid-2000s as an outreach project to connect students in Arizona and Chile and now has thousands of participants worldwide. Contributors compare the stars they can see with maps of what stars would be visible at different levels of light pollution, and enter the results on an app.</p>



<p>“I’d been quite skeptical of Globe at Night” as a tool for precision research, admits physicist Christopher Kyba of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. But the power is in the sheer numbers: Kyba and colleagues analyzed 51,351 individual data points collected from 2011 to 2022.</p>



<p>“The individual data are not precise, but there’s a whole lot of them,” he says. “This Globe at Night project is not just a game; it’s really useful data. And the more people participate, the more powerful it gets.”</p>



<p>Those data, combined with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/third-population-cant-see-milky-way-night">a global atlas of sky luminance</a> published <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=4.00&amp;lat=45.8720&amp;lon=14.5470&amp;layers=B0FFFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFFF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2016</a>, allowed the team to conclude that the night sky’s brightness increased by an average 9.6 percent per year from 2011 to 2022 (<em>SN: 6/10/16</em>).</p>



<p>Most of that increase was missed by satellites that collect brightness data across the globe. Those measurements saw just a 2 percent increase in brightness per year over the last decade.</p>





<p>There are several reasons for that, Kyba says. Since the early 2010s, many outdoor lights have switched from high-pressure sodium lightbulbs to LEDs. LEDs are more energy efficient, which has environmental benefits and cost savings.</p>



<p>But LEDs also emit more short-wavelength blue light, which scatters off particles in the atmosphere more than sodium bulbs’ orange light, creating more sky glow. Existing satellites are not sensitive to blue wavelengths, so they underestimate the light pollution coming from LEDs. And satellites may miss light that shines toward the horizon, such as light emitted by a sign or from a window, rather than straight up or down.</p>

<p>Astronomer and light pollution researcher John Barentine was not surprised that satellites underestimated the problem. But “I was still surprised by how much of an underestimate it was,” he says. “This paper is confirming that we’ve been undercounting light pollution in the world.”</p>



<p>The good news is that no major technological breakthroughs are needed to help fix the problem. Scientists and policy makers just need to convince people to change how they use light at night — easier said than done.</p>



<p>“People sometimes say light pollution is the easiest pollution to solve, because you just have to turn a switch and it goes away,” Kyba says. “That’s true. But it’s ignoring the social problem — that this overall problem of light pollution is made by billions of individual decisions.”</p>



<p>Some simple solutions include dimming or turning off lights overnight, especially floodlighting or lights in empty parking lots.</p>



<p>Kyba shared a story about a church in Slovenia that switched from four 400-watt floodlights to a single 58-watt LED, shining behind a cutout of the church to focus the light on its facade. The result was a 96 percent reduction in energy use and much less wasted light , Kyba reported in the <em>International Journal of Sustainable Lighting </em>in 2018. The <a href="https://lightingjournal.org/index.php/path/article/view/80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">church was still lit up</a>, but the grass, trees and sky around it remained dark.</p>



<p>“If it was possible to replicate that story over and over again throughout our society, it would suggest you could really drastically reduce the light in the sky, still have a lit environment and have better vision and consume a lot less energy,” he says. “This is kind of the dream.”</p>



<p>Barentine, who leads a private dark-sky consulting firm, thinks widespread awareness of the problem — and subsequent action — could be imminent. For comparison, he points to a highly publicized <a href="https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil slick fire on the Cuyahoga River</a>, outside of Cleveland, in 1969 that fueled the environmental movement of the 1960s and ’70s, and prompted the U.S. Congress to pass the Clean Water Act.</p>



<p>“I think we’re on the precipice, maybe, of having the river-on-fire moment for light pollution,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-worsen-allergy-symptoms-hay-fever">Too much of this bacteria in the nose may worsen allergy symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <p>A type of bacteria that’s overabundant in the nasal passages of people with hay fever may worsen symptoms. Targeting that bacteria may provide a way to rein in ever-running noses.</p>



<p>Hay fever occurs when allergens, such as pollen or mold, trigger an inflammatory reaction in the nasal passages, leading to itchiness, sneezing and overflowing mucus. Researchers analyzed the composition of the microbial population in the noses of 55 people who have hay fever and those of 105 people who don’t. There was less diversity in the nasal microbiome of people who have hay fever and a whole lot <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01301-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of a bacterial species called <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em></a>, the team reports online January 12 in <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. &nbsp;</p>





<p><em>S. salivarius</em> was 17 times more abundant in the noses of allergy sufferers than the noses of those without allergies, says Michael Otto, a molecular microbiologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. That imbalance appears to play a part in further provoking allergy symptoms. In laboratory experiments with allergen-exposed cells that line the airways, <em>S. salivarius</em> boosted the cells’ production of proteins that promote inflammation.</p>



<p>And it turns out that <em>S. salivarius</em> really likes runny noses. One prominent, unpleasant symptom of hay fever is the overproduction of nasal discharge. The researchers found that <em>S. salivarius</em> binds very well to airway-lining cells exposed to an allergen and slathered in mucus — better than a comparison bacteria that also resides in the nose.</p>



<p>The close contact appears to be what makes the difference. It means that substances on <em>S.</em> <em>salivarius’</em> surface that can drive inflammation — common among many bacteria — are close enough to exert their effect on cells, Otto says.</p>



<p>Hay fever, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4324099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupts daily activities and disturbs sleep</a>, is estimated to affect as many as 30 percent of adults in the United States. The new research opens the door “to future studies targeting this bacteria” as a potential treatment for hay fever, says Mahboobeh Mahdavinia, a physician scientist who studies immunology and allergies at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. </p>



<p>But any treatment would need to avoid harming the “good” bacteria that live in the nose, says Mahdavinia, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>The proteins on <em>S. salivarius’ </em>surface that are important to its ability to attach to mucus-covered cells might provide a target, says Otto. The bacteria bind to proteins called mucins found in the slimy, runny mucus. By learning more about <em>S. salivarius’ </em>surface proteins, Otto says, it may be possible to come up with “specific methods to block that adhesion.”</p>

<p>A highly cited economics paper that suggested people raised during recessions were more likely to vote for left-leaning political parties has been retracted, apparently due to a coding error that rendered the results invalid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction marks a rarity among economics papers, which research has shown are infrequently retracted compared to papers on other subjects. The article appears to be the first in <em>The Review of Economic Studies</em> to have been retracted for a reason other than publisher error.</p>



<p>The study’s authors, Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo, are economists at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles and the International Monetary Fund, respectively. Giuliano is also the Chauncey J. Medberry Chair in Management at UCLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper,<a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/81/2/787/1520611?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> “Growing up in a Recession,”</a> was published in November 2013. It has been cited 222 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/political-efficacy-and-participation_4548cad8-en">Working</a> <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/an-updated-oecd-framework-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-to-meet-current-and-future-challenges_b6c5478c-en">papers</a> from the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37569">World</a> <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36913">Bank</a> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have also cited the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126415"></span>



<p>The paper was retracted on January 11. According to the retraction notice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors and editorial team are retracting this article because the original findings cannot be replicated, likely as a result of an inadvertent coding error. While the original codes and data sets are no longer available, new analysis with a markedly similar data set does not support the original results.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the paper’s authors nor the editors of the journal responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023060848id_/http://www.anderson.ucla.edu:80/faculty/paola.giuliano/Recession_RESTUD.pdf">study</a> has received a fair amount of media attention. An article in<a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/12/03/study_recession_could_create_a_generation_of_democrats_partner/"> <em>Salon</em></a>, published soon after the final version of the study, was titled, “Has the recession spawned a generation of Democrats?” An earlier, working version of the article available in 2009 sparked an opinion piece in the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/opinion/30douthat.html"> <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>from conservative columnist Ross Douthat. More recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/15/the-2000-stimulus-cheques-alone-wont-work-the-us-needs-better-infrastructure">articles</a> have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-covid-19-led-to-donald-trumps-defeat-150110">cited the study</a> in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. government’s response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retractions from economics journals have been rarer than for some other subjects, such as the biomedical sciences. A<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/12/12/why-arent-there-more-retractions-in-business-and-economics-journals/"> 2012 study</a> examining retractions of economics papers for plagiarism found only six going back to 2009. But the Retraction Watch Database shows that around 700 economics papers were retracted between 2013 and December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion of the retraction on Twitter was mixed. Economist Florian Ederer<a href="https://twitter.com/florianederer/status/1613112047926902786"> </a>applauded the authors for retracting the paper.</p>

<p>Others were more critical of the retraction notice, particularly the assertion that the code used in the study no longer exists.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t really understand the reason,” wrote Tim Martens, an assistant professor of accounting at Bocconi University in Italy, in a<a href="https://twitter.com/econ_martens/status/1613116811079258113"> reply to Ederer’s tweet</a>. “Did their dogs eat the code?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hydrogel-electronics-nanostructure-materials">Want a ‘Shrinky Dinks’ approach to nano-sized devices? Try hydrogels</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-tech shrink art may be the key to making tiny electronics, 3-D nanostructures or even holograms for hiding secret messages.</p>



<p>A new approach to making tiny structures relies on <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrinking them down after building them</a>, rather than making them small to begin with, researchers report in the Dec. 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The key is spongelike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breakup-doesnt-keep-hydrogel-down">hydrogel materials</a> that expand or contract in response to surrounding chemicals (<em>SN: 1/20/10</em>). By inscribing patterns in hydrogels with a laser and then shrinking the gels down to about one-thirteenth their original size, the researchers created patterns with details as small as 25 billionths of a meter across.</p>





<p>At that level of precision, the researchers could create letters small enough to easily write this entire article along the circumference of a typical human hair.</p>



<p>Biological scientist Yongxin Zhao and colleagues deposited a variety of materials in the patterns to create nanoscopic images of Chinese zodiac animals. By shrinking the hydrogels after laser etching, several of the images ended up roughly the size of a red blood cell. They included a monkey made of silver, a gold-silver alloy pig, a titanium dioxide snake, an iron oxide dog and a rabbit made of luminescent nanoparticles.</p>

The red stripes on the left dragon are each just 200 nanometers thick.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120791">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Carnegie Mellon University</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Because the hydrogels can be repeatedly shrunk and expanded with chemical baths, the researchers were also able to create holograms in layers inside a chunk of hydrogel to encode secret information. Shrinking a hydrogel hologram makes it unreadable. “If you want to read it, you have to expand the sample,” says Zhao, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “But you need to expand it to exactly the same extent” as the original. In effect, knowing how much to expand the hydrogel serves as a key to unlock the information hidden inside. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the most exciting aspect of the research, Zhao says, is the wide range of materials that researchers can use on such minute scales. “We will be able to combine different types of materials together and make truly functional nanodevices.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-microbes-eat-virus-virovory-algae">Scientists have found the first known microbes that can eat only viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>New Year, new viral diet — literally.</p>



<p>Tiny, pond-dwelling <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215000120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Halteria</em> ciliates are virovores</a>, able to survive on a virus-only diet, researchers report December 27 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The single-celled creatures are the first known to thrive when viruses alone are on the menu.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that some microscopic organisms snack on aquatic viruses such as chloroviruses, which infect and kill algae. But it was unclear whether viruses alone could provide enough nutrients for an organism to grow and reproduce, says ecologist John DeLong of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>





<p>In laboratory experiments, <em>Halteria</em> that were living in water droplets and given only chloroviruses for sustenance reproduced, DeLong and colleagues found. As the number of viruses in the water dwindled, <em>Halteria</em> numbers went up. Ciliates without access to viral morsels, or any other food, didn’t multiply. But <em>Paramecium</em>, a larger microbe, didn’t thrive on a virus-only diet, hinting that viruses can’t satisfy the nutritional requirements for all ciliates to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Viruses could be a good source of phosphorus, which is essential for making copies of genetic material, DeLong says. But it probably takes a lot of viruses to account for a full meal.</p>



<p>In the lab, each <em>Halteria</em> microbe ate about 10,000 to 1 million viruses daily, the team estimates. <em>Halteria</em> in small ponds with abundant viral snacks might chow down on about a quadrillion viruses per day.</p>



<p>These feasts could shunt previously unrecognized energy into the food web, and add a new layer to the way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-plankton-held-hostage-pirate-viruses">viruses move carbon</a> through an ecosystem — if it happens in the wild, DeLong says (<em>SN: 6/9/16</em>). His team plans to start finding out once ponds in Nebraska thaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ben-mol.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="151" height="227" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ben-mol.jpeg?resize=151%2C227" alt="" class="wp-image-122833" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ben Mol</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There shouldn’t have been many differences between the women recruited for the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14767058.2015.1011121?journalCode=ijmf20">three</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767058.2016.1192601">clinical</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-015-3911-y">trials</a>: All of them gave birth at the same two Cairo hospitals over a period of less than three years, and all of them were treated to prevent or manage postpartum bleeding. Three samples from this pool of patients, Ben Mol felt, should have had largely similar baseline characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, mysteriously, the women’s mean age and BMI varied markedly across the studies—from 25 to 34 years and from 25 to 29 kg/m2, respectively—as did the birthweight of their babies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the researcher turned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">data sleuth</a> began digging. His worries only grew. Eventually, he would come to question the integrity of <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">nearly two dozen randomized controlled trials</a> led by Ahmed Maged, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Egypt&#8217;s top medical school, Kasr AlAiny at Cairo University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, based in part on Mol’s findings, two journals published by Taylor &amp; Francis have issued a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">retraction</a> and nine expressions of concern for the following papers:</p>



<span id="more-126410"></span>

</ul>



<p>&#8220;What we see here, nine expressions of concern in one month, is really a breakthrough,&#8221; Ben Mol, who leads the Evidence-based Women’s Health Care research group at Monash University, in Australia, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Among these titles, there are papers that inform the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, which is maternal-mortality cause number one around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This stuff ends up in <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011689.pub2/full">meta-analyses</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This is the first time a journal has publicly expressed concern over Maged’s work. Mol, however, has taken aim at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">research</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/10/critics-face-legal-threats-as-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-act/">from</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/">Egypt</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/15/how-journal-editors-kept-questionable-data-about-womens-health-out-of-the-literature-years-before-retractions/">several</a> times before, using statistical techniques and simple reasoning to flag potential fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor and publisher of <em>The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care</em>, which retracted a 2018 report by Maged and his colleagues titled “Benefits of vaginal misoprostol prior to IUD insertion in women with previous caesarean delivery: a randomised controlled trial,” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">state</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, significant concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data and reported results in the article. While the authors have fully cooperated with the investigation and provided information in response to our queries, they have not been able to adequately address the concerns raised. As we cannot verify the validity of the published work, we are therefore retracting the article. The authors listed in this publication have been informed, and they do not agree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science; the nine papers that earned expressions of concern from <em>The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine</em> have been cited 86 times in total. </p>



<p>In each of these nine cases, the journal notes that the authors have provided their raw data, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have also referred concerns about this paper to the authors’ institution, in order to conduct a full investigation. As this investigation may take some time to resolve, we advise readers to interpret the information presented in the article with due caution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sabina Alam, director of Publishing Ethics and Integrity at Taylor &amp; Francis, told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction and expressions of concern notices have come about as a result of an investigation being carried out by my Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity team. This investigation does stem partly from concerns raised by Ben Mol about specific papers, but also partly from issues raised through internal audits of our journals. We take cases of unethical conduct very seriously and comply fully with COPE guidelines in any investigation we undertake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added that her team nearly doubled in size last year, reflecting a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">growing industry trend</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis has been investing in resources for ethics and integrity so that my team is now able to lead all large or complex ethics cases, like this one. This brings more expertise and consistency to the investigations and subsequent resolutions of such cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expressions of concern include two of the three studies of women with postpartum bleeding. The third was published in the Springer journal <em>Maternal-Fetal Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol emailed Maged with his concerns in the summer of 2020, two months before he and his colleagues submitted <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">the paper</a> detailing their findings to the <em>American Journal of Perinatology</em>. Later, he also shared his misgivings with the 13 journals that have published the dozens of reports spawned by Maged&#8217;s clinical trials. So far, Taylor &amp; Francis is the only publisher to have taken visible measures as a result.</p>



<p>Maged has defended his work vociferously on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Ahmed+M.+Maged%22">PubPeer</a>, but appears to have offered little by way of evidence or scientific explanations. Instead, in an August email to Monash that Retraction Watch has seen, he accused Mol of &#8220;racist behavior&#8221; and &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; He sounded the same notes in an email to Retraction Watch, adding several unsubstantiated claims and noting that he and his coauthors:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… completely refused the retraction as no evidence that require retraction was proved by either the complainer or the editor. The authors believe that if all these issues undergo a fair, ethical, and unbiased investigations, the journal will withdraw the retraction and expression of concerns.</p>



<p>Wait for the new evidence and changes of these decisions within the near time</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mol told Retraction Watch what drives him “is that I&#8217;m very concerned actually about the impact [scientific misconduct] has on the outcomes of meta-analyses and therefore guidelines all around the world.”</p>



<p>He believes fraud is much more widespread in the literature than most people realize and that blindly trusting the data is a risky proposition:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>So it&#8217;s nice to say that we should work on trust, but whether you talk about your tax return or sports or the safety of airplanes, right, there are controls and checks there … I think that nobody actually has really considered that this happened on such a large scale, and I think that is still part of the problem that editors and publishers do not believe that it&#8217;s happening on such a big scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidna-snot-bubble-cooling">These adorable Australian spike-balls beat the heat with snot bubbles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals cover themselves in all kinds of unsavory fluids to keep cool. Humans sweat, kangaroos spit and some birds will urinate on themselves to survive hot days. It turns out that echidnas do something much cuter — though perhaps just as sticky (and slightly icky) — to beat the heat.</p>



<p>The spiny insectivores <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay cool by blowing snot bubbles</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. The bubbles pop, keeping the critters’ noses moist. As it evaporates, this moisture draws heat away from a blood-filled sinus in the echidna’s beak, helping to cool the animal’s blood.</p>





<p>Short-beaked echidnas (<em>Tachyglossus aculeatus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidnas-do-list-sleep-eat-dig-australia">look a bit like hedgehogs but are really monotremes</a> — egg-laying mammals unique to Australia and New Guinea (<em>SN: 11/18/16</em>). Previous lab studies showed that temperatures above 35° Celsius (95° Fahrenheit) should kill echidnas. But echidnas don’t seem to have gotten the memo. They live everywhere from tropical rainforests to deserts to snow-capped peaks, leaving scientists with a physiological puzzle.</p>



<p>Mammals evaporate water to keep cool when temperatures climb above their body temperatures, says environmental physiologist Christine Cooper of Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “Lots of mammals do that by either licking, sweating or panting,” she says. “Echidnas weren’t believed to be able to do that.” But it’s known that the critters blow snot bubbles when it gets hot.</p>



<p>So, armed with a heat-vision camera and a telephoto lens, Cooper and environmental physiologist Philip Withers of the University of Western Australia in Perth drove through nature reserves in Western Australia once a month for a year to film echidnas.</p>



<p>In infrared, the warmest parts of the echidnas’ spiny bodies glowed in oranges, yellows and whites. But the video revealed that the tips of their noses were dark purple blobs, kept cool as moisture from their snot bubbles evaporated. Echidnas might also lose heat through their bellies and legs, the researchers report, while their spikes could act as an insulator.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An echidna looks like a hot spiky ball of yellow, orange and white in this heat-vision video — except for its chilly nose, which shows up as a purple and black blob. That’s because these Australian mammals blow snot bubbles to keep their noses wet, which cools the critters down as the moisture evaporates, a new study concludes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Finding a way of doing this work in the field is pretty exciting,” says physiological ecologist Stewart Nicol of the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, who was not involved in the study. “You can understand animals and see how they&#8217;re responding to their normal environment.” The next step, he says, is to quantify how much heat echidnas really lose through their noses and other body parts.</p>



<p>Monotremes parted evolutionary ways with other mammals between 250 million and 160 million years ago as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tethys-ocean-implicated-pangaea-breakup">the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/15</em>). So “they have a whole lot of traits that are considered to be primitive,” Cooper says. “Understanding how they might thermoregulate can give us some ideas about how thermal regulation … might have evolved in mammals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemists-long-lasting-roman-concrete">These chemists cracked the code to long-lasting Roman concrete</a></h4>

              
                <p>MIT chemist Admir Masic really hoped his experiment wouldn’t explode.</p>



<p>Masic and his colleagues were trying to re-create an ancient Roman technique for making concrete, a mix of cement, gravel, sand and water. The researchers suspected that the key was a process called “hot mixing,” in which dry granules of calcium oxide, also called quicklime, are mixed with volcanic ash to make the cement. Then water is added.</p>



<p>Hot mixing, they thought, would ultimately produce a cement that wasn’t completely smooth and mixed, but instead contained small calcium-rich rocks. Those little rocks, ubiquitous in the walls of the Romans’ concrete buildings, might be the key to why those structures have withstood the ravages of time.</p>





<p>That’s not how modern cement is made. The reaction of quicklime with water is highly exothermic, meaning that it can produce a lot of heat — and possibly an explosion.</p>



<p>“Everyone would say, ‘You are crazy,’” Masic says.</p>



<p>But no big bang happened. Instead, the reaction produced only heat, a damp sigh of water vapor — and a Romans-like cement mixture bearing small white calcium-rich rocks.</p>



<p>Researchers have been trying for decades to re-create the Roman recipe for concrete longevity — but with little success. The idea that hot mixing was the key was an educated guess.</p>



<p>Masic and colleagues had pored over texts by Roman architect Vitruvius and historian Pliny, which offered some clues as to how to proceed. These texts cited, for example, strict specifications for the raw materials, such as that the limestone that is the source of the quicklime must be very pure, and that mixing quicklime with hot ash and then adding water could produce a lot of heat.</p>



<p>The rocks were not mentioned, but the team had a feeling they were important.</p>





<p>“In every sample we have seen of ancient Roman concrete, you can find these white inclusions,” bits of rock embedded in the walls. For many years, Masic says, the origin of those inclusions was unclear — researchers suspected incomplete mixing of the cement, perhaps. But these are the highly organized Romans we’re talking about. How likely is it that “every operator [was] not mixing properly and every single [building] has a flaw?”</p>



<p>What if, the team suggested, these inclusions in the cement were actually a feature, not a bug? The researchers’ chemical analyses of such rocks embedded in the walls at the archaeological site of Privernum in Italy indicated that the inclusions were very calcium-rich. </p>



<p>That suggested the tantalizing possibility that these rocks might be helping the buildings heal themselves from cracks due to weathering or even an earthquake. A ready supply of calcium was already on hand: It would dissolve, seep into the cracks and re-crystallize. Voila! Scar healed.</p>



<p>But could the team observe this in action? Step one was to re-create the rocks via hot mixing and hope nothing exploded. Step two: Test the Roman-inspired cement. The team created concrete with and without the hot mixing process and tested them side by side. Each block of concrete was broken in half, the pieces placed a small distance apart. Then water was trickled through the crack to see how long it took before the seepage stopped.</p>



<p>“The results were stunning,” Masic says. The blocks incorporating hot mixed cement healed within two to three weeks. The concrete produced without hot mixed cement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never healed at all</a>, the team reports January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Cracking the recipe could be a boon to the planet. The Pantheon and its soaring, detailed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-concrete-planet-strange-and-fascinating-story-worlds-most-common-man-made">concrete dome have stood nearly 2,000 years</a>, for instance, while modern concrete structures have a lifespan of perhaps 150 years, and that’s a best case scenario (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>). And the Romans didn’t have steel reinforcement bars shoring up their structures.</p>



<p>More frequent replacements of concrete structures means more greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete manufacturing is a huge source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, so longer-lasting versions could reduce that carbon footprint. &#8220;We make 4 gigatons per year of this material,” Masic says. That manufacture produces as much as 1 metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per metric ton of produced concrete, currently amounting to about 8 percent of annual global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>



<p>Still, Masic says, the concrete industry is resistant to change. For one thing, there are concerns about introducing new chemistry into a tried-and-true mixture with well-known mechanical properties. But “the key bottleneck in the industry is the cost,” he says. Concrete is cheap, and companies don’t want to price themselves out of competition.</p>



<p>The researchers hope that reintroducing this technique that has stood the test of time, and that could involve little added cost to manufacture, could answer both these concerns. In fact, they’re banking on it: Masic and several of his colleagues have created a startup they call DMAT that is currently seeking seed money to begin to commercially produce the Roman-inspired hot-mixed concrete. “It’s very appealing simply because it’s a thousands-of-years-old material.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cyclones-arctic-intense-frequent-climate">Cyclones in the Arctic are becoming more intense and frequent</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> – In January 2022, a cyclone blitzed a large expanse of ice-covered ocean between Greenland and Russia. Frenzied gusts galvanized 8-meter-tall waves that pounded the region’s hapless flotillas of sea ice, while a bombardment of warm rain and a surge of southerly heat laid siege from the air.</p>



<p>Six days after the assault began, about a quarter, or roughly 400,000 square kilometers, of the vast area’s sea ice had disappeared, leading to a record weekly loss for the region.</p>





<p>The storm is the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD037161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest Arctic cyclone ever documented</a>. But it may not hold that title for long. Cyclones in the Arctic have become more frequent and intense in recent decades, posing risks to both sea ice and people, researchers reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. “This trend is expected to persist as the region continues to warm rapidly in the future,” says climate scientist Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<h4>Rapid Arctic warming and more destructive storms</h4>



<p>The Arctic Circle is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">about four times as fast</a> as the rest of Earth (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). A major driver is the loss of sea ice due to human-caused climate change. The floating ice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-reflection-light-dim-earthshine-moon-solar-radiation">reflects far more solar radiation</a> back into space than naked seas do, influencing the global climate (<em>SN: 10/14/21</em>). During August, the heart of the sea ice melting season, cyclones have been observed to amplify sea ice losses on average, exacerbating warming.</p>



<p>There’s more: Like hurricanes can ravage regions farther south, boreal vortices can threaten <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-report-card-how-poor-environmental-health-affects-everyday-life">people living and traveling in the Arctic</a> (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). As the storms intensify, “stronger winds pose a risk for marine navigation by generating higher waves,” Vavrus says, “and for coastal erosion, which has already become a serious problem throughout much of the Arctic and forced some communities to consider relocating inland.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">Climate change is intensifying storms farther south</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). But it’s unclear how Arctic cyclones might be changing as the world warms. Some previous research suggested that pressures, on average, in Arctic cyclones’ cores have dropped in recent decades. That would be problematic, as lower pressures generally mean more intense storms, with “stronger winds, larger temperature variations and heavier rainfall [and] snowfall,” says atmospheric scientist Xiangdong Zhang of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</p>



<p>But inconsistencies between analyses had prevented a clear trend from emerging, Zhang said at the meeting. So he and his colleagues aggregated a comprehensive record, spanning 1950 to 2021, of Arctic cyclone timing, intensity and duration.</p>



<p><a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1095296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctic cyclone activity has intensified in strength and frequency</a> over recent decades, Zhang reported. Pressures in the hearts of today’s boreal vortices are on average about 9 millibars lower than in the 1950s. For context, such a pressure shift would be roughly equivalent to bumping a strong category 1 hurricane well into category 2 territory. And vortices became more frequent during winters in the North Atlantic Arctic and during summers in the Arctic north of Eurasia.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Storm surge</h3>



<p>In the last decade, strong vortices — with central pressures lower than 990 millibars — appeared in the Arctic more often each year, on average, than in the 1950s, up about 20 percent in the winter and 35 percent in the summer.</p>

<p>What’s more, August cyclones appear to be <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1053374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damaging sea ice more than in the past</a>, said meteorologist Peter Finocchio of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, Calif. He and his colleagues compared the response of northern sea ice to summer cyclones during the 1990s and the 2010s.</p>



<p>August vortices in the latter decade were followed by a 10 percent loss of sea ice area on average, up from the earlier decade’s 3 percent loss on average. This may be due, in part, to warmer water upwelling from below, which can melt the ice pack’s underbelly, and from winds pushing the thinner, easier-to-move ice around, Finocchio said.</p>



<h4>Stronger spring storms spell trouble too</h4>



<p>With climate change, cyclones may <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1092888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue intensifying in the spring too</a>, climate scientist Chelsea Parker said at the meeting. That’s a problem because spring vortices can prime sea ice for later summer melting.</p>



<p>Parker, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and her colleagues ran computer simulations of spring cyclone behavior in the Arctic under past, present and projected climate conditions. By the end of the century, the maximum near-surface wind speeds of spring cyclones — around 11 kilometers per hour today — could reach 60 km/h, the researchers found. And future spring cyclones may keep swirling at peak intensity for up to a quarter of their life spans, up from around 1 percent today. The storms will probably travel farther too, the team says.</p>



<p>“The diminishing sea ice cover will enable the warmer Arctic seas to fuel these storms and probably allow them to penetrate farther into the Arctic,” says Vavrus, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Parker and her team plan to investigate the future evolution of Arctic cyclones in other seasons, to capture a broader picture of how climate change is affecting the storms.</p>



<p>For now, it seems certain that Arctic cyclones aren’t going anywhere. What&#8217;s less clear is how humankind will contend with the storms&#8217; growing fury.</p>

<p>In October 2021, a Reddit user on the r/badscience subforum posted a long critique of an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">article published in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a> earlier that year that had analyzed the “anti-vaccination infodemic” on Twitter and concluded that former U.S. president Donald Trump was “the main driver of vaccine misinformation” on the platform before his account was suspended.</p>



<p>The critique, titled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/qbma8a/terrible_plosone_paper_dissected/">Terrible PlosOne Paper Dissected</a>,” listed concerns about the sample size (50 pro-vaccine and 50 anti-vaccine accounts), method of selecting the sample and control groups, and data analysis. The Redditor also looked at the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">reviews</a> of the article which <em>PLOS ONE</em> made available, and concluded that “clearly neither reviewer actually read it in any detail.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day after the comment was posted, an account for PLOS Communications responded, thanking the user “for your post publication peer review” and saying that <em>PLOS ONE</em> was looking into the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126400"></span>



<p>According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, the PLOS publication ethics team emailed the corresponding author on the article in June 2022 with the subject line “Request for clarification about published PLOS ONE article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, the article was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The lengthy retraction notice detailed a back-and-forth with the authors about methodological concerns in the article. The editors concluded those concerns meant the paper “did not meet <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s publication criteria,” but one of the authors told us he believes a correction could have addressed them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">The anti-vaccination infodemic on social media: A behavioral analysis</a>” appeared in March 2021. Written by Federico Germani and Nikola Biller-Andorno of the Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, the paper has been cited 95 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/101269615">Altmetrics shows</a> pickup in several news stories, as well as a <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37970">working paper</a> from the World Bank.</p>



<p>The June email from the PLOS publication ethics team stated that “some concerns have been raised regarding your article with respect to some clarity in the reporting and methodology,” and asked the authors to submit a revision to the article with specific changes “in order to comply with our publication criteria.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Germani, the corresponding author, sent the journal an updated version of the paper less than two weeks after receiving the request. But he didn’t hear back for months, he told us, until an October email from the publication ethics team informed him and his co-author that the editors had decided to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The email included a draft of the retraction notice listing methodological concerns, to which the authors responded in detail in their appeal of the decision. The journal rejected their appeal and sent them a revised retraction notice in November. After more back-and-forth about the wording of the notice, the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279796">retraction was published</a> on Dec. 22, 2022. The notice began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding the methodology, results, and conclusions presented in this article. The editorial team and a subject expert have re-evaluated the article and determined that the concerns listed below remain unresolved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice listed five bullet points of concerns, including this one:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reported conclusion “Our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, before his profile was suspended, was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter.” is not supported by the research reported in this study. Although the reported results suggests [sic] that people who tweet anti-vaccine content are likely to be in Trump’s network, the reported results are not sufficient to support the claim that Trump himself is driving vaccine misinformation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rest of the notice contains the authors’ response to the concerns. About Trump:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Regarding the conclusion, the authors agreed that the sentence regarding Trump’s role, taken out of context, is not supported by the data presented in the paper, but they maintain that their results, as described in the discussion section, show that Trump’s profile was, at the time, “the main influencer in the anti-vaccination web” on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642#pone.0279796.ref001">1</a>] because, per our editorial assessment, it did not meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria (#3, 4) [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642#pone.0279796.ref002">2</a>]. We regret that the issues with the article were not identified and addressed prior to its publication.</p>



<p>Both authors did not agree with the retraction and stand by the article’s findings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Germani told us he thought the journal’s initial request for a revision to the paper “would have been a reasonable approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his co-author, Biller-Andorno, disagreed with the editorial team and subject expert’s assessment of the methodological concerns, he said, but were “happy to have the opportunity to make corrections to the paper,” and the back-and-forth of corrections, or a response article and reply, “is just how science should work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings about Trump’s role in the anti-vaccine Twitter community were a surprise to him, he said, and he expressed concern that political considerations could have influenced the retraction decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s not clear to us why this paper had to be retracted at all costs and with little communication from the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Germani and Biller-Andorno have posted a revised version of the paper as a <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7528138#.Y8Bn3ezMKhx">preprint</a>, with a disclaimer detailing the history with <em>PLOS ONE</em> and a supplementary PDF responding to the issues listed in the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to PLOS for comment on Germani’s concern that PLOS’s editors may have felt political pressure to retract the article. Renee Hoch, managing editor for publication ethics, responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The claim is untrue. The retraction decision reflects PLOS’ assessment of how the unresolved issues identified in our post-publication editorial assessment aligned with the PLOS Retraction Policy and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Retraction Guidelines. External parties do not contribute to or influence our editorial decisions.</p>



<p>We recognize that individuals raising concerns may have potential competing interests. Our Publication Ethics team and journal editors are well-versed at evaluating potential competing interests and isolating scientific and ethical criticisms/concerns from personal assertions, opinions, or agendas that sometimes accompany complaints. We focus our investigations on the scientific and ethical concerns, and our editorial decisions reflect our assessment of how any verified and unresolved concerns align with PLOS policies, journal requirements, and relevant COPE guidance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We had also asked through what venue concerns were raised about the paper, and Hoch pointed us to the Reddit post. As for why the issues with the paper weren’t raised during peer-review, before the article was accepted for publication, she said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reddit posts discussed concerns about the article’s published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">peer review history</a>. We cannot disclose any unpublished information about the article’s peer review. However, in responding to the concerns raised in this case we completed a thorough, rigorous assessment of the article and obtained input from a well-qualified expert. We regret that the issues identified in this assessment did not surface during the pre-publication peer review.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She also noted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We addressed why these cases take so long sometimes, and why some of these issues are not caught before, in this blog post, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-publication-ethics-a-frank-discussion-on-handling-difficult-cases/#issuesnotidentified">here</a>. It&#8217;s quite a good read.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-lightning-rod-electricity">A powerful laser can redirect lightning strikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a high-tech hammer of Thor, a powerful laser can grab hold of a lightning bolt and reroute its path through the sky.</p>



<p>In a mountaintop experiment, such a laser <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01139-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bent lightning toward a lightning rod</a>, researchers report online January 16 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>. Scientists have used lasers to wrangle electricity in the lab before, but this is the first demonstration that the technique works in real-world storms and could someday lead to better protection against lightning.</p>





<p>Today’s most common anti-lightning tech is the classic lightning rod, a meters-long metal pole rooted to the ground. The metal’s conductivity lures in lightning that might otherwise strike nearby buildings or people, feeding that electricity safely into the earth. But the area shielded by a lightning rod is limited by the rod’s height.</p>



<p>“If you want to protect some large infrastructure, like an airport or a launching pad for rockets or a wind farm … then you would need, for good protection, a lightning rod of kilometer size, or hundreds of meters,” says Aurélien Houard, a physicist at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Palaiseau, France. Such a tall metal pole would be impractical. But a laser could reach that far, intercepting distant lightning bolts and ushering them down to ground-based metal rods.</p>



<p>Houard and his colleagues tested this idea atop the Säntis mountain in northeastern Switzerland. They set up a high-power laser near a telecommunications tower tipped with a lightning rod that is struck by lightning around 100 times every year. The laser was beamed at the sky for about six hours total during thunderstorms from July to September 2021.</p>

Houard <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Photonics</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The laser blasted short, intense bursts of infrared light at the clouds about 1,000 times per second. This train of light pulses ripped electrons off air molecules and knocked some air molecules out of its way, carving out a channel of low-density, charged plasma. Sort of like clearing a path through the woods and laying down pavement, this combination of effects made it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superfast-laser-pulses-could-pave-way-beam-weapons">easier for electric current to flow</a> along this route (<em>SN: 3/5/14</em>). That created a path of least resistance for lightning to follow through the sky.</p>



<p>Houard’s team tuned their laser so that it formed this electrically conductive pathway just above the tip of the tower. This allowed the tower’s lightning rod to intercept a bolt snagged by the laser before it zipped all the way down to the laser equipment.</p>



<p>The tower was hit by lightning four times while the laser was on. One of those strikes happened in a fairly clear sky, allowing two high-speed cameras to capture the moment. Those images showed lightning zigzagging down from the clouds and following the laser light for some 50 meters toward the tower’s lightning rod.</p>





<p>To track the paths of the three bolts that they could not see, the researchers looked at radio waves shed by the lightning. Those radio waves showed that the three strikes followed the path of the laser much more closely than other strikes that happened when the laser was off. This hinted that the laser guided these three strikes to the lightning rod, as well.</p>

<p>“It’s a real achievement,” says Howard Milchberg, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park not involved in the work. “People have been trying to do this for many years.” Scientists’ main goal in bending lightning to their will is to increase safety, he says. But “if this thing ever became really, really efficient, and the probability of guiding a discharge was increased way beyond what it is now, it could potentially even be useful for charging things up.”</p>



<p>Atmospheric and space scientist Robert Holzworth is more cautious about imagining the applications. “They only showed 50 meters of [guiding] length, and most lightning channels are kilometers long,” says Holzworth, of the University of Washington in Seattle. So scaling the laser system up to have a useful reach may take a lot of work.</p>



<p>Using a higher-frequency, higher-energy laser could extend its reach, Houard says. “This is a first step toward a kilometric-range lightning rod.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology">How rare earth elements’ hidden properties make modern technology possible</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In Frank Herbert’s space opera <em>Dune</em>, a precious natural substance called spice melange grants people the ability to navigate vast expanses of the cosmos to build an intergalactic civilization.</p>



<p>In real life here on Earth, a group of natural metals known as the rare earths has made possible our own technology-powered society. Demand for these crucial components in nearly all modern electronics is skyrocketing.</p>



<p>Rare earths fulfill thousands of different needs — cerium, for instance, is used as a catalyst to refine petroleum, and gadolinium captures neutrons in nuclear reactors. But these elements’ most outstanding capabilities lie in their luminescence and magnetism.</p>





<p>We rely on rare earths to color our smartphone screens, fluoresce to signal authenticity in euro banknotes and relay signals through fiber-optic cables across the seafloor. They are also essential for building some of the world’s strongest and most reliable magnets. They generate sound waves in your headphones, boost digital information through space and shift the trajectories of heat-seeking missiles. Rare earths are also driving the growth of green technologies, such as wind energy and electric vehicles, and may even give rise to new components for quantum computers.</p>



<p>“The list just goes on and on,” says Stephen Boyd, a synthetic chemist and independent consultant. “They’re everywhere.”</p>



<h4>Rare earths’ superpowers come from their electrons</h4>



<p>The rare earths are the lanthanides — lutetium and all 14 elements between lanthanum and ytterbium across one row of the periodic table — plus scandium and yttrium, which tend to occur in the same ore deposits and have similar chemical properties to the lanthanides. These gray to silvery metals are often malleable with high melting and boiling points.</p>



<p>Their secret powers lie in their electrons. All atoms have a nucleus surrounded by electrons, which inhabit zones called orbitals. Electrons in the orbitals farthest from the nucleus are the valence electrons, which participate in chemical reactions and form bonds with other atoms.</p>



<p>Most lanthanides possess another important set of electrons called the “f-electrons,” which dwell in a Goldilocks zone located near the valence electrons but slightly closer to the nucleus. “It’s these f-electrons that are responsible for both the magnetic and luminescent properties of the rare earth elements,” says Ana de Bettencourt-Dias, an inorganic chemist at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Place on the periodic table</h3>



<p>The rare earths are a group of 17 elements (highlighted in blue on the periodic table). A subset of rare earths known as the lanthanides (lutetium, Lu, plus the row starting with lanthanum, La) each contain a subshell that typically houses f-electrons, which bestow the elements with magnetic and luminescent properties.</p>

<h4>Rare earths add color and light</h4>



<p>Along some coasts, the night sea occasionally glows bluish green as bioluminescent plankton are jostled in the waves. Rare earth metals also radiate light when stimulated. The trick is to tickle their f-electrons, de Bettencourt-Dias says.</p>



<p>Using an energy source like a laser or lamp, scientists and engineers can jolt one of a rare earth’s f-electrons into an excited state and then let it fall back into lethargy, or its ground state. “When the lanthanides come back to the ground state,” she says, “they emit light.”</p>



<p>Each rare earth reliably emits precise wavelengths of light when excited, de Bettencourt-Dias says. This dependable precision allows engineers to carefully tune electromagnetic radiation in many electronics. Terbium, for instance, emits light at a wavelength of about 545 nanometers, making it good for constructing green phosphors in television, computer and smartphone screens. Europium, which has two common forms, is used to build red and blue phosphors. All together, these phosphors can paint screens with most shades of the rainbow.</p>



<p>Rare earths also radiate useful invisible light. Yttrium is a key ingredient in yttrium-aluminum-garnet, or YAG, a synthetic crystal that forms the core of many high-powered lasers. Engineers tune the wavelengths of these lasers by lacing YAG crystals with another rare earth. The most popular variety are neodymium-laced YAG lasers, which are used for everything from slicing steel to removing tattoos to laser range-finding. Erbium-YAG laser beams are a good option for minimally invasive surgeries because they’re readily absorbed by water in flesh and thus won’t slice too deep.</p>

The UV light excites the europium&#8217;s f-electrons, which then fall back into their ground state and release photons of visible light in the process.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Beyond lasers, lanthanum is crucial for making the infrared-absorbing glass in night vision goggles. “And erbium drives our internet,” says Tian Zhong, a molecular engineer at the University of Chicago. Much of our digital information travels through optical fibers as light with a wavelength of about 1,550 nanometers — the same wavelength erbium emits. The signals in fiber-optic cables dim as they travel far from their source. Because those cables can stretch for thousands of kilometers across the seafloor, erbium is added to fibers to boost signals.</p>



<h4>Rare earths make mighty magnets</h4>



<p>In 1945, scientists constructed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/adds-15000-second">ENIAC, the world’s first programmable, general purpose digital computer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/46, p. 118</em>). Nicknamed the “Giant Brain,” ENIAC weighed more than four elephants and had a footprint roughly two-thirds the size of a tennis court.</p>



<p>Less than 80 years later, the ubiquitous smartphone — boasting far more computing power than ENIAC ever did — fits snugly in our palms. Society owes this miniaturization of electronic technology in large part to the exceptional magnetic power of the rare earths. Tiny rare earth magnets can do the same job as larger magnets made without rare earths.</p>



<p>It’s those f-electrons at play. Rare earths have many orbitals of electrons, but the f-electrons inhabit a specific group of seven orbitals called the 4f-subshell. In any subshell, electrons try to spread themselves out among the orbitals within. Each orbital can house up to two electrons. But since the 4f-subshell contains seven orbitals, and most rare earths contain fewer than 14 f-electrons, the elements tend to have multiple orbitals with just one electron. Neodymium atoms, for instance, possess four of these loners, while dysprosium and samarium have five. Crucially, these unpaired electrons tend to point — or spin — in the same direction, Boyd says. “That’s what creates the north and the south poles that we classically understand as magnetism.”</p>



<p>Since these lone f-electrons flitter behind a shell of valence electrons, their synchronized spins are somewhat shielded from demagnetizing forces such as heat and other magnetic fields, making them great for building permanent magnets, Zhong says. Permanent magnets, like the ones that hold up pictures on a fridge door, passively generate magnetic fields that arise from their atomic structure, unlike electromagnets, which require an electric current and can be turned off.</p>

</ul>
</div>



<p>But even with their shielding, the rare earths have limits. Pure neodymium, for example, readily corrodes and fractures, and its magnetic pull begins to lose strength above 80° Celsius. So manufacturers alloy some rare earths with other metals to make more resilient magnets, says Durga Paudyal, a theoretical physicist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa. This works well because some rare earths can orchestrate the magnetic fields of other metals, he says. Just as weighted dice will preferentially land on one side, some rare earths like neodymium and samarium exhibit stronger magnetism in certain directions because they contain unevenly filled orbitals in their 4f-subshells. This directionality, called magnetic anisotropy, can be leveraged to coordinate the fields of other metals like iron or cobalt to formulate robust, extremely powerful magnets.</p>



<p>The most powerful rare earth alloy magnets are neodymium-iron-boron magnets. A three-kilogram neodymium alloy magnet can lift objects that weigh over 300 kilograms, for instance. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 95 percent of the world’s permanent magnets</a> are made from this rare earth alloy. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets generate vibrations in smartphones, produce sounds in earbuds and headphones, enable the reading and writing of data in hard disk drives and generate the magnetic fields used in MRI machines. And adding a bit of dysprosium to these magnets can boost the alloy’s heat resistance, making it a good choice for the rotors that spin in the hot interiors of many electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>Samarium-cobalt magnets, developed in the 1960s, were the first popular rare earth magnets. Though slightly weaker than neodymium-iron-boron magnets, samarium-cobalt magnets have superior heat and corrosion resistance, so they’re put to work in high-speed motors, generators, speed sensors in cars and airplanes, and in the moving parts of some heat-seeking missiles. Samarium-cobalt magnets also form the heart of most traveling-wave tubes, which boost signals from radar systems and communications satellites. Some of these tubes are transmitting data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">Voyager 1 spacecraft</a> — currently the most distant human-made object — over 23 billion kilometers away (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Because they are strong and reliable, rare earth magnets are supporting green technologies. They’re in the motors, drivetrains, power steering and many other components of electric vehicles. Tesla’s use of neodymium alloy magnets in its farthest-ranging Model 3 vehicles has sparked supply chain worries; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">China provides the vast majority of the world&#8217;s neodymium</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rare earth magnets are also used in many offshore wind turbines to replace gearboxes, which boosts efficiency and decreases maintenance. In August, Chinese engineers introduced “Rainbow,” the world’s first maglev train line based on rare earth magnets that enable the trains to float without consuming electricity.</p>



<p>In the future, rare earths may even advance quantum computing. While conventional computers use binary bits (those 1s and 0s), quantum computers use qubits, which can occupy two states simultaneously. As it turns out, crystals containing rare earths make good qubits, since the shielded f-electrons can store quantum information for long periods of time, Zhong says. One day, computer scientists might even leverage the luminescent properties of rare earths in qubits to share information between quantum computers and birth a quantum internet, he says.</p>



<p>It may be too early to predict exactly how the rare earth metals will continue to influence the expansion of these growing technologies. But it’s probably safe to say: We’re going to need more rare earths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">Here’s what you need to know about COVID’s XBB.1.5 ‘Kraken’ variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The omicron variant’s family tree has grown substantially over the last year. The brood now encompasses a subvariant soup with alphanumeric names such as BA.2, BA.5 and BF.7. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that two versions — BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 — caused just over half of new infections in the United States during the week ending January 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, a newcomer dubbed XBB.1.5 seems poised for a rise to dominance. According to CDC estimates, it accounts for more than 80 percent of new cases in parts of the northeastern United States. For the week ending January 14, it was responsible for 43 percent of new cases across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>But while previous variants such as alpha, delta and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">original omicron</a> were linked to massive surges of new infections, it’s not yet clear whether XBB.1.5 is destined for a similar path (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). Preliminary evidence suggests the subvariant, nicknamed the Kraken in some circles, is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.522427v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more transmissible</a> than its predecessors. That trait, however, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants">a hallmark of viral evolution</a> — successful new variants must be able to outcompete their siblings (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, experts at the World Health Organization are keeping a close eye on XBB.1.5. But it’s <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/11jan2023_xbb15_rapid_risk_assessment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too early to say</a> whether it might take over the globe. Most cases currently come from the United States, the United Kingdom and Denmark.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with infectious diseases specialist Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco about the latest coronavirus variant to make headlines. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What is the difference between XBB.1.5 and earlier versions of omicron?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: There are lots of variants that get produced all the time. It’s a normal thing for the virus as the virus makes more copies of itself. It’s not exactly precise or accurate, so it makes errors, [which are the variants]. It’s kind of like a bad photocopy machine in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB, a sibling of XBB.1.5, was scary — and that was seen in the fall of 2022 — because it was one of the most immune-evasive variants around. But the reason why XBB never took off around the world — it was really in Singapore and India — was that it didn’t really infect cells quite as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB.1.5 has the immune slipperiness of XBB, but it also has this new mutation that makes it easy to infect cells. So it’s kind of like a bulldog in not wanting to let go of the cell. Whereas XBB was kind of invisible, like it had the invisibility cloak from <em>Harry Potter</em>, it didn’t have the bite. But XBB.1.5 has the invisibility cloak, plus the bite.&nbsp;</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Is that why it’s spreading so effectively in some areas?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: We think so. Because to be very efficient at infecting cells is a really important superpower if you are a virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can be invisible [to the immune system] all you want, but if you’re not infecting cells efficiently, you probably won’t be as infectious. That could be [the reason] XBB.1.5 is spreading, because it has both of those things going for it. Seeing how it’s crowding out the other variants now makes us worried that it’s something to pay attention to. And it’s accompanied by increasing cases and hospitalizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Previous variants were linked to big surges of infections. Can we expect the same of XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: It’s complicated. If it were March 2020, it would be a very simple answer: Yes. But in January of 2023, you have so much variation in the amount of experience people have toward COVID, even if it’s a different type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can have somebody who got infected two or three times plus they got vaccinated and boosted. That’s going to be somebody who’s going to be really, really well protected against getting seriously ill. Maybe they might get a cold. Maybe they wouldn’t even know they had an infection versus somebody who didn’t get vaccinated and never got exposed and they’re older. It might as well be March of 2020 for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That [second] kind of person is, for example, in China. In China, XBB.1.5 might cause a lot of problems. But XBB.1.5 going to, you know, the middle of Manhattan might not cause as many problems in a highly vaccinated and exposed group of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Timing also matters] because we saw a lot of BQ.1, BQ.1.1 recently, and a lot of people got infected after Thanksgiving. This rise of XBB.1.5 is coming after a lot of people already got infected recently. So it probably won’t do as much damage as if you had a long lull and all of a sudden you have this new thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Do vaccines and treatments still work against it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The new updated boosters generally work a little better than the old vaccines in terms of overall efficacy and preventing infection. But with these new slippery variants like XBB.1.5 … if you’re looking to prevent infections, even a mild infection, the vaccines are probably going to last maybe three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re talking about preventing me from dying or going to the hospital, those vaccines are going to give me a boost of protection for many, many months, probably until next winter for most people. For older people, older than 65, if they’re not boosted today, then it’s a problem.</p>



<p>[Drugs such as] Paxlovid and remdesivir work independent of the spike protein [the part of the virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">targeted by vaccines</a> but where many of the defense-evading mutations are (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>)]. So it doesn’t matter what invisibility cloak the variant has. They’re going to work because they work on shutting down the virus factory, which is one of the early steps, before the spike protein gets made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they will work no matter what [spike] variant comes along, which is a good thing. Even if you didn’t get vaccinated or never got exposed, if you got diagnosed and you get early therapy, it will cut down your hospitalization rates substantially.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, all monoclonal antibodies don’t work. [The virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">has changed too much</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/22</em>).]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why is it that only omicron variants are popping up?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: I think omicron has hit on a magical formula. It’s going to be hard to kick it off the gold medal stand. It’s so good at transmission, and all these other aspects that are good for the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the [earlier] days, it was two or three months, and you had a new coronavirus variant somewhere in the world. Now it’s been omicron since two Thanksgivings ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>With each variant more transmissible than the last, is it inevitable that everyone will get COVID?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The people who didn’t get infected before are going to have a really, really hard time escaping this one. But it’s not impossible. It’s just going to be harder and harder, not only because XBB.1.5 is so transmissible, but also because we don’t have so many restrictions anymore. You’re going to the grocery store, nobody’s wearing a mask or you don’t feel like you have peer pressure to wear masks. So you’re going to get exposed just like you get exposed to colds….&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you can reduce the risk in the short term by getting a booster, if you haven’t already gotten one. And certainly [the booster] can reduce the risk of dying, particularly if you’re older or immune-compromised….&nbsp;</p>



<p>[People still wearing masks] have to wear really good quality masks [such as KN95s] because you can’t rely on everybody else wearing masks anymore.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How worried should people be about XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The world is divided into two groups of people. The people whose bodies are very, very experienced with COVID — it’s gotten vaccines or boosting or … a couple of infections. And then there are people whose body isn’t well-experienced with COVID. For that [latter] group, they should be worried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For someone, you’re looking around and your neighbor got it and nothing happened, or your cousin or a person at work, and it&#8217;s like it’s no big deal. But there are still 500 people dying every day in the United States [from COVID]. And to those people, it’s a huge deal….</p>



<p>It’s a weird situation because it’s not one-size-fits-all anymore, and different people have different levels of risk.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In preparation for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) negotiations, a group of experts came together in late 2021, convened by <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEO BON</a> and <a href="https://futureearth.org/">Future </a><a href="https://futureearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth</a>, to compile a series of scientific <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefs</a> showing assessments and recommendations for select GBF targets and goals. In order to distill key aspects of these briefs and make their overarching messages more accessible to the broader scientific community, these experts authored and published the first of a series of Policy Perspective companion pieces in <em>PLOS Climate </em>and <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>. Read on for a summary of these papers with links to the full articles below.</p>



<h3>Background&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The articles summarize key focus areas to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. These areas include increasing natural ecosystem area by 2030, focusing on specific restoration needs to meet this goal, and cautioning that specific efforts must respect biodiversity criteria and rights of local populations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Articles</h3>



<p>In the <em>PLOS Climate</em> paper, the authors share opportunities to minimize<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hashtag_click"> </a>climate change impacts on<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/biodiversity?src=hashtag_click"> </a>biodiversity, how biodiversity can support<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adaptation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>adaptation and<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mitigation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>mitigation, and how climate action can avoid negative impacts on biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em> paper describes actions to achieve ambitious net gains in natural<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecosystem?src=hashtag_click"> </a>ecosystem areas, and the second<a href="https://twitter.com/PLOSSustain"> </a>paper addresses the complexities of setting ambitious international<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/restoration?src=hashtag_click"> </a>restoration objectives for terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Future Publications</h3>



<p>Two more papers are under review addressing sustainable agriculture, and sustainable use of biodiversity. Altogether, and with other outputs from the same group, the authors hope that scientific support for the development of the GBF will help align countries during negotiations and facilitate integrated implementation of the targets in coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-snow-saturn-cassini">Enceladus is blanketed in a thick layer of snow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus is shrouded in a thick layer of snow. In some places, the downy stuff is 700 meters deep, new research suggests.</p>



<p>“It’s like Buffalo, but worse,” says planetary scientist Emily Martin, referring to the famously snowy city in New York. The snow depth suggests that Enceladus’ dramatic plume <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103522004614?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have been more active in the past</a>, Martin and colleagues report in the Mar. 1 <em>Icarus</em>.</p>



<p>Planetary scientists have been fascinated by Enceladus’ geysers, made up of water vapor and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">other ingredients</a>, since the Cassini spacecraft spotted them in 2005 (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>). The spray probably comes from a salty ocean beneath an icy shell.</p>





<p>Some of that water goes to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">form one of Saturn’s rings</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But most of it falls back onto the moon’s surface as snow, Martin says. Understanding the properties of that snow — its thickness and how dense and compact it is — could help reveal Enceladus’ history, and lay groundwork for future missions to this moon.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to land a robot there, you need to understand what it’s going to be landing into,” says Martin, of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>To figure out how thick Enceladus’ snow is, Martin and colleagues looked to Earth — specifically, Iceland. The island country hosts geological features called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-dione-has-stripes-no-others-solar-system">pit chains</a>, which are lines of pockmarks in the ground formed when loose rubble such as rocks, ice or snow drains into a crack underneath (<em>SN: 10/23/18</em>). Similar features show up all over the solar system, including Enceladus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="426" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1.jpg" alt="A person walks near pit chain craters in Iceland." class="wp-image-3120901" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1-611x383.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1-297x186.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120901">Pit chain craters in Iceland, like those shown here, helped planetary scientist Emily Martin and colleagues verify that they could measure the depth of craters on Enceladus. Martin took this image during a field excursion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120901">E. Martin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previous work suggested a way to use geometry and the angle at which sunlight hits the surface to measure the depth of the pits. That measurement can then reveal the depth of the material the pits sit in. A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few weeks of fieldwork in Iceland</a> in 2017 and 2018 convinced Martin and her colleagues that the same technique would work on Enceladus.</p>



<p>Using images from Cassini, Martin and colleagues found that the snow’s thickness varies across Enceladus’ surface. It is hundreds of meters deep in most places and 700 meters deep at its thickest.</p>





<p>It’s hard to imagine how all that snow got there, though, Martin says. If the plume’s spray was always what it is today, it would take 4.5 billion years — the entire age of the solar system — to deposit that much snow on the surface. Even then, the snow would have to be especially fluffy.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely that the plume switched on the moment the moon formed and never changed, Martin says. And even if it did, later layers of snow would have compressed the earlier ones, compacting the whole layer and making it much less deep than it is today.</p>



<p>“It makes me think we don’t have 4.5 billion years to do this,” Martin says. Instead, the plume might have been much more active in the past. “We need to do it in a much shorter timeframe. You need to crank up the volume on the plume.”</p>



<p>The technique was clever, says planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Without rovers or astronauts on the ground, there’s no way to scoop up the snow and see how far down it goes. “Instead, the authors are very cleverly using geology to be their rovers, to be their shovels.”</p>



<p>MacKenzie was not involved in the new work, but she led a mission concept study for an orbiter and lander that could one day visit Enceladus. One of the major questions in that study was where a lander could safely touch down. “Key to those discussions was, what do we expect the surface to be?” she says. The new paper could help “identify the places that are too fluffy to land in.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780316540537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Far the Light Reaches</a><br><em>Sabrina Imbler</em><br><em>Little, Brown &amp; Co., $27</em></p>



<p>In <em>How Far the Light Reaches</em>, Sabrina Imbler shows us that the ocean, in all its mystery and dazzling glory, is queer — that is, the life that takes shape there challenges how we landlubbers perceive ways of being. This collection of essays tells the stories of 10 sea creatures, with Imbler, a queer and mixed-race writer, weaving in stories of their own family, self-discovery, sexuality and healing. The profiled animals, often thought of as strange or alien, transform into recognizable emblems of identity, community and queer joy in this delectable amalgam of memoir and science journalism.</p>





<p>Imbler begins with a confession: “The truth is that I was asked to leave the Petco, but I told everyone I was banned.” Thirteen-year-old Imbler had staged a protest in the store, attempting to convince customers not to buy goldfish bowls. The bowls, Imbler writes, condemn the fish to a truncated life in a transparent coffin, in which they will die isolated, starved of oxygen and poisoned with ammonia from their own urine.</p>



<p>But unencumbered by the confines of a bowl, the fish thrive. When bored pet owners dump goldfish in lakes or rivers, the fish can balloon to the size of jugs of milk. They are “so good at living they have become an ecological menace,” breeding with abandon, uprooting bottom dwellers, and fomenting bacterial growth and algal blooms, Imbler writes.</p>



<p>Yet Imbler can’t help but admire the feral goldfish’s resilience: “I see something that no one expected to live not just alive but impossibly flourishing.”</p>



<p>Survival among unthinkable circumstances is a theme common to all the profiled animals. Take the yeti crab (<em>Kiwa puravida</em>), which, after reading this book, I now proclaim a queer icon (step aside, the Babadook). In the frigid dark, about 1,000 meters below the sea surface, the crab finds solace near hydrothermal vents.</p>



<p>Such hot spots foster life in a desolate wasteland. Heat and chemicals from inside the Earth sustain an ecosystem of crabs, clams, mussels, tube worms and more. There, in true queer fashion, <em>K. puravida</em> “dances to live,” Imbler writes. The yeti crab throws its claws in the air and waves ’em like it just don’t care. In doing so, it is “farming” the bacteria that it eats, which cling to the crab’s bristly claws. Waving the claws in a slow but steady rhythm ensures the bacteria get nutrients.</p>



<p>In telling the crab’s story, Imbler reminisces on their quest to find community after moving to Seattle in 2016. Feeling alone among the mostly white people they met, Imbler discovered a monthly party called Night Crush, thrown by and for queer people of color. Night Crush became Imbler’s own hydrothermal vent — an oasis warmed by people dancing in mesh, sequins, glitter and joy. “As queer people, we get to choose our families,” Imbler writes. “Vent bacteria, tube worms, and yeti crabs just take it one step further. They choose what nourishes them.”</p>





<p>Imbler looks to the sea to explore all aspects of family. The purple octopus (<em>Graneledone boreopacifica</em>), for instance, offers insights on motherhood. During a four-and-a-half-year brooding period, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octomom-sets-egg-brooding-record">longest known for any animal</a>, the octopus starves herself to death, foregoing hunting to protect her eggs (<em>SN: 7/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Through the octopus’ saga, Imbler reflects on their own mother, who moved to the United States from Taiwan as a child. Imbler’s mother felt like she was on “a new planet.” To survive, she learned to want to be as white and “American” as possible, and as thin as possible — traumas inherited by Imbler, who developed an eating disorder.</p>



<p>In their recovery, Imbler has realized their mother’s wish for them to be thin, though damaging, was, in a way, an act of love: “She wanted me to be skinny so things would be easier. White, so things would be easier. Straight, so things would be easy, easy, easy. So that unlike her, no one would ever question my right to be here, in America.”</p>

<p>It is with that same grace, clarity and tenderness that Imbler crafts the book’s other essays, whether it’s meditating on their own gender expression through the cuttlefish’s mastery of metamorphosis or examining their experience of sexual assault through the sand striker, an ambush predator of the seafloor.</p>



<p>Like a goldfish confined by a bowl, I am confined by my word count and can’t say everything I want to about this must-read book. So I’ll end on one final insight. In one essay, Imbler introduces salps. These jelly-like blobs exist as a colony of hundreds of identical salps joined in a chain. The creatures do not move in one synchronized effort. “Salps allow each individual to jet at its own pace in the same general direction,” Imbler writes. “It is not as fast as coordinated strokes, but it’s more sustainable long-term, each individual sucking and spurting as it pleases.”</p>



<p>This idea of one collective, made up of individuals marching toward a common cause at their own pace, is one that queer people and other marginalized groups know well — whether creating community or protesting for civil rights. And it’s a notion that Imbler imparts upon their reader: “We may all move at different paces, but we will only reach the horizon together.”</p>

W&#8217;s hesitation, doubt and slight panic reminded me of myself just 2 years ago.

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/singel-cell-2-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When Barbara McClintock dubbed them “<a href="http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/21/197">controlling elements</a>”, the term she used was perhaps far more prescient and descriptive than the term more commonly used today, transposable elements (TEs). In many organisms, including in clades as diverse as plants, animals – mammalian and otherwise -, and bacteria, TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation. In humans, roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35057062">45% of the genome comprises TEs</a>, with a large majority of that consisting of retrotransposons, while in mice, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01262">TEs make up 37% of the genome</a>. Far from mere evolutionary junk, TEs have a variety of modes of impact on the genome and the transcriptome. Even in mammalian genomes, where many TEs are dormant, multiple classes of TEs, such as LINEs and Alu elements, still show active transposition [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722770/">1</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33725281/">2</a>]. This can be a part of the normal genetic variety of the species, but is more frequently linked with adverse outcomes, such as developmental disorders, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0165-8">genetic diseases</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc.2017.35">tumor formation</a> . To prevent such outcomes, TE activity and expression is tightly regulated in many genomes, often using TE proprietary regulatory mechanisms. For example, the suppression of TEs during development often remains intact, despite near-global demethylation and formation of pervasive euchromatin regions [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0159-6">3</a>].</p>
<p>In more recent years, the initial spike in research pertaining to TEs has been followed by a steady decline in the number of publications since 2013 (based on number of publications listed on the PubMed archives). In comparison, even when we do not account for the large amount of research related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of total research articles, as well as research in other fields has seen a general steady increase. While TEs continue to be a source of novel and vital information in many types of biological activity, the research has simply failed to catch up with the growing understanding of their importance in the genome.One of the potential reasons for this decline is the same property of TEs that makes them so important to the genome: as repeat elements, which, unlike tandem repeats, are found scattered across the genome, in-depth study of TEs requires increasingly more specialized tools and methods to yield new insights [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z">4</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5</a>]. For example, due to the potential impact of individual TE instances on the local genomic regions, such as through contributions of regulatory motifs (e.g. transcription factor binding sites), analyzing TE activity as a single meta-gene might lead to insufficient or misleading results. In addition, as mentioned previously, many TEs are actively transposed in both germline and somatic cells, often creating large scale structural variances that are difficult to capture properly without examination of the individual cells or organisms. Use of a reference genome for an organism without taking into account the possibility of such transposition might lead to missed opportunities for TE research. Overcoming such challenges might require extensive modifications to or adaptations of accepted methodologies, which is no trivial task.</p>
<blockquote><p>TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the decrease in published TE research, recent years have also seen an increasing number of computational tools designed to create bespoke solutions for problems faced by TE researchers [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5]</a>. In bulk RNA sequencing, the analysis of TEs has seen significant improvements, thanks to tools such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218879/">SalmonTE,</a> by Hyun-Hwan Jeong <em>et al</em>., and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624635/">SQuIRE</a>, by Wan R Yang <em>et al</em>. . These tools allow improved locus specific quantification, allowing for more precise data. Due to the more complicated nature of the resulting data, TE research using single cell sequencing continues to see improvements. Previously, Jiangping He and colleagues have made available the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21808-x">scTE pipeline</a>, which allowed for the quantification of TEs on a metagene level in single cell RNA-seq data. More recently, Rocío Rodríguez-Quiroz and Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana have published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04020-5">soloTE</a> , which can quantify TE expression in single cell data on a locus-specific level, leading to further refinement of such analysis. For analysis of retrotransposons which code for peptides, and thus contain speficic domain sequences, Mikhail Biryukov and Kirill Ustyantsev have created <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35052350/">DARTS</a> , for domain associated retrotransposon search in genome assemblies. Meanwhile, even more improved usage of such developed tools is possible. In a benchmark analysis involving multiple algorithms and pipelines, including the previously mentioned SQuIRE and SalmonTE, Natalia Savytska <em>et al</em>. have integrated transcription start site profile data to more accurately identify and quantify instance specific TE expression [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9633680/">6]</a>. Thanks to such innovations, there is hope that our understanding of TEs will soon see an acceleration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, TE research remains a vital, yet underappreciated field of study. Lowering the barriers to conducting and understanding TE research is an important prospect, requiring the contributions of many researchers in multiple biological disciplines. This is why we would like to attract your attention to our new <em><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Genomics</a> </em>collection, titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/transposons">Transposable elements</a>&#8220;, to shine a spotlight on our current and growing knowledge of TEs.</p>
