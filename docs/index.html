              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">Chemical signals from fungi tell bark beetles which trees to infest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fungi may help some tree-killer beetles turn a tree’s natural defense system against itself.</p>



<p>The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (<em>Ips typographus</em>) has massacred millions of conifers in forests across Europe. Now, research suggests that fungi associated with these bark beetles are key players in the insect’s hostile takeovers. These fungi warp the chemical defenses of host trees <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to create an aroma that attracts beetles to burrow</a>, researchers report February 21 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<p>This fungi-made perfume might explain why bark beetles tend to swarm the same tree. As climate change makes Europe’s forests more vulnerable to insect invasions, understanding this relationship could help scientists develop new countermeasures to ward off beetle attacks.</p>





<p>Bark beetles are a type of insect found around the world that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bugged-forests-bad-climate">feed and breed inside trees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/10</em>). In recent years, several bark beetle species have aggressively attacked forests from North America to Australia, leaving ominous strands of dead trees in their wake.</p>



<p>But trees aren’t defenseless. Conifers — which include pine and fir trees — are veritable chemical weapons factories. The evergreen smell of Christmas trees and alpine forests comes from airborne varieties of these chemicals. But while they may smell delightful, these chemicals’ main purpose is to trap and poison invaders.</p>



<p>Or at least, that’s what they&#8217;re meant to do.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Conifers are full of resin and other stuff that should do horrible things to insects,” says Jonathan Gershenzon, a chemical ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. “But bark beetles don’t seem to mind at all.”</p>



<p>This ability of bark beetles to overcome the powerful defense system of conifers has led some scientists to wonder if fungi might be helping. Fungi <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-carbon-storage-soil-earth-warm-climate">break down compounds in their environment</a> for food and protection (<em>SN: 11/30/21</em>). And some type of fungi — including some species in the genus <em>Grosmannia</em> — are always found in association with Eurasian spruce bark beetles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1.jpg" alt="image of a cross section of wood showing Eurasian spruce bark beetle larvae inside their burrows" class="wp-image-3122122" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_FK_bark-beetle_inline-1-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122122">Eurasian spruce bark beetles (larvae seen here) have killed millions of trees in their quest to feed and breed inside Europe’s conifers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122122">Dineshkumar Kandasamy (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gershenzon and his colleagues compared the chemicals released by spruce bark infested with <em>Grosmannia </em>and other fungi to the chemical profile of uninfected trees. The presence of the fungi fundamentally changed the chemical profile of spruce trees, the team found. More than half the airborne chemicals — made by fungi breaking down monoterpenes and other chemicals that are likely part of the tree defense system — were unique to infected trees after 12 days.</p>



<p>This is surprising because researchers had previously assumed that invading fungi hardly changed the chemical profile of trees, says Jonathan Cale, a fungal ecologist at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada, who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>Later experiments revealed that bark beetles can detect many of these fungi-made chemicals. The team tested this by attaching tiny electrodes on bark beetles’ heads and detecting electrical activity when the chemicals wafted passed their antennae. What’s more, the smell of these chemicals combined with beetle pheromones led the insects to burrow at higher rates than the smell of pheromones alone.</p>



<p>The study suggests that these fungi-made chemicals can help beetles tell where to feed and breed, possibly by advertising that the fungi has taken down some of the tree’s defenses. The attractive nature of the chemicals could also explain the beetle’s swarming behavior, which drives the death of healthy adult trees.</p>



<p>But while the fungi aroma might doom trees, it could also lead to the beetles’ demise. Beetle traps in Europe currently use only beetle pheromones to attract their victims. Combining pheromones with fungi-derived chemicals might be the secret to entice more beetles into traps, making them more effective.</p>



<p>The results present “an exciting direction for developing new tools to manage destructive bark beetle outbreaks” for other beetle species as well, Cale says. In North America, mild winters and drought have put conifer forests at greater risk from mountain pine beetle (<em>Dendroctonus pendersoae</em>) attacks. Finding and using fungi-derived chemicals might be one way to fend off the worst of the bark beetle invasions in years to come.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-work-burnout-depression-wellness">Lots of people feel burned out. But what is burnout exactly?</a></h4>

              
                <p>When New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who garnered international praise for how she handled the pandemic in her country, recently announced her <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jacindaardernresignationspeech.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intention to resign</a>, here’s how she summed up her surprise decision: “I know what the job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.”</p>



<p>Social scientists and journalists worldwide largely interpreted Ardern’s words in her January 19 speech as a reference to burnout.</p>





<p>“She’s talking about an empty tank,” says Christina Maslach, a psychological researcher who has been interviewing and observing workers struggling with workplace-related distress for decades. In almost 50 years of interviews, says Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, “that phrase [has come] up again and again and again.”</p>



<p>Numerous studies and media reports suggest that burnout, already high before the pandemic, has since skyrocketed worldwide, particularly among workers in certain professions, such as health care, teaching and service. The pandemic makes clear that the jobs needed for a healthy, functioning society are burning people out, Maslach says.</p>



<p>But disagreement over how to define and measure burnout is pervasive, with some researchers even questioning if the syndrome is simply depression by another name. Such controversy has made it difficult to estimate the prevalence of burnout or identify how to best help those who are suffering.</p>



<p>Here are some key questions researchers are asking to get a handle on the problem.</p>



<h4>When did today’s understanding of burnout emerge?</h4>



<p>Some researchers argue that burnout is a strictly modern-day phenomenon, brought on by overwork and hustle culture. But others contend that burnout is merely the latest iteration of a long line of exhaustion disorders, starting with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/acedia-the-lost-name-for-the-emotion-were-all-feeling-right-now-144058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancient Greek concept of <em>acedia</em></a>. This condition, wrote 5th century monk and theologian John Cassian, is marked by “bodily listlessness and yawning hunger.”</p>



<p>The more contemporary notion of burnout originated in the 1970s. Herbert Freudenberger, the consulting psychologist for volunteers working with drug addicts at St. Mark’s Free Clinic in New York City, used the term to describe the volunteers’ gradual loss of motivation, emotional depletion and reduced commitment to the cause.</p>





<p>Roughly simultaneously, Maslach was interviewing social service workers in California and began observing similar characteristics. That prompted Maslach and her then–graduate student, Susan Jackson, now at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., to develop the first tool to measure burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The duo defined burnout as comprising of three components: exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy, or persistent feelings of low personal accomplishment.</p>



<p>Respondents rated statements on a scale from 0 (“never”) to 6 (“daily”). Sample statements read: “I feel emotionally drained from my work” for exhaustion; “I doubt the significance of my work” for cynicism; and “I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job” for inefficacy. High scores for exhaustion and cynicism, and low scores for inefficacy, indicated that a person was struggling with burnout.</p>



<p>Maslach’s scale turned burnout into a legitimate area of inquiry, says Renzo Bianchi, an occupational health psychologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “Before [the Maslach Burnout Inventory], burnout was pop psychology.”</p>



<h4>What is the best way to define burnout?</h4>



<p>Maslach’s inventory remains the most widely used tool to study burnout. But many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-sciences-definitions-terms-research-measurment">criticize that definition</a> of the syndrome (<em>SN: 10/26/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Conceptualizing burnout as a combination of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Burnout-Companion-To-Study-And-Practice-A-Critical-Analysis/Schaufeli-Enzmann/p/book/9780748406982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy is “arbitrary,”</a> wrote organizational psychologists Wilmar Schaufeli and Dirk Enzmann in their 1998 book, <em>The Burnout Companion to Study and Practice: A Critical Analysis</em>. “What would have happened if other items had been included? Most likely, other dimensions would have appeared.”</p>



<p>Moreover, those three components and what&#8217;s causing them are themselves poorly defined, says work and organizational psychologist Evangelia Demerouti of Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. For instance, numerous nonwork factors can trigger exhaustion, such as health problems and caregiving responsibilities.</p>



<p>Disagreements over what constitutes burnout, and how to measure the phenomenon, has led to a chaotic body of literature. A key point of contention is how to use Maslach’s inventory. Maslach never designated a cutoff point at which a worker tips from not burnt out to burnt out. Rather the inventory was designed as a tool to help researchers identify patterns of burnout within a given work environment or profession.</p>



<p>But in practice, Maslach has little control over how researchers use the inventory. A review of 182 studies on physician burnout in 45 countries reported in September 2018 in <em>JAMA </em>is illustrative. Almost 86 percent of studies in that review used a version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. But roughly a quarter of those studies used unofficial versions of Maslach’s scale, such as halving the number of statements or measuring exhaustion only. Those versions are clinically invalid, Maslach contends. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, most researchers using the inventory, or a modified version, did designate cutoff scores, though teams’ definitions for high, medium and low burnout showed little agreement. Consequently, estimates for the prevalence of physician burnout varied from 0 to 80.5 percent — figures that are impossible to interpret, the researchers note.</p>



<p>What’s more, across all the studies, the <em>JAMA</em> team identified <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2702871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">142 definitions of burnout</a>. And among the subset of studies not using a version of the inventory, the researchers identified 11 unique methods for measuring burnout. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those many concerns are prompting some researchers to call for a return to the drawing board on how to define and measure burnout. That process should start with qualitative interviews to see how people struggling at work speak about their own experiences, Demerouti says. “We don’t [have] a good conceptualization and diagnosis of burnout.… We need to start from scratch.”</p>



<h4>Do researchers agree on any features of burnout?</h4>



<p>Surprisingly, yes. Researchers concur that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702620979597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustion is a core feature</a> of the syndrome, wrote Bianchi and his team in March 2021 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science.</em></p>



<p>Research in the past two decades &nbsp;is also converging on the idea that burnout appears to involve changes to cognition, such as problems with memory and concentration. Those cognitive problems can take the form of people becoming forgetful — missing a recurring meeting or struggling to perform routine tasks, for instance, says Charlie Renaud, an occupational health psychologist at the University of Rennes in France. Such struggles can carry over into people’s personal lives, causing leisure activities, such as reading and watching movies, to become laborious.</p>



<p>As these findings mount, some researchers have begun to incorporate questions on cognitive changes into their burnout scales, Renaud says.</p>

<h4>Is burnout a form of depression?</h4>



<p>At first glance, the two concepts appear contradictory. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">Depression</a> is typically seen as stemming from within the individual and burnout as stemming from societal forces, chiefly the workplace (<em>SN: 2/12/23</em>). &nbsp;But some researchers have begun to question if burnout exists as a standalone diagnosis. The concepts are not mutually exclusive, research shows. Chronic stress in one’s environment can trigger depression and certain temperaments can make one more prone to burnout.</p>



<p>For instance, scoring high for the personality trait <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178118310230?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuroticism</a> — characterized by irritability and a tendency to worry — better predicted a person’s likelihood of experiencing burnout than certain work-related factors, such as poor supervisor support and lack of rapport with colleagues, Bianchi and his team reported in 2018 in <em>Psychiatry Research.</em></p>



<p>Moreover, exhaustion occurred together with depression more frequently than with either cynicism or inefficacy, Bianchi and his team reported in the 2021 paper<em>.</em> If burnout is characterized by a suite of symptoms, then exhaustion and depression appear a more promising combination than the Maslach trifecta, the team reported.</p>



<p>“The real problem is that we want to believe that burnout is not a depressive condition, [or] as severe as a depressive condition,” Bianchi says. But that, he adds, simply isn’t true.</p>



<h4>Should people be able to get a diagnosis of “burnout”?</h4>



<p>Not everyone thinks that’s a good idea. “Burnout was never, ever thought of as a clinical diagnosis,” Maslach says.</p>



<p>Bianchi and his team disagree. The researchers have developed their own scale, the Occupational Depression Inventory, which assesses nine core symptoms associated with major depression, including cognitive impairment and suicidal thinking, through the lens of work. For instance, instead of rating a statement like “I feel like a failure,” participants rate the statement, “My experience at work made me feel like a failure.” <em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>If burnout is a form of depression, then it can be treated as such, Bianchi says. And, unlike burnout, treatments for depression, such as therapy and, in severe cases, medication, are already established. “Hopefully the interventions, the treatments, the forms of support that exist for depressed people can then be applied for occupational depression,” he says.</p>



<p>But treating the individual, while often a necessary first step, does nothing to alleviate the work-related stress that triggered the crisis, says occupational health psychologist Kirsi Ahola of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki. “[Imagine] the person is on sick leave, for example, for a few weeks and recuperates and rests … and he comes back to the exactly same situation where the demands are too high and no support and whatever. Then he or she starts burning out again.” That cycle is difficult to break.</p>



<p>Burnout is not included in the American Psychiatric Association’s current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The World Health Organization adopted Maslach’s conceptualization of burnout when they outlined the syndrome in their 2019 International Classification of Diseases. Burnout constitutes “an <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occupational phenomenon,” </a>not a medical condition, the agency noted. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>With the evidence so murky, is there any help for people struggling at work?</h4>



<p>Most researchers agree that interventions must target work-related distress at all levels, from the individual to the workplace to governing bodies.</p>



<p>Interventions at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid">the individual level</a> include therapy, exercise, developing hobbies outside of work and crafting one’s job to better fit one’s goals (<em>SN: 1/10/23</em>). Additionally, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-32813-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive training programs</a> that help restore memory, attention and other cognitive deficits have shown promise in alleviating the cognitive problems associated with burnout, Renaud and University of Rennes developmental psychologist Agnès Lacroix reported January 2 in the <em>International Journal of Stress Management. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the workplace level, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">simple fixes</a>, such as fewer video meetings and reducing distractions during the workday, can alleviate distress (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>). It’s time to chip away at all the little changes that have increased people’s workload over time, Maslach says. “Everybody adds stuff to people’s work. They never subtract.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, though, it may take systemic changes, such as more stringent labor laws, to combat burnout in countries like the United States, where sick leave is seldom guaranteed and few rules protect employees from overwork and job insecurity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But even without regulations forcing employers’ hands, governments and companies that prioritize healthy workplaces have a competitive advantage. “When people are feeling well and cope well and have energy, they are also better workers,” Ahola says. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">Fungi don’t turn humans into zombies. But The Last of Us gets some science right</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like so many others, I’ve been watching the HBO series <em>The Last of Us.</em> It’s a classic zombie apocalypse drama following Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they make their way across the former United States (now run by a fascist government called Fedra).</p>



<p>I’m a big fan of zombie and other post-apocalyptic fiction. And my husband had told me how good the storyline is in the video game that inspired the series, so I was prepared for interesting storytelling. What I didn’t expect was to be so intrigued by the science behind the sci-fi.</p>





<p>In the opening minutes of the series, two scientists on a fictional 1968 talk show discuss the microbes that give them pandemic nightmares. One says it’s fungi — not viruses or bacteria — that keep him awake. Especially worrisome, he says, are the fungi that control rather than kill their hosts. He gives the example of fungi that turns ants into living zombies, puppeteering the insects by flooding their brains with hallucinogens.</p>



<p>He goes on to warn that even though human body temperature keeps us fungus-free, that might not be true if the world got a little bit warmer. He predicts that as the thermostat climbs, a fungus that hijacks insects could mutate a gene allowing it to burrow into human brains and take control of our minds. Such a fungus could induce its human puppets to spread the fungus “by any means necessary,” he says. What’s worse, there are no preventatives, treatments or cures, nor any way to make them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a brief segment, but it had me hooked. It all sounded so chilling and … <em>plausible</em>. After all, fungi like ones that cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/nail-infections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nail infections</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeast infections</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ringworm</a> already infect people.</p>



<p>So I consulted some experts on fungal infections to find out whether this could actually happen.</p>



<p>I’ve got good news and bad news.</p>



<p>First, the bad news.</p>



<h4>Bad news: Climate change has already helped one fungus mutate to infect humans.</h4>





<p>I wanted to know if warming has spurred any fungi to mutate and become infectious. So I called Arturo Casadevall. He has been thinking about fungi and heat for a long time. He’s proposed that the need to avoid fungal infections may have provided the evolutionary pressure that drove mammals and birds to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/just-warm-enough">evolve warm-bloodedness</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>).</p>



<p>Most fungal species simply can’t reproduce at human body temperature (37° Celsius, or 98.6° Fahrenheit). But as the world warms, “these strains either have to die or adapt,” says Casadevall, a microbiologist who specializes in fungal infections at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That raises the possibility that fungi that now infect insects or reptiles could evolve to grow at temperatures closer to human body temperature.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans&#8217; average body temperature has been falling</a> since the 19th century, at least in high-income countries, researchers reported in <em>eLife</em> in 2020. One study from the United Kingdom pegs average body temperature at 36.6° C (97.9° F). And some of us are even cooler.</p>



<p>Fungi’s possible adaptation to higher heat and humans’ cooling body temperature are on a collision course, Casadevall says.</p>

<p>He and colleagues presented evidence of one such crash. Climate change may have allowed a deadly fungus called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans"><em>Candida auris</em> to acclimate to human body temperatures</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/19</em>). A version of the fungus that could infect humans independently emerged on three continents from 2012 to 2015. “It’s not like someone took a plane a spread it. These things came out of nowhere simultaneously,” Casadevall says.</p>



<p>Some people argue that the planet hasn’t warmed enough to make fungi a problem, he says. “But you have to think about all the really hot days [that come with climate change]. Every really hot day is a selection event,” in which many fungi will die. But some of those fungi will have mutations that help them handle the heat. Those will survive. Their offspring may be able to survive future even hotter heat waves until human body temperature is no challenge.</p>



<p>Fungi that infect people are usually not picky about their hosts, Casadevall says. They will grow in soil or — if given an opportunity — in people, pets or in other animals. The reason fungi don’t infect people more often is that “the world is much colder than we are, and they have no need of us,” he says.</p>



<p>When people do get infected, the immune system usually keeps the fungi in check. But fungal infections can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">cause serious illness</a> or be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">deadly, particularly to people with weakened immune systems</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21; SN: 1/10/23</em>).</p>



<p>The second episode of <em>The Last of Us</em> reveals that the zombie-creating fungi initially spread through people eating contaminated flour. Then, the infected people attack and bite others, spreading the fungus.</p>



<p>In real life, most human infections arise from breathing in spores. But Casadevall says it’s “not implausible” that people could get infected by eating spores or by being bitten.</p>



<h4>Also bad: Fungal genes can adapt to higher heat.</h4>



<p>I also wondered exactly <em>how</em> a fungus could evolve in response to heat. Asiya Gusa, a fungal researcher at Duke University School of Medicine, has published one possibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, she and colleagues reported in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> on how one fungus mutated at elevated temperature to become harder to fight.</p>



<p><em>Cryptococcus deneoformans,</em> which already infects humans (though it’s no zombie-maker), <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2001451117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became resistant to some antifungal drugs</a> when grown at human body temperature. The resistance was born when mobile bits of DNA called transposons (often called jumping genes) hopped into a few genes needed for the antifungals to work.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study, Gusa and colleagues grew <em>C. deneoformans</em> at either 30° C or 37° C for 800 generations, long enough to detect multiple changes in their DNA. Fungi had no problem growing at the balmy 30° C (86° F), the temperature at which researchers typically grow fungi in the lab. But their growth slowed at the higher temperature, a sign that the fungi were under stress from the heat.</p>



<p>In <em>C. deneoformans</em>, that heat stress really got things jumping. One type of transposon accumulated a median of 12 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2209831120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra copies</a> of itself in fungi grown at body temperature. By contrast, fungi grown at 30° C tended to pick up a median of only one extra copy of the transposon. The team reported those results January 20 in <em>PNAS</em>. The researchers don’t yet know the effect the transposon hops might have on the fungi’s ability to infect people, cause disease or resist fungus-fighting drugs.</p>



<p>So yeah, the bad news is not great. Fungi are mutating in the heat and at least one species has gained the ability to infect people thanks to climate change. Other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">fungi that infect people are more widespread</a> than they were in the 1950s and 1960s, also thanks to a warming world (<em>SN: 1/4/23</em>).</p>



<p>But I promised good news. And here it is.</p>



<h4>Good news: Human brains may resist zombification.</h4>



<p>It may not be our body temperature, but our brain chemistry, that protects us from being hijacked by zombifying fungi.</p>



<p>I consulted Charissa de Bekker and Jui-Yu Chou, two researchers who study the <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> fungi that are the model for the TV show’s fungal menace. These fungi infect ants, flooding the insects with a cocktail of chemicals that steer the ants to climb plants. Once in position, the ants chomp down and the chemicals keep the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">jaw muscles locked</a> in place (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike most fictional zombies, the ants are alive during this process. “A lot of people get the misconception that we work on undead ants,” says de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She’s glad to see the show “stick to the story of the host being very much alive while its behaviors change.” The fungi even help preserve the ant, keeping it alive even while feeding on it. But eventually the ant dies. Then a mushroom rises from the corpse, showering spores onto the ground where other ants may become infected.</p>



<p>Related species of <em>Ophiocordyceps</em> infect various species of ants and other insects. But each fungal species is very specific to the host it infects. That’s because the fungi had to individualize the chemicals they use to control the particular species they infect. The ability to manipulate behavior comes at the cost of not being able to infect multiple species.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2.jpg" alt="A close up photo of ant infected by Ophiocordyceps fungi on a leaf." class="wp-image-3122055" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_ts_fungi-run-amok_inlne2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122055"><em>Ophiocordyceps</em> fungi that infect ants (shown here) are the inspiration for the fictional zombifying fungus on the show.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122055">Jui-Yu Chou</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A fungus that specializes in infecting ants probably can’t get past humans’ immune systems, says Chou, a fungal researcher at the National Changhua University of Education in Taiwan. “Think of a key that fits into a specific lock. It is only this unique combination that will trigger the lock to open,” he says.</p>



<p>Even if the fungi evolved to withstand human body temperature and immune system attacks, they probably couldn’t take control of our minds, de Bekker says. “Manipulation is like a whole different ballgame. You need a ton of additional tools to get there.” It took millions of years of coevolution for the fungi to master piloting ants, after all.</p>



<p>While fungi do make mind-altering chemicals that can affect human behavior (LSD and psilocybin, for instance), Casadevall agrees that fungi that mind control insects probably won’t turn humans into zombies. “It’s not one of my worries,” he says.</p>



<p>Infected ants don’t turn into vicious, biting zombies either, de Bekker says. “If anything, we actually see the healthy ants being aggressive toward infected individuals, once they figure out that they&#8217;re infected, to basically get rid of them.” That “social immunity” helps protect the rest of the nest from infection.</p>



<h4>Also good: Humans are innovative enough to develop treatments.</h4>



<p>The fictional scientist&#8217;s assertion that we couldn’t prevent, treat or cure these fungal infections is also a stretch.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs exist and they cure many fungal infections, though some infections may persist.&nbsp;Some that spread to the brain may be particularly difficult to clear.Some fungi are also evolving resistance to the drugs. And a few <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00294-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fungal vaccines are in the works</a>, although they may not be ready for years.</p>



<p>The experts I talked to say they hope the show will bring attention to real fungal diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gusa was especially glad to see fungi in the limelight. And she shares my fondness for that retro series opening in which the scientist predicts climate change could spawn mind-controlling fungi bent on infecting every person on the planet.</p>



<p>“I was pretty much yelling at the TV when I watched the [show’s] intro,” in an excited kind of way, she says. “This is the foundation of a lot of my grant funding … the threat of thermal adaptation of fungi.… To see it played out on the screen was something kind of fun.”</p>

<p>A paper that caught flak for its claims that an ancient city in the Middle East was destroyed by an exploding celestial body – and the authors’ suggestion that the event could have inspired the Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah – now has an editor’s note acknowledging the journal is looking into concerns about its data and conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The note follows a litany&nbsp; of criticism on Twitter, PubPeer, and in a “Matters Arising” response, as well as an extensive correction published last year. It appeared just days after Retraction Watch asked the publisher for an update on the case.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>,” was published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title, in September 2021. It has been cited six times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/113737860#score">Altmetric shows</a> it has gotten more online attention than most other papers of a similar age.&nbsp;</p>

One of the authors, Philip J. Silvia of Trinity Southwest University in Albuquerque, N.M., told us at the time that “the accusation that the image was photoshopped is categorically false.” But another author later acknowledged in a blog post that a graphic artist “made minor, cosmetic corrections to five of 53 images.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to comments about the images on PubPeer, corresponding author Allen West, whose affiliation is listed as “Comet Research Group,” located in Prescott, Ariz., <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#18">posted original versions</a> of seven images in the paper alongside the altered versions to show what was changed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06266-9">correction</a> to the paper in February 2022 listed several dozen figures that had been altered, and published original versions of them. The erratum stated:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next month, the journal published a “Matters Arising” in response to the original paper, titled, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08216-x">No mineralogic or geochemical evidence of impact at Tall el-Hammam, a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversation continued on PubPeer, sometimes with West and Silvia replying to questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last&nbsp; September, Boslough collected four outstanding issues with the paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#74">in a PubPeer post</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; Among these, he wrote, was “an egregious misrepresentation of my own work” in the paper’s figure 53, a depiction of an airburst simulation Boslough had presented at a conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to archives of <em>Scientific Reports</em>’ website, West had been a member of the journal’s editorial board as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306181639/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors#earthenvironment">March of 2020</a>, but was no longer listed on the site as of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210801042155/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">August 2021</a>. He has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Beginning soon after the Tall el-Hammam article’s publication, Boslough has been in contact with Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, about the issues he saw in the paper, his posts on PubPeer, and critical articles he was working on for the publication <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/12/sodom-meteor-strike-claims-should-be-taken-with-a-pillar-of-salt/"><em>Skeptical Inquirer</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boslough emailed Marszalek again in December, following West’s PubPeer comment about working with <em>Scientific Reports</em> on corrections to the article, and asked if the paper couldn’t at least be marked with an editor’s note while the journal considered what to do:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Forgive me for my increasing rate of messages asking for Bunch et al (2021) to either be retracted or corrected, but this is becoming urgent.

In some cases, the authors agree that the information is false (such as their incorrect labeling of my simulation in Figure 53, and the false claims about trees at Tunguska).

<p>Earlier this month, Boslough copied Retraction Watch on his latest email to Marszalek, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>​​As I&#8217;ve noted several times since we started corresponding in 2021, Scientific Reports needs to either retract or make several more immediate corrections to the paper by Bunch et al (2021). Most important to me is the removal from your journal of their Figure 53, which shows a photoshopped version of one of my airburst simulations with added labels that are wrong and a caption that misrepresents it and changes its meaning in an apparent attempt to use my model to support their hypothesis. I do not want their false claims to be misattributed to me… ​​Can you please put a statement of concern on this paper until it is retracted or until these and other corrections are made?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We also emailed Springer Nature’s press office to ask if correction was indeed underway, and on February 10 got the following response attributed to Marszalek:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation into this paper is still ongoing. The editors are looking into the concerns raised, which include but are not limited to those issues raised in the PubPeer comments. This process may take some time while we carefully consider available evidence and give all parties involved the chance to respond.</p>



<p>We will update our readers with further information as soon as we are able to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This editor’s note was posted on February 15:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that concerns raised about the data presented and the conclusions of this article are being considered by the Editors. A further editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what prompted the note’s publication, given the longstanding critiques of the paper. Marszalek responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When concerns are raised about papers we have published, we look into them carefully, following an established process. These issues are often complex and as a result, it can take time for editors and authors to fully investigate them.&nbsp; Given that it is taking significant time to unravel the concerns in this case, we felt it was in the best interests of the readership to add a note at this stage.&nbsp; For confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment further at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Responding to the editor’s note, Boslough told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is a positive development that is long overdue. Frankly, I think the paper is unsalvageable and no amount of correction would be sufficient to make it publishable. For example, data points in their map of debris directionality (Fig. 17) appear to be fabricated and the authors don&#8217;t seem to be capable of providing the raw data or methods so others can see how they arrived at their claimed wind vectors on which their conclusions are based. I hope this expression of concern leads to more scrutiny on the same group&#8217;s other papers with similarly troublesome claims based on data and methods that they have never revealed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stroke-recovery-new-treatment-implant-patient-paralysis">A new treatment could restore some mobility in people paralyzed by strokes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sitting in an exam room, surrounded by doctors and scientists, Heather Rendulic opened her left hand for the first time since suffering a series of strokes nine years earlier when she was in her early 20s.</p>



<p>“It was an amazing feeling for me to be able to do that again,” Rendulic says. “It’s not something I ever thought was possible.”</p>



<p>But immediately after a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02202-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surgically implanted device sent electrical pulses into her spinal cord</a>, Rendulic could not only open her hand but also showed other marked improvements in arm mobility, researchers report February 20 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. “We all started crying,” Marco Capogrosso, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a February 15 news conference. “We didn’t really expect this could work as fast as that.”</p>





<p>The approach is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinal-cord-injuries-stimulation-implants-paralysis-nerve-signals">similar to that recently used for patients paralyzed by spinal cord injuries</a> (<em>SN: 08/03/22</em>). It represents a promising new technique for restoring voluntary movement to those left with upper-body paralysis following strokes, the team says.</p>



<p>A stroke occurs when blood supply to parts of the brain is cut off, often causing short-term or long-term issues with movement, speech and vision. Stroke is a leading, and often underappreciated, cause of paralysis; in the United States alone, 5 million people are living with some form of motor deficit due to stroke. While physical therapy can provide some improvements, no treatment exists to help these patients regain full control of their limbs — and their lives.</p>



<p>Strokes cause paralysis because the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged; the brain tries to tell the spinal cord to move certain muscles, but the message is muddled.</p>



<p>So, taking advantage of techniques already existing for spinal injections of anesthetics, the team invented an electrical device that can be placed along the spinal cord to stimulate the nerves there. The stimulation “does not hurt whatsoever,” Rendulic says. “It feels like a vibration.”</p>



<p>By aligning the electrodes on the device with sensory nerves, “we can enhance the activation of muscles that are weakened by the stroke,” Douglas Weber, an engineer and neuroscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said at the news conference. Pulses from these electrodes seek to amplify signals from the brain, stimulating sensory nerves that go on to activate muscles, restoring voluntary body control to patients.</p>



<p>Rendulic and the other patient in the study both showed improvement in mobility tasks, including drawing a spiral, opening a lock and gripping and lifting a soup can while the device was on. Treatment sessions of continuous electrical stimulation were held for four hours per day, five days a week, over 29 days, and the improvements persisted for as long as four weeks after treatment stopped. This makes the researchers optimistic that they can get even stronger results if the treatment were paired with intensive physical training, Elvira Pirondini, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, said at the news conference.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="A new spinal implant lets a stroke patient regain arm motion | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkWOVH4_uJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After a series of strokes nine years ago, Heather Rendulic lost the use of her left arm and hand. Now, thanks to an implanted device that sends electrical pulses into spinal nerves, she has regained some function. Here, she feeds herself and sorts blocks while the device is on, but has trouble doing those tasks when the stimulation is turned off. The implant sends electrical pulses into spinal nerves, circumventing the damaged connection between the brain and the spinal cord. (Devices on her arm are just for monitoring.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>She and the rest of the team are actively testing the device with other patients, and also exploring if pairing it with physical training can improve outcomes. The researchers are hopeful that it will be widely accessible because the surgery to implant it is minimally invasive and routine, and the value of the procedure can be clearly demonstrated, which is important to convince insurance companies to cover it.</p>





<p>The treatment might not work well for patients with severe mobility impairment, says UCLA neurologist Bruce Dobkin, who was not involved with the study. But it could serve as a “new tool to try to maximize the recovery” of stroke patients with more moderate paralysis, in combination with other therapies.</p>



<p>For Rendulic, the proven potential of using spinal cord stimulation to treat paralysis caused by stroke gives her hope for the future. “I really hope and pray that this becomes widely available,” she says, “because I know it’s going to change so many lives.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-perseverance-rover-nasa-water-life">What has Perseverance found in two years on Mars?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In August 2021 on a lonely crater floor, the newest Mars rover dug into one of its first rocks.</p>



<p>The percussive drill attached to the arm of the Perseverance rover scraped the dust and top several millimeters off a rocky outcrop in a 5-centimeter-wide circle. From just above, one of the rover’s cameras captured what looked like broken shards wedged against one another. The presence of interlocking crystal textures became obvious. Those textures were not what most of the scientists who had spent years preparing for the mission expected.</p>





<p>Then the scientists watched on a video conference as the rover’s two spectrometers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103522002809?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the chemistry</a> of those meshed textures. The visible shapes along with the chemical compositions showed that this rock, dubbed Rochette, was volcanic in origin. It was not made up of the layers of clay and silt that would be found at a former lake bed.</p>



<p>Nicknamed Percy, the rover <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">arrived at the Jezero crater two years ago</a>, on February 18, 2021, with its sidekick helicopter, Ingenuity. The most complex spacecraft to explore the Martian surface, Percy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">builds on the work</a> of the Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars since 2012, the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers, the Sojourner rover and other landers.</p>



<p>But Perseverance’s main purpose is different. While the earlier rovers focused on Martian geology and understanding the planet’s environment, Percy is looking for signs of past life. Jezero was picked for the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars 2020 mission</a> because it appears from orbit to be a former lake environment where microbes could have thrived, and its large delta would likely preserve any signs of them. Drilling, scraping and collecting pieces of the Red Planet, the rover is using its seven science instruments to analyze the bits for any hint of ancient life. It’s also collecting samples to return to Earth.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where on Mars is Perseverance?</h3>



<p>After landing on the Red Planet, Perseverance tested its movements and instruments for several months before exploring the floor of the Jezero crater. Percy then journeyed to the delta, arriving in April 2022. The rover explored the delta front through December, before carefully depositing samples on the surface. Next, it’s headed to the top of the delta.</p>

<p>Since landing, “we’ve been able to start putting together the story of what has happened in Jezero, and it’s pretty complex,” says Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who helps plan Percy’s day-to-day and long-term operations.</p>



<p>Volcanic rock is just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">one of the surprises the rover has uncovered</a>. Hundreds of researchers scouring the data Perseverance has sent back so far now have some clues to how the crater has evolved over time. This basin has witnessed flowing lava, at least one lake that lasted perhaps tens of thousands of years, running rivers that created a mud-and-sand delta and heavy flooding that brought rocks from faraway locales.</p>



<p>Jezero has a more dynamic past than scientists had anticipated. That volatility has slowed the search for sedimentary rocks, but it has also pointed to new alcoves where ancient life could have taken hold.</p>



<p>Perseverance has turned up carbon-bearing materials — the basis of life on Earth — in every sample it has abraded, Horgan says. “We’re seeing that everywhere.” And the rover still has much more to explore.</p>

<h4>Perseverance finds unexpected rocks</h4>



<p>Jezero is a shallow impact crater about 45&nbsp;kilo­meters in diameter just north of the planet’s equator. The crater formed sometime between 3.7&nbsp;billion and 4.1&nbsp;billion years ago, in the solar system’s first billion years. It sits in an older and much larger impact basin known as Isidis. At Jezero’s western curve, an etched ancient riverbed gives way to a dried-out, fan-shaped delta on the crater floor. </p>



<p>That delta “is like this flashing signpost beautifully visible from orbit that tells us there was a standing body of water here,” says astrobiologist Ken Williford of Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle.</p>



<p>Perseverance landed on the crater floor about two kilometers from the front of the delta. Scientists thought they’d find compacted layers of soil and sand there, at the base of what they dubbed Lake Jezero. But the landscape immediately looked different than expected, says planetary geologist Kathryn Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Stack Morgan is deputy project scientist for Perseverance.</p>

<p>For the first several months after the landing, the Mars 2020 mission team tested the rover’s movements and instruments, slowly, carefully. But from the first real science drilling near the landing location, researchers back on Earth realized what they had found. The texture of the rock, Stack Morgan says, was “a textbook igneous volcanic rock texture.” It looked like volcanic lava flows.</p>



<p>Over the next six months, several more rocks on the crater floor revealed igneous texture. Some of the most exciting rocks, including Rochette, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed olivine crystals throughout</a>. “The crystal fabric was obviously cooled from a melt, not transported grains,” as would be the case if it were a sedimentary sample, says Abigail Allwood of the Jet Propulsion Lab. She leads the rover’s PIXL instrument, which uses an X-ray beam to identify each sample’s composition.</p>



<p>Mission scientists now think the crater floor is filled with igneous rocks from two separate events — both after the crater was created, so more recently than the 3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago time frame. In one, magma from deep within the planet pushed toward the surface, cooled and solidified, and was later exposed by erosion. In the other, smaller lava flows streamed at the surface.</p>

<h3>Seeking signs of ancient life</h3>



<p>X-ray spectrometry of an abraded rock from the floor of the Jezero crater offers clues to the rock&#8217;s chemistry. These and other data can help scientists in the search for ancient life.</p>

<p>Sometime after these events, water flowed from the nearby highlands into the crater to form a lake tens of meters deep and lasting tens of thousands of years at least, according to some team members. Percy’s instruments have revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways that water altered the igneous rocks</a>: For example, scientists have found sulfates and other minerals that require water to form, and they’ve seen empty pits within the rocks’ cracks, where water would have washed away material. As that water flowed down the rivers into the lake, it deposited silt and mud, forming the delta. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flooding delivered 1.5-meter-wide boulders</a> from that distant terrain. All of these events preceded the drying of the lake, which might have happened about 3&nbsp;billion years ago.</p>



<p>Core samples, which Perseverance is collecting and storing on board for eventual return to Earth, could provide dates for when the igneous rocks formed, as well as when the Martian surface became parched. During the time between, Lake Jezero and other wet environments may have been stable enough for microbial life to start and survive.</p>



<p>“Nailing down the geologic time scale is of critical importance for us understanding Mars as a habitable world,” Stack Morgan says. “And we can’t do that without samples to date.”</p>



<p>About a year after landing on Mars, Perseverance rolled several kilometers across the crater floor to the delta front — where it encountered a very different geology.</p>



<h4>The delta might hold signs of ancient life</h4>



<p>Deltas mark standing, lasting bodies of water — stable locales that could support life. Plus, as a delta grows over time, it traps and preserves organic matter.</p>



<p>Sand and silt deposited where a river hits a lake get layered into sedimentary material, building up a fan-shaped delta. “If you have any biological material that is trapped between that sediment, it gets buried very quickly,” says Mars geologist Eva Scheller of MIT, a researcher with the Percy team. “It creates this environment that is very, very good for preserving the organic matter.”</p>



<p>While exploring the delta front between April 2022 and December 2022, Perseverance found some of the sedimentary rocks it was after.</p>

<p>Several of the rover’s instruments zoomed in on the textures and shapes of the rocks, while other instruments collected detailed spectral information, revealing the elements present in those rocks. By combining the data, researchers can piece together what the rocks are made of and what processes might have changed them over the eons. It’s this chemistry that could reveal signs of ancient Martian life — biosignatures. Scientists are still in the early stages of these analyses.</p>



<p>There won’t be one clear-cut sign of life, Allwood says. Instead, the rover would more likely reveal “an assemblage of characteristics,” with evidence slowly building that life once existed there.</p>



<p>Chemical characteristics suggestive of life are most likely to hide in sedimentary rocks, like those Perseverance has studied at the delta front. Especially interesting are rocks with extremely fine-grained mud. Such mud sediments, Horgan says, are where — in deltas on Earth, at least — organic matter is concentrated. So far, though, the rover hasn’t found those muddy materials.</p>



<p>But the sedimentary rocks studied have revealed carbonates, sulfates and unexpected salts — all <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materials indicating interaction with water</a> and important for life as we know it. Percy has found carbon-based matter in every rock it has abraded, Horgan says.</p>



<p>“We’ve had some really interesting results that we’re pretty excited to share with the community,” Horgan says about the exploration of the delta front. Some of those details may be revealed in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.</p>



<h4>Perseverance leaves samples for a future mission</h4>



<p>As of early February, Perseverance <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-rock-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has collected 18&nbsp;samples</a>, including bits of Mars debris and cores from rocks, and stored them on board in sealed capsules for eventual return to Earth. The samples come from the crater floor, delta front rocks and even the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the final weeks of 2022 and the first weeks of 2023, the rover dropped — or rather, carefully set down — half of the collected samples, as well as a tube that would reveal whether samples contained any earthly contaminants. These captured pieces of Mars are now sitting at the front of the delta, at a predetermined spot called the Three Forks region.</p>

If the rover isn’t operable when a future mission arrives at Mars, the samples can still be collected and returned to Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121933">JPL-CALTECH/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If Perseverance isn’t functioning well enough to hand over its onboard samples when a future sample-return spacecraft arrives, that mission will collect these samples from the drop site to bring back to Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers are currently working on designs for a joint Mars mission between NASA and the European Space Agency that could retrieve the samples. Launching in the late 2020s, it would land near the Perseverance rover. Percy would transfer the samples to a small rocket to be launched from Mars and returned to Earth in the 2030s. Lab tests could then confirm what Perseverance is already uncovering and discover much more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Percy is climbing up the delta</a> to explore its top, where muddy sedimentary rocks may still be found. The next target is the edge of the once-lake, where shallow water long ago stood. This is the site Williford is most excited about. Much of what we know about the history of how life has evolved on Earth comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">environments with shallow water</a>, he says. “That’s where really rich, underwater ecosystems start to form,” he says. “There’s so much going on there chemically.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-limbs-ants-locomotion">This robot automatically tucks its limbs to squeeze through spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inspired by how ants move through narrow spaces by shortening their legs, scientists have built a robot that draws in its limbs to navigate constricted passages.</p>



<p>The robot was able to hunch down and walk quickly through passages <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that were narrower and shorter than itself</a>, researchers report January 20 in <em>Advanced Intelligent System</em>s. It could also climb over steps and move on grass, loose rock, mulch and crushed granite.</p>



<p>Such generality and adaptability are the main challenges of legged robot locomotion, says robotics engineer Feifei Qian, who was not involved in the study. Some robots have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-legged-robot-hints-how-ancient-tetrapods-walked">specialized limbs</a> to move over a particular terrain, but they cannot squeeze into small spaces (<em>SN: 1/16/19</em>).</p>





<p>“A design that can adapt to a variety of environments with varying scales or stiffness is a lot more challenging, as trade-offs between the different environments need to be considered,” says Qian, of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>For inspiration, researchers in the new study turned to ants. “Insects are really <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-robots-could-learn-fire-ants">a neat inspiration for designing robot systems</a> that have minimal actuation but can perform a multitude of locomotion behaviors,” says Nick Gravish, a roboticist at the University of California, San Diego (<em>SN: 8/16/18</em>). Ants adapt their posture to crawl through tiny spaces. And they aren’t perturbed by uneven terrain or small obstacles. For example, their legs collapse a bit when they hit an object, Gravish says, and the ants continue to move forward quickly.</p>



<p>Gravish and colleagues built a short, stocky robot — about 30 centimeters wide and 20 centimeters long — with four wavy, telescoping limbs. Each limb consists of six nested concentric tubes that can draw into each other. What’s more, the limbs do not need to be actively powered or adjusted to change their overall length. Instead, springs that connect the leg segments automatically allow the legs to contract when the robot navigates a narrow space and stretch back out in an open space. The goal was to build mechanically intelligent structures rather than algorithmically intelligent robots.</p>



<p>“It’s likely faster than active control, [which] requires the robot to first sense the contact with the environment, compute the suitable action and then send the command to its motors,” Qian says, about these legs. Removing the sensing and computing components can also make the robots small, cheap and less power hungry.</p>



<p>The robot could modify its body width and height to achieve a larger range of body sizes than other similar robots. The leg segments contracted into themselves to let the robot wiggle through small tunnels and sprawled out when under low ceilings. This adaptability let the robot squeeze into spaces as small as 72 percent its full width and 68 percent its full height.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Like ants, a new type of robot can contract its legs to move through narrow spaces and hunch down to traverse spaces shorter than itself. It can also climb over steps and move on grass and loose rock.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, the researchers plan to actively control the stiffness of the springs that connect the leg segments to tune the motion to terrain type without consuming too much power. “That way, you can keep your leg long when you are moving on open ground or over tall objects, but then collapse down to the smallest possible shape in confined spaces,” Gravish says.</p>





<p>Such small-scale, minimal robots are easy to produce and can be quickly tweaked to explore complex environments. However, despite being able to walk across different terrains, these robots are, for now, too fragile for search-and-rescue, exploration or biological monitoring, Gravish says.</p>



<p>The new robot takes a step closer to those goals, but getting there will take more than just robotics, Qian says. “To actually achieve these applications would require an integration of design, control, sensing, planning and hardware advancement.”</p>



<p>But that’s not Gravish’s interest. Instead, he wants to connect these experiments back to what was observed in the ants originally and use the robots to ask more questions about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-robot-pigeon-can-bend-wings-like-real-bird">the rules of locomotion in nature</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>). </p>



<p>“I really would like to understand how small insects are able to move so rapidly across certain unpredictable terrain,” he says. “What is special about their limbs that enables them to move so quickly?”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593492307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Climate Book</a><br><em>Greta Thunberg</em><br><em>Penguin Press, $30</em></p>



<p>The best shot we have at minimizing the future impacts of climate change is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since the Industrial Revolution began, humankind has already raised the average global temperature by about 1.1 degrees. If we continue to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate, the world will probably surpass the 1.5-degree threshold by the end of the decade.</p>



<p>That sobering fact makes clear that climate change isn’t just a problem to solve someday soon; it’s an emergency to respond to now. And yet, most people don’t act like we’re in the midst of the greatest crisis humans have ever faced — not politicians, not the media, not your neighbor, not myself, if I’m honest. That’s what I realized after finishing <em>The Climate Book</em> by Greta Thunberg.</p>





<p>The urgency to act now, to kick the addiction to fossil fuels, practically jumps off the page to punch you in the gut. So while not a pleasant read — it’s quite stressful — it’s a book I can’t recommend enough. The book’s aim is not to convince skeptics that climate change is real. We’re well past that. Instead, it’s a wake-up call for anyone concerned about the future.</p>



<p>A collection of bite-size essays, <em>The Climate Book</em> provides an encyclopedic overview of all aspects of the climate crisis, including the basic science, the history of denialism and inaction, and what to do next. Thunberg, who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">became the face of climate activism</a> after starting the Fridays For Future protests as a teenager (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>), assembles an all-star roster of experts to write the essays.</p>



<p>The first two sections of the book lay out how a small amount of warming can have major, far-reaching effects. For some readers, this will be familiar territory. But as each essay builds on the next, it becomes clear just how delicate Earth’s climate system is. What also becomes clear is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the significance of 1.5 degrees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). Beyond this point, scientists fear, various aspects of the natural world might reach tipping points that usher in irreversible changes, even if greenhouse gas emissions are later brought under control. Ice sheets could melt, raise sea levels and drown coastal areas. The Amazon rainforest could become a dry grassland.</p>



<p>The cumulative effect would be a complete transformation of the climate. Our health and the livelihood of other species and entire ecosystems would be in danger, the book shows. Not surprisingly, essay after essay ends with the same message: We must cut greenhouse gas emissions, now and quickly.</p>



<p>Repetition is found elsewhere in the book. Numerous essays offer overlapping scientific explanations, stats about emissions, historical notes and thoughts about the future. Rather than being tedious, the repetition reinforces the message that we know what the climate change threat is, we know how to tackle it and we’ve known for a long time.</p>





<p>Thunberg’s anger and frustration over the decades of inaction, false starts and broken pledges are palpable in her own essays that run throughout the book. The world has known about human-caused climate change for decades, yet about half of all human-related carbon dioxide emissions ever released have occurred since 1990. That’s the year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its first report</a> and just two years before world leaders met in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to sign the first international treaty to curb emissions (<em>SN: 6/23/90</em>).</p>



<p>Perversely, the people who will bear the brunt of the extreme storms, heat waves, rising seas and other impacts of climate change are those who are least culpable. The richest 10 percent of the world’s population accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions while the top 1 percent emits more than twice as much as the bottom half. But because of a lack of resources, poorer populations are the least equipped to deal with the fallout. “Humankind has not created this crisis,” Thunberg writes, “it was created by those in power.”</p>



<p>That injustice must be confronted and accounted for as the world addresses climate change, perhaps even through reparations, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a philosopher at Georgetown University, argues in one essay.</p>



<p>So what is the path forward? Thunberg and many of her coauthors are generally skeptical that new tech alone will be our savior. Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, for example, has been heralded as one way to curb emissions. But less than a third of the roughly 150 planned CCS projects that were supposed to be operational by 2020 are up and running. </p>



<p>Progress has been impeded by expenses and technology fails, science writer Ketan Joshi explains. An alternative might be “rewilding,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">restoring damaged mangrove forests</a>, seagrass meadows and other ecosystems that naturally suck CO<sub>2</sub> out of the air (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>), suggest environmental activists George Monbiot and Rebecca Wrigley.</p>



<p>Fixing the climate problem will not only require transforming our energy and transportation systems, which often get the most attention, but also our economies (endless growth is not sustainable), political systems and connection to nature and with each other, the book’s authors argue.</p>



<p>The last fifth of the book lays out how we could meet this daunting challenge. What’s needed is a critical mass of individuals who are willing to make lifestyle changes and be heard. This could trigger a social movement strong enough to force politicians to listen and create systemic and structural change. In other words, it’s time to start acting like we’re in a crisis. Thunberg doesn’t end the book by offering hope. Instead, she argues we each have to make our own hope.</p>



<p>“To me, hope is not something that is given to you, it is something you have to earn, to create,” she writes. “It cannot be gained passively, through standing by and waiting for someone else to do something. Hope is taking action.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassy-eyes-young-crustaceans-predators">Glassy eyes may help young crustaceans hide from predators in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fledgling crustaceans have eyes like the sea, a peculiarity that could help them hide from predators.</p>



<p>Young shrimp, crab or lobster larvae already rock nearly translucent bodies to stay out of view. But dark eye pigments essential for vision pose the risk of exposing the animals anyway.</p>



<p>Some see-through ocean animals rely on mirrored irises or minuscule eyes to avoid detection. Young shrimp and prawns, on the other hand, camouflage their dark pigments behind light-reflecting <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass made of tiny, crystalline spheres</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Variations in the size and placement of the orbs allow the crustaceans’ eyes to shine light that precisely matches the color of the surrounding water, possibly rendering them invisible to predators on the hunt for a meal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Technologies that mimic the nanospheres’ structure could one day inspire more efficient solar energy or bio-friendly paints, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“I’ve often wondered what’s going on with [these animals&#8217;] eyeshine,” says evolutionary biologist Heather Bracken-Grissom of Florida International University in Miami, who was not involved in the study. She and colleagues often collect crustaceans from the deep sea, giving them nicknames like “blue-eyed arthropod” or “green-eyed, weird-looking shrimp” because the creatures don’t resemble their adult forms. Now, she says, that eye color makes sense.</p>



<p>In the study, chemist Keshet Shavit and colleagues used an electron microscope to peer into the eyes of lab-raised and wild crustaceans. Inside shrimp and prawn eyes, the team found crystalline nanospheres made of isoxanthopterin, a molecule that reflects light.</p>



<p>The spheres are a bit like disco balls, with highly reflective surfaces pointing outward, says study coauthor Benjamin Palmer, a chemist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel. Each sphere is made of thin, isoxanthopterin plates that stick together to form balls that range in size from around 250 to 400 nanometers in diameter.</p>



<p>These balls are arranged in clusters at the base of protein-dense cones that focus light on the animal’s light-sensing nerves, and form a protective cover over the pigmented cells. But crustacean larvae can still see because there are small holes in the glass, Palmer says. “It’s basically allowing light to go down to the retina on some specific angles, but on other angles, it’s reflecting light back.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>The size and order of the spheres seem to influence the color of the reflected light, the team’s observations and computer simulations show.</p>



<p>“The correlation between the particle size and the eyeshine color is beyond amazing,” says Shavit, also at Ben-Gurion University. Nanosphere size appears to help the animals’ eyes match the color of their native habitat, helping the critters blend into the background. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Blue-eyed shrimp that inhabit the Gulf of Aqaba’s clear blue waters off the coast of Israel, for instance, have spheres that are approximately 250 to 325 nanometers in diameter. The 400-nanometer-wide spheres of a freshwater prawn (<em>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</em>)<em> </em>glitter yellow-green, mimicking muddy waters found in the salty estuaries where they live.</p>

Shavit</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The prawn’s eyes also seem to be able to reflect different colors in different environments. Individuals exposed to sunlight for four hours in the lab had silvery yellow eyes, possibly a result of nanospheres arranged in a disorganized jumble. But individuals left in the dark overnight had green eyes. Their nanospheres are arranged in layers — though the orbs within each layer are still disorganized, Palmer says.</p>



<p>Such adaptable eyes could help larvae move undetected through different parts of the ocean as changing light levels alter the color of the water, Bracken-Grissom says. At night, young crustaceans migrate to shallow waters to feed and dive back down when the sun rises. “If they are in fact using it as a form of camouflage, it would be an ingenious way to camouflage themselves as they move through these different light environments.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelics-improve-mental-health-nerve-cells">Psychedelics may improve mental health by getting inside nerve cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Psychedelics go beneath the cell surface to unleash their potentially therapeutic effects.</p>



<p>These drugs are showing promise in clinical trials as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">treatments for mental health disorders</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/21</em>). Now, scientists might know why. These substances <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can get inside nerve cells in the cortex</a> — the brain region important for consciousness — and tell the neurons to grow, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Several mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are tied to chronic stress, which degrades neurons in the cortex over time. Scientists have long thought that repairing the cells could provide therapeutic benefits, like lowered anxiety and improved mood.</p>





<p>Psychedelics — including psilocin, which comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-treat-depression-mushrooms-psychedelic">magic mushrooms</a>, and LSD — do that repairing by promoting the growth of nerve cell branches that receive information, called dendrites (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>). The behavior might explain the drugs’ positive outcomes in research. But how they trigger cell growth was a mystery.</p>



<p>It was already known that, in cortical neurons, psychedelics activate a certain protein that receives signals and gives instructions to cells. This protein, called the 5-HT2A receptor, is also stimulated by serotonin, a chemical made by the body and implicated in mood. But a study in 2018 determined that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serotonin doesn’t make these neurons grow</a>. That finding “was really leaving us scratching our heads,” says chemical neuroscientist David Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>To figure out why these two types of chemicals affect neurons differently, Olson and colleagues tweaked some substances to change how well they activated the receptor. But those better equipped to turn it on didn’t make neurons grow. Instead, the team noticed that “greasy” substances, like LSD, that easily pass through cells’ fatty outer layers resulted in neurons branching out.</p>



<p>Polar chemicals such as serotonin, which have unevenly distributed electrical charges and therefore can’t get into cells, didn’t induce growth. Further experiments showed that most cortical neurons’ 5-HT2A receptors are located inside the cell, not at the surface where scientists have mainly studied them.</p>



<p>But once serotonin gained access to the cortical neurons’ interior — via artificially added gateways in the cell surface — it too led to growth. It also induced antidepressant-like effects in mice. A day after receiving a surge in serotonin, animals whose brain cells contained unnatural entry points didn’t give up as quickly as normal mice when forced to swim. In this test, the longer the mice tread water, the more effective an antidepressant is predicted to be, showing that inside access to 5-HT2A receptors is key for possible therapeutic effects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It seems to overturn a lot about what we think should be true about how these drugs work,” says neuroscientist Alex Kwan of Cornell University, who was not involved in the study. “Everybody, including myself, thought that [psychedelics] act on receptors that are on the cell surface.”</p>





<p>That’s where most receptors that function like 5-HT2A are found, says biochemist Javier González-Maeso of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who was also not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Because serotonin can’t reach 5-HT2A receptors inside typical cortical neurons, Olson proposes that the receptors might respond to a different chemical made by the body. “If it’s there, it must have some kind of role,” he says. DMT, for example, is a naturally occurring psychedelic made by plants and animals, including humans, and can reach a cell’s interior.</p>



<p>Kwan disagrees. “It’s interesting that psychedelics can act on them, but I don’t know if the brain necessarily needs to use them when performing its normal function.” Instead, he suggests that the internal receptors might be a reserve pool, ready to replace those that get degraded on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Either way, understanding the cellular mechanisms behind psychedelics’ potential therapeutic effects could help scientists develop safer and more effective treatments for mental health disorders.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, I hope this leads to better medicines,” Olson says. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Setting sail into a plastic sea</strong> —<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environment-190"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 10, 1973</p>



<p>Scientists on an oceanographic voyage in the Central North Pacific last August became startled about the number of manmade objects littering the ocean surface. [Far from civilization and shipping lanes], they recorded 53 manmade objects in 8.2&nbsp;hours of viewing. More than half were plastic. They go on to compute that there are between 5 million and 35&nbsp;million plastic bottles adrift in the North Pacific.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is larger now than it was in 1973, containing an estimated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-pacific-garbage-patch-new-size-estimates">1.8 trillion pieces of plastic</a> within an area twice the size of Texas (<em>SN Online: 3/22/18</em>). In recent years, marine biologists have started seeing evidence that garbage is disrupting ocean ecosystems. For instance, large pieces of trash have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heres-breakdown-animals-crossed-pacific-2011-tsunami-debris">helped species cross into new territories</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/17, p. 32</em>). But an even greater threat may lurk beneath the waves. Tiny bits of plastic concentrate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">hundreds of meters deep</a> where they can be eaten by filter feeders and potentially make their way into the guts of larger predators (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 5</em>).</p>

<p>A university investigation in Hong Kong found that a professor used the email account of a former student to conduct all the correspondence needed to edit special issues of two journals, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two special issues, which were published last year, are full of articles with the hallmarks of paper mills, said Dorothy Bishop, an Oxford psychologist and scientific sleuth who flagged the matter to the institution involved in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, Bishop emailed the president of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with the information that Kaifa Zhao, a PhD student at the university, was listed as the lead editor for two special issues of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, </em>both journals published by Hindawi. The nearly 300 articles in the special issues were “mostly meaningless gobbledegook” that suggested they came from a paper mill, she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The episode is the latest of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/27/disbelief-researchers-watch-out-for-this-new-scam-involving-journal-special-issues/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/journal-run-by-new-ama-president-elect-caught-in-special-issue-scam/">problems</a> involving <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">questionable</a> peer review of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">special issues</a> – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/06/publisher-retracts-400-papers-at-once-for-violations-of-peer-review-process-policies/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retractions</a> – we’ve covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126561"></span>



<p>“There is no question that whoever is letting these fraudulent papers into the literature is guilty of serious academic fraud,” Bishop wrote, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. “The only possible defense that I can imagine is if Mr Zhao Kaifa is a victim of identity theft.”</p>



<p>According to the university’s response to Bishop, that’s indeed what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">PolyU’s Department of Computing convened a panel to meet with Zhao and his supervisor 10 days after receiving Bishop’s email. In the meeting, Zhao said that Yizhang Jiang, one of the supervisors of his master’s degree studies at Jiangnan University in Wuxi, China, “borrowed” his Hindawi journal account and PolyU email account and passwords and used them to edit the special issues. It’s unclear why he did so.</p>



<p>“According to Mr Zhao, he was not aware of relevant emails from Hindawi and has never responded to emails that are related to the two special issues,” a university staffer wrote to Bishop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university contacted Jiang, who confirmed that he had been “managing” Zhao’s accounts. The researcher said that Zhao did not know he was named an editor of the journal special issues until Bishop’s emails. Both Zhao and Jiang told the university that Zhao didn’t receive any payments related to the special issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for consequences, the university’s email stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The panel reminded Mr Zhao regarding proper use of his email account and personal data protection in the meeting. Mr Zhao admitted and understood that he should not have shared information of his PolyU account email and password with others.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email also said that the department would refer the matter to the university’s IT office “to further investigate if Mr. Zhao has been involved in any misconduct related to these two journal special issues through the usage of his PolyU email account, and will consider proper penalty to be imposed onto the student.”</p>



<p>Neither Zhao nor Jiang has responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to Hindawi for comment on PolyU’s findings, as well as the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Advanced+Big+Data+Analysis+Technologies+for+Environmental+Monitoring+Data%22%2C">PubPeer</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22BCI-based+Mobile+Computing+in+the+Internet+of+Medical+Things%22">posts</a> about papers in the two special issues, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/si/870528/">Advanced Big Data Analysis Technologies for Environmental Monitoring Data</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/si/736482/">BCI-based Mobile Computing in the Internet of Medical Things</a>.&#8221; A spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are investigating these papers and will take appropriate action on the articles and author in question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The whole thing is a huge mess,” Bishop told us when we asked for her take on the situation.&nbsp;She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My personal view is that where we have editor of a special issue that contains clearly weird content – with inappropriate citations, gobbledegook text, content that is way off topic – then the default assumption should be that the editor is working for a paper mill and all content of the special issue is suspect and needs to be retracted. If more evidence is needed, it should be obtained from the peer review record – my guess is that this would reveal superficial and very rapid reviews that totally fail to engage with the content (such as it is) and may come from reviewers with fake email addresses.</p>



<p>Instead, we seem to have a system where the publisher is slowly going through articles one at a time, checking with the authors and editors (who may be using fake email addresses from paper mills, and so can slow things down by delayed replies or silence), and using a very high bar of evidence for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Separately, last October Bishop contacted the <a href="https://doaj.org/about/">Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a>, an index of journals that publish papers without paywalls, about Hindawi titles on its list with paper mill content. One of those journals was the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em>, for which Zhao had appeared to edit a special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bishop told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think DOAJ, and indeed other indices, could play an important role in delisting journals found to have more than a minimal level of paper mill content, as this would remove the value to those placing articles there.</p>



<p>The only issue then is the collateral damage to honest authors who have published in those journals – I’m sure these do exist, and it is very unfortunate that they will find themselves&nbsp; published in a journal that has a tainted reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Within a few days of Bishop’s email, a DOAJ staffer told her by email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to work with you and other members of the research community to be able to identify these problems sooner, remove offending journals from DOAJ and try to ensure these practices are eliminated as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, months later, no Hindawi journals seem to have been removed from DOAJ’s index. Bishop said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I always hope organisations will act more quickly than they do, but I think DOAJ behaved reasonably, but were perhaps too trusting that Hindawi would take the initiative in getting paper mill content removed quickly.&nbsp; To my mind the key question is whether DOAJ will now act quickly to suspend from the register the journals that have been identified as having a very large number of PubPeer comments by paper mill sleuths.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about Consciousness and Information Theory based on selection of 3 papers. For more information, please see the list of papers and an abstract below.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which
incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological
axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it
differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to
non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular
spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how
physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate
experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as
&quot;differences that make a difference&quot; within a system, and integrated information as
information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By
applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of
systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally
irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and
the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS
specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information Φ_Max its quantity.
From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense
into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the
quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to
the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated
MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can
be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true
&quot;zombies&quot; - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious
complexes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-fossil-leaves-fold-insect-bites">Insect bites in plant fossils reveal leaves could fold shut millions of years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>As early as 252 million years ago, some plants may have curled up their leaves at night for a cozy “sleep.”</p>



<p>Fossilized leaves of two now-extinct <em>Gigantonoclea</em> species bear signs of nyctinasty, or circadian rhythmic folding at night, researchers report February 15 in <em>Current Biology</em>. That would make these specimens the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.12.043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first known fossilized examples of this curious plant behavior</a>, the team says.</p>



<p>The two leaf fossils were discovered in a rock layer in southwestern China that dates to between 259 million and 252 million years ago. In both species, the leaves were broad, with serrated edges. But most curiously, they bear oddly symmetrical holes.</p>

<p>Insects made those holes while feeding on the leaves while they were folded, say paleontologist Zhuo Feng of Yunnan University in Kunming, China and colleagues. Similar symmetrical patterns of insect damage in leaf fossils can be used to distinguish folding behavior from leaves that might have shriveled as the plant died, the team says.</p>



<p>Modern plants, including many in the legume family such as the orchid tree, that fold and unfold their leaves use specialized cells called pulvinus cells, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-muscles-fold-mimosa-leaf">which act somewhat like muscles</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/23</em>). By shifting water from one part of the leaf to another, the cells can bloat or deflate, allowing the leaves to fold or curl. </p>



<p>These cells would be at the base of the leaves, which weren’t preserved in the fossils, so it’s not possible to say whether these ancient plants also had pulvinus cells, the team says. Although it&#8217;s also hard to prove this was nighttime behavior, the leaves would also have had to be folded long enough for insects to do their munching. But the find does suggest that such leaf folding emerged independently in different plant lineages: Nearly all the modern plants that do this are angiosperms, or flowering plants. But <em>Gigantonoclea</em> plants were gymnosperms, seed-producing plants such as conifers and ginkgos.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">Rapid melting is eroding vulnerable cracks in Thwaites Glacier’s underbelly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Antarctica’s most vulnerable climate hot spot is a remote and hostile place — a narrow sliver of seawater, beneath a slab of floating ice more than half a kilometer thick. Scientists have finally explored it, and uncovered something surprising.</p>



<p>“The melt rate is much weaker than we would have thought, given how warm the ocean is,” says Peter Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge who was part of the team that drilled a narrow hole into this nook and lowered instruments into it. The finding might seem like good news — but it isn’t, he says. “Despite those low melt rates, we’re still seeing rapid retreat” as the ice vanishes faster than it’s being replenished.</p>





<p>Davis and about 20 other scientists conducted this research at Thwaites Glacier, a massive conveyor belt of ice about 120 kilometers wide, which flows off the coastline of West Antarctica. Satellite measurements show that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Thwaites is losing ice more quickly</a> than at any time in the last few thousand years (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). It <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/5187/2021/tc-15-5187-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has accelerated its flow into the ocean by at least 30 percent</a> since 2000, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL082182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemorrhaging over 1,000 cubic kilometers of ice</a> — accounting for roughly half of the ice lost from all of Antarctica.</p>



<p>Much of the current ice loss is driven by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">warm, salty ocean currents</a> that are destabilizing the glacier at its grounding zone — the crucial foothold, about 500 meters below sea level at the drilling location, where the ice lifts off its bed and floats (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, this first-ever look at the glacier’s underbelly near the grounding zone shows that the ocean is attacking it in previously unknown and troubling ways.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A glacier’s underbelly</h3>



<p>Thwaites Glacier and most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sit on a gravelly bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level — making the ice vulnerable to warm, salty ocean currents that hug the seafloor. Thwaites is especially vulnerable because parts of its grounding zone (where it lifts off its bed and floats on the ocean) sit as far as 1 kilometer below sea level, exposing it to the warmest water.</p>

<p>When the researchers sent a remote-operated vehicle, or ROV, down the borehole and into the water below, they found that much of the melting is concentrated in places where the glacier is already under mechanical stress — within massive cracks called basal crevasses. These openings slice up into the underside of the ice.</p>



<p>Even a small amount of melting at these weak spots could inflict a disproportionately large amount of structural damage on the glacier, the researchers report in two papers published February 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>These results are “a bit of a surprise,” says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not part of the team. Thwaites and other glaciers are monitored mostly with satellites, which make it appear that thinning and melting happen uniformly under the ice.</p>



<p>As the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, the shrinking glacier itself has the potential to raise global sea level by 65 centimeters over a period of centuries. Its collapse would also destabilize the remainder of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, triggering an eventual three meters of global sea level rise.</p>



<p>With these new results, Scambos says, “we’re seeing in much more detail processes that will be important for modeling” how the glacier responds to future warming, and how quickly sea level will rise.</p>



<h4>A cold, thin layer shields parts of Thwaites Glacier’s underside</h4>



<p>Simply getting these observations “is kind of like a moon shot, or even a Mars shot,” Scambos says. Thwaites, like most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on a bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level. The floating front of the glacier, called an ice shelf, extends 15 kilometers out onto the ocean, creating a roof of ice that makes this spot almost entirely inaccessible to humans. “This might represent the pinnacle of exploration” in Antarctica, he says.</p>



<p>These new results stem from a $50 million effort — the <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration</a> — conducted by the United States’ National Science Foundation and United Kingdom’s Natural Environment Research Council. The research team, one of eight funded by that collaboration, landed on the snowy, flat expanse of Thwaites in the final days of 2019.</p>



<p>The researchers used a hot water drill to melt a narrow hole, not much wider than a basketball, through more than 500 meters of ice. Below the ice sat a water column that was only 54 meters thick.</p>



<p>When Davis and his colleagues measured the temperature and salinity of that water, they found that most of it was about 2 degrees Celsius above freezing — potentially warm enough to melt 20 to 40 meters of ice per year. But the underside of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05586-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ice seems to be melting at a rate of only 5 meters per year</a>, researchers report in one of the <em>Nature</em> papers. The team calculated the melt rate based on the water’s salinity, which reveals the ratio of seawater, which is salty, to glacial meltwater, which is fresh.</p>



<p>The reason for that slow melt quickly emerged: Just beneath the ice sat a layer of cold, buoyant water, only 2 meters thick, derived from melted ice. “There is pooling of much fresher water at the ice base,” says Davis, and this cold layer shields the ice from warmer water below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those measurements provided a snapshot right at the borehole. Several days after the hole was opened, the researchers began a broader exploration of the unmapped ocean cavity under the ice.</p>



<p>Workers winched a skinny, yellow and black cylinder down the borehole. This ROV, called Icefin, was developed over the last seven years by a team of engineers led by Britney Schmidt, a glaciologist at Cornell University.</p>

<p>Schmidt and her team piloted the craft from a nearby tent, monitoring instruments while she steered the craft with gentle nudges to the buttons of a PlayStation 4 controller. The smooth, mirrorlike ceiling of ice scrolled silently past on a computer monitor — the live video feed piped up through 3½ kilometers of fiber-optic cable.</p>



<p>As Schmidt guided Icefin about 1.6 kilometers upstream from the borehole, the water column gradually tapered, until less than a meter of water separated the ice from the seafloor below. A few fish and shrimplike crustaceans called amphipods flitted among otherwise barren piles of gravel.</p>



<p>This new section of seafloor — revealed as the ice thins, lifts and floats progressively farther inland — had been exposed “for less than a year,” Schmidt says.</p>



<p>Now and then, Icefin skimmed past a dark, gaping cleft in the icy ceiling, a basal crevasse. Schmidt steered the craft into several of these gaps — often over 100 meters wide — and there, she saw something striking.</p>



<h4>Melting of Thwaites&#8217; underbelly is concentrated in deep crevasses</h4>



<p>The vertical walls of the crevasses were scalloped rather than smooth, suggesting a higher rate of melting than that of the flat icy ceiling. And in these places, the video became blurry as the light refracted through vigorously swirling eddies of salty water and freshwater. That turbulent swirling of warm ocean water and cold meltwater is breaking up the cold layer that insulates the ice, pulling warm, salty water into contact with it, the scientists think. <strong></strong></p>



<p>Schmidt’s team calculated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the walls of the crevasses are melting at rates of up to 43 meters per year</a>, the researchers report in the second <em>Nature</em> paper. The researchers also found rapid melt in other places where the level ceiling of ice is punctuated by short, steep sections.</p>



<p>The greater turbulence and higher melt also appear driven by ocean currents within the crevasses. Each time Schmidt steered Icefin up into a crevasse, the ROV detected streams of water flowing through it, as though the crevasse were an upside-down ditch. These currents moved up to twice as fast as the currents outside of crevasses.</p>



<p>The fact that melting is concentrated in crevasses has huge implications, says Peter Washam, an oceanographer on Schmidt’s team at Cornell: “The ocean is widening these features by melting them faster.”</p>



<p>This could greatly accelerate the years-long process by which some of these cracks propagate hundreds of meters up through the ice until they break through at the top — calving off an iceberg that drifts away. It could cause the floating ice shelf, which presses against an undersea mountain and buttresses the ice behind it, to break apart more quickly than predicted. This, in turn, could cause the glacier to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">spill ice into the ocean more quickly</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). “It’s going to have an impact on the stability of the ice,” Washam says.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video, captured by a remote-operated vehicle called Icefin, shows the underside of Thwaites Glacier where it flows off the coastline of West Antarctica. Horizontal sections of the ice are smooth, indicating slow melting. But on steep ice surfaces — especially along the walls of deep cracks in the ice — the surfaces are scalloped, suggesting a much higher rate of melt, driven by turbulent swirling of warm, salty ocean water and cold, fresh meltwater. An example of the difference between those two surfaces is clearly visible from 0:11 to 0:13 in the video, when Icefin captures a scalloped vertical surface intersecting with a smooth horizontal one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These new data will improve scientists’ ability to predict the future retreat of Thwaites and other Antarctic glaciers, says Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who assisted the team by providing satellite measurements of changes in the glacier. “You just cannot guess what the water structure might look like in these zones until you observe it,” he says.</p>



<p>But more work is needed to fully understand Thwaites and how it will further change as the world continues to warm. The glacier consists of two side-by-side fast-moving lanes of ice — one moving 3 kilometers per year, the other about 1 kilometer per year. Due to safety concerns, the team visited the slower lane — which still proved extremely challenging. Rignot says that scientists must eventually visit the fast lane, whose upper surface is more cracked up with crevasses — making it even harder to land aircraft and operate field camps.</p>



<p>The research reported today “is a very important step, but it needs to be followed by a second step,” the investigation of the glacier’s fast lane, he says. “It doesn’t matter how hard it is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/new-policies-address-paper-mills-and-unprofessional-conduct/">New policies address paper mills and unprofessional conduct</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>On February 1, 2023, PLOS introduced two new policies: one addressing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">manipulation of the publication process </a>and the other outlining <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-standards-for-professional-conduct">standards for professional conduct</a>. Here, we provide brief excerpts and information about the policies for which the full text is on our journals&rsquo; Ethical Publishing Practice pages.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Manipulation of the Publication Process</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>&ldquo;PLOS will reject or retract articles suspected of any manipulation of the publication process.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p>Manipulation of the publication process encapsulates a variety of issues currently vexing the publishing industry, such as fabrication and/or sale of content, peer review, or authorship (e.g. via &ldquo;paper mills&rdquo;) and peer review manipulation. Each of these cases can involve 100s of submissions/articles across publishers, posing a large-scale threat to the integrity and reliability of the published record and demanding extensive editorial resources to address. If the problematic content is published, it can have deleterious effects on active research and those affected by applied research, and can also harm public trust in science.</p>



<p>PLOS is taking multiple approaches to strengthen our internal processes so as to better prevent, identify and address these cases. Our new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">Manipulation of the Publication Process policy</a> represents one aspect of this work. It provides authors information about practices and services that should be avoided, states that PLOS will reject or retract articles suspected of any manipulation of the publication process, and explains that we may not disclose details about specific concerns in these cases. These measures are needed to safeguard the integrity of our publications, maintain confidentiality required in multi-manuscript cases, and ensure that bad actors do not obtain information that could be used to evade our checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, this policy supports our teams in taking a hard line in cases where we suspect manipulation of publication cases, even if we do not have concrete, indisputable evidence in hand. We apply editorial judgment in determining whether the cumulative evidence, including circumstantial, supports concerns to a degree that per our internal standards warrants editorial action. We are aware of the serious implications that retractions can have for researchers&rsquo; careers, and we do not take these decisions lightly. While notices we issue in these cases may be brief, they represent extensive bodies of investigative work and careful consideration by our Publication Ethics and journal teams.</p>



<p><strong><em>Standards for Professional Conduct</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&ldquo;<em>PLOS is committed to open scientific communications and professional conduct. We expect that all interactions with PLOS through any medium of communication &hellip; will be courteous, respectful, and adherent to high standards of professionalism</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS works with an expansive network of contributors around the globe, including our internal and external staff, authors, and volunteer editors and reviewers who support peer review. In our publishing activities, we do not always deliver positive news. At times, authors, readers, and other stakeholders may be disappointed by a decision or frustrated by aspects of our processes.</p>



<p>We welcome feedback and questions, and our journals have dedicated appeal processes by which decisions can be challenged. However, we expect all communications to adhere to high standards of professionalism regardless of the circumstances. Unfortunately, this expectation is not always met. In a minority of cases, our teams receive communications that go beyond what can be considered acceptable, for example including personal threats or abusive messages. We have also encountered situations wherein excessively repeated inquiries or resubmissions detract resources from our core publishing functions.</p>



<p>Our new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-standards-for-professional-conduct">Standards for Professional Conduct policy</a> underscores that such behaviors will not be tolerated, and that PLOS will take steps as needed to support our contributors and resolve these situations. It provides transparency as to PLOS&rsquo; standards for interactions with our teams in the context of their work for PLOS, provides examples of behaviors that we consider unacceptable, and outlines actions we may take in response. While communication and language norms vary around the globe, we consider the expectations of respect and professionalism set in this policy to be universal.</p>



<p><strong><em>Closing remarks</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>As a publisher, we have a duty to ensure the papers we publish are scientifically valid and adhere to the highest standards of research and publication ethics. We take this responsibility very seriously. PLOS has had a specialized publication ethics team since early 2018, and over the past five years we have resolved &gt;1500 cases, publishing ~900 notices to address integrity issues. Policies such as those outlined above are integral to supporting this work, and in line with PLOS&rsquo; commitment to openness the policies also provide transparency as to our standards and the approaches we take to address concerns.</p>



<p><em>If you have concerns about non-compliance with these policies, please contact the relevant journal office for Standards for Professional Conduct issues, or the </em><a href="mailto:pub-ethics@plos.org"><em>PLOS Publication Ethics team</em></a><em> for Manipulation of the Publication Process issues.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicles-pure-water-salt-ripples">Here’s why icicles made from pure water don’t form ripples</a></h4>

              
                <p>Icicles made from pure water give scientists brain freeze.</p>



<p>In nature, most icicles are made from water with a hint of salt. But lab-made icicles free from salt disobey a prominent theory of how icicles form, and it wasn’t clear why. Now, a study is helping to melt away the confusion.</p>



<p>Natural icicles tend to look like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ripple-effect">skinny cones with rippled surfaces</a> — the result of a thin film of water that coats the ice, researchers think (<em>SN: 11/24/13</em>). As icicles grow, the film freezes. Any preexisting small bumps in the icicle get magnified into large ripples because the water layer is thinner above the bumps and can freeze more readily. But this theory fails to explain the salt-free variety, which have more irregular shapes reminiscent of drippy candles, says physicist Menno Demmenie of the University of Amsterdam.</p>





<p>So Demmenie and colleagues grew icicles in the lab, adding a blue dye that was visible only when the water was liquid. Salted icicles not only had ripples, but they also were covered in a thin, blue film. Icicles made from pure water had no such film. Only small <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.024005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">droplets of blue appeared on those icicles</a>, the team reports in the February <em>Physical Review Applied</em>.</p>



<p>In icicles with salt, the temperature at which the water on the surface freezes is lowered, allowing a liquid layer to coat the entire icicle. Without the salt, icicles must build up drop by drop.</p>

<p>Citing an investigation by Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, two journals last week retracted five articles by <a href="https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/edward-e-whang-md/">Edward Whang</a>, an associate professor of surgery at the school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journals, <em>Oncogene</em> and <em>Surgery</em>, <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(23)00008-9/fulltext">both</a> <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(23)00009-0/fulltext">refer</a> to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02626-5">problems</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02625-6">with</a> images of Western blots that could not be resolved because &#8220;no underlying research data&#8221; were available, according to the investigation.</p>



<p>Questions have loomed over Whang&#8217;s research <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/04/pubpeer-selections-questions-stem-cells-price-shopping-access-charges/">for a decade</a>, and more than 20 of his studies <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=+Edward+Whang">have been flagged</a> on PubPeer for possible image problems. As one commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/28F5B2E923CD97D6F1D58B78A20FE7#1">wrote</a> in 2014 about one of the now-retracted papers, &#8220;It is perhaps fortunate that figure assembly and liver surgery require such unrelated skill sets.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not clear how many of Whang’s papers were affected by the investigation. We reached out to Harvard Medical School for more details, but it declined to share information about the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126555"></span>



<p>In 2013, the German magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em> quoted a professor at a university there as saying that figures from two separate papers by Whang and his colleagues were sufficiently similar as to justify &#8220;<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/zu-gleich-a-fa24644d-0002-0001-0000-000118184432?context=issue">the suspicion of manipulation</a>.&#8221; Whang conceded the likeness, but said he could &#8220;vouch for the accuracy of the data.&#8221;</p>



<p>That same year, the well-known anonymous tipster writing under the pseudonym <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=clare+francis">Clare Francis</a> alerted Michael Sarr, then an editor of <em>Surgery</em>, to the same problem. After reviewing the papers and concluding that they described &#8220;totally different experiments,&#8221; Sarr <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/what-to-do-about-clare-francis-38704">reportedly replied</a> to the tipster in an email: &#8220;Quite frankly, in the future, unless you wish to point out how these articles are exactly the same and unless you do your research, we (at Surgery) are going to ignore any further claims that you send us.”</p>



<p>A PubPeer commenter later <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67F00A871ABAE836F7B471C13203F9#5">pointed out</a> that Sarr, an emeritus professor of surgery at Mayo Clinic, had once <a href="https://jamesivassociationsurgeons.com/report_edward_whang_md.php">seconded Whang&#8217;s nomination</a> for a surgical traveling fellowship. Sarr is no longer at <em>Surgery</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of the retracted papers, which were published in 2004 and dealt with potential new cancer treatments:</p>

</ul>



<p>(As of this writing, a retraction notice for the last paper has not yet been published &#8220;due to a technical issue,&#8221; according to Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Oncogene</em>.)</p>



<p>The retraction notices issued by <em>Oncogene</em> on February 9 and 10 state that Whang and one of his coauthors, U.K. surgeon <a href="https://www.markduxbury.info/">Mark Duxbury</a>, did not agree to the retractions. Neither researcher responded to requests for comments from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Springer Nature told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We became aware of issues with these papers when Harvard contacted us detailing the outcome of their institutional investigation and requesting the papers be retracted. Following this, the journal Editors and Springer Nature Research Integrity Group investigated and agreed that the papers should be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Springer Nature is not aware of other papers published in its journals that are implicated in the Harvard investigation, the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Elsevier, which publishes <em>Surgery</em>, said Harvard contacted them last year following the investigation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After reviewing the materials, the Journal of Surgery [sic] Editors reached out to the corresponding authors and asked for a response. The Editors were not satisfied by the explanation and the papers were retracted at the end of last year. [Editor’s note: The notices are dated Feb. 10 and 11, 2023.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Harvard Medical School&#8217;s media relations team declined to share the investigation report, but said in an emailed statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-male-giraffes-drink-female-mate-pee">Why male giraffes drink potential mates’ pee</a></h4>

              
                <p>A female giraffe has a great Valentine’s Day gift for potential mates: urine.</p>



<p>Distinctive anatomy helps male giraffes <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/3/354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a taste for whether a female is ready to mate</a>, animal behaviorists Lynette and Benjamin Hart report January 19 in <em>Animals</em>. A pheromone-detecting organ in giraffes has a stronger connection to the mouth than the nose, the researchers found. That’s why males scope out which females to mate with by sticking their tongues in a urine stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Animals such as male gazelles will lick fresh urine on the ground to track if females are ready to mate. But giraffes’ long necks and heavy heads make bending over to investigate urine on the ground an unstable and vulnerable position, says Lynette Hart, of the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>The researchers observed giraffes (<em>Giraffa giraffa angolensis</em>) in Etosha National Park in Namibia in 1994, 2002 and 2004. Bull giraffes nudged or kicked the female to ask her to pee. If she was a willing participant, she urinated for a few seconds, while the male took a sip. Then the male curled his lip and inhaled with his mouth, a behavior called a flehmen response, to pull the female’s scent into two openings on the roof of the mouth. From the mouth, the scent travels to the vomeronasal organ, or VNO, which detects pheromones.</p>



<p>The Harts say they never saw a giraffe investigate urine on the ground.</p>



<p>Unlike many other mammals, giraffes have a stronger oral connection — via a duct — to the VNO, than a nasal one, examinations of preserved giraffe specimens showed. One possible explanation for the difference could be that a VNO-nose link helps animals that breed at specific times of the year detect seasonal plants, says Benjamin Hart, a veterinarian also at the University of California, Davis. But giraffes can mate any time of year, so the nasal connection may not matter as much.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-quenched-galaxy">The James Webb telescope spotted the earliest known ‘quenched’ galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has spotted the earliest known galaxy to abruptly stop forming stars.</p>



<p>The galaxy, called GS-9209, <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2301.11413v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quenched its star formation</a> more than 12.5 billion years ago, researchers report January 26 at arXiv.org. That’s only a little more than a billion years after the Big Bang. Its existence reveals new details about how galaxies live and die across cosmic time.</p>



<p>“It’s a remarkable discovery,” says astronomer Mauro Giavalisco of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the new study. “We really want to know when the conditions are ripe to make quenching a widespread phenomenon in the universe.” This study shows that at least some galaxies quenched when the universe was young.</p>





<p>GS-9209 was first noticed in the early 2000s. In the last few years, observations with ground-based telescopes identified it as a possible quenched galaxy, based on the wavelengths of light it emits. But Earth’s atmosphere absorbs the infrared wavelengths that could confirm the galaxy’s distance and that its star-forming days were behind it, so it was impossible to know for sure.</p>



<p>So astrophysicist Adam Carnall and colleagues turned to the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. The observatory is very sensitive to infrared light, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">it’s above the blockade of Earth’s atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). “This is why JWST exists,” says Carnall, of the University of Edinburgh. JWST also has much greater sensitivity than earlier telescopes, letting it see fainter, more distant galaxies. While the largest telescopes on the ground could maybe see GS-9209 in detail after a month of observing, “JWST can pick this stuff up in a few hours.”</p>



<p>Using JWST observations, Carnall and colleagues found that GS-9209 formed most of its stars during a 200-million-year period, starting about 600 million years after the Big Bang. In that cosmically brief moment, it built about 40 billion solar masses’ worth of stars, about the same as the Milky Way has.</p>



<p>That quick construction suggests that GS-9209 formed from a massive cloud of gas and dust collapsing and igniting stars all at once, Carnall says. “It’s pretty clear that the vast majority of the stars that are currently there formed in this big burst.”</p>



<p>Astronomers used to think this mode of galaxy formation, called monolithic collapse, was the way that most galaxies formed. But the idea has fallen out of favor, replaced by the notion that large galaxies form from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">slow merging of many smaller ones</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Now it looks like, at least for this object, monolithic collapse is what happened,” Carnall says. “This is probably the clearest proof yet that that kind of galaxy evolution happens.”</p>





<p>As to what caused the galaxy’s star-forming frenzy to suddenly stop, the culprit appears to be an actively feeding black hole. The JWST observations detected extra emission of infrared light associated with a rapidly swirling mass of energized hydrogen, which is a sign of an accreting black hole. The black hole appears to be up to a billion times the mass of the sun.</p>



<p>To reach that mass in less than a billion years after the birth of the universe, the black hole must have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">feeding even faster</a> earlier on in its life, Carnall says (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). As it gorged, it would have collected a glowing disk of white-hot gas and dust around it.</p>



<p>“If you have all that radiation spewing out of the black hole, any gas that’s nearby is going to be heated up to an incredible extent, which stops it from falling into stars,” Carnall says.</p>



<p>More observations with future telescopes, like the planned <a href="https://elt.eso.org/instrument/HARMONI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extremely Large Telescope</a> in Chile, could help figure out more details about how the galaxy was snuffed out.</p>

<p>In 2018, when <em>The Lancet</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/06/the-final-verdict-lancet-retracts-two-papers-by-macchiarini/">pulled two</a> studies by <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam">once-celebrated</a> transplant surgeon Paolo Macchiarini after he was found <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/25/karolinska-finds-macchiarini-six-other-researchers-guilty-of-misconduct/">guilty of misconduct</a>, we suggested in a post that the journal&#8217;s chapter of the long-running Macchiarini saga was finally over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were wrong.</p>



<p>Last week, the journal<em> </em><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00293-3/fulltext">issued</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00292-1/fulltext#bib1">expressions</a> of concern about a pair of papers by the Italian doctor, who is currently on probation after a court in Sweden  <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">convicted</a> him of causing bodily harm to a patient.</p>



<span id="more-126548"></span>



<p>In the first paper, published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61598-6/fulltext">2008</a>, Macchiarini and his colleagues reported how they implanted a cadaveric windpipe seeded with stem cells into a 30-year-old woman; in the second, from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext#section-7c530872-6235-4433-899c-b3f276970189">2013</a>, they described how the patient fared over the next five years. Despite needing repeated bronchoscopic interventions, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext">the authors wrote</a>, she “had a normal social and working life.&#8221;</p>



<p>The research made headlines across the globe. But it did not live up to its promise: Of eight patients who had an artificial windpipe implanted by Macchiarini between 2011 and 2014, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">seven died following complications</a> from the procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, the woman described in the 2008 report suffered multiple complications, including respiratory failure, and had to have surgery to remove her left lung, according to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30485-4/fulltext">a 2019 <em>Lancet</em> report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Macchiarini – who has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMacchiarini%252c%2bPaolo">eight papers retracted</a> – first came to our attention <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/11/26/misconduct-leads-to-retraction-from-italian-super-surgeon-under-house-arrest/">more than a decade ago</a>, when he had a paper retracted in November 2012 “for scientific misconduct for reproducing a table but failing to acknowledge and cite the previous, original work from which it was taken.” At the time, he was reportedly under house arrest for fraud and attempted extortion charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years later, <em>The New York Times</em> revealed that Macchiarini, then at the Karolinska Institutet, was facing <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/12/revealed-complaint-lodged-macchiarini-super-surgeon-investigation/">misconduct allegations</a>. The story took numerous twists and turns, particularly in 2016, when filmmakers released a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/12/meet-the-filmmakers-who-cracked-open-the-case-against-star-surgeon-macchiarini/">documentary about the allegations</a> and <em>Vanity Fair</em> published a piece on how the surgeon scammed – in the romantic way – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam">an NBC News producer</a>.</p>



<p>For years, critics continued to press for investigations, sanctions, and retractions. Last year, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o498">letter to the editor in <em>The BMJ</em></a> called for the retraction of the case report in <em>The Lancet</em>, noting the journal:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>was informed in May 2018 that the key findings of the article were false. Despite this, and subsequent demands for retraction of the paper by us and others, the Lancet has refused to retract, without providing any explanation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The case report has been cited more than 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and the follow-up has garnered 196 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In its expression of concern from February 8, the journal noted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Lancet has received continuing questions over the reliability of the findings and conduct of this reported case, since Paolo Macchiarini was found guilty of scientific misconduct in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) has discussed these concerns at length again and their view, as an expert body in publication ethics, is that these two unretracted articles should, at a minimum, have received an Expression of Concern given the severity of the concerns raised and the length of time during which the concerns have persisted. As members of COPE, we are now following this advice and are issuing an Expression of Concern for these two Articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reached for comment in Spain, Macchiarini said he was not aware of the new expressions of concern and did not have time to look at them. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing surgery, so… busy,&#8221; he told Retraction Watch, adding &#8220;I don&#8217;t give interviews.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">Climate ‘teleconnections’ may link droughts and fires across continents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large-scale climate patterns that can impact weather across thousands of kilometers may have a hand in synchronizing multicontinental droughts and stoking wildfires around the world, two new studies find.</p>



<p>These profound patterns, known as climate teleconnections, typically occur as recurring phases that can last from weeks to years. “They are a kind of complex butterfly effect, in that things that are occurring in one place have many derivatives very far away,” says Sergio de Miguel, an ecosystem scientist at Spain’s University of Lleida and the Joint Research Unit CTFC-Agrotecnio in Solsona, Spain.</p>





<p>Major droughts arise around the same time at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35531-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drought hot spots</a> around the world, and the world’s major climate teleconnections may be behind the synchronization, researchers report in one study. What’s more, these profound patterns may also regulate the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36052-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scorching of more than half of the area</a> burned on Earth each year, de Miguel and colleagues report in the other study.</p>



<p>The research could help countries around the world forecast and collaborate to deal with widespread drought and fires, researchers say.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable">El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a>, or ENSO, is perhaps the most well-known climate teleconnection (<em>SN: 8/21/19</em>). ENSO entails phases during which weakened trade winds cause warm surface waters to amass in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, known as El Niño, and opposite phases of cooler tropical waters called La Niña.</p>



<p>These phases influence wind, temperature and precipitation patterns around the world, says climate scientist Samantha Stevenson of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in either study. “If you change the temperature of the ocean in the tropical Pacific or the Atlantic … that energy has to go someplace,” she explains. For instance, a 1982 El Niño caused severe droughts in Indonesia and Australia and deluges and floods in parts of the United States.</p>



<p>Past research has predicted that human-caused climate change will provoke <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40641-018-0093-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more intense droughts</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">worsen wildfire seasons</a> in many regions (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>). But few studies have investigated how shorter-lived climate variations — teleconnections — influence these events on a global scale. Such work could help countries improve forecasting efforts and share resources, says climate scientist Ashok Mishra of Clemson University in South Carolina.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, Mishra and his colleagues tapped data on drought conditions from 1901 to 2018. They used a computer to simulate the world’s drought history as a network of drought events, drawing connections between events that occurred within three months of each other.</p>



<p>The researchers identified major drought hot spots across the globe — places in which droughts tended to appear simultaneously or within just a few months. These hot spots included the western and midwestern United States, the Amazon, the eastern slope of the Andes, South Africa, the Arabian deserts, southern Europe and Scandinavia.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“When you get a drought in one, you get a drought in others,” says climate scientist Ben Kravitz of Indiana University Bloomington, who was not involved in the study. “If that&#8217;s happening all at once, it can affect things like global trade, [distribution of humanitarian] aid, pollution and numerous other factors.”</p>



<p>A subsequent analysis of sea surface temperatures and precipitation patterns suggested that major climate teleconnections were behind the synchronization of droughts on separate continents, the researchers report January 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. El Niño appeared to be the main driver of simultaneous droughts spanning parts of South America, Africa and Australia. ENSO is known to exert a widespread <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">influence on precipitation patterns</a> (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). So that finding is “a good validation of the method,” Kravitz says. “We would expect that to appear.”</p>

<p>In the second study, published January 27 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, de Miguel and his colleagues investigated how climate teleconnections influence the amount of land burned around the world. Researchers knew that the climate patterns can influence the frequency and intensity of wildfires. In the new study, the researchers compared satellite data on <a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global burned area</a> from 1982 to 2018 with data on the strength and phase of the globe’s major climate teleconnections.</p>



<p>Variations in the yearly pattern of burned area strongly aligned with the phases and range of climate teleconnections. In all, these climate patterns regulate about 53 percent of the land burned worldwide each year, the team found. According to de Miguel, teleconnections directly influence the growth of vegetation and other conditions such as aridity, soil moisture and temperature that prime landscapes for fires.</p>



<p>The Tropical North Atlantic teleconnection, a pattern of shifting sea surface temperatures just north of the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, was associated with about one-quarter of the global burned area — making it the most powerful driver of global burning, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>These researchers are showing that wildfire scars around the world are connected to these climate teleconnections, and that’s very useful, Stevenson says. “Studies like this can help us prepare how we might go about constructing larger scale international plans to deal with events that affect multiple places at once.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-3d-maps-toxic-substances-organs">3-D maps of a protein show how it helps organs filter out toxic substances</a></h4>

              
                <p>A close look at one protein shows how it moves molecular passengers into cells in the kidneys, brain and elsewhere.</p>



<p>The protein LRP2 is part of a delivery service, catching certain molecules outside a cell and ferrying them in. Now, 3-D maps of LRP2 <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00046-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423000466%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal the protein’s structure</a> and how it captures and releases molecules, researchers report February 6 in <em>Cell</em>. The protein adopts a more open shape, like a net, at the near-neutral pH outside cells. But in the acidic environment inside cells, the protein crumples to drop off any passengers.</p>





<p>The shape of LRP2’s structure — and how it enables so many functions — has stumped scientists for decades. The protein helps the kidneys and brain filter out toxic substances, and it operates in other places too, like the lungs and inner ears. When the protein doesn’t function properly, a host of health conditions can occur, including chronic kidney disease and Donnai-Barrow syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and brain.</p>



<p>The various conditions associated with LRP2 dysfunction come from the protein’s numerous responsibilities — it binds to more than 75 different molecules. That’s a huge amount for one protein, earning it the nickname “molecular flypaper,” says nephrologist Jonathan Barasch of Columbia University.</p>



<p>Typically, LRP2 sits at a cell membrane’s surface, waiting to snag a molecule passing by. After the protein binds to a molecule, the cell engulfs the part of its surface containing the protein, forming an internal bubble called an endosome. LRP2 then releases the molecule inside the cell, and the endosome carries the protein back to the surface.</p>



<p>To understand this shuttle system, Barasch and colleagues collected LRP2 from 500 mouse kidneys. The researchers put some of the protein in a solution at the extracellular pH of 7.5, and some in an endosome-mimicking solution at pH 5.2. Using a cryo-electron microscope, they captured images of the proteins and then stitched the images together in a computer, rendering 3-D maps of the protein at both open and closed formations.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This 3-D model of the protein LRP2 shows how it transforms from a more open structure at near-neutral pH outside of a cell to a crumpled-up shape at the acidic pH inside a cell.

<p>The researchers suggest that charged calcium atoms hold the protein open at extracellular pH. But as pH drops due to hydrogen ions flowing into the endosome, the hydrogen ions displace the calcium ions, causing the protein to contract.</p>

<p>More than a year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">we reported on two websites</a> advertising authorships of scientific papers for sale, one of the posted articles has been retracted, while publishers say they are still investigating others.</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-020-01246-x">Dynamic simulation of moderately thick annular system coupled with shape memory alloy and multi-phase nanocomposite face sheets</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, a Springer Nature title, in January 2021. The article has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Although the retraction notice doesn’t say as much, the journal’s publisher told us that it removed the article in part due its having been advertised for sale.</p>



<p>After our September 2021 article on the websites selling authorships, the anonymous whistleblower “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/15/a-researcher-with-30-retractions-and-counting-the-whistleblower-speaks/">Artemisia Stricta</a>” identified several papers from a cached version of one of the websites, Teziran.org, and notified the editors and publishers of the journals about the finding.</p>



<span id="more-126540"></span>



<p>In an email to Jessica Zhang, editor-in-chief of <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, and Allison Keene, who was an associate editor at Springer Nature at the time, Artemisia identified the article from the journal that had been posted for sale, and linked to our post. Artemisia wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I am sure you will agree, the listing of authorship for sale is a major red flag, and, in many cases, is accompanied by outright falsification of the article for scalability of authorship sales.</p>



<p>Are you able to review the point during the review process when the authors were added? If any were added after initial submission, this would be a strong indication of authorship manipulation, which may constitute grounds for retraction.Of course, it is also possible that authorship was sold prior to submission. In any case, I hope that you will investigate this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article’s first two authors, Haiquan Wang and Hongyan Zhang, are affiliated with Weifang University in China, while the second two, Ramin Dousti and Hamed Safarpour, are affiliated with Isfahan University of Technology and Imam Khomeini International University, respectively, both in Iran. Wang, the paper’s corresponding author, did not respond to Retraction Watch’s request for comment.</p>



<p>In November of last year, the paper was retracted. The retraction notice states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor in Chief has retracted this article because of significant overlap with a previously-published article by different authors [1] and an article by different authors that was simultaneously under consideration in a different journal [2].</p>



<p>Hamed Safarpour has not explicitly stated whether they agree to this retraction notice. Haiquan Wang, Hongyan Zhang, and Ramin Dousti have not responded to any correspondence from the publisher about this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice’s references point to two articles: “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-020-01200-x">Frequency simulation of viscoelastic multi-phase reinforced fully symmetric systems</a>,” published in 2020 in the same journal, and “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263822320330762">On the vibrations of the imperfect sandwich higher-order disk with a lactic core using generalize differential quadrature method</a>,” published in the journal <em>Composite Structures</em> in 2021.</p>



<p>Both papers list as the first author M.S.H. Al-Furjan, who is affiliated with Zhejiang University in China, in addition to several other common co-authors. Many are&nbsp; also listed on three other papers posted on Teziran, two in <em>Composite Structures</em> and another in <em>Engineering with Computers</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to an email inquiry from Retraction Watch, Tim Kersjes, head of Research Integrity, Resolutions at Springer Nature, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We can confirm that this retraction relates to the fact that this article had been listed for sale on Teziran.org and had significant overlap with two other papers.</p>



<p>For paper [sic] that we identify as associated with Teziran.org, we will take editorial action once these investigations are complete and all parties have had a chance to respond.</p>



<p>We continue to actively monitor for articles where their authorship may have been offered for sale and have a zero-tolerance policy regarding these activities. When we identify papers that may have violated our editorial policies, we take all necessary steps to investigate and correct the scientific record, in compliance with COPE guidelines.</p>



<p>We are working with colleagues to develop guidelines and best practice for counteracting cases of authorship sale, which undermine the integrity of and public trust in the scientific record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">None of the other articles Artemisia flagged from our post has been retracted.&nbsp;According to other emails we have seen between Artemisia and editors and publishers of papers that had been posted on Teziran, multiple publishers confirmed they were investigating the matter. The articles have not been marked with expressions of concern or other editorial notes indicating that they are under investigation and may not be reliable. These articles are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wu et al. 2020, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15397734.2020.1858870">On the dynamics of an ultra-fast-rotating-induced piezoelectric cantilevered nanodisk surrounded by viscoelastic foundation</a>” in <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines </em>(cited five times)</li>

</ul>



<p>Taylor and Francis, the publisher of one of the journals, initially responded to our inquiry that they would get back to us, but have not yet provided any other comment.</p>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of three of the Teziran articles Artemisia raised concerns about, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The integrity of research is of paramount importance to Elsevier. We have been investigating this matter and will provide an update once our investigations have concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an August 2022 response to Artemisia’s inquiry about the Al-Furjan article published in <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, an employee at Springer Nature cited a backlog of cases and lack of author response as reasons the investigation was delayed, writing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thanks for reaching out, and apologies for my lack of response regarding this concern. Regrettably I have no updates to provide on this investigation at this time. Progress has been delayed by lack of author responses and a large backlog of cases on the part of the SN Research Integrity Group. Please know that the SNRIG and I are looking into this issue, and that I will update you as soon as I’m able.</p>
