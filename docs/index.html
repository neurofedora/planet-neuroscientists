<p class="has-drop-cap">This year marks the 20th<sup> </sup>anniversary of the publication of “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200406019">What’s in a picture?&nbsp; The temptation of image manipulation</a>,” in which I described the problem of image manipulation in biomedical research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two decades later, much has changed.&nbsp; I am reassured by the heightened awareness of this issue and the numerous efforts to address it by various stakeholders in the publication process, but I am disappointed that image manipulation remains such an extensive problem in the biomedical literature. (Note: I use the term “image manipulation” throughout this piece as a generic term to refer to both image manipulation (e.g., copy/paste, erasure, splicing, etc.) and image duplication.)</p>



<p>In 2002, I was the managing editor of <em>The Journal of Cell Biology </em>(JCB), and STM journals were transitioning away from paper submissions.&nbsp; We had just implemented online manuscript submission, and authors often sent figure files in the wrong file format.&nbsp; One day, I assisted an author by reformatting some figure files.&nbsp; In one of the Western blot image panels, I noticed sharp lines around some of the bands, indicating they had either been copied and pasted into the image or the intensity of those bands had been selectively altered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-129798" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-300x300.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-1022x1024.jpg 1022w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-150x150.jpg 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-768x769.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mike Rossner</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I vividly recall my reaction, which was, “Oh shit, this is going to be a problem.&nbsp; We’re going to have to do something about this.”&nbsp; With the blessing of then editor-in-chief, Ira Mellman, I immediately instituted a policy for the journal to examine all figure files of all accepted manuscripts for evidence of manipulation before they could be published.&nbsp; We began using simple techniques, which I developed along with three of my colleagues at the time, Rob O’Donnell, Erin Grady, and Laura Smith.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/how-to-guard-against-image-fraud-47775">The approach</a> involved visual inspection of each image panel using adjustments of brightness and contrast in Photoshop, to enhance visualization of background elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129796"></span>



<p>Such adjustments can reveal inconsistencies in an image (such as sharp lines in what should be a uniform background) that are clues to manipulation such as splicing, or consistencies in an image (such as a matching pattern of background spots) that are clues to duplication.&nbsp; By this point, it was clear to me that image manipulation was an issue all journals could, and thus should, address within their production workflows.&nbsp; There were personnel costs involved, but I believed the costs were worth it to protect the scientific record.</p>



<p>As far as I know, <em>JCB </em>was the first scholarly journal to implement systematic image screening.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8278802">Other</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10916744/">people</a> had <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Science-Design-Craft-Image/dp/0262062259/">raised concerns</a> about the potential problem of digital image manipulation in biomedical research before then.&nbsp; But, in 2002, no one had yet done anything to detect it systematically and prevent manipulated images from entering the published literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The start of <em>JCB</em>’s image screening process was announced in an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200209084">editorial</a> published in September 2002.&nbsp; That editorial also contained my first call for principal investigators to closely examine the image data in prepared manuscripts from their labs before submission to a journal, as another means of preventing image falsification.</p>



<p>After about six months of observing what authors were doing with their images, we came up with the first journal guidelines for handling digital images.&nbsp; These were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030801143445/http:/www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition">published in July 2003</a>.&nbsp; At a meeting of the <em>JCB </em>editors in December of that year, I discussed with Ken Yamada ― a PI at the NIH, member of the NIH ethics committee, and a <em>JCB </em>editor ― ways we could share the image screening policies and practices we had implemented at the journal.&nbsp; Joan Schwartz, then assistant director for ethics and education at the NIH, invited us to write an article for the <em>NIH Catalyst</em>, an intramural NIH publication.&nbsp; The resulting “What’s in a picture?” article was published in May 2004 and reprinted verbatim in <em>JCB </em>two months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after “What’s in a picture?” was published, I spoke at a conference sponsored by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) about research on research integrity.&nbsp; Attendees debated the prevalence of research misconduct, because no one had investigated it in a systematic way.&nbsp; Survey data and some back-of-the-napkin calculations at the time estimated between <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessing_int_research.pdf">one in 100 and one in 100,000</a> researchers had committed some form of research misconduct.&nbsp; Based on the numbers of cases resulting from the systematic image screening at <em>JCB</em>, I believed the incidence of image manipulation alone was on the order of magnitude at the high end of that range; one in 100 accepted manuscripts at the journal contained evidence of image manipulation that affected the interpretation of the data.</p>



<p>That talk led to an invitation to speak to the Division of Investigative Oversight at ORI in January 2005.&nbsp; The meeting concluded with a consensus that image manipulation was a serious problem that all biomedical research journals were eventually going to have to address to prevent fraudulent data from entering the published literature.&nbsp; It also concluded with a question from Chris Pascal, then the director of ORI, asking how we were going to get other journals to start addressing it.&nbsp; The collective answer was that it was going to take a serious case of image manipulation at a high-profile journal to get other journals to take note.&nbsp; Then the Hwang case broke.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1094515">2004</a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1112286">2005</a>, Woo Suk Hwang and his colleagues published two papers in the journal <em>Science</em> describing the production of human embryonic stem cells.&nbsp; The work came under scrutiny after a whistleblower in the lab alerted the Korean media to potential ethical violations and falsification of data, including image manipulation, in the articles.&nbsp; After an investigation by the authors’ institution, both papers were retracted in January 2006.</p>



<p>The Hwang case jolted the biomedical research and publishing communities, and led to&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/science/it-may-look-authentic-heres-how-to-tell-it-isnt.html">publicity</a> for the image screening program at <em>JCB</em>, which, I believe, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200612154">would have detected</a> at least some of the manipulation in the <em>Science</em> articles before publication.&nbsp; Over the next several years, my colleagues and I at Rockefeller University Press trained roughly 25 other publishers in our visual screening techniques, and many of them – including the publishers of <em>Science</em> – began systematic image screening before publication.</p>



<p>But other stakeholders in the publication process – researchers, funders, institutions, most publishers – remained naïve about the extent of the problem and their susceptibility to this form of misconduct.&nbsp; It seemed like they were willing to let what they thought was just a small problem continue, because no-one was calling them out publicly.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2010, journal editors began receiving emails from someone with the pseudonym “Clare Francis,” who appeared to be scouring the published literature for examples of image manipulation.&nbsp; In the early days, many of the allegations were bizarre and lacked merit (<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/22/clare-francis-scores-a-bullseye-journal-of-cell-biology-paper-retracted-for-image-manipulation/">although some did</a>), which led journal editors to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/09/why-editors-should-stop-ignoring-anonymous-whisteblowers-our-latest-labtimes-column/">disregard allegations from anonymous whistleblowers</a> in general.&nbsp; This unfortunate attitude caused a setback in the effort to get journals to address the issue of image manipulation.</p>



<p>In July 2012, Paul Brookes of the University of Rochester started a personal blog called Science-Fraud.com.&nbsp; He anonymously posted allegations of image manipulation that he and some helpers detected.&nbsp; Within six months, the site was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/03/11/so-what-happened-after-paul-brookes-was-forced-to-shut-down-science-fraud-org/">shut down</a> due to threats of litigation.</p>



<p>However, during that same six-month period, a neuroscientist named <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pubpeer-s-secret-out-founder-controversial-website-reveals-himself">Brandon Stell</a> founded the website <a href="https://pubpeer.com">PubPeer.com</a> as a public forum for post-publication peer review.&nbsp; This site was different, in that members of the public could post comments about published articles, and they could do so anonymously.&nbsp; The right of commenters to maintain that anonymity has since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/12/07/pubpeer-wins-appeal-court-ruling-unmask-commenters">upheld in court</a>.&nbsp; PubPeer has flourished in the intervening dozen years, and a substantial proportion of the comments on the site involve allegations of image manipulation in the biomedical literature.</p>



<p>One of the most prominent and prolific posters on the site is not anonymous.&nbsp; Elisabeth Bik has made allegations of image manipulation in thousands of articles in her posts on PubPeer.&nbsp; She rose to prominence in 2016 with a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00809-16">landmark paper</a> on the frequency of image duplication in published biomedical research articles, which represented a tour-de-force analysis of 20,000 articles.&nbsp; The frequency that she detected for image duplications that were unlikely to be due to clerical error (2% of articles screened) was in keeping with the rate of manipulation that affected the interpretation of the data at <em>JCB</em> (1% of articles screened).</p>



<p>Bik has inspired the establishment of a community of so-called image <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">sleuths</a> who scour the literature for examples of image manipulation in published articles.&nbsp; The sheer number of their postings has highlighted the extent of the problem.&nbsp; The fact that these postings are public means stakeholders are now more concerned about damage to their reputations, making them more likely to take action. &nbsp; How the sleuths choose which papers to scrutinize is unclear, but that mystery keeps all stakeholders on their toes about whether they will be called out next.</p>



<p>As sleuths work through older publications, they have demonstrated that manipulation of digital images was occurring years before I realized it at <em>JCB </em>in 2002.&nbsp; As an example, a misconduct investigation into Marc Tessier-Lavigne at Stanford University in 2023 led to the retraction of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/former-stanford-president-retracts-1999-cell-paper/"><em>Cell</em> paper from 1999</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">two <em>Science </em>papers from 2001</a> due to image manipulation.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As far as I am aware, the first commercially available software for detecting image manipulation was released in 2007.&nbsp; That software <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200810172">did not prove effective</a>.</p>



<p>Within the last few years, however, several other companies have released commercially available algorithms for detecting image manipulation.&nbsp; One that distinguished itself was <a href="https://imagetwin.ai">ImageTwin</a>, which was the first to develop functionality to screen for duplications against a database of millions of images from previously published articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of these software developers has provided information on how effective their algorithm is relative to visual screening by someone with a trained eye for detecting image manipulation.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/01/10/guest-post-publishers-should-be-transparent-about-the-capabilities-and-limitations-of-software-they-use-to-detect-image-manipulation-or-duplication/">written about the need for transparency</a> about the effectiveness of these algorithms, so that users are informed about their capabilities and limitations.&nbsp; Those I have tested are reasonably good at detecting duplications in micrograph images, but their effectiveness at detecting duplications in blot images is more limited.&nbsp; Their ability to detect manipulations such as copy/paste, erasure, or splicing is disappointing in their current state of development.&nbsp; Any algorithmic output must be evaluated by a trained and knowledgeable human to confirm its findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I strongly encourage the use of these algorithms to screen images at scale.&nbsp; Indeed, the screening of the images in an article against millions of previously published articles is only possible algorithmically.&nbsp; As a by-product of this functionality, collaborative efforts are <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/05/23/guest-post-the-research-integrity-hub-connecting-the-dots-in-a-dynamic-landscape/">in progress</a> to enable publishers to screen their submissions at scale against manuscripts submitted to other publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to their use for image screening at scale, algorithms are inappropriate for evaluating specific allegations of image manipulation.&nbsp; Visual inspection is the only standard that should be used (unless the allegation is that an image has been created using generative AI, see below).&nbsp; The algorithms I have tested have too many false negatives and false positives to be used in this capacity.&nbsp; Thus, a negative result from an algorithm is not proof of innocence, and a positive result is not proof of guilt.</p>



<p>In some cases that have <a href="https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/1594810586487037958">played out publicly on X</a>, authors attempted to refute allegations from Bik of image duplication using algorithmic methods, but the results produced by those methods were flat-out wrong when compared to visual inspection.&nbsp; I have experienced similar situations, and Leonid Schneider has also <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/05/10/schneider-shorts-10-05-2024-socially-unacceptable-behaviour/#mario">reported</a> on <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/05/31/schneider-shorts-31-05-2024-historic-heavy-rain-and-flooding/#shock">cases</a>&nbsp; in which publishers used an algorithm to incorrectly dismiss allegations of image manipulation.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The perception that algorithms are superior to human ability is dangerous at the current stage of algorithm development—false negatives will lead to manipulated image data remaining in the published literature, and false positives will lead to incorrect accusations of misconduct.&nbsp; Visual inspection remains the gold standard for evaluating specific allegations of image manipulation.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2015, I established a company called <a href="https://imagedataintegrity.com">Image Data Integrity</a> to consult about image manipulation in biomedical research.&nbsp; I work mostly with institutions conducting internal investigations in response to allegations made on PubPeer.&nbsp; I continue to see image manipulations in the same types of images — mostly in blots, but also in other images, such as, micrographs, photographs and scatter plots.&nbsp; I continue to see the same types of manipulations and duplications.&nbsp; I also continue to see the same types of inconsistencies between loading control and experimental blot image panels (e.g., one is spliced, and the other is not spliced), indicating that they were detected on different blots, making the loading control invalid.</p>



<p>I also continue to hear the same types of responses from authors, the most common of which is, “Oh, it’s just a loading control.”&nbsp; It is time for the biomedical research community to firmly reject this perspective.&nbsp; Without a valid loading control, a blot experiment cannot be properly interpreted &nbsp;– no valid comparison of protein levels can be made&nbsp; – and thus any conclusion the authors have drawn is unreliable.</p>



<p>The predominant change in the last 20 years has been the dramatic increase in the number of published articles <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/">questioned for image manipulation</a>. The increase, which has several drivers, has occurred despite the fact that people’s skills in Photoshop have undoubtedly improved over this timespan. </p>



<p>First, we have seen&nbsp; a dramatic increase in the number of articles published per year, especially low-quality papers.&nbsp; This surge is due in part to the advent of predatory publishers, which were an unintended, but not unforeseen, consequence of the pay-to-publish open access business model <a href="https://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17276">pioneered by BioMed Central</a> over 20 years ago.&nbsp; Predatory publishers carry out only cursory (if any) peer review to maximize the number of articles they publish and thus their profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increase in the number of articles published also reflects the emergence of China as a global player in biomedical research within the last 25 years.&nbsp; This emergence has <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/04/18/guest-post-making-sense-of-retractions-and-tackling-research-misconduct/">added hundreds of thousands of articles</a> to the published biomedical literature annually, due, in part, to <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/02/22/why-fake-research-is-rampant-in-china">problematic incentives designed to boost the country’s rankings</a></p>



<p>Anonymous public commenting has become common, which has led to increased detection because of an increase in the number of image sleuths scouring the published literature for image manipulation. The accuracy of those sleuths’ allegations has improved; they are consistently more reliable than in the early days of Clare Francis and are therefore taken more seriously. Finally, algorithms that detect image manipulation have come online, lowering the bar for entry to becoming a sleuth and to implementing systematic image screening.</p>



<p>Whether the <em>percentage</em> of published articles with problematic images has changed is unclear.&nbsp; Those numbers were remarkably consistent over the 12 years that I was involved with image screening at <em>JCB</em>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.17749">similar</a> <a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1873-3468.13201">studies</a> more recently have provided similar numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this rate is irrelevant to the important consequence resulting from the increase in the absolute number of articles questioned for image manipulation.&nbsp; The increase, along with coverage by sites like <a href="https://retractionwatch.com">Retraction Watch</a>, and more recently, by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/stanford-president-resigns-tessier-lavigne.html">national media</a>, has led to an increase in the awareness of the problem of image manipulation among all stakeholders in the publication process and even the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increased awareness has led to some reassuring actions by various stakeholders, but more is needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">No one disputes the value of the goal of preventing manipulated images from getting into the published literature, but there is <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/03/28/putting-research-integrity-checks-where-they-belong/">considerable debate</a> over who should be responsible for screening and at what stage of the research process.&nbsp; In my opinion, all stakeholders should be screening data and evaluating data anomalies─in grant applications (funders), before manuscript submission (researchers and institutions), and during manuscript review (publishers). This is like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/coronavirus-swiss-cheese-infection-mackay.html">Swiss cheese model of prevention</a> that we became familiar with during the COVID pandemic. There will be holes in the checks at every stage, but, with more stages, more holes will be filled.</p>



<p>The goal of preventing falsified image data from reaching the published literature should be an end in and of itself, but additional benefits to all stakeholders include the savings in time, reputation, and money from dealing with fewer allegations of image manipulation.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, the availability of algorithms has led many more publishers to systematically screen images before publication.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as far as I know, no-one is tracking that number.&nbsp; For those who had previously done no screening at all, this is an improvement, and, overall, this reflects a sea change toward achieving the goal of detection before publication.&nbsp; However, some publishers have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn7530">downgraded</a> from visual screening to algorithmic screening.&nbsp; Ideally, they would continue their visual screening and use the algorithm as an additional check.</p>



<p>Nearly five years ago, Alison Abbott wrote a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03529-w">feature article in <em>Nature</em></a> describing three European institutions that were using algorithms to screen all manuscripts produced by their staff for evidence of image manipulation before submission to a journal.&nbsp; I believe that the thousands of other research institutions around the world should do the same.&nbsp; If institutions are concerned about imposing screening on their staff, they could at least offer this as a service to those who want it.&nbsp; Institutions should also consider screening the publications of job candidates before hiring them.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, many institutions have established mechanisms to be notified about allegations made on PubPeer and social media (such as subscribing to the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/institutions">PubPeer “Dashboard”</a>), but this effort is reactive.&nbsp; Institutions must switch their footing from a reactive stance to a proactive stance to try to prevent image manipulation from happening in the first place, and, if it does happen, to prevent manipulated images from getting submitted to a journal.&nbsp; Again, these goals should be ends in and of themselves, but they will also help to preserve the reputation of the institution and keep the grant money flowing in.</p>



<p>We cannot overlook a root cause of the image manipulation problem: the institutionalized culture of publish or perish caused, in part, by the criteria used by institutions for hiring and promotion.&nbsp; A lot of ink has been spilled over the past dozen years or so discussing the need to change the incentive structure in biomedical research to reduce the pressure on individual researchers to publish positive results.&nbsp; I will not reiterate the arguments here, except to say that, as one of the <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/innovator/dora/">founders of the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in 2012</a>, I wholeheartedly support these efforts.&nbsp; But progress in this direction is <a href="https://undark.org/2022/06/16/why-wont-academia-let-go-of-publish-or-perish/">disappointingly slow</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers know that they can get just about anything published these days.&nbsp; Under the current pay-to-publish model, there will always be publishers that game the system and publish any submission without concern for the integrity of the data.</p>



<p>But researchers also know that they cannot get just about anything funded.&nbsp; Funders could help to dis-incentivize image manipulation if they screened the applicants’ publications that are cited in a grant application.&nbsp; I am not aware of any funder that does this, and this is truly a missed opportunity to avoid funding research based on fraudulent data and feeding a vicious cycle.</p>



<p>In a promising development, the recent funding for the NIH came with an <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/congress-pushes-nih-review-reproducibility-and-near-misses">admonishment</a> from the US Congress to “proactively look for signs of academic fraud.”&nbsp; As far as I know, the NIH has not yet responded with any indication of how they will do this, but a simple approach would be to screen the PI’s cited publications in a grant application or progress report before approving it.</p>



<p>Some institutions have <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/27/broad-boston-childrens-plagiarism-detection-tools/">offered access to algorithms to their staff</a>, relying on the PIs to use them to screen individual manuscripts before submission to a journal.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is an inappropriate work-around being offered to PIs, who should directly compare all of the data in figures prepared for a manuscript to the source data from the lab (or at least delegate this responsibility to a trusted and trained lab member or even to a core facility provided by the institution).&nbsp; This expectation needs to be codified in institutional policy.</p>



<p>Given the scale of the problem, PIs must come to terms with the possibility that image manipulation might happen in their labs.&nbsp; They also need to accept the possibility that what they’re seeing in PowerPoint presentations in lab meetings may have already been manipulated.</p>



<p>Crucial to the recommendation to compare prepared figures to source data is an understanding of what constitutes source data.&nbsp; They are not the composed, assembled display of multiple image panels in a PowerPoint file.&nbsp; They are the actual files obtained through the research process, unaltered post-acquisition.&nbsp; In the case of image data, they are the proprietary files produced by the imaging system (or the actual pieces of X-ray film, if you’re an old school autoradiography person).</p>



<p>I acknowledge that the software that drives gel documentation systems and microscopes has image-processing capabilities.&nbsp; Thus, images may have been altered before they were ever saved in the proprietary file type, and comparison to the published image would not reveal the alteration.&nbsp; But if there are any suspicions that an image in a proprietary file type has been altered post-acquisition, those changes should be present in the file metadata.</p>



<p>The only sure way to dispel an accusation of image manipulation in a published article is for the accused researcher to provide the source data for comparison.&nbsp; Too often in institutional investigations, researchers claim that they don’t have the source data because their institution did not mandate the retention of those data for more than a few years.&nbsp; That needs to change.</p>



<p>Data storage is now much cheaper than it was 20 years ago—disk storage is now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/historical-cost-of-computer-memory-and-storage">~100-fold cheaper</a> than it was then.&nbsp; Institutions should mandate that the data underlying a published article be retained in perpetuity (at least for the actual data presented in the article) and provide the data storage and structure necessary to do so.</p>



<p>I am not talking about the multiple terabytes required to store the thousands of images in an imaging screen or the hundreds of whole slide images (WSI) that were reviewed for a study.&nbsp; I’m talking about the few megabytes (or gigabytes for WSI) needed to store the few images from that screen or study that were shown in the article.</p>



<p>The only publisher that <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/image-integrity">mentions the concept</a> of retaining data in perpetuity is Springer Nature for the Nature Portfolio of journals.&nbsp; They state that “We recommend retaining unprocessed data and metadata files after publication, ideally archiving data in perpetuity.”&nbsp; This needs to be changed to a requirement by all journals, to begin to force institutions to do the right thing with the data underlying a publication and retain it in perpetuity.</p>



<p>There are numerous precedents (many of them <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/25/jama-journal-retracts-paper-when-author-cant-produce-original-data/">cited on Retraction Watch</a>) for retractions predicated on the inability of authors to provide source data.&nbsp; Institutions will be protecting their PIs from this eventuality by requiring them to retain these data in perpetuity.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Considerable progress has been made in addressing the issue of image manipulation over the past 20 years, but challenges remain.<strong> </strong>Paper mills are a growing and dire problem for publishers and the integrity of the published literature.&nbsp; These are companies that produce wholly fabricated research papers (often duplicating images from previously published papers or fabricating them using generative AI, as discussed below).&nbsp; The companies get the papers accepted for publication in a journal and then sell authorships on those papers.&nbsp; The higher the impact factor of the journal, the higher the cost of authorship.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One study by a major publisher used software to screen manuscripts for hallmarks of paper mill production and found that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/14/up-to-one-in-seven-of-submissions-to-hundreds-of-wiley-journals-show-signs-of-paper-mill-activity/">10 to 13% of its submissions were from a paper mill</a>.&nbsp; I refer the reader to some recent <a href="https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2023/11/defence-against-dark-arts-proposal-for.html">commentaries</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5">news articles</a> on paper mills for more information.</p>



<p>The use of generative artificial intelligence exploded with the release of Chat GPT in November 2022.&nbsp; Even before then, however, computer scientists were working on machine learning frameworks for generating images, and some have applied those technologies to image types relevant to biomedical research (specifically Western blots).</p>



<p>In early 2021, Qi, Zhang, and Luo posted a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.395319">preprint</a> describing the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce synthetic Western blot images that strongly resembled authentic blots.&nbsp; In 2022, Wang and colleagues published an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100509">opinion piece</a> in the journal <em>Patterns</em> in which they demonstrated the synthesis of both Western blot images and medical photographs using a GAN.&nbsp; Also in 2022, Ed Delp from Purdue University and his colleagues used a variety of generative models to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179116">produce a library of 24,000 synthetic Western blots</a>.&nbsp; They applied various types of detectors to this data set, the best of which reportedly was able to detect synthetic blots with 90% accuracy.</p>



<p>More recently, one of the authors of that paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24954600">took the detection of synthetic Western blots a step further</a> and reported that he and his colleagues could detect the particular AI model that was used to produce a synthetic Western blot.</p>



<p>We are in the dark about how bad the problem of generative AI already is in biomedical publications.&nbsp; The only thing we can say for certain is that it will get worse, with the now-widespread access to AI models for generating images and the difficulty of detecting them visually.&nbsp; The old hallmarks of visual inspection do not apply.</p>



<p>The development of algorithms for detecting images produced by generative AI is promising, and the near-term opportunities include independently verifying their effectiveness, using them to document the current extent of the problem, commercializing them, and implementing their use among all stakeholders in the publication process.</p>



<p>While journals and institutions are still working through the massive backlog of cases of image manipulation perpetrated using old image-processing techniques, generative AI is currently creating the new front in the battle against image manipulation.&nbsp; I had hoped I would be forced into retirement by the end of image manipulation in the published literature, but it looks like I might be forced into retirement by generative AI that is impossible to detect visually.</p>



<p>Twenty years ago, people were either unaware of the problem of image manipulation in the biomedical literature, or they thought the problem was so minor that they didn’t have to deal with it.&nbsp; Today, it would be difficult to claim to be unaware of the extent of the problem.&nbsp; Twenty years ago it was mostly a one-sided arms race &#8211; images were being manipulated, but very few people were doing anything about it.&nbsp; </p>



<p>We may still be losing the arms race, but now at least it’s two-sided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2024/08/09/arxiv-accessibility-2024/">The arXiv Accessibility Forum is back for another year – spread the word!</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2023, arXiv had its very first Accessibility Forum to help center accessibility issues in the open research and scientific communities. This inaugural Forum gathered accessibility experts and researchers with disabilities from across the globe to discuss potential solutions and barriers to access in science, with the goal of making accessible research papers a reality.</p>
<p>arXiv’s Accessibility Forum 2023 was a successful first step on a long journey – there is still work to be done to make sure that science and research are open and accessible to all.</p>
<p>Which means . . . it’s time for arXiv’s second-ever Accessibility Forum! Coming this September, get ready for arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024: Converging on Accessible Science Together. This Forum is free, entirely virtual, and open to all.</p>
<p>The arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024 begins on September 3<sup>rd</sup> and is composed of seven unique sessions, including a keynote, that cover a range of accessibility topics across many different scientific fields. Sessions will be about 1-2 hours long and will take place on different days over a period of two weeks &#8211; Forum attendees can choose to sign up for one, a few, or all of these sessions, as their interest and schedule allow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/schedule">full schedule for the Forum</a> is posted on our <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/index.html">arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024 website</a>, where you can learn more about <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/presenters">our presenters</a>, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYBgeITZhL4&amp;list=PLYgeAMJvRZ6ZRuNQGoekx0FdjXqEG0bzM">welcome and technical videos</a>, <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bBqisDGVGcrzQeq">send questions</a> to presenters to cover in their live sessions, or even <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/volunteer">sign up to volunteer</a> with the Forum!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sneak peek at the schedule:</p>
<p>Week 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask Me Anything | </strong>Tuesday, September 3rd</li>
<li><strong>AI and Accessibility</strong> | Wednesday, September 4th</li>
<li><strong>Deaf Hub at RIT</strong> |Friday, September 6th</li>
</ul>
<p>Week 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sonification</strong> | Tuesday, September 10th</li>
<li><strong>SciELO</strong> | Wednesday, September 11th</li>
<li><strong>HTML Papers on arXiv</strong> | Thursday, September 12th</li>
<li><strong>Keynote: Universal Designs</strong> | Friday, September 13th</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to accessibility in research – that’s why it’s important for our community to join together, learn about barriers to access, and let our voices be heard when it comes to accessibility for all.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in one (or all!) of arXiv’s Accessibility Forum sessions, you can sign up for the 2024 Forum (as well as scheduling updates and post-event recordings) <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEZ1d27LF2fVM7Y">here.</a></p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129787" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-300x300.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-150x150.png 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.png 561w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Laura Schaefer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On a Friday in July, Laura Schaefer Googled herself to find her <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID researcher ID</a> for a paper submission. </p>



<p>To her surprise, a paper popped up with her name in a journal she’d never published in. Her surprise quickly turned to concern – had someone copied one of her articles?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she searched the site where the work appeared, she found more articles with her name, covering subjects she had never written about and with co-authors she didn’t know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[I] became angrier the more I found, and also started feeling really violated that someone had used my name and title to put forward something that wasn’t scientifically rigorous,” <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/laura-schaefer">Schaefer</a>, a professor of mechanical engineering at Rice University in Houston, said.</p>



<span id="more-129786"></span>



<p>Schaefer found a total of four papers bearing her name, on topics far from her expertise such as agriculture and waste disposal. The articles appeared in the <em>Journal of Robotics Spectrum</em>, <em>Journal of Machine and Computing</em> and <em>Journal of Computing and Natural Science</em>, all titles belonging to a publisher in Kenya called AnaPub. None of the journals is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to their website, <a href="https://anapub.co.ke/index.html">AnaPub</a> is a “globally active publisher” with a mission to provide opportunities for authors to “publish their high-quality articles on the world [sic] best platform.” In July, Schaefer wrote to Emmanuel Sikuku Ogutu, AnaPub’s managing editor, asking him to remove the four papers attributed to her and linked to her Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ogutu apologised for incorrectly linking to her ID, but said his team had “successfully verified the authorship” of “Mr. Laura Schaefer,” who was “a past alumnus [sic] of Rice University.”</p>



<p>Schaefer promptly responded that she knew for a fact, as former department chair of Mechanical Engineering at Rice, there had never been another student with her name in the Mechanical Engineering Department or within the entire School of Engineering.</p>



<p>Lawyers for Rice also contacted a former student with a relatively similar name, Lauren Schaefer DiGloria, who confirmed she never authored any papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Rice’s lawyers demanded AnaPub remove the publications immediately and threatened a lawsuit for fraud. In a response on July 29, Ogutu said AnaPub has given “Mr. Laura Schaefer” 60 days to verify their identity. Schaefer and her team at Rice have not heard from Ogutu or anyone at AnaPub since. AnaPub also did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://css.umich.edu/people/university-affiliates/arvind-atreya">Arvind Atreya</a>, Schaefer’s supposed co-author on two of the papers, is also listed as a faculty member at Rice. Atreya is in fact a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He confirmed he did not write the papers, either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles list email addresses for Atreya and Schaefer at Rice’s domain that bounced back when we attempted to contact them. Another address listed for Schaefer at “hotmail.com” didn’t bounce, but no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schaefer has her doubts whether other authors named on papers on AnaPub’s website are truly connected with the work. They are “all people from very well-respected institutions,” she said. All four papers remain on AnaPub’s website credited to Laura Schaefer.</p>



<p>We’ve previously covered other cases of forged authorship on papers that appeared to have been plagiarized. One of the papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">falsely attributed to Anca Turcu</a> of the University of Central Florida, has been taken down, but the other, naming <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">Steffen Barra</a> of the University of Saarland in Germany, is <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/introducing-the-complexities-of-forensic-psychology-decoding-the-mind-behind-the-crime.pdf">still online</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/being-you-coming-to-terms-with-living-in-a-hallucination">Being You: Coming to terms with living in a hallucination</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Fran Hardyman reviews </strong><em><strong>Being You: A new science of consciousness</strong></em><strong>, a bestselling book of the renown author, Anil Seth. Seth discusses the subjectivity of human experience and attempts to explain consciousness.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What does it mean to be conscious? For Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience and co-Director of the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science, it means there exists “something it is like to be you”. It is fundamentally subjective and, as any scientist knows, subjectivity is a difficult starting point for experimentation and understanding. So, how can we ever attempt to explain the physical basis of the experience we call consciousness?</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This is at the root of the so-called ‘hard problem’, as defined by David Chalmers in 1995 (</span></span><u><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAFUT" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a></span></span></u><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">): why and how are the physical processes of the brain accompanied by subjective experience? Seth tackles this seemingly insurmountable question by focusing on the separate, but related, ‘real problem’ of consciousness: trying to “explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience” (p22, Being You). He broadly defines these properties as conscious level (on a scale from coma, sleep, and drowsiness to alertness, and even the hyper-awareness during psychedelic use), content (sensory experience), self-awareness and free will. With this structure, he keeps the focus of the book on what can be understood through theory and experimentation, and encourages us to trust that the resulting data will provide a framework for an improved understanding of more existential questions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth compares the field, as it stands now, to the study of life a few centuries ago. He argues that both ‘life’ and ‘consciousness’ refer to emergent properties that arise from varying combinations of stacked biological processes which can be examined and understood individually. He draws the contrast between this type of phenomenon and the kind modelled by temperature, which derives ultimately from a single physical feature (molecular vibration) and can be quantified by a single measure. This temperature-like approach is characteristic of integrated information theory (IIT), one of the leading current theories of consciousness, and one that Seth discusses thoroughly. It holds that integrated information itself, to a high enough degree, produces conscious experience, and that the amount of consciousness can be measured with a single unit: phi. Seth ultimately does not fully subscribe to IIT, but he does not shy away from engaging with its ‘weirder’ aspects, including the implication of panpsychism, wherein the entire fabric of the universe thrums with a background low-level consciousness, with humans, animals, and other complex systems ‘hotspots’ with high phi. What is ‘weird’ is not necessarily false, as, he reminds us, has been proven repeatedly in the last century of physics. There is no reason to expect that the ultimate explanation of consciousness will make intuitive sense.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth’s preferred theory of consciousness, however, centres on predictive processing; a mechanistic theory often associated with IIT as a means of integrating information. It suggests that the brain is, at its core, a ‘prediction machine’, that generates models of the world around us and ‘expectations’ of the conditions inside the body, then compares sensory inputs against these. This shifts the common conception of sensory processing from bottom-up ‘reading’ of the world to top-down interpretation of it. Thus our lived experience is a “controlled hallucination” that we design and inhabit. In order to minimise prediction errors, between our internal models and the input they receive, we often engage in ‘active inference’: homeostatic control inside the body, or action in the world, to provide the sensory signals the brain’s predictive models ‘expect’. In this way, predictions can produce phenomenological experience and a conception of the self, he argues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, this book maintained an excellent balance of science and entertainment, not shying away from the weird and the ethically complex, including panpsychism, animal consciousness, and AI, while also maintaining a hard focus on the known and knowable. Seth made a clear and convincing case for his ‘real problem’ framework for conceptualising consciousness, supported by engaging writing that made his deep expertise and thoughtfulness apparent throughout. This book came at an exciting time for consciousness science, with an advent of adversarial collaboration studies and newfound respect for the field more broadly. I certainly got a lot out of it, and I think most readers could too!</span></span></p>

<p>In 2008, a group of researchers published a paper in <em>Current Biology</em> reporting on what they said was a lungless water-loving frog in Borneo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-bickford-2b254b92/?originalSubdomain=sg">David Bickford</a>, then of the National University of Singapore, and his colleagues, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornean_flat-headed_frog">Bornean flat-headed frog</a> “breathed” the way most salamanders do:&nbsp; by absorbing oxygen through <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/lungless-salamanders-skin-expresses-protein-crucial-for-lung-function/">their skin</a> or, during earlier phases of life for some species, through gills. (We’re not salamander experts, so if this characterization is a bit crude, don’t come for us.) Because the frog lived in fast-moving streams, the researchers reasoned, it could obtain adequate oxygen to meet its needs.</p>



<p>For the last 15-odd years, that understanding held. But in May, another team of herpetologists, using more sophisticated tools, said they’ve found evidence of lungs – tiny but functional – in the creatures. As the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2431834-worlds-only-lungless-frog-species-actually-does-have-lungs-after-all/"><em>New Scientist</em></a> magazine reported earlier this year:</p>



<span id="more-129780"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/blackburn-lab/personnel/principal-investigator/">David Blackburn</a> at the Florida Museum of Natural History and his colleagues have taken another look at two of Bickford’s specimens. They ran them through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LObeI9l5DMg">high-resolution micro-CT scanner</a> and saw a respiratory system with small, thin lungs hiding in plain sight.</p>



<p>“Right away, both of us were like, why is there a hole on the bottom of the mouth? That’s not supposed to be there,” says Blackburn. He had spotted the glottis, where the mouth connects with the lungs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the paper has been retracted. Here’s the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01064-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224010649%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">retraction notice</a> for the article, “A lungless frog discovered on Borneo,” which has been cited 38 times, according to Clarivate’ Web of Science: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors previously claimed to have established lunglessness of the Bornean endemic aquatic frog, Barbourula kalimantanensis, by gross dissection and histological sections. However, these methods have been shown to not be sufficient to establish lunglessness (Blackburn et al., 2024, Curr. Biol. 34, R492–R493, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.03.017">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.03.017</a>). Although the methods the authors used were necessary to demonstrate simple features of gross anatomy, newer techniques used by Blackburn et al. (i.e., high-resolution CT scanning) are vastly superior and were able to detect the greatly reduced lungs that clearly exist in Barbourula. Though substantial loss of function might accompany such a reduction in the size of lungs, the frogs’ habitat in fast-flowing streams and rivers still appears to be a key driver of lung reduction in this species. The authors regret that they prematurely came to a false conclusion that Barbourula kalimantanensis has no lungs based on methods that have now been shown to be unreliable in detecting greatly reduced organs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bickford did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blackburn told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I led a large-scale collaborative project called oVert (<a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/">https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biad120">https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biad120</a>) in which we were creating high-resolution 3D anatomical datasets, mostly using CT-scanning. As an amphibian biologist, I was interested to generate datasets not only for exemplars across amphibian diversity but also of some taxa with interesting phenotypes. Thus, one species that we chose to CT-scan, as well as to create additional contrast-enhanced CT-scans to visualize soft tissues, was the “lungless frog”, Barbourula kalimantanensis. It was only after we began investigating these datasets that we realized something had been overlooked in the past. We often scroll through these x-ray cross-sections of these datasets beginning at the snout and scrolling backwards. We quite quickly noticed that there appeared to be a glottis and trachea, which, of course, wasn’t supposed to be there. That then led us to investigate this in more detail, including physically inspecting the two specimens on loan (two of the same specimens that had been investigated by Bickford et al. 2008).</p>



<p>To be clear, David Bickford has been a colleague for many years, and there was no animosity between us about this paper. Sometimes scientists take a second look and with different techniques and realize that not all is as it first seemed.</p>

<p>Researchers who said they discovered a new disease akin to rheumatoid arthritis, but caused by pollution, are standing by their claim despite the retraction of their paper last month.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01698-1">Middle east pain syndrome is a pollution-induced new disease mimicking rheumatoid arthritis</a>,” appeared in the Springer Nature journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> in November 2021.&nbsp; The paper has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and received limited <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/painful-new-arthritislike-disease-is-linked-to-pollution-suggest-doctors-61686">press coverage</a>.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-66447-6">retraction notice</a>, “post-publication peer review by an expert has confirmed the validity” of multiple concerns raised about the study. The paper did not present data to support its claims about the presumed cause for the syndrome, didn’t “conclusively” prove that MEPS is a new disease, and the bone erosions the study claimed were a hallmark of the disease weren’t backed by scans, the notice stated. Also, a figure of the paper featured a radiograph of a patient that wasn’t part of the study.</p>



<span id="more-129777"></span>



<p>“The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the conclusions of this study,” the notice states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://communities.springernature.com/users/rafal-marszalek">Rafal Marszalek</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal, told Retraction Watch the concerns were raised by a reader. After post-publication peer review by an expert “confirmed these concerns and that they substantially impact the conclusions of the article,” it was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author of the paper, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-8545">Adel A. Elbeialy</a>, a rheumatologist at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, disagreed with the retraction. He told us the journal did not respond to his objections.</p>



<p>In an email to <a href="https://communities.springernature.com/users/268019-anam-akhtar">Anam Akhtar</a>, a deputy editor of <em>Scientific Reports,</em> Elbeialy called the decision “hurried.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other communications with the journal seen by Retraction Watch, Elbeialy disputed the retraction, saying the findings would be supported in future research. “Some of these papers will reach your eminent journal soon,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elbeialy admitted that one of the figures was from a patient not included in the study, but said the authors decided to include it because of its “high resolution and suitability for printing.”</p>



<p>In his email to Akhtar, Elbeialy compared MEPS to COVID-19 “and its sequelae, we have to wait for other researches that explain the pathogenesis, criteria for diagnosis and proper treatment.” He also noted that rheumatoid arthritis, which the retracted paper claims is similar to Middle East Pain Syndrome, “was not understood fully from a single paper when described by Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais in the year 1800.”</p>

<p><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>has corrected an article by a prize-winning chemist following a report by Retraction Watch his threat to sue a fellow scientist who had submitted a letter to the journal critiquing the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/people/chad-mirkin/">Chad Mirkin</a>, director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern University in Chicago, received one quarter of this year’s <a href="https://www.kavliprize.org/prizes/nanoscience/2024">Kavli Prize in nanoscience</a> for his work on spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), the topic of the <em>PNAS</em> article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/16/kavli-prize-winner-threatens-to-sue-critic-for-defamation/">last month</a>, a lawyer representing Mirkin sent a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cease-and-Desist-to-R.-Levy-5_15_20241348054-clean.pdf">cease and desist letter</a> to Raphaël Lévy, a professor of physics at the Université Paris Sorbonne Nord, accusing Lévy of making “patently false and defamatory” statements about Mirkin’s research in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12746734">letter Lévy had submitted to <em>PNAS</em></a> about the now-corrected article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his letter, Lévy wrote that the article’s “presentation of SNAs as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics’ is misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129774"></span>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> paper,“<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306973121">Multimodal neuro-nanotechnology: Challenging the existing paradigm in glioblastoma therapy</a>,” had mentioned a clinical trial of an experimental cancer drug from <a href="https://invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/startups/exicure.html">Exicure</a>, a company Mirkin <a href="https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/invo-spotlights/featured-innovators/chad-mirkin.html">co-founded in 2011</a> to develop SNAs for diagnosing and treating disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental drug showed a “33% overall response rate at the highest dosage,” according to the <em>PNAS</em> paper. In his critique, Lévy wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<p>No reference is provided but the figure appears to come from an interim report presented by the company (press release and presentation at a conference (<a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_3/A257.2">10</a>)). The 33% are in fact 2 patients from a sub-group of 6 patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413733121">correction</a> to the article adds four references regarding the drug and its performance in clinical trials, one of which was reference 10 from Lévy’s letter. The other added references include the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03684785">clinical trial registration</a> and company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200916005263/en/">press release</a> about the results, both of which Lévy referred to in his letter, and a publication about a phase 1 study of the drug. The references were added “upon request,” according to the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>PNAS</em> declined to publish Lévy’s letter, and declined to comment on its decision for our prior article. The journal said it had nothing to add to the correction. Mirkin has not responded to our requests for comment. </p>



<p>The added references confirm what Lévy wrote in his letter, he told Retraction Watch, but don’t go far enough to fix the article, in his view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers will “be unaware that this correction results from my comment, which Chad Mirkin tried to silence with a legal threat, and that PNAS decided not to publish,” Lévy said. “They will also not know that the results are from an interim report of a clinical trial that stopped several years ago.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thus this correction does nothing to correct the main problem” of the article, Lévy said, namely “that it cherry picks facts (here encouraging results from a very small number of patients) to mislead readers by presenting spherical nucleic acids as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics.’”</p>



<p>Lévy also informed <em>PNAS</em> Mirkin had founded a new company, <a href="https://www.flashpoint.bio/">Flashpoint Therapeutics</a>, to develop SNA drugs but had not disclosed this relationship in the paper. “That conflict of interest is still undeclared,” he said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Being a woman in neuroscience can be challenging, but facing strong gender bias from an early age, by being a woman in physics, can be even more so. Dr Eva Kreysing is both. Equally fascinated by these research areas, based at the University of Cambridge as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Professor Kristian Franze, Dr Kreysing uses her advanced training in the physical sciences to shine light on some of the biggest questions in developmental neuroscience. What can physics tell us about the way that neurons mature as our brains are built? I sat down with Eva to learn about her journey into cross-disciplinary science, her current projects, and where her career is heading. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would probably say in eleventh grade which, in my school, was the first time we were properly introduced to the sciences in class. There were two key moments that come to mind. The first was in my first real school physics lecture where we were taught, in one go, how to differentiate, integrate and solve differential equations. I was amazed to see just how powerful maths is and how elegantly you can apply it. That made me see that I really love the approach that physics gives you in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">From the biology side, it was around the same time. I was looking through my biology textbook at the beginning of term and came across neurons – I was so intrigued, but perhaps a bit lazy and didn’t keep reading! Instead, I went to see my father, who used to be a biology teacher, and asked him to tell me everything he knew about neurons. We sat down for an entire afternoon, and I was hooked. I knew then that I wanted to study neurons, but I wanted to take a physics approach.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Your undergraduate and PhD studies were both in physics – what made you take that particular path?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I spoke to various people with backgrounds in neuroscience, medicine and physics, and from these conversations, I decided that the best way to combine a love of physics and neuroscience was to study physics as a primary subject and explore neuroscience independently. I felt learning physics by myself would be harder, but with biology I could focus on the areas I was specifically interested in and explore them in depth. I thought this approach would be the best way forward.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What parts of your training in physics then helped you in neuroscience?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say less of the techniques, but more of the approach. Being a physics student teaches you to be independent in your learning. You know you will not understand everything in the beginning, but you just have to keep going. No matter what it is, you will manage. We used to call it ‘frustration tolerance’! I took that lesson with me into neuroscience – if I keep trying, then I can find the answers to the questions I am interested in.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So training as a physicist helped you to train yourself as a biologist?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think so!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Can you tell me about the research you are doing now? What excites you most about your current work, combining physics with neuroscience?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At the moment, I am taking on the question of how mechanics impacts the electrical development of neurons. For example, how quickly do neurons start to communicate with one another depending on their mechanical environment, such as the stiffness of the surrounding brain tissue? I absolutely love trying to figure out all of the different components that feed into the mechanics of the cell. Sometimes I put myself into the neuron’s shoes and try to imagine what it would actually </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">feel</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, what the world looks like from the perspective of this tiny neuron. If I am a neuron, and I grab hold of this and pull on it, how will this affect me?</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So cool! What sort of lab techniques help you to understand this?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are so many different techniques. On the one hand, I use a lot of microscopy tools that are grounded in physics to probe how the mechanics of a cell work. Using traction force microscopy, I can measure the forces that a cell applies to its environment, for example as an axon extends and grows, by looking at how it deforms its environment. Optics tweezers let me pull a super thin tether of cell membrane to see how much tension there is. These physical principles tell us lots about how neurons behave and develop over time, and this feeds back into more traditional biological measures, such as gene expression. Figuring out how mechanical interactions can change biological pathways is, for me, the coolest thing, because it really combines these two worlds.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How do you investigate the mechanisms that link mechanics to biochemistry? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have done a lot of RNA sequencing, and more Western blots than I can count, to compare gene expression from cells that are cultured in different mechanical environments, in particular on gels of different &apos;stiffness&apos;. This can pinpoint interesting candidates that may be important in the signalling cascade, even if you have never heard of them before! I then specifically target these candidates with molecular techniques, like CRISPR-Cas9, and see if the result is what I would expect, depending on my hypothesis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Is there such a thing as a typical ‘day-to-day’ in your job?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My days vary so much, which is definitely part of the appeal. I have some days where I am fully engaged in the lab, doing tissue dissections and neuronal culture. Now that I have so much experience, it almost feels like a handicraft, and I get into a sort-of ‘flow state’ when the muscle memory just kicks in. It gives lab work a totally zen feeling. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I then look at my cells under the microscope and, particularly if it is a new experiment, I might see things I have never seen before – I get so curious about what I am about to see! When you see something interesting, it is really eye opening, especially if it is not the observation you expected. I take the time to think about it and prepare to doubt all of my assumptions. I dive into the literature and search through papers for the missing pieces of the puzzle that explain what I just saw with my own two eyes. With more research, the picture becomes clearer, and I get such a sense of reward.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also supervise students, which is immensely satisfying because I can share my knowledge to help people avoid making some of the frustrating mistakes I faced myself! Some of my students are actually taking on my own previous projects, so supporting their progress is truly fantastic because I still feel so invested in this research, despite not having the opportunity to progress with my own two hands in the lab. I’m still following the story, all while giving advice and mentoring the next generation of scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Of course, there are also desk-based days. I write a lot of my own custom software to analyse the data that I have collected, such as the dynamic calcium signalling of cells. On other days, I’m writing papers and research proposals </span></span><u><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.25.605128v1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">(have a look at Eva&apos;s latest preprint here)</span></span></em></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2e5208a4f6a947a1b8c67263e572add2~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Eva's Newfador, Sam."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Sounds really intense! When things get tough, what keeps you going?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As soon as I start to feel uneasy, I turn to the people around me. In the lab or the office, I am fortunate to be blessed with the most amazing team of colleagues who are such a source of support. After work, I focus on spending time with the people I love, and my adorable black Newfador, Sam. Sport is also a fantastic mental release; whenever I exercise, like taking Sam for a walk or jog, the world looks completely different when I get home. It gives me a new perspective and helps me forget about things.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Do you think there are particular challenges faced by women in progressing in their careers in both neuroscience and physics?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say it has become more ‘normal’ to be a woman in neuroscience than a woman in physics. This probably also depends what country you are in, as Germany (where I come from and did my PhD) has a very different scientific culture to the UK. I have always felt more accepted here, not by specific individuals, but in an overall sense. I do feel that I belong in science and that I am respected.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>On the topic of respect, who would you consider a scientific inspiration to admire?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have been thinking a lot about this question, as I thought it might come up! I have to say, if it is really a question of inspiration, I must admit that it is not people that inspire me, but problems. When I am faced with a problem, I am compelled to learn everything that I need to in order to tackle it. It is this that really inspires me in my work, rather than a desire to follow in the footsteps of someone else. Every scientist, just like every person, is completely different. No scientist I have met is someone I have felt able to compare myself to. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>There are so many problems out there to face! What problems do you want to face in your future research? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My dream is to combine my research from both my PhD and my postdoc and take them to the next level. Together, they could give much deeper insights into how mechanics impacts circuit formation in the brain. This is a huge question, and to face it we have to learn a lot more about how mechanosensing actually works at the subcellular level – how are neurons ‘feeling’ their environment? Then we have to take the story all the way through to the development of organs </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">in vivo</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. If I could start a lab that works to achieve this, it would be incredible. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Last but not least, if you could go through your career again, is there anything you would change?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Honestly, I would probably do exactly the same. During my undergraduate studies, people used to ask me what I was interested in, and when I told them I wanted to work at the interface of neuroscience and physics, they just looked at me in a funny way. Many tried to talk me out of studying physics at all. They gave me the impression that they thought what I wanted was wrong, or was not possible. Now, having gone through my journey, I know they were wrong. This has been the right path for me.</span></span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/rewiring-the-mind-the-extraordinary-power-of-neuroplasticity">Rewiring the mind: the extraordinary power of neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself by forming and eliminating neural connections throughout life. This adaptive capability is essential for learning, memory and recovery from brain injuries.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Neuroplasticity manifests in two ways: functional, and structural plasticity. Functional plasticity is the brain’s ability to move the capability of performing functions from damaged areas to undamaged ones. For example, after a stroke, other parts of the brain may take over the functions that were previously controlled by other areas. Meanwhile, structural plasticity involves the brain’s ability to physically change in structure, such as when learning, during experiences, or injury. It includes growth of new neurons (neurogenesis) and formation of new synaptic connections.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Mechanisms of neuroplasticity</span></h4>
<p>1.    <strong> Synaptic plasticity:</strong> changes in strength of the synapses (the connections between neurons) are crucial for learning and memory. Key processes involved are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), strengthening or weakening synapses over time in response to increases or decreases in their activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process that results in a lasting enhancement of signal transmission between two neurons when they are stimulated together and the strengthening of synaptic connections. This phenomenon is typically triggered by high-frequency stimulation of the synapse. The induction of LTP relies on the influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors, which activates signalling pathways that boost synaptic strength. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes are involved in LTP, with increased neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron and heightened receptor sensitivity or density on the postsynaptic neuron contributing to the overall enhancement of synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Long-term depression (LTD) is a process that results in a sustained reduction in synaptic strength, usually induced by low-frequency stimulation of the synapse. This decrease in synaptic efficiency is characterized by the removal of neurotransmitter receptors, such as AMPA receptors, from the postsynaptic neuron. Unlike long-term potentiation, which involves an influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors to strengthen synapses, LTD involves a lower influx of calcium, activating phosphatases that lead to receptor removal. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes contribute to LTD, including diminished neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron and a decrease in receptor density or sensitivity on the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_466823b649c3449686a2119e217b3d25~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_943,h_810,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     <strong>Neurogenesis:</strong> generation of new neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, which is vital for learning and memory.</p>
<p>3.     <strong>Dendritic branching:</strong> the growth of dendrite branches at the end of axons enhances the formation of new connections.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Factors that influence neuroplasticity</span></h4>
<p>1. <strong>    Age: </strong>neuroplasticity is more pronounced in childhood; however, adults retain significant plasticity, especially in response to stimuli like learning new skills or rehabilitation after injury.</p>
<p>2.     <strong>Environments with stimulating activities </strong>such as physical exercise, social interaction, cognitive challenges, and exposure to novel experiences enhance neuroplasticity. This is due to increased blood flow and providing complex varied stimuli.</p>
<p>3.     <strong>Experience and learning</strong> leads to formation and strengthening of synaptic connections.</p>
<p>4.     <strong>Physical activity</strong> promotes synaptic plasticity, benefiting cognitive functions.</p>
<p>5.    <strong> Dietary nutrients</strong>, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, support brain health and plasticity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Neuroplasticity in health and disease</span></h4>
<p>Memory consolidation techniques, such as spaced repetition, enhance long-term retention of information. Similarly, post-injury rehabilitation strategies aim to harness neuroplasticity to restore lost functions. These include physical therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, or constrain induced movement therapy, a rehabilitation technique that involves restricting the use of an unaffected limb to encourage the use and improve the function of a weaker limb, commonly used in stroke recovery. Neuroplasticity also plays a role in mental health conditions, e.g. CBT aims to rewire maladaptive circuits in depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Outlook</span></h4>
<p>In the future, there are multiple ways in which we can continue to harness neuroplasticity. Devices such as brain computer interfaces can directly influence neuroplasticity by providing real-time feedback and targeted stimulation, which helps the brain to reorganize and form new neural connections, thereby enhancing motor and cognitive functions. Pharmacological drugs, such as memantine (used for Alzheimer&apos;s disease), donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), and ketamine (an anaesthetic with rapid antidepressant effects) can promote neuroplasticity by modulating neurotransmitter systems, enhancing synaptic connections, and supporting cognitive and emotional function, and hence can be used to treat neurological disorders. Genes and their expression can also influence neuroplasticity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, neuroplasticity, the brain’s dynamic ability to adapt, learn, and heal, not only supports our cognitive and motor functions, but also gives us hope for recovery from injuries and treatment of neurological disorders. As research progresses, harnessing neuroplasticity enables us to unlock new discoveries, ultimately enhancing human health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>A journal has republished an edited version of a paper it retracted after a distributor of a chiropractic product the paper criticized wrote in to complain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distributor accused the publication of making “very serious, incorrect and libelous statements” and threatened legal action, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129772"></span>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/01/journal-retracts-paper-on-chiropractic-product-after-company-complains/">we reported</a> the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/"><em>Journal of Clinical Imaging Science</em></a> retracted the paper, “<a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">An investigation into the chiropractic practice and communication of routine repetitive radiographic imaging for the location of postural misalignments</a>,” because it contained “controversial statements regarding the commercial product Denneroll,” according to the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/retraction-an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">retraction notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deed Harrison, a chiropractor who is a distributor of Denneroll, “claimed that the data presented against this product lacks scientific backing,” the notice stated. “The authors of the manuscript acknowledged the error. Therefore, on ethical grounds, the article is being retracted.”</p>



<p>We have now <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDLRrLcVyzvbH5v1d56VFts0Qwi2L22I8c7qVrJbkGU/edit?usp=sharing">obtained an email</a>, dated June 15, in which Harrison accused the journal of making a “serious Libelous statement” against himself and the maker of Denneroll. “I do not wish to involve my legal team in this issue nor the legal team of Denneroll Industries, however, if nothing is done regarding the above we will be compelled to pursue legal counsel and appropriate action,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harrison called the statements in the published paper about him and the company “false,” and said the researchers “provide no reference for the support of their statements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the email, Harrison stated his family does not own Denneroll Industries, as the original paper asserted. He also criticized the article’s use of the word “pillow” to describe the cervical chiropractic device. Rather, he called Denneroll a “prescription only based orthotic used by physicians (prescribed to their patients) to improve the cervical lordotic curvature.”</p>



<p>“The statement is not only false by Williams et al, but it is damaging to the scientific truth and the reputation of the Denneroll product, which in turn are damaging to Denneroll Industries,” Harrison wrote.</p>



<p>In the retracted version of the paper, still available online, the researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839988/pdf/jcca-v50-2-103.pdf">cited</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839992/pdf/jcca-v50-2-097.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383(98)00184-3/abstract">papers</a> critical of the Denneroll and a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1840024/pdf/jcca-v49-4-270.pdf">2005 study</a> Harrison coauthored. Harrison noted that the quotations the retracted paper attributed to the critical articles it cited “can’t be found as a quotation by those sources.” </p>



<p>Another apparent quotation about the purported effects of the Denneroll is “not properly referenced and is made to appear as if it were nothing but conjecture from the &#8216;Harrisons&#8217;&#8211;being me Dr. Deed Harrison.” </p>



<p>“The libelous statements made by Williams et al in your journal are not referenced by them and it appears as though they made these up without proper citation,” he wrote.</p>



<p>One week after Harrison’s email to the journal, on June 22, the journal retracted the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 1, the day we published our report, the journal <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments-2/">republished the article</a> without the offending statements, or any apparent reference to the original article or retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112358951-vikram-s-dogra">Vikram Dogra</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal, nor the corresponding author, <a href="https://muckrack.com/brogan-williams/articles">Brogan Williams</a>, a researcher at the Association of Musculoskeletal Sports Physiologists in Auckland, New Zealand, immediately responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The republished version of the article still cites four papers by Harrison in the introduction as examples of researchers “commonly drawn to communicate the patient’s overall spinal curvature and increased weight-bearing that may be occurring at specific structures.” Harrison’s papers were also used as examples of research that used “postural analysis of the lumbopelvic region” to “validate treatment approaches and communicate a patient’s spinal health.”</p>
