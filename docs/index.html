<p>Two institutional investigations that concluded in 2016 and 2019 found scientific misconduct in multiple publications from the lab of a leading urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigations could not determine who had manipulated the published images of experimental data, but the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2019-RD-investigation-report.pdf">2019 report</a> concluded that Rajvir Dahiya, also director of the urology research center at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, “was senior/last author on all these publications and therefore responsible for the results.” Dahiya retired in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two investigation reports, which we obtained through a public records request, along with the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2014-inquiry-report.pdf">reports</a> from the preliminary <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2018-inquiry-report.pdf">inquiries</a> preceding the investigations, recommend notifying the journals that published eight papers of the issues identified. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/08/professor-emeritus-loses-fourth-paper-after-ucsf-va-investigation-five-years-after-other-retractions/">Four</a> have <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDahiya%252c%2bRajvir">so far</a> been retracted, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/20/ucsf-va-investigation-finds-misconduct-in-highly-cited-pnas-paper/">one corrected</a>, and two marked with expressions of concern. One of those expressions of concern was published last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Dahiya blamed the findings that research misconduct occurred in his lab on the age of the papers. He said the VA destroyed notebooks with original data that had been stored in a central facility after the required data retention period had lapsed: </p>



<span id="more-127745"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The major concern was that the original data was not found to address these concerns. On one hand, the VA/UCSF storage facility discarded all our original data, and on the other hand, the VA/UCSF committee wanted original data to address their concerns and thus blamed us that we fasified [sic] this data.&nbsp; We also carried out a series of new experiments to generate new original data to address all their concerns but they did not agree with the new data either.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2016-investigation-report.pdf">investigation report from 2016</a>, the committee called the overall lack of raw data or draft manuscripts and figures “puzzling,” and noted that Dahiya had said the lab began keeping digital copies of data in 2005.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya told the committee that the relevant lab notebooks were lost during laboratory moves. However, the report stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no direct evidence for this occurring, and neither the former nor current ACOS [Associate Chief of Staff] for Research at the San Francisco VAMC has any record or recollection of such a loss.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee considered whether data may have been destroyed intentionally, but decided that because much of the lab’s data was lost, rather than data related only to the allegations of manipulation, the loss was “consistent with a chronic, general laxity of data management” rather than misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the committee concluded Dahiya had been “negligent in his duties as a laboratory director,” they did not believe his actions met the criteria for research misconduct due to recklessness:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no clear evidence that his failure to maintain research records was done with the intention or knowledge that his behavior incurred the risk of data fabrication or falsification, i.e., scientific misconduct by members of his research group.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report determined that four of Dahiya’s publications “​​contain instances of data fabrication or falsification,” and recommended notifying the journals as one of four corrective actions. The committee also recommended that Dahiya “develop a systematic, comprehensive approach for data storage, including the archiving of original data, images, and laboratory notebooks,” and periodically audit his lab’s work for scientific integrity with a research integrity officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another recommendation that Dahiya should work with a research integrity officer to train his lab members in scientific integrity, the committee wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since no single individual was clearly responsible for this misconduct, it is likely that the instances of misconduct described in the four allegations represent the actions of multiple individuals over a period of years. This suggests that the research environment in the Respondent’s lab does not adequately foster or oversee ethically sound scientific practices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to the committee’s recommended actions, Bonnie S. Graham, the director of the San Francisco VA Health Care System, who certified the report, recommended a review of Dahiya’s “suitability … to function as a PI and/or to supervise research at the VA.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Dahiya’s employment timeline (<a href="https://archive.li/PP2BB#selection-2801.25-2801.146">archived</a> from the UCSF website before his emeritus status ended and the page became unavailable) nor his <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/zmg7k8elQ0SnUvFD788ycQ/projects">grant funding history</a> indicate that he ceased functioning as a PI. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The second investigation, concluded in 2019, identified manipulated data in six papers. Some of the flagged figures came from papers that had been included in the first investigation. The committee wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manipulation of Western blot gels and splicing of gels have been pervasive in the Dahiya lab. … There are numerous examples of manipulation of data to make the results fit what was expected, for example, a blank space on a gel to represent a negative control that was not run.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to notifying the journals that had published the papers, the committee recommended that all lab members receive training on best practices for publishing figures, and that Dahiya “must audit data to be published from his laboratory and document that published figures are accurate until no longer determined necessary.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya “may not apply for external funding until these Corrective Actions are in place and documented,” the report stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report is dated Sept. 4, 2019, but the committee members did not sign it until January 2020. Dahiya retired that June. We asked him about the committee’s recommendations regarding data auditing and prohibition of applying for grants, and he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The committee recommended that all the data from our lab must be submitted to the VAMC Chief of Staff for Research. We strictly followed all the guidelines recommended by the committee.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/07/ucsf-va-investigations-find-clear-evidence-misconduct-cancer-papers/">previously reported</a> on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">letters</a> UCSF and the VA have sent to journals asking them to retract papers, and how one journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/16/when-it-takes-two-university-federal-agency-letters-and-five-years-for-a-journal-to-retract-a-paper/">took five years</a> to heed the request. That journal wasn’t the only one taking its time: Last month, the <em>British Journal of Cancer</em>, a Springer Nature title, placed an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02365-0">expression of concern</a> on a paper flagged in the 2019 VA/UCSF report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expression of concern highlights a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-018-0146-2">correction from 2018</a> that replaced a figure in the paper, and states that the VA/UCSF investigation “could not establish that the data in the replacement panels … corresponded to the data of the original experiments. … Readers should therefore interpret the results and conclusions presented with caution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya disagreed with the expression of concern. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On May 18th 2018, Dr. Hiroshi Hirata voluntarily proposed to replace Figure 4D as a correction and the Editor-in-chief and Scientific Publications Manager of Brit. J. Cancer agreed to go ahead with a correction of this figure.</p>



<p>Now on August 16th 2023 (after 5 years), the VA / UCSF investigation committee does not agree with this correction and forces Brit. J. Cancer to write this statement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dahiya also forwarded us <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fwd_-_Request-for-correction-Br.-J.-Cancer-2014-1106_-1645-1654.pdf">an email chain</a> between Hirata and the journal, which began with a May 8, 2018 email in which Hirata wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I got Email [sic] from Dr Dahiya to contact you about correction [sic].</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The inquiry report with allegations about two figures in the paper, including the one that Hirata sought to correct, was dated Feb. 7, 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After going back and forth with detailed questions about the new figure, the journal’s scientific publications manager conveyed the editor in chief’s decision to publish a correction on May 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation report acknowledged the correction, but stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>without original data showing pictures (negative and positive) taken at the same time, we conclude intentional research misconduct occurred because the reuse of different frames of the same data to represent 2 conditions is research misconduct and this activity constitutes a significant departure from accepted research practices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the report’s proposed action to take on the paper did not seem to recommend contacting the journal over the corrected figure, but only to assess whether the journal should be notified of another figure showing a gel that had been spliced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature said that due to the “uncertainty around the data” in the corrected figure, the editor in chief of the journal felt the expression of concern “was the most appropriate editorial action to take.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the notice appearing nearly four years after the investigation report was finalized, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal became aware of the outcome of the institutional investigation during a period of significant transition while journal ownership transferred to Springer Nature and the previous Editor-in-Chief retired. Additionally, we spent some time attempting to contact some of the authors and, regretfully, together this led to some delays in our handling of the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Only one of the eight papers that the investigations identified as containing manipulated data remains without some sort of notice:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>Dahiya disagreed with all the retractions. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Other journals did not agree with the VA/UCSF investigation committee report and thus no further actions were taken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the journals that published our papers did not have any problems with our data. But the VA/UCSF investigation committee members forced these four journals to retract our papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another preliminary inquiry, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2021-inquiry-report.pdf">completed in 2021</a>, determined the single allegation of falsified data it concerned did not warrant a full investigation.</p>

                <p>Roughly a century before the Inca empire came to power in A.D. 1400, blasts of human-produced thunder may have rumbled off a ridge high in the Andes Mountains.</p>



<p>New evidence indicates that people who lived there around 700 years ago stomped rhythmically on a special dance floor that amplified their pounding into a thunderous boom as they worshipped a thunder god.</p>



<p>Excavations at a high-altitude site in Peru called Viejo Sangayaico have revealed how members of a regional farming and herding group, the Chocorvos, constructed this reverberating platform, says archaeologist Kevin Lane of the University of Buenos Aires. Different layers of soil, ash and guano created a floor that absorbed shocks while emitting resonant sounds when people stomped on it. This ceremonial surface <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278416523000314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked like a large drum</a> that groups of 20 to 25 people could have played with their feet, Lane reports in the September <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>These findings, from a ridgetop ritual area that faces a nearby mountain peak, provide a rare glimpse of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-trumpets-played-eerie-notes">the role played by sound and dance in ancient societies</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/10</em>).</p>



<p>While working at Viejo Sangayaico in 2014, Lane’s team first noticed that one of two open-air platforms located in a ritual area sounded hollow when people walked on it.</p>



<p>A later excavation of part of the platform uncovered six sediment deposits consisting of various mixes of silty clay, sand, ash and other materials. Ashy layers within a section of guano from animals such as llamas and alpacas included small cavities that helped to generate drumlike sounds from the platform’s surface, Lane says.</p>



<p>His team acoustically tested the platform by stomping on it one at a time and in groups of two to four while measuring the noise produced. The same was done while a circle of four people stomp-danced across the platform.</p>



<p>The resulting sounds ranged in intensity from 60 to 80 decibels, roughly equivalent to between a loud conversation and a noisy restaurant, Lane says. Larger groups of Chocorvos dancers, possibly accompanied by singing and musical instruments, would have raised a much bigger racket.</p>



<p>Spanish historical documents describe Chocorvos beliefs in thunder, lightning, earthquake and water deities. Supernatural convictions may have inspired ancient ceremonies at Viejo Sangayaico that included stomp dancing aimed at emulating a thunder god’s signature blasts, Lane suggests. In line with that suggestion, remains of a possible temple near the percussive platform included pottery pieces displaying snake images that, in the local Quechua language, refer to water or rivers and, in some instances, lightning.</p>



<p>Pre-Inca stomp dancing may also have influenced a dance practiced by the Chorcovos and other Andean groups in the mid-1500s, after Spanish conquest of the Incas in 1532, Lane suspects. The Chorcovos had been subjects of the Inca Empire for most of its run. As part of a resistance movement against Spanish culture called <em>Taki Onqoy</em>, Andeans danced and trembled ecstatically in circles, possibly to evoke spirits of their traditional deities.</p>



<p>Finding another percussive platform along with artifacts related to water and lightning rituals at other ancient Andean sites would better support Lane’s argument that sound-amplifying platforms provided a way to honor a thunder god as part of broader ceremonial events, says anthropological archaeologist Kylie Quave. To that end, researchers can now excavate platforms at other sites to check for guano layers and other elements of drumlike dance floors, says Quave, of George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Whether makers of the Viejo Sangayaico platform designed it to amplify sounds, Chocorvos people could have discovered the surface’s drumlike properties and then used it for ceremonial dancing, says Miriam Kolar, an archaeoacoustics researcher at Stanford University.</p>



<p>Evidence of other sound-altering structures has also been found at Andean sites older than Viejo Sangayaico, Kolar says. Conch-shell horns found in a ceremonial center at <a href="https://culturalacoustics.org/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a roughly 3,000-year-old site called Chavin de Huántar</a> could have produced a range of sounds, from nearly pure tones to loud roars, that were emphasized in ceremonially important passages and ventilation shafts, Kolar and colleagues have found.</p>





<p>People today who live near Viejo Sangayaico say that another ancient site in the area contains a similar platform that resonates underfoot. Lane and colleagues have yet to visit that site.</p>



<p>Finding more sound-amplifying platforms will depend on “having your ear attuned to how different parts of a site sound,” Lane says, “which is something that archaeologists rarely do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/health-risks-persist-2-years-covid-19">Health risks can persist at least 2 years after COVID-19, new data suggest</a></h4>

              
                <p>The risk of experiencing such health issues as diabetes, fatigue or blood clots can persist for at least two years after a coronavirus infection, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>That finding is based on the health records of about 140,000 U.S. veterans infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, compared with nearly 6 million more who did not test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers used veterans’ new diagnoses of health issues, lab results and prescription records to identify health problems that emerged starting a month after getting COVID-19.</p>





<p>Even two years after their infections, people who had COVID-19 were at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02521-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher risk for many health issues</a> — ranging from heart disease to gastrointestinal problems, the team reports August 21 in <em>Nature Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Patients who were hospitalized during their initial COVID-19 cases were more likely to experience these health problems, the team found. But those with milder initial infections were still at higher risk for about one-third of the medical issues that the scientists analyzed, compared with people who didn’t test positive. As most COVID-19 cases are milder, this group represents a greater burden to the health care system, says Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System.</p>



<p>The most common problems align with common long COVID symptoms identified in other studies, such as fatigue, memory problems, loss of smell, blood clots, metabolic issues and gastrointestinal problems. For example, initially hospitalized patients were about 1.88 times as likely to experience acute gastritis, or stomach inflammation as those with no record of COVID-19 at two years after infection; non-hospitalized patients had a risk factor of 1.44 times.</p>



<p>“Long COVID represents a significant burden of disease and disability,” says Al-Aly, who is also affiliated with Washington University in Saint Louis. A coronavirus infection can “result in heart disease, result in brain problems,” and many other long-term risks which scientists are just beginning to understand.</p>



<p>While the patients in the study were predominantly male and older, the findings align with Upinder Singh’s experience seeing patients at Stanford University’s long COVID clinic. “This is an important set of data,” she says.</p>



<p>The findings also match patients’ experiences with persistent symptoms, says Lisa McCorkell, a long COVID patient and researcher at the Patient-Led Research Collaborative. In particular, she noted that autonomic nervous system issues, which can lead to symptoms like pain and fatigue, persisted for both groups of patients in the study and even increased over time for the non-hospitalized group. Many people with long COVID have also been diagnosed with this condition.</p>



<p>Al-Aly and colleagues examined 77 medical problems that may arise after an acute COVID-19 case. Two years after infection, COVID-19 patients who hadn’t been hospitalized for severe symptoms early on – about 120,000 of those in the study — remained at higher risk for 24 of the 77 issues, compared with people who hadn’t tested positive. Those who had been hospitalized were at higher risk for 50 of the 77 issues, suggesting that worse symptoms in the acute phase can contribute to a greater chance of long COVID.</p>



<p>Initially hospitalized patients also had higher risks of going to the hospital again or dying in the two years following their COVID-19 infections, the researchers found. These risks tapered off for people who had milder cases early on, as did some specific health risks, including low blood oxygen levels and memory problems.</p>



<p>Overall, Al-Aly and colleagues found that for every 1,000 people infected with the coronavirus, a cumulative 150 years of healthy life is lost due to these patient’s struggles with persistent symptoms. This finding demonstrates “how destructive long COVID can be,” McCorkell says. Other studies, such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Census’ Household Pulse Survey</a>, similarly found that long COVID can severely restrict day-to-day life for many patients.<s></s></p>



<p>The study does have limitations. Because it used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/researchers-fill-the-gaps-long-covid-data">electronic health records</a>, only information available to the medical system can be analyzed (<em>SN: 11/28/22</em>). The researchers couldn’t assess some common long COVID symptoms that are not typically captured by doctor’s visits, such as post-exertional malaise (PEM). “When it comes to a symptom clinicians have never heard of before, like PEM, [health records don’t capture] the full picture,” says Jaime Seltzer, an expert on myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome who heads scientific and medical outreach with the advocacy group #MEAction. This chronic condition shares many symptoms with long COVID.</p>





<p>Seltzer also notes that the study may be skewed by its veteran population. About 90 percent of veteran records included were from men, while long COVID and other similar chronic conditions are more common among women. Some health issues that are more common for women with long COVID, such as long-term neurological and endocrine symptoms, may be underrepresented, she says.</p>



<p>The study also didn’t include people who may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but failed to get a positive test result in early 2020, when tests were not widely available. In fact, many of the people included as controls could have “actually had COVID-19,” Singh says.</p>



<p>Despite the caveats, <a>with </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expect-coronavirus-fall-endemic-variants">COVID-19 transmission rising again</a> in recent weeks, the study offers a reminder that “it’s still worth it to protect yourself,” Al-Aly says (<em>SN: 8/21/23</em>). Even a mild infection could lead to health problems in the months or years that follow.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stuart-pimm.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="133" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stuart-pimm.jpg?resize=133%2C200" alt="" class="wp-image-24038" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stuart Pimm</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the world&#8217;s foremost conservation biologists is being accused of plagiarism and bullying by a former PhD student, Retraction Watch has learned. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The biologist, <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm">Stuart Pimm</a> of Duke University, strongly denies the charges, but he and his colleagues have acknowledged the existence of “closely related” work following an internal investigation by Duke.</p>



<p>The allegations surfaced late last month on X, formerly known as Twitter, in <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955038156832769">a thread that quickly went viral</a>, garnering hundreds of thousands of views and drawing comments from a broad swath of scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the thread, <a href="https://rdpalacio.co/">Ruben Dario Palacio</a> claimed his former academic advisor &#8220;threatened to kick me out of Duke&#8221; to make him work faster. Palacio decided to change labs due to the alleged &#8220;bullying and harassment,&#8221; he said, and three months later, in April 2020, published his research as <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.064477v1">a preprint</a>. The article <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13424">appeared</a> in the journal <em>Diversity and Distributions</em> in October 2021.</p>



<span id="more-127733"></span>



<p>But in November 2021, Pimm’s group published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259299">a paper</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em> describing work that was &#8220;remarkably similar to mine, and I was not cited. It&#8217;s plagiarism,&#8221; Palacio wrote on X.</p>



<p>In an interview with Retraction Watch, he said he believes Pimm&#8217;s actions were meant as retribution.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wanted to retaliate against me for … having the balls to leave his lab because no one else had done it before, to my knowledge,&#8221; Palacio said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In support of his accusations, he has shared several emails with Retraction Watch, as well as a secret <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/last_interaction_with_Stuart.mp3">recording</a> of a conversation he had with Pimm before they parted ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm, a professor at Duke&#8217;s Nicholas School of the Environment, said Palacio&#8217;s allegations had &#8220;no merit&#8221; and that internal investigations at Duke had cleared him of the harassment charge and had not found research misconduct on his part.</p>



<p>&#8220;For Ruben to claim that ideas that have been developed for well over a decade in my lab and with many of our co-authors were his is patently silly,&#8221; Pimm told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>He also denied threatening to fire Palacio: &#8220;That&#8217;s not a decision that individual professors make in the U.S.&#8221;</p>



<p>The secretly taped conversation, however, reveals Pimm did repeatedly threaten to terminate his then-student and take away the research Palacio had been leading &#8212; promises he appears to have made good on.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Palacio first met Pimm in 2015, the year after he graduated from Icesi University in Cali, Colombia, with a bachelor&#8217;s in biology. He had helped organize a conference that Pimm attended as &#8220;one of the VIPs,&#8221; Palacio recalled. On field trips, Palacio volunteered as a bird guide, and the two biologists talked over several days. Eventually, Pimm suggested Palacio join him as a PhD student at Duke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palacio was impressed. The following year he traveled to Durham, North Carolina, with a Fulbright scholarship under his belt.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just thrilled to be his student,&#8221; Palacio wrote on X.</p>



<p>At Duke, Palacio set to work on a project mapping the distribution of bird species. The research was meant to help the organization <a href="https://abcbirds.org/">American Bird Conservancy</a> do conservation work in Ecuador, Palacio said, and Pimm wanted him to use <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00798.x">a method Pimm had published</a> in 2008, known as a geospatial workflow. Essentially, this is a series of steps to follow to find out where a species lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm&#8217;s method relied on expert-drawn maps and had been <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12801">criticized</a> by other scientists. Palacio wasn&#8217;t happy with it. He suggested improving the protocol by creating a new workflow based instead on data of bird sightings. It took a long time to convince his then-advisor his idea was sound, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell Stuart like, hey, we can do better, we can do something much nicer than your old protocol,&#8221; Palacio said. &#8220;That took a lot of finesse, because, you know, his ego is like, over the sky.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;I have all the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/research-misconduct-email-exchanges.pdf">emails, very detailed</a>, showing how I came up with the idea, and how [Pimm] wasn&#8217;t even aware we could do this.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But the work on the new method dragged out, and they were running behind schedule, Palacio said. The delays created tension between the student and his professor. As Palacio explained to the assistant director of the school’s PhD programs in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-email-to-Wiggins_2020-01-14.png">email from October 2019</a>, he felt “very anxious and stressed” by the pressure he alleged Pimm was putting on him.</p>



<p>One day, Palacio said, Pimm had invited him for lunch at the cafeteria where the school’s faculty eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I started walking with him and then he goes, ‘Ruben, you will never graduate with a PhD from Duke,’&#8221; Palacio recalled Pimm saying. &#8220;He&#8217;s like, ‘You don&#8217;t work hard enough. You need to put in 16, 18 hours a day of work.’&#8221;</p>



<p>When they sat down to eat, Palacio said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t even swallow. And he was like, &#8216;Just remember that just with one email I send to Fulbright, I can terminate your scholarship.'&#8221;</p>



<p>After Palacio confronted Pimm about the high levels of stress he was experiencing, his advisor wrote in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Part-of-email-from-Stuart-Pimm-dated-January-5-2020.jpg">email on January 5, 2020</a>,<strong> </strong>that Palacio had “played a ‘health card’ … which very strongly limits my options. Duke very clearly prohibits me from stressing you. So, were you to wish to remain in my programme, you would need to assert categorically that the progress I expect from you will not stress you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That progress “would likely involve very long days, seven days a week for at least the next three weeks,” Pimm wrote in the email. (This passage is part of a longer email that was pasted into in a harassment complaint Palacio filed with Duke. Palacio said he no longer has the full email after his Duke account was closed.)</p>



<p>Pimm declined to &#8220;make specific comments about Ruben&#8221; to Retraction Watch, but pointed out that, &#8220;I alone am not empowered to make the decision as to whether a student remains within Duke or retains a scholarship.&#8221; He added that he had &#8220;found the quality of [Palacio&#8217;s] work lacking.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the lunch with Pimm, Palacio decided he needed to change labs. He received help from university counselors to navigate the situation, which he said had left his mental health in tatters. He also complained about Pimm to Duke, but the school found no fault with the professor&#8217;s behavior, according to both Palacio and Pimm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm attracted controversy in the past for<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/21/i-dont-take-whores-in-taxis-casual-sexism-in-scientific-journal-leads-to-editors-note/"> using misogynistic language</a> in a book review, as we reported in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duke did not respond to phone calls or repeated emails requesting comments.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 7, 2020, Palacio met with his advisor to follow up on the email and discuss how to move forward. In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/last_interaction_with_Stuart.mp3">recording</a> of the conversation that Palacio made without Pimm&#8217;s knowledge and later shared with Duke, Pimm can be heard calling his student&#8217;s writing &#8220;inexcusably incompetent&#8221; and complaining that Palacio was two months behind on his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm repeatedly threatened to terminate Palacio if he did not promptly deliver a number of updates on the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t handle that and turn around some results by this time tomorrow, then I will fire you,&#8221; he told his student. &#8220;If I fire you, I promise you it will look bad on you. Right? So I don&#8217;t want any more bloody excuses from you. If you can&#8217;t do that stuff on that kind of schedule, you need to resign.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Palacio explained that he already found a new advisor, the conversation returned to Palacio&#8217;s research. Pimm told his student that if he sent updated results within &#8220;a couple of days,&#8221; he would &#8220;get senior authorship&#8221; of the ensuing manuscript.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should you choose not to do that, I can promise you that I have the firepower with your former colleagues to recreate that stuff in a matter of a few days. And we will produce that work and we will publish it and you won&#8217;t have any say in that whatsoever,&#8221; Pimm said, continuing:</p>



<p>&#8220;So the other decision you need to make … is what you propose to do with that [research]. If you move that work forward at a pace that I find acceptable, then I will continue to let you lead it. If you don&#8217;t, I will simply take all of that stuff away and you&#8217;ll have to use the other ideas that you have in the community.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked about his threats to take away the research Palacio had been leading and publishing it without his former student, Pimm said: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his work. He was offered a project. He didn&#8217;t complete it. His work on that project was inadequate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palacio was crying and shaking when he finally left Pimm&#8217;s office, he recalled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was probably one of the toughest times in my life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing with the PhDs. Like, your advisor has so much power over you and you feel helpless at the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>Responding to Palacio&#8217;s thread on X, a number of scientists expressed sympathy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This sounds like a massive power abuse situation rather than &#8220;just&#8221; plagiarism. What&#8217;s the University doing now?&#8221; one<a href="https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya/status/1685532771538640896"> data scientist</a> asked, while <a href="https://twitter.com/D_Pattemore/status/1685026176828588032">an ecologist argued</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;This type of bullying &amp; unethical behaviour is far too common in academia; we need to hear more stories like this. I too looked up to Pimm but later realised how lucky I was that I ended up at a different lab for my PhD.&#8221;</p>



<p>On X, Palacio also posted screenshots of <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955078048837633/photo/2">an exchange</a> he had with one of Pimm&#8217;s coauthors, who told him: &#8220;I&#8217;m not proud of this, of the way &#8216;we&#8217; kicked you out and took your idea, and also because I never really said anything to the others involved.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coauthor, whose name Palacio redacted, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955078048837633/photo/1">said</a> they had &#8220;alerted people about your [preprint], and Stuart Pimm explained that the methods were sufficiently different to still go ahead. I did not know at that time that you had left his group, that this was your project and that you were not involved in it.&#8221; (The identity of the coauthor is known to Retraction Watch, but they asked not to be named as they did not have full knowledge of the case, they said.) </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ryan Huang, a researcher in Pimm&#8217;s lab and first author of the <em>PLOS ONE</em> paper, also contested the plagiarism accusations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ruben did not make any contribution to our paper,&#8221; he told Retraction Watch. &#8220;The shared intellectual history of ideas accounts for the similarities Ruben uses as evidence for his claims.&#8221;</p>



<p>Huang said that while he had been aware of Palacio&#8217;s preprint, he had not read it &#8220;for the explicit purpose that I did not want to cross-contaminate ideas, but I also told Ruben that we would not cite a pre-print as it was not peer-reviewed.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the acknowledgments of his papers, Palacio thanked Pimm and Huang &#8220;for suggestions during the initial development of the geospatial workflow.&#8221; But he stood by his claim that the new method was his creation and said his preprint created &#8220;scientific precedence&#8221; and should have been cited.</p>



<p>Pimm and his coauthors, Palacio argued, &#8220;could have said, OK, we developed this workflow based on Palacio and colleagues, or we looked into Palacio and colleagues and we think their protocol is shit, so we came up with another one. That&#8217;s what you do in the sciences.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palacio said Duke investigated his research-misconduct complaint against Pimm, but that the school would not share its findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duke has <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/913283?form=fpf">drawn criticism</a> in the past for not responding adequately to cases <a href="https://cancerletter.com/free/20150109_1/">involving potential research misconduct</a>. Following <a href="https://cancerletter.com/free/20150109_1/">several incidents</a> at the university, in 2019 the U.S. National Institutes of Health suspended a number of grants to the institution due to concerns about “clinical research irregularities” that could affect patient safety. The same year, the university settled a lawsuit with the U.S. federal government for a <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910871">record $112.5 million</a> after researchers were accused of using fake data in grant applications.</p>



<p>In an email concerning its investigation of Pimm, Duke told Palacio:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are not able to provide you with a report due to the confidentiality requirements of our policies; we can only provide the outcome, which was the comment added to the PlosOne [sic] publication noted below.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment to which the statement refers was posted in April by Huang and Pimm under &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259299">Reader Comments</a>&#8221; on the <em>PLOS ONE</em> paper website. It has since disappeared, but Palacio <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955038156832769/photo/1">posted a screenshot</a> of it on X.</p>



<p>Titled &#8220;Similar Work,&#8221; it read, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On behalf of the authors, we want to inform the readership and research community about a closely related journal article published shortly before ours.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment also provided links to Palacio&#8217;s journal paper and the preprint. According to Pimm:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Ruben’s paper appeared three weeks before ours appeared and well after the final version of our paper had been accepted. As a courtesy, we agreed to notice his paper having been published and the university was happy with our doing that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never really seen anything like that before,&#8221; Palacio said about the “Similar Work” comment. He added that he has asked <em>PLOS ONE</em> to retract the paper and that the journal told him it would investigate his allegations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the publisher declined to comment on the specific case, but said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In principle, comments may be used to inform readers of related work that has not been cited in a PLOS article. Whether a comment would be a suitable [sic] for this purpose depends on case-specific details such as the relative publication date(s), the relationship of the related work to the PLOS publication, and whether the related work introduces editorial or ethics concerns that need to be addressed by a different means.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for the missing comment, the spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Based on PLOS records, the comment appears to have been removed in error due to a technical issue with the commenting system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After leaving Pimm&#8217;s group, Palacio said, he completed his doctorate in 2022 at <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/clark">another lab</a> at Duke that he described as a &#8220;much better environment.&#8221; He is now back in Colombia heading the conservation non-profit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fundacionecotonos?locale=es_LA">Fundación Ecotonos</a> and is about to publish a &#8220;great paper&#8221; in a top ecology journal with his second advisor.</p>



<p>It was “sort of a happy ending for me,&#8221; he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-star-tidal-waves-astronomy">This extreme star might have huge tidal waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like ocean surf smashing on a sandy beach, enormous waves of plasma may crash onto the surface of one massive star.</p>



<p>The star is part of a pair, stretched and pulled by its companion’s gravity. That gravitational tug-of-war causes the star’s brightness to change drastically and rhythmically. Now, a computer simulation suggests that this steady heartbeat of starlight <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02036-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is caused by giant tidal waves undulating and breaking on the star’s surface</a>, researchers report August 10 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. The height of the waves could be up to three times the diameter of the sun.</p>





<p>“It’s quite rare to see these really kind of dramatic but transformative moments in action,” says astrophysicist Morgan MacLeod of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>The star system, dubbed MACHO 80.7443.1718, sits about 160,000 light-years away from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It hosts one visible star that is 35 times the mass of the sun and another unseen star of at least 10 solar masses. About once a month, as they orbit each other, they pass near enough that gravitational forces raise tides on both stars’ surfaces, scientists suspect, much the way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/matter-gravity-0">the moon tugs on Earth’s oceans</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/11</em>).</p>



<p>On the stars, though, that tug would be substantially more extreme. “Instead of being a few meters tall, [the tide] can be 10 percent of the diameter of the star” that’s visible, says astrophysicist Jim Fuller of Caltech, who was not part of the study. On a star as big as that visible star — about 24 times as wide as the sun — that corresponds to a tidal wave roughly 3.3 million kilometers tall.</p>



<p>The new study, Fuller says, “shows how complicated and interesting the dynamics get when you have an extreme system like this.”</p>



<p>Astronomers can’t see the shapes of these stars through a telescope, but they can track how the brighter star’s light changes over time. While the brightness of most known “heartbeat stars” changes by about a tenth of a percent, the brightness of this system changes by 20 percent.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stellar dance</h4>



<p>Roughly once a month, two stars about 160,000 light-years away from Earth pass close enough to one another that gravitational forces should raise tides in the plasma on both stars’ surfaces. A computer simulation (shown) suggests that the gravitational tug-of-war raises enormous tides in the plasma on the larger star&#8217;s surface.</p>

Loeb/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>MacLeod wanted to know how the dynamics of this star system lead to those visible changes. So he and Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb simulated how plasma moves on and between these stars as they orbit one another.</p>



<p>The waves can get big enough that they actually break and crash across the brighter star’s surface, the study suggests. When an ocean wave is far from shore, it’s a rolling, undulating wave. But as it comes closer to shore, it rises and collapses on itself. “Something kind of parallel is happening here,” MacLeod says. The top of the wave steepens, “gets out of phase with the bottom, and it folds over on itself, and it crashes.”</p>





<p>After it crashes on the stellar surface, he says, “debris that&#8217;s thrown off is fed into this atmosphere around the star,” like the foamy surf left behind on a beach. As the waves crash, energy is lost. That crashing, the study suggests, causes the stars’ orbits to shrink, meaning eventually these stars could collide and possibly merge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expect-coronavirus-fall-endemic-variants">What should we expect from the coronavirus this fall?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across the United States, thousands of people with COVID-19 are being hospitalized each week and the number is steadily trending up — a sure sign that overall cases have also been on the rise.</p>



<p>Levels of detectable coronavirus in wastewater samples and the proportion of tests that come back positive have certainly been ticking up since June, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Both metrics indicate rising cases at the national level, albeit indirectly. It’s hard to get a good grasp of the start of new surges or know what’s happening within communities, in part because states are no longer required to report new cases, a result of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">the U.S. public health emergency ending in May</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/23</em>).</p>





<p>We do know the worst of the pandemic is largely behind us. While the virus can, and does, still spread far and wide, its transmission isn’t the overwhelming crush that characterized the pandemic’s first years.</p>



<p>Amid a backdrop of ever-evolving variants — including a new version of omicron designated BA.2.86 that is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-tracks-new-lineage-virus-that-causes-covid-2023-08-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under close watch</a> from global and U.S. health agencies — most infections are now less deadly than the pandemic’s early days. Data from blood banks show that as of September 2022, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7222a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 96 percent of people in the United States had been vaccinated</a>, infected with the virus or both, which can help reduce the severity of future infections. And, a new booster shot — designed to target relatives of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">a viral lineage dubbed XBB</a> — should be available at the end of September (<em>SN: 1/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>Even with those rays of hope, our future with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, is unclear. The virus is not going anywhere; new variants will continue to appear with varying degrees of infectiousness and severity. How many people might fall ill or die on average each year? We don’t know.</p>



<p>Answering that question requires the virus to have entered its endemic phase — when it regularly circulates at some baseline amount. Even then, endemic does not mean benign. In that phase, people will still get sick with COVID, some severely so. But far fewer will land in the hospital or die in a “normal” year than during the pandemic years.</p>



<p>To see if this fall — our fourth with COVID and the first without a public health emergency in place — could possibly be the start of the coronavirus’ endemic phase, <em>Science News </em>spoke with epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How are things different this fall than in previous years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One of the big differences … is that at this point pretty much everybody … has some sort of immunity against SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<p>A majority of people have hybrid immunity, meaning that most people in the United States, or a good chunk of them, have been not only vaccinated but had an infection. For a majority of people that did not choose to get vaccinated, most of those individuals have been infected a few times. And some of the people who were vaccinated have been infected a few times.</p>



<p>What that means is that we have a higher level of immunity against the virus. Obviously, that’s not preventing people from getting infected or reinfected. But it’s certainly helping to reduce the severity of those infections when they happen.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What have we learned about what reinfections tend to look like?</strong></p>





<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> They tend to be a lot milder than a first infection. But severe reinfections still do occur. And when you talk about severe, you’re not only thinking about fatal infections, which are of course the most severe, but also infections that cause hospitalization or may cause long-term symptoms.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>A new booster this fall will replace the omicron variant with a new one. Is it important to get this booster?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think booster shots are definitely advised, particularly for individuals who are more likely to have severe disease.</p>



<p>I had really hoped that we would have arrived at a point where SARS-CoV-2 was looking like a seasonal coronavirus, one that causes symptoms of the common cold, and was therefore less severe than influenza. What we’re still seeing for SARS-CoV-2 is that it is more severe than flu. It’s still causing a lot more deaths on an annual basis than flu is causing. I’d say it’s not clear if we’ve gotten to the fully endemic level yet [when transmission falls into an average range from year to year].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Where do you think we are on the spectrum between pandemic and endemic?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> I think we’re getting pretty close to what endemic will look like. I don’t know if we’ll be fully at that level for this next season, or if it might take another season or two for us to get there.</p>



<p>I will say that I’m kind of hoping we’re not at the endemic level yet. At least based on last year, because there were a substantial number of deaths in the United States — 244,000 was the CDC estimate. It’s four or five times higher than a severe seasonal influenza season in the United States.</p>



<p>But [COVID disease severity] has been trending downward over the last many months. The hope would be that we continue to see that downward trend in the number of severe and fatal cases. If [COVID] had hit its endemic level, we would expect some season-to-season fluctuations, but it’d be fluctuating around that number rather than continuing a downward trend of being less and less severe.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Have researchers learned anything over the past year about what endemic might look like?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think we’re zeroing in on what endemic will look like. It’s, I think, become fairly clear that this is going to be a regular infection that people may get more often than flu. Maybe the virus will start changing less. For adults [who are more likely than kids to get severely ill], it is probably looking like it’s going to [be as dangerous as] influenza if not [more dangerous]. We will see for sure.</p>



<p>I had thought that everybody would need maybe a vaccination and then one or two infections to get at whatever the endemic level would be. It’s possible that you need a little bit broader immunity [to protect against more variants of the virus] and more exposures to hit that endemic level.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What do you think experts might learn this fall?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One thing that we’ll look at this fall is how different it is from last fall. Because if we’re still seeing a downward trajectory, then maybe we haven’t yet hit the endemic level. Or we may see something that looks quite similar to last fall, which would tell us that perhaps we’ve arrived at that endemic level.</p>



<p>There is season-to-season variability, there are differences in variants, and we have new variants arising, which will all contribute on a yearly basis to how severe the SARS-CoV-2 season is. We have that for flu. CDC estimates for recent flu seasons, excluding the pandemic ones, were anywhere from 12,000 to 52,000 deaths a year. That’s quite a bit of variability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-distant-galaxies-surprises-space">JWST’s hunt for distant galaxies keeps turning up surprises</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When Brant Robertson saw a new measurement of the distance to a familiar galaxy, he laughed out loud.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the galaxy had been a contender for the most distant ever observed. In 2012, Robertson and colleagues used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to show that the galaxy’s light had shone across the universe from about 13.3 billion years ago — less than 400 million years into the universe’s existence.</p>



<p>Not everyone believed it. “We got a lot of flak,” recalls Robertson, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It seemed too implausible that it was at such a great distance.” It felt like he was going around claiming to have seen the Loch Ness monster.</p>





<p>But in September, the James Webb Space Telescope, JWST for short, aimed its massive mirror and sensitive spectrograph at the same galaxy and showed that Robertson and his colleagues were right. The galaxy’s light is indeed incredibly old, dating to just 390 million years after the Big Bang. It was like someone had drained the lake, and the monster was sitting there at the bottom.</p>



<p>And this galactic Nessie is not alone. So far, in its first year of observations, JWST has turned up thousands of distant galaxies dating to the early universe, many more than astronomers had expected. Some of those galaxies are brighter, more massive or more mature than astronomers would have thought. They are now scratching their heads trying to explain how the galaxies could have grown up so fast.</p>

<p>A lot of the extreme distances still need to be confirmed, but initial evidence suggests there’s reason to believe that many, if not most, of the galaxies really are that far away.</p>



<p>“I was expecting to find some galaxies at this [distance]. Some people were pessimistic; I wasn’t,” says Steven Finkelstein, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. “But I was not this optimistic. I thought, ‘Yeah, yeah, we know what we’re going to see.’ And I was wrong.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Hubble Space Telescope&#8217;s distant galaxies</h4>



<p>For longtime galaxy hunters, JWST’s bounty may feel like déjà vu. In the 1990s, Hubble took a long, deep look at an apparently blank patch of sky, just to see what was there. The result was thousands of galaxies, some captured as they looked when the universe was only a billion years old.</p>



<p>Those galaxies looked mature, like they had already been through multiple rounds of supernova explosions and star formation. Thus, they were not the first to form in the universe, astronomers realized. The first galaxies must date even further back.</p>



<p>The hunt for those original galaxies was part of the motivation for building JWST, says astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado Boulder. “The reason we have JWST is, they launched Hubble and saw that the things in the early universe were very evolved,” she says. “They were like, ‘Wow! There are galaxies way earlier than we thought’ ” — even further back in time than Hubble can see.</p>



<p>Hubble wasn’t designed to see all the way back to the universe’s beginning. The telescope is sensitive to ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths of light. But by the time light from the universe’s early days reaches us, it has stretched all the way into infrared wavelengths that are longer than Hubble’s (or human) eyes can see. That’s because the universe is expanding; everything in it is moving away from everything else. And as light sources move away from us, their light stretches — the wavelengths of light grow longer, or redder.</p>





<p>The amount of stretching of that light, known as the redshift, is astronomers’ proxy for cosmic distance and age. The present-day universe is at redshift zero. A redshift of 1 corresponds to about 6 billion years after the Big Bang. A redshift of 4 is about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, and so on.</p>



<p>In 1995, redshift 4 was the furthest back that Hubble could detect. Over the next 20 years, upgrades to the telescope and new observing techniques pushed the frontier back to redshift 7, which corresponds to 800 million years after the Big Bang. In 2012, the galaxy that Robertson studied appeared at a possible, though at the time unconfirmed, redshift of 11.9. Later, a galaxy called GN-z11 clocked in at a redshift of 11.1, or 400 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>These tantalizing discoveries set off a search for even more distant galaxies. “This has kind of become a game in extragalactic astronomy, where everyone wants to find the highest redshift, most distant galaxy,” astrophysicist Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York said in April in Minneapolis at an American Physical Society meeting. “Become the new record holder, right? It’s fun.”</p>



<p>By 2016, when GN-z11 was discovered, the hunt had stalled. Astronomers had wrung everything they could out of existing technology.</p>



<p>“It really requires JWST to push to even earlier times,” Kartaltepe said, “which we need to understand the very beginnings of galaxy formation.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why astronomers want to find early galaxies</h4>



<p>The quest to find the earliest galaxies is about more than just bragging rights. These galaxies could shed light on a key event in the universe’s infancy called reionization.</p>



<p>In the beginning, there was the Big Bang. After that initial cataclysm, the universe continued to expand and cool. After about 372,000 years, it had cooled enough for electrons, protons and neutrons to combine into hydrogen atoms. That hydrogen gas was diffuse and opaque, plunging the universe into what astronomers call the cosmic dark ages.</p>



<p>Sometime during these dark ages, the first stars formed and began to clump together into galaxies with the help of an invisible and still mysterious material known as dark matter. But because of the opacity of that neutral hydrogen, all astronomers can really observe is that the universe became transparent again at about 200 million years after the Big Bang, as hydrogen atoms lost their electrons.</p>



<p>“We know there was a transition where the hydrogen was reionized somehow,” Robertson says. Thanks to observations with Hubble and other telescopes, “we think galaxies are very likely the agents of that process,” he says. Light from the youngest, most massive stars in those early galaxies might have knocked electrons off atoms in the hydrogen gas between galaxies. “But how that process unfolds, we have relatively little information on,” Robertson says.</p>



<p>JWST can help fill in those details. Taking a census of the galaxies that were around during the era of reionization could help illuminate how it got started.</p>



<p>And so, astronomers were giddy with excitement when JWST launched on Christmas Day in 2021 and started collecting data about six months later.<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa"> The first images</a> were unveiled with great fanfare on July 12, 2022 (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>). But astronomers had to wait until the next day to download the rest of the data the telescope had acquired while getting up and running.</p>



<p>“We knew, somewhere, on some computer, our photons were sitting there, waiting for us to see them,” Kartaltepe said. “As soon as the data were released in July, we jumped on it and started analyzing.”</p>



<p>Astronomers sifted through the images like a cosmic Where’s Waldo, picking the reddest-looking candidate galaxies out of the pack.</p>



<p>Extremely distant candidates popped out quickly. In several different regions of the sky, JWST found little red dots corresponding to galaxies that appeared to be at astonishing redshifts: 10, 13, even 17. Some of the galaxies seemed small and dim, as expected. But others looked big and bright, suggesting they were heftier than astronomers would expect for such early galaxies.</p>



<p>“These galaxies, they’re just at phenomenal distances. It’s a little hard to swallow,” Robertson said in June in Cambridge, Mass., at the JWST First Light Conference. “But it’s really important to actually confirm the distances to these very, very distant galaxies, and then learn about their properties.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The most distant galaxy ever confirmed</h4>



<p>Most of the cosmic distances reported for JWST galaxies so far have been preliminary estimates based on data from the telescope’s cameras. The cameras scan broad areas of sky and use filters to let in certain wavelengths of light. These filters allow astronomers to estimate “photometric” redshifts.</p>



<p>But to know for sure how far away a galaxy really is, astronomers need to use JWST’s spectrograph. A redshift calculated from a galaxy’s full spectrum of light uses 1,000 data points compared with a photometric redshift’s seven data points.</p>



<p>“Until we have spectra, nothing is ironclad,” Nelson says.</p>



<p>As part of a project called the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, Robertson and colleagues collected spectra for four galaxies with photometric redshifts higher than 10 — likely close to the beginning of the era of reionization. One of the galaxies was the one Robertson studied in 2012. The distance of that galaxy, now known as JADES-GS-z11-0, was downgraded a bit, from a redshift of 11.9 to 11.58. But with one of the other galaxies, the team claimed a new record for most distant galaxy ever confirmed, with a redshift of 13.2, just 325 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The spectra the team analyzed were detailed enough to reveal some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01921-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">properties of the galaxies</a>, Robertson and colleagues reported in April in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. They’re all about a hundredth the size and mass of the Milky Way, but they are forming stars at a comparable rate — a lot of stars for galaxies this small. All those newborn stars produce a lot of ionizing radiation, meaning it’s possible these galaxies could be some of the earliest agents of reionization, Robertson says.</p>



<p>JADES has since reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 700 more galaxies</a> whose photometric redshifts place them at redshift 8 or greater, or less than 650 million years after the Big Bang, Robertson said at the June First Light meeting. Those galaxies’ distances still need to be confirmed, but the sheer numbers are amazing. “We’re really in a remarkable age,” Robertson said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Trusting JWST&#8217;s measurements</h4>



<p>The huge galaxy haul raises another question: How many of them are likely to be at such great distances?</p>



<p>A potential record-breaking galaxy called CEERS-93316 is a cautionary tale. The galaxy was identified in JWST images taken for the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science, or CEERS, survey. Those images put the galaxy at a photometric redshift of 16.4, or just 240 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>“That was higher redshift than we expected to see with CEERS,” says Finkelstein, the survey’s lead researcher. CEERS was designed to practice using JWST in its different observing modes and give astronomers some data to play with, not necessarily to set new records.</p>



<p>In its first chunk of data, CEERS contained a surprising number of apparently high-redshift galaxies. So Finkelstein and colleagues asked the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates JWST, for some extra telescope time to chase down the spectra of CEERS-93316, as well as a galaxy that Finkelstein had found with a photometric redshift of about 12. He named that galaxy Maisie’s Galaxy in honor of his daughter, because he found it on her ninth birthday. (Maisie didn’t mind that her dad had to work that day — “I got other birthday presents,” she says, though she did wish her galaxy was the potential record holder.)</p>



<p>When the spectral data came through, Finkelstein’s colleague Pablo Arrabal Haro, an astrophysicist at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, based in Tucson, worked through the weekend to write up results before anyone else.</p>



<p>CEERS-93316’s 16.4 redshift turned out to be wrong. The galaxy was actually at a redshift of 4.9, putting it 1.2&nbsp;billion years after the Big Bang — practically modern compared with some of JWST’s other finds.</p>



<p>The galaxy’s photometric redshift was so high because of a weird coincidence. Light streaming from hydrogen in the galaxy was redshifted such that it looked like it jumped in brightness at a wavelength suggestive of the huge distance. But when the full spectrum came in, that single jump was revealed to be several separate peaks, suggesting a smaller redshift.</p>



<p>Maisie’s Galaxy, however, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost as distant as the photometric redshift implied</a>, Arrabal Haro and colleagues reported in a paper posted in March to arXiv.org. And in an April paper posted to arXiv.org, the team reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectra for more than 30 other galaxies</a> with redshifts of roughly between 8 and 10. So photometric redshift estimates are generally reliable, Finkelstein says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Timeline of early galaxies</h3>



<p>JWST has detected many galaxies from the early universe (a few are shown on this timeline). These galaxies could shed light on reionization, the process that ended the cosmic dark ages, when the universe was shrouded in darkness. Some of these galaxies, the “universe breakers,” appear to be more massive than theory can explain.</p>

<p>“Although we have this notable failure case, that’s a pathological case,” he says. It’s “not devastating.”</p>



<p>That’s good news for JWST’s observing schedule: Astronomers won’t have to follow up with the full spectrum for every distant galaxy. They can believe that most of the redshifts are legit and save the extra effort of taking the full spectrum for the really interesting ones. “It is exciting that the photometric redshifts tend to hold up,” Robertson says. “It gives us some hope that some of these really distant things could be real.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Distant galaxies too bright to explain</h4>



<p>Another outcome of JWST analyses so far is that there are more bright galaxies around redshift 10 than expected. Galaxy brightness is an indicator of galaxy mass, and thus star abundance. The brighter the galaxy, the more stars it must have to produce all that light.</p>



<p>Galaxies are born in halos of dark matter, whose gravity pulls in and concentrates ordinary matter. Cosmologists know from simulations and theory how many dark matter halos the universe would have had when the first galaxies formed. They also have a decent idea of how massive those halos were in the universe’s first 500 million years and how much of that mass ended up in the form of hydrogen and helium, the raw material for making stars. Theoretically, if all that gas turned into stars, the largest a galaxy could get would be about 10 billion times the mass of the sun.</p>



<p>In reality, researchers expect early galaxies to be much less massive, because modern galaxies never convert all their gas into stars.</p>



<p>JWST has not turned up any galaxy near the theoretical upper limit. But it has found many more hefty early galaxies than predicted. The confirmed JADES galaxies weigh in at about 100 million solar masses, just 330 million years after the Big Bang. Some of the CEERS galaxies seem to have over a billion suns’ worth of stars as early as 450 million years after the Big Bang. Two galaxies discovered in another JWST survey, called COSMOS-Web, appear to be about 5 billion solar masses as early as 350 million years after the Big Bang, astronomer Caitlin Casey of the University of Texas at Austin said at the June First Light meeting.</p>



<p>“With these massive beacons, you can test the limits of how fast you can assemble that much matter in the short time between the Big Bang and the time that we’re observing them in,” she says.</p>



<p>What astronomers find from these galaxies could point to where our existing understanding of galaxy formation is wrong. Or researchers might discover that some of the galaxies’ light doesn’t come directly from stars but instead from the ionized gas in between stars that are actively forming, Casey says. That would mean the galaxies aren’t actually as massive as they look.</p>



<p>Finding out how early galaxies were put together is the first step to understanding our own galaxy, Robertson says. “That’s ultimately what drives a lot of galaxy formation research, is trying to understand how our home, the thing that’s important to us, the place that we live, came to be,” he says. “We’re never going to complete that full story without looking at how galaxies at redshift 10 were put together…. That’s the starting place for how we got here.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking the universe &#8230; or not</h4>



<p>One set of galaxies has sparked debate over not just galaxy formation, but the theoretical foundations of the universe itself.</p>



<p>In February, Nelson and colleagues reported six galaxies spotted with CEERS that seem to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">grown so big, so fast</a> that they directly challenge the standard theory of how structure forms in the universe (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). These galaxies have photometric redshifts between about 7 and 9, meaning they grew up in the first 800 million years of the universe. But their stellar masses appear to rival or exceed that of the Milky Way, about 60 billion solar masses.</p>



<p>Nelson affectionately calls them the “universe breakers.” Nothing that massive should have been able to form that fast, she says. “As soon as we saw it, we were like, this is bananas.”</p>



<p>Barely enough ordinary matter is even believed to have existed back then to create the universe breakers, says astrophysicist Mike Boylan-Kolchin of the University of Texas at Austin. Regions where budding galaxies formed would have had to turn all their atoms into stars.</p>

LABBÉ/SWINBURNE UNIV. OF TECHNOLOGY; IMAGE PROCESSING: G. BRAMMER/COSMIC DAWN CENTER/NIELS BOHR INSTITUTE/UNIV. OF COPENHAGEN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“We have this reservoir of atoms,” he says. “Almost every single one of them has to be in stars or in galaxies” if the universe breakers are for real. “If these observations and their interpretation is correct … it’s very hard to accommodate them in our current models,” he says.</p>



<p>Over the last few months, theorists have come up with several ways to explain the universe breakers. One of the most dramatic options would be to add some extra dark energy, the mysterious substance that drives the universe to expand faster and faster, to the early universe, which would speed up all sorts of cosmic processes.</p>



<p>“That would go in the right direction here, in the sense that there’d be bigger reservoirs [of atoms] and maybe more of them at earlier times,” Boylan-Kolchin says. “These early dark energy models do predict faster evolution of structure at early times.”</p>



<p>More mundane options include super-compact early galaxies that could have converted all their gas into stars before the oldest stars had a chance to go supernova and blow it away. <em>S</em>uch efficient star formation <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/523/3/3201/7179993?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could explain the universe breakers without breaking the universe</a>, physicist Avishai Dekel of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and colleagues suggested in a paper published May 25 in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</em></p>



<p>And there’s still the question of whether the universe breakers’ masses and distances will hold up. A spectrum of one of them has already revealed it to be a galaxy at redshift 5.6 with an actively feeding black hole creating extra light — so not a universe breaker after all.</p>



<p>JWST’s second observing cycle began in July, and Nelson will take spectra of the rest of the universe breakers to find out if they are truly abounding with stars, filled with black holes or something else.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another group of astronomers will test JWST’s limits, hunting for galaxies at redshift 15 or greater. So by the telescope’s second birthday next summer, there may be new distance records.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recoiling-black-hole-gravitational-wave">Recoiling black holes could move at nearly one-tenth the speed of light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collisions between black holes can launch newly melded cosmic sinkholes at speeds up to <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9907aYe8M851ac75f7126235be144786cbb957515#:~:text=This%20spin%20sequence%20for%20s,10%%20the%20speed%20of%20light" data-type="URL" data-id="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9907aYe8M851ac75f7126235be144786cbb957515#:~:text=This%20spin%20sequence%20for%20s,10%%20the%20speed%20of%20light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-tenth the speed of light</a>, researchers report August 18 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Moving that fast — about 28,500 kilometers per second — it would take about 13 seconds to complete the average trip from Earth to the moon. The findings may help researchers figure out how much energy can get released when black holes converge.</p>



<p>Black holes merge after coming so close together that they become ensnared in each other’s gravitational pull. The couple enters a cosmic waltz, spiraling ever tighter and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">stirring up ripples in spacetime</a> known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 6/28/23; SN: 1/21/21</em>).</p>





<p>If the pair’s convergence blows gravitational waves preferentially in one direction, then the emerging black hole will recoil in the opposite direction at high speed, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">kickback from a gun</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Previous research had indicated the blowback from such twisting mergers could hurl black holes at up to about <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.231102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,000 kilometers per second</a>. For the new study, astrophysicists Carlos Lousto and James Healy, of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, probed black hole interactions that were more head-on, akin to particles zipping towards each other in a particle accelerator.</p>



<p>The duo simulated more than 1,300 approaches. These included close flybys, direct collisions and everything in between. The mashups that almost didn’t happen — grazing collisions that still resulted in merging — produced the fastest recoiling black holes, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Such collisions might be possible with three or more black holes, Lousto says. “Two black holes orbiting in opposite directions around a larger black hole might eventually collide,” he explains, dispatching their descendant with the quickest of quick kicks.</p>

<p>The overall winning image depicts bright orange fruiting bodies growing on deadwood in the Australian rainforest and was taken by Cornelia Sattler from Macquarie University, Australia. The orange pore fungus was first observed in Madagascar but is now found throughout the world. Previous research has reported that invasive species, such as the European rabbit, root rot fungus and feral pigs, threaten 82% of Australian species at risk of extinction. As a result, Australia has particularly strict rules about bringing plants, animals, and organic matter into the country. Cornelia Sattler said: “Despite its innocent and beautiful appearance, the orange pore fungus is an invasive species that displaces other fungi and is spreading throughout the Australian rainforest. It is important to closely monitor this fungus, whose spores are often transported by humans, in order to safeguard the biodiversity of Australia.” Senior Editorial Board Member Arne Traulsen recommended the entry, saying: “Cornelia Sattler’s image allows us to peek into the world of fungi, organisms that are fascinating and yet underappreciated and understudied.”</p>

<p>Victor Huertas from James Cook University, Australia took the winning image for the Research in Action category. The photograph depicts the deployment of an underwater remotely operated vehicle at Coral Sea Marine Park, Australia. The device is used to survey oceans at depths that are beyond the reach of divers and has been used to discover new species in reefs and expand the known geographic range of multiple fish species. Senior Editorial Board Member Luke Jacobus said: “This photograph captures the essence of ecological study.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The runner-up for the ‘Research in action’ category captured a moment as researchers conduct a necropsy on a stranded humpback whale that, unfortunately, had passed away. Professor Paul Thompson from the University of Aberdeen in the UK, who submitted the photo taken by James Bunyan from Tracks Ecology explains, “Post whaling recovery of North Atlantic humpback whale populations has led to increases in sightings of this species in UK coastal waters, but this also raises the risk of entanglement in coastal waters. In May 2023, a young humpback whale became stranded in Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve in NE Scotland, drawing the attention of the scientific community. This site has been the focus of long-term photographic studies of harbour seals by the University of Aberdeen, most recently working in collaboration with Tracks Ecology to use UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) photography to identify and measure individual seals from this population. Colleagues from the University of Glasgow’s Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme conducted a necropsy of this whale, confirming drowning following entanglement was the most likely cause of death. This image was drawn from a series captured by UAV photography, documenting the necropsy and producing a 3-D model of the whale using photogrammetric techniques that were developed to study the size structure of the seal population.” This photo depicts researchers collaborating to further our understanding of the challenges faced by these magnificent creatures.</span></p>

Victor explains that “Professor Rummer leads Physioshark, a research team headquartered at James Cook University in Australia, that investigates the impact of climate change on the physiological performance of newborn sharks in tropical shark nurseries. These habitats typically occur in shallow waters and are therefore highly exposed to rising temperatures and lower oxygen concentrations. The Physioshark team is untangling the challenges newborn sharks face in such rapidly changing environmental conditions. Professor Rummer and her students have so far been able to show how despite the burden climate change  is placing on the physiology of young sharks, these are displaying an exceptional resilience to these changes, giving scientists hope that they will be able to adjust to a warming ocean.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The winning image of the &#8216;Paleoecology&#8217; category, submitted by Jordan Mallon from the Canadian Museum of Nature, has highlighted the incredible work<a href="https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/palaeontology-in-a-pandemic-remote-research-on-dinosaur-eggs-and-embryos?channel_id=behind-the-paper"> a group of trans-Pacific palaeontologists completed remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Jordan&#8217;s submission showcases the team&#8217;s collaborative efforts in describing a remarkable discovery: a pair of hadrosauroid dinosaur eggs and embryos from China&#8217;s Upper Cretaceous red beds, dating back approximately 72 to 66 million years ago. Jordan comments, &#8220;The relatively small size of the eggs, and the unspecialized nature of the dinosaur embryos inside, suggest that the earliest hadrosaurs laid small eggs and hatched altricial young. More derived hadrosaurs eventually laid eggs nearly four times larger by volume and hatched correspondingly larger young. This digital image depicts an example of a &#8216;primitive&#8217; hadrosaur developing within the safety of its small egg expertly crafted by Wenyu Ren.&#8221; This image reminds us of the amazing wealth of information locked within fossils. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/13000-years-humans-fire-ecosystem-la-brea">Around 13,000 years ago, humans and fire changed LA’s ecosystem forever</a></h4>

              
                <p>By about 11,700 years ago, most large land mammals outside of Africa had gone extinct. Scientists have long debated whether these extinctions were primarily caused either by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/few-humans-were-needed-wipe-out-new-zealands-moa">human activities</a> or a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flowers-died-out-arctic-so-did-mammoths">changing climate</a> as the last ice age came to a close (<em>SN: 11/13/14; SN: 2/6/14</em>).</p>



<p>A new study of the remains of animals trapped long ago in the La Brea tar pits, in what’s now Los Angeles, suggests both factors worked in concert to bring about the demise of the region’s megafauna. A warming, drying climate plus humans’ hunting and burning of the landscape led to large fires that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo3594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precipitated the end-Pleistocene die-offs</a> there around 13,000 years ago and forever changed the ecosystem, researchers report in the Aug. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The findings “reflect the reality of nature, which is that phenomena are rarely, if ever, driven by a single factor,” says Danielle Fraser, a paleoecologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The type of “climate-human synergy” implicated in the demise of California’s biggest beasts may warn of dramatic upheaval in modern ecosystems subjected to ongoing human-caused climate change, the researchers say. Southern California, for instance, has warmed more than 2 degrees Celsius over the last century, a more rapid change than the area faced during that earlier time period.</p>

<p>In the new study, F. Robin O’Keefe, a paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., and colleagues were initially studying the remains of ancient carnivores that had become stuck and died in the asphalt seeps of La Brea, investigating how the animals had physically changed over many thousands of years. Then the researchers found evidence of an extinction event recorded in the tar pit fossil record.</p>



<p>“We had lots and lots of megafauna, and then suddenly they were gone,” O’Keefe says.</p>



<p>The team started gathering data on more species. In all, the researchers dated remains from 172 individuals from eight megafauna species from 10,000 to about 15,600 years ago.&nbsp;Included were extinct animals like saber-toothed cats (<em>Smilodon fatalis</em>), dire wolves (<em>Aenocyon dirus</em>) and ground sloths (<em>Paramylodon harlani</em>), and a single species that survived to today, the coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>). Sure enough, about 13,000 years ago, the seven of the eight megafaunal species all vanished from the tar pit fossil record, the team found.</p>



<p>To understand what was going on in the environment long ago, the researchers turned to sediment cores from nearby Lake Elsinore. The cores serve as a record of regional vegetation, climate and fire frequency changes over tens of thousands of years. O’Keefe and his colleagues also compared the extinction timing with computer modeling of human population growth on the continent built from a database of many thousands of radiocarbon dates of archaeological sites across North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sediment cores revealed that over the millennium preceding the extinction, the region warmed by 5.6 degrees Celsius and dried out. The area’s juniper and oak woodlands gave way to more drought and fire-tolerant plants. Shortly after this shift started, Southern California went through a 300-year-long period of intense fires, evidenced by a spike in charcoal in the lake records. The team’s modeling on human populations shows their numbers rapidly grew right before the burning started. That the population upswing so closely coincides with the fires suggests the two are linked.</p>



<p>What’s more, the changing climate and human activities not only precipitated the extinctions, the team found, but also converted the region’s woodlands into chaparral scrubland for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Keefe describes it as a feedback loop, noting that hunting herbivores also makes the ecosystem more fire prone as plants go uneaten. “You get this vicious cycle,” he says. “You add more people and it gets hotter and drier, and you&#8217;re killing more herbivores. So there&#8217;s more fuel [to burn].”</p>



<p>The seven megafauna species vanished from Southern California about 1,000 years before they did elsewhere in North America. Those other populations may have met a similar end, the researchers say. “There is evidence for a continent-wide event, not just in Southern California but across the continent right about at the same time,” O’Keefe says.</p>

<p>Sandra Brügger, a paleoecologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland who wasn’t involved in the research, notes that similarly rapid ecological transformations have been documented in the Mediterranean and a broader swathe of the U.S. West during the transition between the Pleistocene and the following Holocene Epoch.</p>



<p>The new findings not only provide a glimpse into the past but are also a “cautionary tale” relevant to the present and to the survival of modern biodiversity, says O’Keefe, pointing to recent large, intense fires in Hawaii, the U.S. West and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">Canada</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/23</em>). “So the parallels are certainly there. The one thing that&#8217;s different about today is that we know what happened before, and if we can learn something from that, maybe we can change our trajectory.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-otzi-iceman-dna-ancestry-genome">A new look at Ötzi the Iceman’s DNA reveals new ancestry and other surprises</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the Iceman’s DNA reveals that his ancestors weren’t who scientists previously thought.</p>



<p>In 2012, scientists compiled a complete picture of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frozen-mummys-genetic-blueprints-unveiled">Ötzi’s genome</a>; it suggested that the frozen mummy found melting out of a glacier in the Tyrolean Alps had ancestors from the Caspian steppe (<em>SN: 2/28/12</em>). But something didn’t add up.</p>



<p>The Iceman is about 5,300 years old. Other people with steppe ancestry didn’t appear in the genetic record of central Europe until about 4,900 years ago. Ötzi  “is too old to have that type of ancestry,” says archaeogeneticist Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The mummy &#8220;was always an outlier.&#8221;</p>





<p>Krause and colleagues put together a new genetic instruction book for the Iceman. The old genome was <a href="https://cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00174-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily contaminated</a> with modern people’s DNA, the researchers report August 16 in <em>Cell Genomics</em>. The new analysis reveals that “the steppe ancestry is completely gone.”</p>



<p>But the Iceman still has oddities. About 90 percent of Ötzi’s genetic heritage comes from Neolithic farmers, an unusually high amount compared with other Copper Age remains, Krause says.</p>



<p>The Iceman’s new genome also reveals he had male-pattern baldness and much darker skin than artistic representations suggest. Genes conferring light skin tones didn’t become prevalent until 4,000 to 3,000 years ago when early farmers started eating plant-based diets and didn’t get as much vitamin D from fish and meat as hunter-gathers did, Krause says.</p>



<p>As Ötzi and other ancient people’s DNA illustrate, the skin color genetic changes took thousands of years to become commonplace in Europe.</p>



<p>“People that lived in Europe between 40,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago were as dark as people in Africa, which makes a lot of sense because [Africa is] where humans came from,” he says. “We have always imagined that [Europeans] became light-skinned much faster. But now it seems that this happened actually quite late in human history.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnet-rust-nanoparticles-estrogen-out-water">Magnetic ‘rusty’ nanoparticles pull estrogen out of water</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new “smart rust” could one day help pull pollutants out of waterways, leaving cleaner water behind.</p>



<p>Researchers adorned tiny particles of iron oxide, better known as rust, with “sticky” molecules that <a href="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/30/page/975/1?eventSearchInput=3907631&amp;eventSearchDateTimeStart=&amp;eventSearchDateTimeEnd=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab on to estrogen and similar hormones in water samples</a>. A magnet can then remove both the particles and the trapped pollutants from the water, materials scientist Lukas Müller reports August 16 in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.</p>





<p>The new technology could potentially limit excess estrogen’s harmful effects on animals, especially those that live in waterways.</p>



<p>With the nanoparticles, &#8220;we are able … to clean very different kinds of environmental pollutants,” says Müller, of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany.</p>



<p>Estrogen hormones typically enter waterways through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormones-heres-beef">humans’ and other animals’ waste</a> (<em>SN: 1/2/02</em>). Even low concentrations can have harmful chronic effects on aquatic life, like higher instances of cancer or reproductive issues, says Konrad Wojnarowski, a biologist at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München who was not involved in the study. Wastewater treatment plants can remove some estrogen hormones, he says, but the process isn’t cheap or energy efficient.</p>



<p>For now, “we still don’t have an ideal way of dealing with estrogen pollution in the environment,” but nanoparticles could help, Wojnarowski says.</p>



<p>To build the estrogen-catching particles, Müller and Marcus Halik, a chemist also at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, drew on prior experience designing iron oxide nanoparticles that can catch other kinds of pollutants like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/oil-magnets">oil</a> or herbicides (<em>SN: 7/25/08</em>). The tiny iron oxide cores are each about 10 nanometers in diameter. Each core is then covered in phosphonic acid molecules, which act like sticky hairs that scoop up contaminants.</p>



<p>The new version of the nanoparticles specifically targets estrogen by including two types of phosphonic acid. One kind is long, repels water and attaches to the neutrally charged part of the estrogen molecule. The other is positively charged to attract parts of estrogen hormones that carry a slight negative charge.</p>



<p>The smart rust removed much of the estrogen from small water samples prepared in the lab, the researchers found. Their next step is to test the nanoparticles on samples from actual waterways.</p>



<p>And the team is investigating exactly how the molecules on the nanoparticle surfaces grab and hold on to estrogen at the atomic scale. With this information, Halik says, they can improve the estrogen binding even more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/run-two-hour-marathon-drafting-pacers-eliud-kipchoge">How to run a marathon in under two hours</a></h4>

              
                <p>In an unofficial race in Vienna in 2019, Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first person ever to run a marathon in under two hours. A new study shows how teamwork made that feat possible.</p>



<p>Kipchoge ran with a rotating posse of pacers, other runners who deflected some of his air resistance in a process known as drafting. Now, wind tunnel tests with action-figure manikins suggest that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0836" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those pacers saved him 3 minutes and 33 seconds</a> — dropping him below the two-hour mark to 1:59:40 — researchers report August 16 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</em>. An alternative configuration of pacers could have given Kipchoge an even bigger boost, cutting an additional 49 seconds, the team proposes.</p>





<p>Elite marathon runners are often accompanied by team members who swap in and out to keep them on pace. Scientists know from experiments on live participants and from computer simulations that running between these pacers can reduce an athlete’s drag.</p>



<p>In the new study, mechanical engineer Massimo Marro of the École Centrale de Lyon in France and colleagues measured the drag force felt by manikins in a wind tunnel, which allowed the team to test different drafting configurations readily. Inside the tunnel, the team replicated Kipchoge’s 2019 formation, which featured five pacers in a V in front with two more in the rear. This arrangement reduced about half the drag felt by the athlete — enough to trim about three and a half minutes off his time, the team found. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing different formations of action-figure manikins in a wind tunnel shows how setting up a phalanx of pacers can diminish drag from air resistance, allowing a runner to go faster. In a set-up (left) mirroring the runners in Eliud Kipchoge’s unofficial sub-two-hour 2019 marathon in Vienna, five manikins create a V in front of the runner (gray circle).&nbsp;A   formation that deploys the five forward pacers in more of a lowercase-t formation (right) is even more optimal, the researchers demonstrate.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Credit: École Centrale de Lyon/LMFA UMR 5509</p>
</div>



<p>The researchers also identified three new formations that could further maximize performance.</p>



<p>Rather than a V, the winning design sets the five pacers in front in a formation shaped like a lowercase t: one pacer behind another, followed by two side-by-side, and then one more behind that pair. The researchers estimated the drag Kipchoge would have felt running alone at his marathon speed to calculate the predicted savings from this new formation: 4 minutes, 22 seconds.</p>





<p>“You can sort of slice through the air with a narrower wedge” using this formation, says Rodger Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the research. “That’s quite innovative.”</p>



<p>While official races typically allow runners only two or three pacers, Kram suggests competing athletes could make use of “cooperative drafting” —&nbsp;taking turns coasting in each other’s shadows to boost performance.</p>



<p>In September, Kipchoge and his competitors will attempt to break the two-hour barrier in a professional race for the first time in Berlin, where in 2022 Kipchoge set the current official record of 2:01:09.</p>



<p>“The limit is close, but it’s not reached,” Marro says. “These collaborative strategies could help to improve the record.”</p>

                <p>In what seems like something out of a sci-fi movie, scientists have plucked the famous Pink Floyd song “Another Brick in the Wall” from individuals’ brains. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Using electrodes, computer models and brain scans, researchers previously have been able to decode and reconstruct individual <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">words</a> and entire <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscientists-decoded-thoughts-brain-scans">thoughts</a> from people’s brain activity (<em>SN: 11/15/22; SN: 5/1/23</em>).</p>



<p>The new study, published August 15 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>, adds music into the mix, showing that songs can also be decoded from brain activity and revealing <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how different brain areas pick up an array of acoustical elements</a>.

<p>People listened to Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” song while having their brain activity monitored. Using that data and a computer model, researchers were able to reconstruct sounds that resemble the song.</p>

<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">L. Bellier <I>et al</I>/<I>PLOS Biology</i> 2023 <a />(CC-BY 4.0)</a></div>
</div>



<p>To decode the song, neuroscientist Ludovic Bellier of the University of California, Berkeley and colleagues analyzed the brain activity recorded by electrodes implanted in the brains of 29 individuals with epilepsy. While in the hospital undergoing monitoring for the disorder, the individuals listened to the 1979 rock song.</p>



<p>People&#8217;s nerve cells, particularly those in auditory areas, responded to hearing the song, and the electrodes detected not only neural signals associated with words but also rhythm, harmony and other musical aspects, the team found. With that information, the researchers developed a computer model to reconstruct sounds from the brain activity data, and found that they could produce sounds that resemble the song. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a real tour de force,” says Robert Zatorre, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal who was not involved in the study. “Because you’re recording the activity of neurons directly from the brain, you get very direct information about exactly what the patterns of activity are.”</p>





<p>The study highlights which parts of the brain respond to different elements of music. For example, activity in one area within the superior temporal gyrus, or STG, located in the lower middle of each side of the brain, intensified at the onset of specific sounds, such as when a guitar note played. Another area within the STG increased and kept its activity up when vocals were used.</p>



<p>The STG on the right side of the brain, but not the left, seemed to be crucial in decoding music. When the researchers removed information from that brain area in the computer model, it decreased the accuracy of the song reconstruction.</p>



<p>“Music is a core part of human experience,” says Bellier, who has been playing instruments since he was 6 years old. “Understanding how the brain processes music can really tell us about human nature. You can go to a country and not understand the language, but be able to enjoy the music.”</p>



<p>Continuing to probe musical perception is likely to be difficult because the brain areas that process it are hard to access without invasive methods. And Zatorre wonders about the broader application of the computer model, trained on just one song. “Does [it] work on other kinds of sounds, like a dog barking or phone ringing?” he asks.</p>



<p>The goal, Bellier says, is to eventually be able to decode and generate natural sounds in addition to music. In the shorter term, incorporating the more musical elements of speech, including pitch and timbre, into brain-computer devices could help individuals with brain lesions or paralysis or other conditions communicate better.</p>

<p>Common mental health disorders, or CMDs, such as anxiety, depression and stress significantly contribute to workplace absences. Intervention programmes have been employed in workplaces to aid people with a history of or presently experiencing mental health issues but present some limitations, among which is the identification of staff experiencing CMDs.</p>
<p>Prevail is presented as a new intervention strategy that focuses instead on the whole workforce, aiming to increase the overall mental wellbeing of employees. The aims of the new programme include reducing the stigma of mental health, increasing the level of awareness of mental health issues, educating staff to manage mental health issues within the workplace and encouraging people to disclose potential issues they are experiencing.</p>
<p>In this study, the delivery of the Prevail intervention was very well received, with 81% of the participants stating it was helpful in improving their own mental health. While there was no distinct effect on the level of stigma towards others, evidence suggests that the Prevail intervention is successful in reducing self- and anticipated stigma and social distance from people with mental health issues. In addition, a reduction in levels of sickness absence was observed between the pre- and post-intervention periods.</p>
<p>This study presents a novel approach to tackling common mental health disorders in the work environment by addressing the whole workforce and shows its effectiveness in improving their overall mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>The Triassic period (252-201 million years ago) separates the Permian and the Jurassic Periods and marks the start of the Mesozoic Era. It followed the most devastating mass extinction event in history. This Period was characterised by the expansion and diversification of reptiles and saw the first appearance of dinosaurs, belonging to the Archosauria.</p>
<p>Phytosaurs, also archosauromorphs, were mostly semi-aquatic reptiles and fossil record allowed to determine they were spread across the Pangea. In this study, phylogenetic analysis allowed to determine that a partial skull and bone fragments collected in 1974 in Nova Scotia, Canada belong to a new phytosaur genus and species, named <em>Jupijkam paleofluvialis</em>. The biogeographic reconstructions show that this new species is one of the youngest phytosaur lineage to have been identified.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis also allowed to infer that climate events, in particular related to an arid central belt, were important determinants not only in the spreading of phytosaurs, but in establishing the biogeography of vertebrates in the Triassic Period.</p>

<p>Medication adherence is a key determinant of treatment success. Additional, unnecessary treatment may be needed as a consequence of non-adherence, leading to increased patient discomfort as well as financial costs. Being able to efficiently estimate adherence means also being able to determine the associated costs and identify patients most at risk of non-adherence.</p>
<p>Data mining of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is an opportunity to expand adherence estimation to large scale groups, but consensus on the best method to do so is lacking.</p>
<p>This study compared different adherence measures using a Scottish EHR dataset for asthma medication. Of the eight Continuous, Multiple Interval, Measures of Medication Availability (CMAs) that were assessed, CMAs 1 to 4 calculate the amount of medication obtained over a certain period, while CMAs 5 to 8 are based on the timing of the prescriptions. In the context of the study, CMA7 and 8 proved reliable in estimating current adherence based on data from the previous year.</p>
<p>This study highlights key considerations to take into account when designing medication adherence estimates and provides a rule-based data extraction method which can be adapted to different conditions and regimens.</p>

<p>Merlot, a cross between Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes, is one of the most extensive wine cultivations in the world. Merlot, and grapevine in general, genome mapping and chimera identification can be helpful elements in selection and conservation efforts. Grapevine chimeras are an important element of viticulture and more specifically periclinical chimeras, where the somatic variation is present throughout the cell layer, are of particular interest due to their stability and their ability to be propagated through cuttings.</p>
<p>In this study, a method for genome sequencing and chimera identification is presented based on long reads sequencing, trio binning and organ comparison. A total of 51 and 53 chimeras originating from SNVs in non-repeated sequences were identified in Merlot Haplotype CF and Merlot Haplotype MG, respectively. Haplotype comparison yielded 3.5 million variants between Merlot-leaf-hap-MG or Merlot-root-hap-MG and Merlot-root-hap-CF pseudo-molecules – mostly Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs).</p>
<p>These findings not only are significant for the cultivation of Merlot wine, but have a wider application for viticulture and plant breeding and conservation.</p>

<p>Low-income or resource-limited settings struggle to access adequate technologies to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory infections in children. Lack of resources impact the clinical training necessary for the operation of a standard stethoscope, making the assessment of symptoms challenging. A digital stethoscope prototype was developed to address such challenges, and in this study its usability and uptake were assessed in rural areas of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The study involved both parents and community healthcare providers, aiming to identify the level of acceptance of the prototype use and its practical performance.</p>
<p>There was positive feedback on acceptance and the healthcare providers were happy with the level of training and support they received ahead of and during the enrolment. Issues were also reported, in relation to both the implementation and technological aspects. These included inability to charge the device due to lack of electricity, having to transport the device as such an expensive piece of kit cannot be stored in the clinic, and technical problems such as lack of visual cues and unwanted recording, which also raises privacy concerns.</p>
<p>This study provides valuable feedback on practical aspects of the implementation of digital devices in resource-limited settings and insights into areas with improvement potential.</p>

<p>Talk about artificial intelligence. Fifteen studies published in various journals name a mysterious computer scientist as an author. </p>



<p>The problem? He doesn’t seem to exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragan Rodriguez is listed as being affiliated with Case Western Reserve University, but an official at the Cleveland institution told a sleuth no one of that name has been associated with the university.</p>



<p>The studies on which Rodriguez’s name appears range in topic from cancer detection to &#8220;renewable energy systems optimization.&#8221; The papers were published since 2018 in 10 journals from four major scientific publishers since 2018, including the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy </em>and the <em>Journal of Building Engineering</em>, which have both historically had impact factors above 7, and&nbsp; <em>Applied Energy</em>, whose impact factor has been above 11. They have been cited a total of 232 times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127713"></span>



<p>Alexander Magazinov, a researcher and scientific sleuth, told Retraction Watch he noticed Rodriguez’s name while searching for papers that over-cited beneficiaries of a potential citation ring that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/17/journal-to-retract-papers-that-cost-its-impact-factor/">cost two journals their impact factors</a> earlier this year. The papers are associated with an operation Elizabeth Bik has dubbed the “<a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2022/09/15/the-iranian-plants-paper-mill/">Iranian plant paper mill</a>,” and the authors include Majid Khayatnezhad, a researcher at Islamic Azad University in Iran. Khayatnezhad has denied benefiting from a citation ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov said he was looking at papers that gave an unusual amount of citations to Noradin Ghadimi, a researcher at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University in Turkey. Ghadimi, who did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, is a frequent co-author with Khayatnezhad and another potential citation ring beneficiary, said Magazinov. He told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>With that in mind, I tried to locate other papers that over-cite Ghadimi, and thus found &#8220;Rodriguez&#8221;. This combination of a South Slavic given name and a Spanish surname is weird; also weird is the total absence of domestic collaboration of this allegedly US-based &#8220;researcher&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>The practice of listing gift, guest, or honorary authors, who usually have made <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/15/i-never-asked-or-expected-to-be-included-as-an-author-retired-penn-state-prof-has-three-retractions-for-manipulated-peer-review/">minimal or no contribution</a> to the paper, is common in academic publishing, although it generally is considered unethical or at least questionable. The custom does not typically extend to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/18/another-whodunit-the-author-no-one-can-find/">fabricating a researcher’s entire identity.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rodriguez is not listed as a corresponding author on any of the 15 studies that bear his name and has no profile or listing of any kind on Case Western’s website. Although he is listed on some studies as being affiliated with the university’s “Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,” the corresponding department at the school is the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.</p>



<p>Magazinov emailed Case Western asking if anyone with this name had ever worked at the university, and, if so, for the institution to investigate his work. In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Tracy J. Wilson-Holden, assistant vice president of research integrity, told him:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Upon a thorough review of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) records, it was determined that Dragan Rodriguez is not, and never has been, a member of the CWRU community as faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, student or volunteer</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov forwarded the email to the journals that had published papers on which Rodriguez is listed as an author, writing that Wilson-Holden’s statement meant that “it is beyond reasonable doubt that [Rodriguez’s] affiliation is falsified, and it is quite likely that the identity is also fictional.”</p>



<p>The studies that Rodriguez is listed as an author on are:&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/macaques-puerto-rico-shade-hurricane-maria">Macaques in Puerto Rico learned to share shade after Hurricane Maria</a></h4>

              
                <p>After Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico in 2017, monkeys living there forged new bonds to share a suddenly scarce resource: shade.</p>



<p>Rhesus macaques (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) that were willing to hang out with others <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.17.549328v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted their chance of survival</a> in the storm’s aftermath, researchers report July 24 at bioRxiv.org. That newfound sociability may have allowed multiple animals to escape the scorching heat of the day beneath any trees left standing, and any other source of shade they could find.</p>





<p>Amid Hurricane Maria’s heavy rain and furious winds — coming just two weeks after Hurricane Irma dumped a heavy deluge of rain — trees and other plants across Puerto Rico toppled. Nearly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-hurricane-maria-heavy-rains-devastated-puerto-rico-forests">a quarter of Puerto Rico’s total forest biomass</a> was demolished (<em>SN: 3/17/20</em>). Cayo Santiago, a once lush key located off Puerto Rico’s coast, was left largely barren after it lost nearly two-thirds of its vegetation.</p>



<p>More than five years later, Cayo Santiago’s flora hasn’t recovered, says Camille Testard, a behavioral ecologist and neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. As of April 2023, the tiny island hosted fewer than 600 living trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3130228" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-1a.jpg?ssl=1" alt="A satellite photo of Cayo Santiago seen before Hurricane Maria with trees and abundant shade to assist macaques." width="680" height="800" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3130229" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-1b.jpg?ssl=1" alt="A satellite photo of Cayo Santiago seen after Hurricane Maria with a distinct lack of trees and other forms of shade to assist macaques." width="680" height="800" class="image-compare__image-after" /></div><figcaption>Before Hurricane Maria, trees and shade were abundant on Cayo Santiago (left, February 2017). More than five years after the storm, vegetation hasn’t recovered and shade is a scarce resource (right, March 2023).<span class="credit">Left: Google Earth</span><span class="credit">Right: Google Earth</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But a colony of around 1,600 macaques, managed by the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center, also calls Cayo Santiago home. Without much remaining tree cover, the destructive hurricane left many monkeys searching for shady relief from temperatures that regularly exceed 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit). Some of that shade now comes in smaller forms: from boulders, water basins or even human shadows.</p>



<p>“If you’re collecting data on the island, you’re gonna have monkeys that are sitting in your shade and following you around,” Testard says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Hurricane Maria, the macaques, typically hierarchal animals, could often be found fighting over food, status or mates. But immediately after the storm, the macaques <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00368-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded their social network to form new relationships</a>, Testard and colleagues reported in 2021. While monkey fights still happen, they aren’t as common as before. These new friendships meant more access to shade in tight places, the team hypothesized. But it lacked the data to back it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers examined interactions within groups of monkeys over a 10-year span, five years before and five years after the hurricane. During that decade, the team analyzed monkey groups in 10-minute increments from 6:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. (One year, 2020, was excluded because of the COVID-19 pandemic.)</p>



<p>After Hurricane Maria, from 2018 to 2022, the animals spent more time in close company in the heat of the afternoon compared with relatively cooler mornings, the team found. The recorded interactions don’t specifically note whether the monkeys were sitting in shade or sun, says coauthor Lauren Brent, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Exeter in England. But more social monkeys were less likely to die in the five years after the storm, which suggests that afternoon gatherings took place in the shade, so the animals might cool down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="700" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2.jpg" alt="A photo of several macaques lined up in the shade of a bare tree trunk." class="wp-image-3130230" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-372x383.jpg 372w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-437x450.jpg 437w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-181x186.jpg 181w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-563x580.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130230">Macaques line up in the shade of a bare tree trunk to escape the heat of the day in July 2019.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130230">Sébastian Tremblay</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The findings are a “wonderful” example showing how behavior can be an important factor for survival as environments change, says Richard Buchholz, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Because researchers on Cayo Santiago ensure macaques have food and water, it’s unclear whether the same might happen in a group of wild monkeys, he says. But “it’s exciting that [the researchers have] shown this impact on mortality.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the boost in sociality comes not from a benefit of being tolerant of their primate peers after a natural disaster, but because there’s a cost to being intolerant, Buchholz says. “We tend to get lethargic when things get superhot.” The animals may be calmly sitting together in the shade so as not to raise their metabolisms, “avoiding the metabolic cost of chasing after somebody and building up more heat that you’ll have to get rid of somehow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>There could also be other consequences to monkey gatherings. In a separate study, posted July 19 to bioRxiv.org, Testard, Brent and colleagues used computer simulations to show that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.17.549341v1.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming more social may increase the risk that infectious diseases</a> will spread.</p>



<p>“So even if you’re really flexible, and you’re able … to adapt to this new environment, the way that you have to adapt actually makes you more vulnerable to other external shocks to the system,” Testard says. “I think that needs to be kept in mind when we think about the effects of natural disasters on wildlife health.”</p>

<p>A law firm that holds a mortgage on the house of Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University, may foreclose on the property, a judge has ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce hired James E. Arnold and Associates to represent him in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel case</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/04/litigious-osu-professor-loses-appeal-in-federal-defamation-case/">defamation case</a> against <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, a professor of biological sciences at Purdue University who became something of a public nemesis for the Ohio scientist after pointing out problems in Croce’s published work. Croce also needed representation for Ohio State’s research misconduct investigation, and a suit attempting to <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/18/embattled-cancer-researcher-loses-legal-bid-to-be-reinstated-as-department-chair-at-osu/">stop the university</a> from removing him as chair of the department of cancer biology and genetics. </p>



<p>Croce lost each case. Ohio State’s investigation <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">found problems</a> with how he managed his lab that did not amount to research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127710"></span>



<p>Arnold and Associates was the second firm Croce hired, after his original lawyers at <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter</a> dropped his cases and sued him because he wasn’t paying his bills. Last December, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/09/judge-orders-osu-cancer-researcher-to-pay-1-million-to-lawyers-from-failed-libel-suit/">ordered</a> Croce to pay Kegler Brown nearly $1.1 million. To enforce the judgment, Ohio State has been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">garnishing his wages</a>, and Kegler Brown has filed a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230731-motion-to-sell-artwork.pdf">motion</a> for the court to allow Sotheby’s to handle the sale of pieces from Croce’s collection of Renaissance artwork, which the county sheriff seized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After also ceasing to pay Arnold’s fees, according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">lawsuit</a> Arnold later filed, Croce agreed to put up his house <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/croce-arnold-note.pdf">as collateral</a> for continued representation, but still didn’t pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230712-Arnold-decision.pdf">decision</a> dated July 12, judge Jeffrey M. Brown granted Arnold a favorable summary judgment in three counts of the firm&#8217;s suit against Croce, as well as finding that the firm has “met the requirements to foreclose” on Croce’s house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reached by phone, Arnold confirmed, “I intend to sell his house if he doesn’t pay his debt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of publication, Zillow <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2140-Cambridge-Blvd-Upper-Arlington-OH-43221/33990724_zpid/">values Croce’s house at $3.2 million</a>.</p>



<p>The court will hold a hearing on December 4 for a magistrate to determine the amount Croce owes Arnold’s firm, which Arnold estimated to be about $650,000 in original fees, plus interest that has been accruing at 21% per year, reaching “probably north of $500,000.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the magistrate or a jury decides how much Croce owes Arnold, foreclosure can proceed, unless Croce appeals the decision and provides a bond guaranteeing that a third party will pay his debt if he loses, Arnold said. He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It would be wise for him to start to liquidate some of his artwork to pay his debts, otherwise he won’t have any place to put it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-adults-50-colorectal-cancer-warning">Why are more people under 50 getting colorectal cancer? Scientists have some clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abdominal pain is one clue something could be wrong. Changing bowel movements may be another. Other people might notice blood in their stool. Doctors may chalk that symptom up to hemorrhoids, but for some people, it’s a sign of something more insidious: early-onset colorectal cancer. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the patients that Thejus Jayakrishnan sees are in their 30s or 40s, establishing themselves in their careers and perhaps settling down in a new house with young kids at home. When they find out they have colorectal cancer, they’re shocked, he says. “It’s not something you expect.” In some cases, the cancer, which takes root in the large intestine, has already spread through the body and encroached on the liver or lungs.</p>





<p>Though the number of colorectal cancer cases among people under 50 has been rising for decades, younger and middle-aged adults’ symptoms can still go overlooked, says Jayakrishnan, a physician at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. These people aren’t in the age group that doctors tend to be concerned about, he says.</p>



<p>That’s also been the experience of Christopher Lieu, a medical oncologist at the University of Colorado Cancer Center in Aurora. “For the last 10 years of my career, all my patients were told, ‘You&#8217;re just too young to have colorectal cancer. Don&#8217;t worry about it.’” In a June talk at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Lieu noted that, by 2030, colorectal cancer could be the number one cause of cancer death in people ages 20 to 49. “This is a humongous issue,” he said.</p>



<p>In 2018, the American Cancer Society updated its guidelines to reflect the changing incidence of the disease. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experts-advise-start-colorectal-screening-45-not-50">Screening should begin at 45 years old rather than 50</a>, the organization now recommends (<em>SN: 5/31/18</em>). But younger people with early-onset colorectal cancer may still be falling through the cracks, says Yin Cao, a cancer epidemiologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “At least 50 percent of these cases are under age 45,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists don’t know what’s driving the disease’s increase in younger adults, but they’ve been looking for answers. Recent research is beginning to reveal some hints, though the picture remains murky.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Cao and Jayakrishnan are looking for ways to identify the disease earlier, before it has advanced to other parts of the body. Cao’s team recently identified warning symptoms linked to the early-onset cancer. And Jayakrishnan presented a small study at the June ASCO meeting that suggests there may be metabolic differences between people with early-onset and average-onset tumors.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with these and other doctors about what they’re learning about early-onset colorectal cancer and what questions remain. Here are three key aspects of the disease that they wish more people knew.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More younger adults are getting colorectal cancer, a trend that’s occurring around the world.</h4>



<p>Historically, in the United States, colorectal cancer has been a disease of older people, Cao says. But in 2017, a landmark study marked a change in who was getting diagnosed.</p>



<p>Though older individuals still made up most cases, scientists noted that, from 2000 to 2013, colorectal cancer incidence among people ages 50 to 64 had meandered downward. In people 65 and older, the rate had plunged. But there had been a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colorectal-cancer-rise-among-younger-adults">22 percent increase in cases in people under 50</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>). Whereas 59 new cases were diagnosed out of every million younger people at the start of that period, the rate had risen to 72 out of a million by the end. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really alarming because we saw this rising incidence in younger adults,” Cao says, and for a disease that hadn’t typically affected a younger population.</p>





<p>The data reflected what doctors were seeing in the clinic, Lieu says. Looking back through the decades, scientists can track the rise’s origin to the late 1980s. Seeing the numbers creep up for a few years might have been a blip, but “what’s concerning is that [the trend] doesn’t seem to be reversing,” Lieu says. In fact, “this problem continues to get worse.” And it appears to be occurring more or less globally. Other high-income countries, including Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, mirror the rise.</p>



<p>Scientists have noticed that people born in more recent generations tend to have a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer than people born in earlier generations, what’s known as a birth cohort effect. That means someone who turns 40 today is more at risk than someone who turned 40 a decade ago, Lieu says. The pattern, and the fact that most early-onset cases lack a hereditary link, has doctors and scientists scrambling to answer a singular question: “What are younger individuals being exposed to that could account for that risk?” he asks.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Many factors may be driving the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer.</h4>



<p>It’s not easy to take a magnifying glass to people’s lives and deduce what may be causing their disease. Sifting through a person’s diet history and past environmental exposures is complicated, Lieu says. “People have difficulty remembering what they ate yesterday, let alone their entire lives.”</p>



<p>That’s one reason the early-onset colorectal cancer picture is still so cloudy. Today, scientists are investigating an assortment of potential disease drivers, including obesity, antibiotics, the gut microbiome, alcohol intake, delivery by cesarean section and a diet rich in red meat and sugar.</p>



<p>Cao’s team, for example, has linked drinking <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sugar-sweetened beverages to an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer in women</a>. Her group and others have also reported a connection between the disease and <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/6/1147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people with metabolic syndrome</a> (which can include conditions like high blood pressure and excess belly fat) as well as those <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/113/5/543/5951179?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who eat a Western diet</a>, among other factors.</p>



<p>Other teams have pointed out alterations in the gut microbiome in people with early-onset disease. They have a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.1036946/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different community of gut microbes</a> compared with people diagnosed later in life, a 2022 study suggested. Though many scientists are exploring the microbiome’s role in early-onset colorectal cancer, so far “nothing definitive has been determined,” says Cathy Eng, a medical oncologist at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That seems to be true of the many potential risk factors scientists have identified. It’s also possible that younger generations are somehow more susceptible to environmental insults that kick colorectal cancer into action. “I think it&#8217;s really hard to draw a conclusion at this point,” Cao says. Lieu agrees. Scientists are still “at the hypothesis-generating stage,” he says.</p>



<p>Some data can even be downright confusing. One study linked <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/11/1971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oral antibiotic use with an increased risk of colon cancer yet a reduced risk of rectal cancer</a>. “Even in the same study, you’re getting two very different answers,” Lieu says.</p>



<p>And the diet and obesity-related risk factors are not one-size-fits-all. In Lieu’s experience in Colorado, many of his young colorectal cancer patients are otherwise “incredibly healthy,” he says. “They’re [Division 1] athletes; they’re triathletes; they’re pretty remarkable.”</p>



<p>A combination of different factors working together may set off early-onset colorectal cancer, and the recipe may vary among individuals. Doctors want to be able to say, “If we stop doing this one thing, then we can prevent the cancer,” Lieu says. But, he adds, “I don’t think there’s going to be a single smoking gun.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Four ‘red flag’ symptoms may be signs of early-onset colorectal cancer.</h4>



<p>Though scientists have not pinned down a single, definitive cause of early-onset colorectal cancer, they have identified some early warning signs.</p>



<p>Up to two years before their diagnosis, people with the disease may experience <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djad068/7147891?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea and iron-deficiency anemia</a>, Cao’s team reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in May.</p>



<p>The researchers trawled through insurance claim data from more than 27,000 people with and without the disease. They were looking for patterns in patients’ records — telltale symptoms documented in people under 50 who were later diagnosed with the cancer. The four signs Cao’s team identified stood out because they seemed specific to early-onset cases, and they often preceded a diagnosis by months to years. Unexplained weight loss could also be a symptom to look out for, Lieu says.</p>



<p>Knowing and spotting the warning signs could help people get a jump on the disease. In one 2019 survey of nearly 1,200 early-onset patients and survivors, <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/13_Supplement/3347/635227/Abstract-3347-Young-onset-colorectal-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 7 out of 10 were diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease</a>, when their cancer had already grown into neighboring tissues or spread to distant locales in the body. Patients often waited months before seeing their doctor and then visited multiple doctors before receiving a correct diagnosis.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Four ‘red flag’ signs of colorectal cancer</h4>



<p>Scientists have identified some warning signs of early-onset colorectal cancer, which can affect younger and middle-aged adults. Knowing and spotting the warning signs could help people get a jump on the disease. Four potential &#8220;red flag&#8221; symptoms are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Iron-deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Many early-onset cases are actually diagnosed at the emergency room, Cao says. “The bottom line is if someone has at least two [red flag symptoms], they really need to be aware of it,” she says. “It will definitely be worth a conversation with their primary care doctor.”</p>



<p>Beyond noticing suspicious symptoms, other doctors are exploring different ways to spot the cancer before it spreads. In a study of 170 patients, the&nbsp;<a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/222545?0=n&amp;1=u&amp;2=l&amp;3=l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early-onset and average-onset diseases left different metabolic signatures in the blood</a>, Jayakrishnan reported in June at ASCO. His team saw differences in chemical reactions involving citrate and the amino acid arginine in young people with the cancer. If Jayakrishnan’s results hold up, such metabolic signatures could one day help doctors screen people for the disease.</p>



<p>“If you can detect it early,” he says, “colorectal cancer has really good treatment options. It really makes a huge difference.”</p>



<p>One key part of early detection may simply be wider knowledge that the early-onset disease is on the rise, says Colorado’s Lieu. Most cases of abdominal pain probably won’t be cancer, he says, but “you just don’t want to ignore it.” Raising awareness of the disease and its symptoms among both patients and doctors could “save somebody’s life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frogs-glow-biofluorescence-language">Many frogs glow in blue light, and it may be a secret, eerie language</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the dim twilight hours, many frogs may be capable of emitting a faint green or orange glow.</p>



<p>A survey of hundreds of frogs in South America shows that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.25.550432v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more frogs are biofluorescent</a> than previously thought, researchers report in a preprint posted July 28 at bioRxiv.org. The ghostly colors may have a role in the frogs’ communication with members of the same species, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The findings “are a reminder to check our own perception as humans,” says Jennifer Lamb, a herpetologist at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who was not involved with the research. “We are very visually dominant in terms of our senses. And other animals are too, but they might be experiencing that visual world differently than we are.”</p>





<p>Biofluorescence occurs in many types of creatures. It happens when an organism absorbs light at one wavelength, or color, and reemits it at a different wavelength with lower energy. Over the past several years, researchers have recognized the trait in a growing diversity of species, from the fur of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/1/21/5299493?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flying squirrels</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">platypuses</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">the nests of certain wasps</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/20, SN: 9/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>Fluorescence was <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1701053114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first discovered in frogs</a> in 2017. Since then, researchers have tested more amphibians for fluorescence, says Courtney Whitcher, an evolutionary biologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee. But investigations of frog biofluorescence have used just one or two light sources she says, usually violet or ultraviolet light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get a more detailed and cohesive picture of fluorescence in frogs, Whitcher and her colleagues tested frogs using five different light sources covering a range of wavelengths from green to UV. From March to May 2022, the team captured and shone lights on 528 individual frogs in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and measured any reemitted light.</p>



<p>All 151 frog species they tested had some degree of fluorescence, ranging from 2 percent of the original light intensity to well over 90 percent. Prior to this study, less than two dozen of the 42 frog species that had been previously tested were considered fluorescent.</p>



<p>The frogs’ green and orange fluorescence was most intense under blue light that dominates at twilight. This is similar to how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-frogs-salamanders-may-be-surprisingly-common">many salamander species fluoresce</a> under blue light, Lamb says (<em>SN: 2/27/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fluorescence in land-living animals “was recently thought to be rare, and when people go out looking for it, surveying across multiple species, it turns out it’s everywhere,” says zoologist Linda Reinhold, recently a graduate student at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. “It was only because no one had looked before.”</p>



<p>Many of the frogs’ body parts that strongly fluoresced are also involved in signaling to other frogs. Much of the fluorescence seemed centered on the throat and underside of the frogs, which are commonly used in courtship rituals.&nbsp;“While they&#8217;re calling, that vocal sac region is expanding and contracting,” Whitcher says. Fluorescence may make for a more noticeable display.</p>



<p>The green glow is probably something other frogs can see, the researchers say. The team found that in the twilight hours — a time when frogs tend to court and mate — frog eyes are quite sensitive to the particular green light that’s emitted from the frogs’ skin.&nbsp;The orange fluorescence, on the other hand, may be intended for a different receiver, such as a predator. It may serve as camouflage or a warning signal, Whitcher says.</p>



<p>It’s “astonishing” how widespread fluorescence is among these frogs, says evolutionary biologist Mark Scherz, of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. “Not a single one of the species they tested failed to fluoresce,” he says, adding that testing the frogs against a variety of light wavelengths might help explain the fluorescence rate.</p>





<p>But he is skeptical that the fluorescence would be strong enough for communication purposes. Twilight is much dimmer than daylight, he says, so there may not be much light available for conversion to an emerald glow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whitcher is now investigating whether fluorescence in male frogs influences female frogs’ mating choices.&nbsp;“Maybe there&#8217;s a threshold of fluorescence intensity that is needed in order to elicit some kind of behavioral response,” she says.</p>
