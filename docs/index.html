<p>We’ve seen all kinds of articles that got published despite having references that don’t exist. But this was a new one: a paper with a made-up reference to the journal in which it appears.</p>



<p>While nonexistent references can indicate the use of a large language model in generating text, the authors maintain they used AI according to the journal’s guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-024-07752-6">letter to the editor</a>, published in December 2024 in <em>Intensive Care Medicine</em>, explored ways AI could help clinicians monitor blood circulation in patients in intensive care units. The 750-word letter included 15 references.</p>



<span id="more-134026"></span>



<p>We were able to locate the cited papers for five of the references, although one of them had an error in the publication year, and another had a different author order, page numbers and slight variations in the title. For the remaining 10, we couldn’t find articles with matching titles, either in the journal cited or any journal at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reference 11 was to a paper on integrating AI-driven hemodynamic monitoring in intensive care, published in <em>Intensive Care Medicine</em>. We could find no such article in the journal, nor any article in the journal by the listed authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Intensive Care Medicine</em> is the journal of the <a href="https://www.esicm.org/">European Society of Intensive Care Medicine</a> and published by Springer Nature. On November 4, the publisher <a href="https://archive.ph/YCCMJ">added an editor’s note</a> to the article stating “concerns regarding the presence of nonexistent references have been raised.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On November 29 the editor-in-chief retracted the letter, according to the notice. “The authors have stated that these non-existent references resulted from the use of generative AI to convert the PubMed IDs of cited articles into a structured reference list,” the notice states. “As a result, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the reliability of the contents of the article.”</p>



<p>The retraction notice also states “the peer review process had not been carried out in accordance with the journal’s editorial policies.”</p>



<p>Jordan Schilling, publishing director, medicine, for Springer Journals, told us the publisher first learned of concerns with the article in January 2025, but did not specify whether those concerns were with the references or peer review process. “Whilst we endeavour to complete our investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, we do with care to ensure the integrity of the scientific record,” Schilling said. “However, we appreciate that delays to investigations can be frustrating, and we apologise for the length of time taken in this case.”</p>



<p>Alexander Vlaar, professor of intensive care medicine at Amsterdam University Medical Center, and the corresponding author on the letter, referred us to his institution’s press office. “The content of the letter was original; no AI was used beyond what is allowed by the publisher,” press officer Edith Verheul told us by email. “In the retraction comment by the editor and publisher it is confirmed that these inaccuracies were the result of a formatting error caused by the permitted use of AI. For this reason, publishing a correction would have been a more appropriate response. However, this is a decision made by the editorial board, as they indicated that the review process was not properly followed. This, however, is beyond the authors’ control.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/134/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Title%20Page">journal’s author guidelines</a> do specify that large language models may be used for copy editing — and also note that the authors are ultimately responsible for the content:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The use of an LLM (or other AI-tool) for &#8220;AI assisted copy editing&#8221; purposes does not need to be declared. In this context, we define the term &#8220;AI assisted copy editing&#8221; as AI-assisted improvements to human-generated texts for readability and style, and to ensure that the texts are free of errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation and tone. These AI-assisted improvements may include wording and formatting changes to the texts, but do not include generative editorial work and autonomous content creation. In all cases, there must be human accountability for the final version of the text and agreement from the authors that the edits reflect their original work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While far from complete, the list of publications with fake references includes <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/02/fake-references-chatgpt-journal-academic-ethics-springer-nature-whistleblowing/">an article on whistleblowing</a> in an ethics journal (which has now been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-025-09630-2">retracted</a>), an article with a reference to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/21/springer-nature-flags-paper-with-fabricated-reference-to-article-not-written-by-our-cofounder/">a nonexistent article by one of our cofounders</a>, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">an entire book</a> full of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/28/challenge-accepted-a-reader-wrote-a-program-to-find-fake-references-in-books/">fake citations</a>.

<p>While plagiarism can sometimes be difficult to prove, stolen figures and identical metadata were the death knell for a recent article involving chicken mortality.</p>



<p>In September, the authors of a <a href="https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?AID=53723&amp;t=3&amp;dabs=Y&amp;redir=&amp;redirType=">2022 paper</a> in the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers’ journal <em>Applied Engineering in Agriculture</em> discovered a version of their article published by different authors in the <em>International Journal of Engineering Research &amp; Technology</em>. Both papers, which had identical titles, describe the development of a robot designed to assist with detecting and removing dead chickens from farms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although some of the text in the 2025 <em>IJERT</em> paper was altered, the images are the same as those from the ASABE paper, which has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The <em>IJERT </em>paper also replaced the word “broiler,” a chicken raised for meat production, with “grill,” including paraphrasing “broiler mortality” as “grill mortality” and “U.S. broiler industry” as “American grill business.” Such <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/24/google-ai-engineer-withdraws-arxiv-preprint-tortured-phrases-genai/">tortured phrases</a>, which occur when common phrases are transformed into nonsensical ones, can <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/01/bosom-peril-is-not-breast-cancer-how-weird-computer-generated-phrases-help-researchers-find-scientific-publishing-fraud/">indicate plagiarism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134018"></span>



<p>The original authors reached out to Joseph Walker, ASABE’s director of publications, who emailed <em>IJERT </em>about the suspect paper. The journal responded on October 1 saying they “found [the paper] copied” and would remove it in 24 hours, Walker told us. <em>IJERT </em>also banned the authors from publishing in the journal for the next two years. The three authors of the <em>IJERT</em> paper don’t have affiliations listed, and LinkedIn messages sent to the likely authors went unanswered.</p>



<p>The article was removed from the website after Walker contacted the journal and the page <a href="https://archive.is/I7e2c">read</a> “Retracted by Author.” After we reached out, the journal removed the paper’s page completely, although <a href="https://www.ijert.org/research/design-and-development-of-a-broiler-mortality-removal-robot-IJERTV14IS050033.pdf">the PDF remains online</a>.</p>



<p><em>IJERT</em> is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science and appeared on Beall’s list of potential predatory journals and publishers, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">went dark in 2017</a> but is <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walker pointed out the PDF property title for the <em>IJERT </em>article, “PAFS15013,” is the same as that for the ASABE paper. The author listed in the metadata for both files is “miller” — for the ASABE editor who created the PDF. The DOI on the retraction notice page links to Zenodo, an open repository. The <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/18106532">Zenodo page associated with the paper</a> has been removed by the owner for copyright infringement, it states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to a request we sent to <em>IJERT</em>, the journal said it uses an “in-house developed system to automatically screen submissions for similarity and potential plagiarism.” The email was signed “Editor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://ems.ijert.org/editorial-board"><em>IJERT’</em>s website</a> doesn’t list an editor-in-chief, but rather six managing editors and 14 associate editors. </p>



<p>The <em>IJERT</em> editor told us the article was retracted “after it was confirmed that portions of the content were improperly copied” from the ASABE paper.</p>

<p>The year 2026 did not start off kindly for <a href="https://rvu.edu.in/team/dr-vijayalakshmi-s/">Vijayalakshmi S</a>, an economics researcher at RV University in Bengaluru, India. She received a rejection letter from a journal noting that a paper of hers was highly similar to another published study by other researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>S couldn’t understand why that was — until she realised someone had somehow gotten hold of her study and published it as their own. She <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/drvijayalakshmis_retract-academicintegrity-academictheft-ugcPost-7413514795720716288-vKpV/">took to LinkedIn</a>, expressing her concerns and tagging the authors responsible. The post attracted a comment from another individual, also based in India, with inside knowledge of how paper mills work. Using keywords from S’s study, he found reasons to believe authorship slots on the stolen paper had been sold on Telegram for less than $200 each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After S’s LinkedIn post went live, she heard from someone apologizing on behalf of a researcher who had allegedly mistakenly published her paper as a coauthor. That person was now offering her a different study on a related topic that she could publish under her name.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134010"></span>



<p>“I was shocked to my core,” S told Retraction Watch. “He is telling me that he will give me a paper in exchange.” S disclosed the emails in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413915601611440128/">separate LinkedIn post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years earlier, in January 2024, S had submitted the study to <em>Discover Energy</em>, which ultimately rejected her paper during peer review, suggesting revisions. She also later presented it at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay’s (IIT Bombay) Young Scholar Initiative Conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know where this paper was leaked,” S said. She had decided against posting the paper as a preprint due to concerns that “blinded” peer reviewers who might later referee her manuscript at a journal could find out her identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted IIT Bombay for a comment but have received no response. Tim Kersjes, research integrity manager at Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Discover Energy</em>, said the publisher is investigating the concerns S raised.</p>



<p>In April 2024 – three months after S had submitted her paper to the Springer Nature journal – someone submitted the study to EnPress Publisher’s <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd"><em>Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development</em></a> (<em>JIPD</em>). It was <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/article/viewFile/5939/3988">published</a> in September 2024, listing authors based at institutions in Oman, India, and Saudi Arabia. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/30/in-four-years-a-psychosocial-counselor-co-authored-seven-papers-on-disparate-medical-topics-how/">Retraction Watch</a> and others have reported, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00344-w">unlikely co-authorship networks</a> can indicate the activity of&nbsp; <a href="https://cen.acs.org/research-integrity/One-academic-papers-journey-through/101/i29">paper mills</a>, which churn out subpar or plagiarized studies, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/russian-website-peddles-authorships-linked-reputable-journals">sell authorship slots</a>, and artificially inflate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01672-7">citations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2025, Scopus <a href="https://www.enpress-publisher.com/journal/JIPD/760/169#:~:text=Indexing%20of%20JIPD-,View%20All,longer%20be%20indexed%20in%20Scopus.">stopped indexing <em>JIPD</em></a>. Some observers <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_the_Journal_of_Infrastructure_Policy_and_Development_a_predatory_journal">have suggested</a> that may be because the journal has recently had a sudden surge in the number of papers it is publishing — often seen as a sign of lowering standards for publication.</p>



<p>S didn’t know that the <em>JIPD</em> paper presenting her work had gone live until she resubmitted her paper to a different journal. The editor there rejected it, noting that it had too many similarities to the <em>JIPD</em> paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After being pointed to the publication, S went through the whole article line by line and realised that every single data point she had used, all the literature she referenced, and the citations she included were the same. “This is not their paper at all,” she said. “This is my paper, which I have written without anybody’s help.”</p>



<p>S is now calling for the <em>JIPD </em>paper to be retracted. We reached out to one of <em>JIPD</em>’s associate editors, <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/about/editorialBoard">Jun Xie</a>, who is the president of the Asian Digital Development Bank and president of the Asia-Pacific Investment Development Bank, for a comment but didn’t hear back.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://ccba.du.edu.om/mohammed-ahmar-uddin/">Mohammed Ahmar Uddin</a> of Dhofar University in Salalah, Oman, who is listed as the first author on the <em>JIPD </em>paper, told us the study was checked for plagiarism before publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The data used in the research were publicly available from government sources,” Uddin said. “Furthermore, several published research studies are already available related to this topic and our research was aimed at providing additional insights. Upon receiving the complaint I have also written to the journal and [am] awaiting their reply.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with us, Uddin denied that he bought an authorship slot on the paper or being in touch with any paper mill. Uddin said he doesn’t know any of the listed coauthors and was introduced to them via a mutual researcher contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On my part, I assure you that I am capable enough and would never consider publishing a paper by dubious means,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The man who discovered that S’s paper was probably sold on Telegram knew about paper mills because he had had personal experience with one. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutosh-ind/?originalSubdomain=in">Ashutosh Tiwari</a>, who runs the counseling firm <a href="https://mindglass.in/">Mindglass WellBeing</a>, told us that after he saw S’s post about her study having been stolen, he searched keywords from the <em>JIPD </em>paper on Telegram and <a href="https://t.me/paperpublicationopportunity">found a matching advertisement</a> dated December 29. Authorship slots had been sold for 15,000 Indian rupees (INR; around $165) for first author, 10,000 INR ($110) for second author, and 5,000 INR ($55) for the remaining slots, Tiwari said. </p>



<p>Tiwari knew about the inner workings of paper mills because he had previously himself used the services of such a shady service without realising it was unethical. Although the paper Tiwari ultimately published was his own, he paid 10,000 INR with the hope of receiving help in publishing quickly in a journal indexed by Scopus.</p>



<p>“I was not guided in the family, in my friend circle, [on] how to write, [or] how to submit,” he said. Tiwari ultimately retracted that study and republished it after revisions in a different journal. “That was a fast process because I requested them that it is a matter of my Ph.D.,” he said.</p>



<p><em>Update, January 27, 2026: The authorship ad on Telegram listed the second author fee as 10,000 INR, not 15,000, as previously stated.  </em></p>

The Institutional Award went to the <strong>Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative</strong>, a nationwide effort to systematically evaluate research results in laboratory biology and the largest coordinated replication effort in the field worldwide, showcasing the transformative potential of country-level research improvement efforts. The Early Career Award was won by <strong>Maximilian Sprang </strong>for his project <strong><em>Erring Rigorously</em></strong>, which improves reproducibility in functional genomics by distinguishing true biological signals from technical errors in high-throughput sequencing.</p>

                Imagine two children born in the same year, into families with similar incomes, but living in US states where income is distributed very differently. One grows up where income is fairly evenly distributed; the other where a small portion of people hold most of the wealth. According to a new analysis of brain scans from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, this broader social environment — measured with each state’s Gini coefficient — is linked to notable differences in...
