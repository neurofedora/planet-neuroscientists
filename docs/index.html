<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="324" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-1024x324.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129521" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-1024x324.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-300x95.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-768x243.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>A committee of scholars in Finland has decided to downgrade 271 journals from Frontiers and MDPI in their quality rating system, in a move that may discourage researchers from submitting manuscripts to the outlets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both publishers criticized the move, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/finland-downgrades-mdpi-and-frontiers-will-others-follow-suit">first reported</a> in <em>Times Higher Education</em>, as lacking transparency and seeming to target fully open-access publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finland’s Publication Forum (JUFO) “is a rating and classification system to support the quality assessment of research output,” which factors into government funding for universities, according to its website. “The objective is to encourage Finnish scholars and researchers to publish their research outcomes in high-level domestic and foreign forums.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130575"></span>



<p>JUFO rates journals on a scale from 1 to 3, with higher ratings corresponding to more points for funding. Publications in titles rated “<a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/faq-0#Q5">level 0</a>” count the same as popular articles or scientific articles that haven’t been peer-reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, as we reported, JUFO <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/28/finland-group-downgrades-60-journals/">downgraded 60 journals</a>, most of them from MDPI, from level 1 to level 0  after soliciting feedback from researchers about their experiences with the quality of publications in scientific journals.</p>



<p>JFUO later <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/grey-area-journals-level-0">decided it would downgrade</a> MDPI and Frontiers journals to level 0 in 2025, calling the publications “grey area journals” which “make use of the APC (Article Processing Charge) operating model and aim to increase the number of publications with the minimum time spend for editorial work and quality assessment.” The announcement continued: </p>



<p>One of the most important changes in scientific publishing in Finland is the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/publication-volume-decreased-mdpi-journals">sharp increase in the number of articles</a> published especially in MDPI and Frontiers open access journals operating with APC fees. The scientific community’s key concern is, whether the costs of open access publishing increases unreasonably, and whether the increase happens at the expense of a thorough quality assessment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 16, JUFO released a <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/sites/default/files/2024-12/List%20of%20journals%20to%20be%20downgraded%20to%20level%200.pdf">list</a> of 271 journals that will be downgraded to level 0 next year, 193 from MDPI and 78 from Frontiers. Based on suggestions from discipline-specific panels of experts, JUFO kept 16 MDPI and 22 Frontiers journals at level 1, the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/changes-classification">announcement</a> stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are deeply concerned by JUFO&#8217;s recent decision and find it challenging to understand the objectivity of the applied criteria,” Giulia Stefenelli, scientific communications lead for MDPI, said in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MDPI-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch. “The simultaneous downgrade of 271 journals suggests a generalized evaluation process rather than a fair assessment of each journal’s merit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, the sudden death of a young MDPI employee <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/22/young-employees-death-puts-workplace-culture-in-spotlight-at-publisher-mdpi/">raised questions about the workplace culture at the company</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Frontiers-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, Shirley Dent, head of public relations for Frontiers, said all of the publisher’s downgraded journals meet JUFO’s criteria for level 1 ranking. “Targeting” publishers with author-funded open-access models “is both unfair and arbitrary – the assessment ranking of journals should simply be based on the quality and value of services provided,” Dent said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dent also said JUFO’s statement on their decision “does not provide any evidence” but points to “hearsay, anecdote and discredited lists.” Frontiers did not receive any “substantial feedback” about issues to address, “which is the core criterion of any evaluation process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“​​The decision can only be interpreted as an attack on a publishing model, rather than as an assessment of journal quality,”  she said, in comments <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2024/12/19/institutional-journal-lists-place-an-unfair-burden-on-publishers/">echoing those by Frontiers&#8217; Fred Fenter in the LSE Impact Blog</a>.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png"><img decoding="async" width="365" height="480" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130571" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png 365w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martin Gleave</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A high-profile Canadian urologist received an editorial expression of concern for one of his papers this month, after anonymous comments on PubPeer flagged suspected data duplication in dozens of his articles. </p>



<p>By our count, sleuths have flagged <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=gleave">30 papers</a> co-authored by Martin Gleave, a professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and co-founder of the Vancouver Prostate Centre. According to the posts on PubPeer, images in these studies appear “much more similar than expected” based on analyses using the similarity detection software ImageTwin. The issues include similarities within individual papers and across multiple publications, with some comments suggesting the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0D5681C40B524E650ACBC095B0A627#">alleged reuse of tumor specimens</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gleave, an appointee to the Order of Canada for his work developing treatments for prostate cancer, has received more than $120 million (approximately $84 million USD) in funding throughout his career, according to his profile on the Vancouver Prostate Centre website. He is also a co-founder of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, with several of the findings from the flagged papers connected to the company and related patents.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130569"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Gleave stated, “We are taking the comments seriously, and assessing them internally now,” adding it would take “a couple of months to understand and respond to the issues.” He declined to speculate on how the mistakes might have occurred, writing that he couldn’t provide insights “at this time,” but maintained the errors did not affect the findings or conclusions of the papers.</p>



<p>A media representative at the University of British Columbia acknowledged the PubPeer comments, but declined to comment on whether the works were under investigation, stating the university does not “discuss employee matters.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This month, the<em> British Journal of Cancer</em>, a Springer Nature publication, published an expression of concern for the 2012 paper “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2012209">Clusterin inhibition using OGX-011 synergistically enhances antitumour activity of sorafenib in a human renal cell carcinoma model</a>.” The paper, a collaboration between Gleave and researchers from Kobe University in Japan, is one of the 30 flagged on PubPeer. It has been cited 36 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-024-02918-x">journal’s notice</a> cites “concerns” about similarities between Western blots meant to represent different experimental conditions. The expression of concern follows a June post on PubPeer in which an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08A295E42FAFF9BBA26D466706DDEB#">anonymous commenter</a> had reported the similarities, which appeared to involve horizontal and vertical resizing of the images. According to the journal, the original data are no longer available, and “Readers are therefore advised to interpret these results with caution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four more of the 30 papers are published in other Springer Nature journals:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>A spokesperson from Springer Nature, Alice Kay, confirmed the publisher is “aware of the concerns and [is] looking into them” and said editors would decide on appropriate action once they had established the facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another of Gleave’s papers, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283813013808">Suppression of Heat Shock Protein 27 Using OGX-427 Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Potentiates Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors to Delay Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer</a>”, published in <em>European Urology </em>in 2014<em>,</em> was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283816002712?via%3Dihub">corrected</a> in 2016 for mislabeling and duplication of data. But the journal doesn’t appear to have addressed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2D45B0398BD26B918696E6F368EC7#">the more recent concerns</a> about additional data duplications.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Gleave%22+%2B+%22dong%22">Several of the papers</a> flagged originated from the lab of Xuesen Dong, a frequent co-author with Gleave and a senior research scientist at the Vancouver Prostate Centre and professor at the University of British Columbia. They include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/92D29150742BE3C36895DB0543D53C#">Consensus PP1 binding motifs regulate transcriptional corepression and alternative RNA splicing activities of the steroid receptor coregulators, p54nrb and PSF</a>, <em>Molecular Endocrinology</em>, 2011</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/502BA68BFA9EAC0588A0DB91704488#">Prostate stromal cells express the progesterone receptor to control cancer cell mobility</a>, <em>PLoS ONE</em>, 2014</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D8AC95DB6BFB09699C8FE5714247AD#">UGT2B17 Expedites Progression of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancers by Promoting Ligand-Independent AR Signaling</a>, <em>Cancer Research</em>, 2016</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FE78FF07944B56112DBD6260CE02F6#">Catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II suppress the androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer progression</a>, <em>Oncotarget</em>, 2015</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7F3F271CAEDF3B7DF8E0DF4913118E#">Downregulation of c-SRC kinase CSK promotes castration resistant prostate cancer and pinpoints a novel disease subclass</a>, <em>Oncotarget</em>, 2015</li>



<li><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1D20E72C797DE6EFCB2CCA9862BA02#">Expression and function of the progesterone receptor in human prostate stroma provide novel insights to cell proliferation control</a>, <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</em>, 2013</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first five papers listed above, Dong attributed the errors to students who “inadvertently inserted incorrect images into the figures,” he wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. He explained most of the issues involve Western blots, “which can appear very similar” or originate from “experiments with comparable designs. The images “were often labeled with file names that differed by only one letter or a small detail,” he stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Compounding the issue, many of these incorrect images were part of larger composite figures containing up to 30 subfigures, which made the errors more challenging to identify,” he added. Dong also said the method his lab used to develop Western blots may have contributed to “flipped images being saved and later incorporated into figures.”</p>



<p>Addressing concerns about the final paper in question, published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism </em>in 2013, Dong claimed “there is no mistake” in the figure referenced in the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1D20E72C797DE6EFCB2CCA9862BA02#">PubPeer comment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, <em>Oncotarget</em> contacted Dong in late June regarding “image irregularities” in two of his papers published in the journal. That followed <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/A14D808A9A8155FA23A7522AC05140#2">anonymous</a> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/FE78FF07944B56112DBD6260CE02F6#2">comments</a> on PubPeer detailing similarities between images earlier the same month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the 2015 paper “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/4279/text/">Downregulation of c-SRC kinase CSK promotes castration resistant prostate cancer and pinpoints a novel disease subclass</a>” published in <em>Oncotarget</em>, Dong echoed the explanation he provided to Retraction Watch. He told the journal manager the project “involved a large amount of immunoblotting assays, and all loading controls looked similar. Therefore the two actin images were mistakenly inserted.” He added, “Regardless, these minor mistakes did not affect the conclusion we have drawn.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/4105/text/">Catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II suppress the androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer progression</a>,” another 2015 paper in <em>Oncotarget</em>, the journal pointed out similarities to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2014303">an earlier publication</a> in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>. Dong explained that the first author, Haolong Li, had been working on the two publications simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Each project involved a large amount of western blotting assays,” he told the journal. “And all images for the loading controls look very similar and easily misplaced.” No corrections have yet been posted for the <em>Oncotarget </em>papers, and the journal has not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late November, Dong’s co-authors reached out to the other three journals which published papers containing erroneous data to request corrections, according to emails shared with Retraction Watch. None so far has been corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another 14 of Gleave’s papers flagged on PubPeer were published in American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) journals, with six of them in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. In an email, Christine Battle, publisher and vice president of scientific publications at AACR, wrote they would be examining the articles and will correct or retract if required.</p>

<p>The authors of an influential but controversial 2020 paper on the activity of bat coronaviruses in China which proposed the animals as a “likely origin” for the virus that causes COVID-19 have retracted their work and republished a revised version of the analysis. They say their results and conclusions did not change.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17687-3">Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China</a>,” appeared Aug. 25, 2020, in <em>Nature Communications</em>. It has been cited 154 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and by at least two <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/88830779/policy-documents">international policy documents</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are affiliated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the New York City-based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which has come under intense scrutiny by members of the U.S. Congress and others. The U.S. government in May <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/federal-officials-suspend-funding-ecohealth-alliance-nonprofit-entangled-covid-19">suspended</a> funding for EcoHealth amid concerns the COVID-19 pandemic virus may have developed from research on which the nonprofit and Wuhan lab collaborated – a so-called “lab leak.” EcoHealth has denied the pandemic virus could have emerged from its work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130566"></span>



<p>Peter Daszak, a corresponding author of the paper and president of EcoHealth, told Retraction Watch the researchers had discovered dozens of the more than 1,000 viral sequences in the paper didn’t come from China, but from “a few miles over the border” in Laos. He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Given that bats on both sides of the border likely co-mingle, and that our initial analyses were conducted by zoogeographic regions which encompass cross-border populations, we did not expect that the inclusion of these samples changed any conclusions substantially. However, given that the title and focus of the paper was for CoVs from bats in China, the authors decided to remove the 41 Laotian sequences, and repeat all of the paper’s analyses. During this process, we were also able to remove 29 sequences that were duplicated in the Genbank database. As expected, the results did not change substantially, and the conclusions remain the same.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nature Communications</em> published the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55384-7">revised analysis</a> on December 19, along with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55454-w">retraction notice</a> for the original article. The abstracts of the original and revised papers are identical, except for the number of viral sequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors learned of the erroneously included sequences “months after publication,” Daszak said. He did not immediately respond to our questions about when his group informed the journal, or whether they considered publishing an expression of concern while they conducted the new analysis.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/china.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="268" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/china.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-51247" style="width:300px"/></a></figure></div>


<p><em>The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation </em>(<em>JHLT</em>) has decided against retracting a November 2024 paper that&nbsp; violated the ethics policy of the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publishing the paper, which describes a new mechanical circulatory support device used to treat heart failure that was developed in China, staff at the journal realised two of the patients in the study had received organ transplants in that country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dozens of research articles have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/">been retracted or flagged</a> for appearing to have used organs procured from executed prisoners in China, and many journals around the world have introduced policies to avoid such research. <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement, published in 2022, bans data on human organ transplants from journals or scientific sessions when they originate from countries, particularly China, where organ procurement from prisoners has been observed.</p>



<span id="more-130542"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01664-4/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">study</a>, “Long-term outcomes of a novel fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device for the treatment of advanced heart failure in China,” has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s abstract was initially presented at the annual meeting of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, which runs the journal, said cardiologist <a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/joseph-g-rogers/">Joseph Rogers</a>, president and chief executive officer of the Texas Heart Institute and the editor-in-chief of <em>JHLT</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a “lengthy debate,” Rogers said, the editors decided retracting the paper would be an “inappropriate response” despite the journal’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>“We didn’t want to convey to the readership that there was something scientifically invalid about the paper,” Rogers said. “That’s not true. The paper was scientifically valid.”</p>



<p>The journal also printed <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01804-7/abstract">two editorials</a>, one by the journal’s then interim editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/michelle-kittleson-309129.html">Michelle Kittleson</a> of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who initially accepted the study, and the other about <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)01803-5/abstract?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email">the journal’s ethics statement</a>, signed by the <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Retraction Watch</em> has reached out to <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/savitri-fedson-21192">Savitri Fedson</a>, of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a co-author of the editorial about <em>JHLT</em>’s ethics statement.</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal published the editorials to recognise <em>JHLT </em>missed the issue and had violated its own ethics commitments. If the issue was spotted beforehand, he noted, <em>JHLT </em>would have rejected the study. Going forward, the journal has put in “additional safeguards” to prevent violation of the ethics statement, Rogers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1141521/overview">Shengshou Hu</a>, the study’s corresponding author, who is based at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>As part of the safeguards, all papers are now sent to Rogers, who desk-rejects any papers involving human organ transplants in China, he said. That step is particularly&nbsp; important, he noted, because peer reviewers working for the journal are not required to read the publication’s ethics statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers said the journal contacted the study’s authors. “What we really wanted to do was reassure them that the reason that we were editorializing their paper in this manner was not because of the scientific content of the paper,” he added. “It was really a failure of our internal checks and balances that allowed that paper to move forward.”</p>

The authors of the report describe ecological medicine as “the structured and deliberate use of connectedness and interaction with plants, animals, and other species to generate a therapeutic effect for individuals.” While few would doubt the value of spending time in the natural world, the suggestion that we need medicine to mediate our connection to nature is a striking one. Surely nothing could be more direct and immediate than the sense of awe we feel when we gaze upon the vast night sky, or the sense of renewal we feel when wandering in a spring meadow? And surely, too, it is more than just our health that is affected by this engagement; <em>we </em>are affected.</p><p>That the concept of ecological medicine seems to be pointing at something so familiar, and yet seems to be expressing it in such a striking and novel manner, gives us pause to reflect. How have we arrived at a point in our civilisation where it seems sensible to describe as a medical discovery the idea that “other species are worthy of respect”, and that the recognition of inter-species reciprocity that is enabled by participating in ecological medicine “serves to counteract some of the societal elements contributing to society’s epidemic of mental health problems”?</p><p>This manner of approaching our sense of connection with nature is, arguably, emblematic of a sweeping cultural trend: </p><div><blockquote> We appear to be losing our grasp on ways of conceiving of human flourishing other than in medical terms. </blockquote></div><p>Today, we speak of ‘mental health’, often treating this as synonymous with the notion of flourishing itself. To accept the notions of ‘mental health’ and ‘flourishing’ as synonymous with each other involves a commitment to the conjunction of the following two claims:</p><div>C1: To be mentally healthy is to flourish; and</div><div>C2: To flourish is to be mentally healthy.</div><p>C1 takes mental health to be sufficient for flourishing, whilst C2 takes it to be a necessary condition. C1 is the stronger of the two claims insofar as it asserts that nothing else—apart from being mentally healthy—is required for human flourishing. C2, unlike C1, allows for the possibility that there may be <em>other </em>conditions besides that of mental health that are also necessary for human flourishing—conditions pertaining to other domains of value such as ethics or aesthetics (domains that are of course salient in our connection with nature). But even the weaker claim, C2, imports a medical connotation into our conception of human flourishing that would have once seemed novel, perhaps even puzzling. Aristotle in the <em>Eudaimian Ethics</em>, for instance, takes health (like wealth or honour) to be a means by which we might come to flourish, rather than as tantamount to flourishing itself. How did this connotation appear, signalling the shift towards the medicalisation of our understanding of what it means to flourish?</p><p>Here is one story of the origin of this connotation (told by Martin Seligman, a founding father of the positive psychology movement): if (severely) distressing emotional experiences are cast as states of pathology, as contemporary psychiatry does, then it isn’t a huge leap (although it is a <em>substantive </em>one) from this claim to the idea that being in a state opposite to this—that is, enjoying a preponderance of pleasant emotional experiences—amounts to a state of wellness, a state of wellbeing, indeed a state of flourishing. This chain of inference is one of the major paths we have taken that has led us towards the medicalisation of our conception of flourishing. If this is right, then recovering alternate, non-medicalised conceptions of human flourishing, conceptions that might well return to us the expressive power to capture (amongst other things) our immediate connection with nature that we intuit, will involve a dissection of the concept of emotional disorder.</p><p>What, then, is the basis of the claim that (severely) distressing emotional states constitute states of pathology? From what general concept of disorder is this identification derived, and in light of what conception of our emotional lives might this identification be motivated?&nbsp;Surprising lines of inquiry emerge in the course of this exploration, all of which point to the pivotal role that our emotions play in the myriad ways we appraise our lives and make sense of ourselves. One particular line is worth mentioning here: it is often assumed that the medicalisation of our understanding of human flourishing signifies progress, at least in the sense that it yields an understanding that is informed by scientific knowledge. But this line of inquiry invites us to consider whether human flourishing is something we should seek to understand exclusively in scientific terms (as the invocation of the idea of progress implies). Indeed, is it something we should seek to understand in scientific terms at all? A systematic investigation of the value of emotions in human life suggests that there are visions of human flourishing that invite, indeed compel, not the detachment of the scientific gaze, but our immersion in life through the exercise of our rational agency. It is in appreciating the trade-offs between these alternative conceptions of human flourishing, and the appraisals they lead us to make of our emotional experiences, that we arrive at a clearer reflective understanding of our current predicament. It is in so doing that we may recover our power to express the immediate connection we feel with nature when we plant an acorn and tend its growth.</p><p>My aim is not to argue in favour of any particular conception of flourishing—and so I do not, for instance, claim that it is a mistake to medicalise our sense of connection with nature. It is rather to display as perspicuously as possible some of the conceptual structures that guide our ongoing quest to live happier and more enlightened lives. This quest has, for the most part, taken a very distinctive shape over the past half century: we pour billions of dollars each year into the enterprise of improving our ‘mental health’. It is ultimately for us to decide, individually and collectively, whether thinking of our flourishing in terms of the notion of ‘mental health’ is a good thing to do—rather than being, merely, something we’ve simply ended up doing.</p><p><em><sub>Featured Image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@cmdor?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Sébastien Bourguet</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-brown-and-red-beans-sxrpceiAKts?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909669284/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/909669284/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f12%2fphoto-1510950109928-f3aac6afbb03-1-273x194.avif"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/909669284/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/jolly-yule/">Jolly Yule</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/a-look-behind-the-curtain-at-the-best-books-of-2024/">A look behind the curtain at the best books of 2024</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/12/does-the-get-italics/">Does &#8220;the&#8221; get italics?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="768" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-129213" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere.jpeg 576w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chemosphere-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></figure></div>


<p><em>Chemosphere</em>, the Elsevier title which in September published an article on “unexpected exposure to toxic flame retardants in household items” such as black plastic cooking utensils, has been removed from Clarivate’s Web of Science index in its December update. </p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524022173">From e-waste to living space: Flame retardants contaminating household items add to concern about plastic recycling</a>,” received heavy international media coverage questioning whether we should all throw out our black plastic spatulas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors corrected their calculations in a December 15 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X">corrigendum</a>, as reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>. The exposure was an order of magnitude lower than the safe daily reference dose, not approaching it, as they had initially reported, but “this calculation error does not affect the overall conclusion of the paper,” the authors wrote in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130550"></span>



<p>Meanwhile, Clarivate, the scholarly publication data company behind metrics such as the journal impact factor, removed <em>Chemosphere</em> from its Web of Science index December 16 for failing to meet editorial <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">quality criteria</a>. Clarivate places journals “on hold” from indexing for a reevaluation period before removing them, and has recently put <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/24/elife-latest-in-string-of-major-journals-put-on-hold-from-web-of-science/">other major journals</a> “on hold” as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Chemosphere</em> has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;qs=%22retraction%22&amp;years=2024&amp;sortBy=date">retracted eight articles</a> this month and published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;qs=%22expression%20of%20concern%22&amp;years=2024&amp;lastSelectedFacet=years">60 expressions of concern</a> since April. As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">noted elsewhere</a>, removing a journal from Web of Science means Clarivate will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a>, as universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions.</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson said the publisher’s ethics team is “conducting in-depth investigations” of “potential breaches of <em>Chemosphere’s</em> publishing policies. According to a June <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/chemosphere/about/news/commitment-to-research-integrity-and-publishing-ethics">announcement</a> from the journal, these breaches included “unusual authorship changes, compromised or manipulated peer-review processes, and undisclosed conflicts of interest.” The spokesperson continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are addressing the concerns raised during the investigation and are committed to correcting the scientific record in a responsible and transparent manner. We will continue to work with Clarivate to assist in their re-evaluation in due course.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a December 12 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/chemosphere/about/news/discover-the-decisive-steps-we-are-taking-to-ensure-research-integrity">news update</a>, the journal laid out steps it would take as a result of the investigation, including retracting articles and publishing expressions of concern.</p>

<p>An engineer accused of being involved in paper mill activities mysteriously reappeared on a list of editorial board members at Springer Nature’s <em>Scientific Reports </em>earlier this year, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The journal had “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/">parted ways</a>” with the engineer, Masoud Afrand of the Islamic Azad University in Iran, in March 2022 after an internal audit found “irregularities” in how he handled papers, editor-in-chief Rafal Marszalek told us last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of “an oversight,” however, Afrand remained on the publication’s website until <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">a story</a> by Retraction Watch and Undark raised concerns about his work last year.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130539"></span>



<p>Our story quoted sleuth Alexander Magazinov saying Afrand “was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in <em>Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences</em>,” in which Afrand was cited more than 130 times. Magazinov later expanded on his suspicions in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#:~:text=July%2012%2C%202023%20at%201%3A22%20am">a comment</a> on our site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But at some point this year, Afrand, who has not responded to emails seeking comment, was back on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214124738/https:/www.nature.com/srep/about/editors"><em>Scientific Reports</em>’ website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a December 15 email copying Retraction Watch and fellow sleuth Dorothy Bishop, among others, Magazinov wrote to Marszalek to ask why Afrand had apparently been reinstated. Marszalek replied:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr Afrand left Scientific Reports Editorial Board in 2022, and this remains true to this day (i.e. he has not been re-instated). However, as a result of clerical mistakes, he was not removed from our homepage (though has been properly retired in 2022 from all other systems), and this has been rectified now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bishop countered in a December 16 email to Marszalek that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>contrary to what you say, Dr Afrand was removed from the home Editors webpage in 2022, and was still absent in June 2024 [as evidenced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240609132634/https:/www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">this archived webpage</a>]. However, his name did reappear some time in the summer of 2024. I checked with the Wayback machine, and he was absent from the list at the start of 2024 through to June 2024, but was present in September 2024 [&#8230;] This is a strange kind of clerical error.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek offered no explanation, telling Bishop only:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I appreciate you flagging that. At this point I can only confirm that Dr Afrand has not been a member of Scientific Reports Editorial Board and has not handled any content since 2022. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek told us he did not have “much more to add than what I told Dr Bishop.”</p>
