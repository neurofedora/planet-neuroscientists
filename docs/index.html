<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, two science journalists had an idea for a blog about retractions. And on Aug. 3, 2010, Retraction Watch launched, detailing in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/08/03/why-write-a-blog-about-retractions/">the first post</a> why retractions matter. </p>



<p>And now, 15 years and 6,700 posts later, that work seems more important than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are gratified every day to see Retraction Watch driving the conversation on integrity in scientific research. Our work has provided the foundation for stories on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/scientific-journals-quality-publishers-6399fc95">mass resignations</a> at journals, how <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-scanning-error-created-a-fake-science-term-now-ai-wont-let-it-die-2000590659">fake phrases</a> end up in the literature, the retraction of a paper claiming evidence for <a href="https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/article-860552">an ancient comet</a> with Biblical ties. We’ve gotten shoutouts in <em>Science</em>, which included <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-guidance-authors-engaging-media">links to our stories</a> as examples for scientists of how to respond constructively to critiques of their work, and in <em>Nature, </em>which urged universities to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00509-1">examine their own retraction data</a>.</p>



<span id="more-132464"></span>



<p>Journalists turn to us to comment on issues such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04253-w">“publish or perish”</a> culture, the Trump administration’s call for government scientists to <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.substack.com/p/demoralizing-and-paralyzing-scientists">withdraw in-press manuscripts</a>, and of course on the recent high-profile retraction of the “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fifteen-years-later-science-retracts-arsenic-life-paper-despite-study-authors">arsenic-life”</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02325-z">paper</a> in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The Retraction Watch Database was central to recent studies looking at retractions in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-024-8233-7">specific</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831119">fields</a> and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468781225000645?via%3Dihub">certain clinical practice guidelines</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448">anomalies in citations</a> universities use in their rankings, retractions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00455-y">by institution</a>, retraction rates <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00353/127805/The-Retraction-Gender-Gap-Are-Mixed-Teams-More">by gender</a>, and even <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Report-to-Appropriations-Committee-on-Scholarly-Publishing-and-Public-Access-Implementation.pdf">a report to the U.S. Congress</a> by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky penned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/rfk-kennedy-vaccines-scientific-literature/681681/">an editorial</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> on how citing literature can be manipulated for any cause, and an article in <em>American Scientist </em>about <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/retraction-reactions">how researchers respond </a>to retractions; Ivan wrote in <em>Quillette </em>about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2025/04/21/when-do-scholarly-retractions-become-a-form-of-censorship/">politicization of retractions</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the Council of Science Editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/06/retraction-watch-awarded-council-of-science-editors-highest-honor/">honored us</a> with the 2025 Award for Meritorious Achievement. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/06/meet-retraction-watchs-two-new-journalists/">hired</a> two fulltime journalists. We’ve published stories with partners, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/data-manipulations-alleged-study-paved-way-microsoft-s-quantum-chip">including</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise"><em>Science</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224"><em>The Conversation</em></a>. More than 4 million people came to our website. Our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/">Retraction Watch Database</a> surpassed 60,000 entries, more than any other such repository. Our <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/our-projects/retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Hijacked Journal Checker</a> is up to 345 journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we’re celebrating on our 15th anniversary is the growth and expansion of our parent nonprofit, <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a>. We announced three exciting new projects this year:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/our-projects/elisabeth-bik-fund/">Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund</a>, launched with the proceeds of Bik’s Einstein Award, is providing financial resources to Bik and other sleuths and collaborators, as well as funding for training programs, grants, or awards for science integrity advocates. Read more about it <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/renowned-scientific-integrity-investigator-endows-fund-support-fellow-sleuths">in <em>Science</em></a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Our <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuth in Residence Program</a> expanded our team to include David Robert Grimes and Mariana Ribeiro, who are bringing their research expertise to the dozens of tips we receive. The goal of the program is to build capacity in this space to emphasize the value of compensating and protecting the critical work of sleuths.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>And we launched the <a href="https://medicalevidenceproject.org/">Medical Evidence Project</a>, to investigate and rapidly disseminate problems in the medical literature that directly affect human health. Led by James Heathers, the project will leverage the tools of forensic metascience to identify problems in scientific articles, combined with the experience and platform of Retraction Watch to publicize those findings. Read more about it in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01739-z"><em>Nature</em></a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/06/25/meet-sciences-new-fraud-fighter-00421851"><em>Politico</em></a> and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/06/12/un-projet-pour-nettoyer-la-litterature-medicale-des-etudes-douteuses_6612453_1650684.html?search-type=classic&amp;ise_click_rank=2"><em>Le Monde</em></a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>And, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/job-opportunities/">we’re hiring more staff</a> to support all our projects.</p>



<p>We’re thrilled by this growth, and look forward to seeing where these projects take us. And we have some exciting ideas of other ways we can continue to keep individuals, institutions and publishers accountable.</p>



<p>None of this would have been possible without you, our readers, who value and support our work. Here’s a way you can continue to support us to keep us going for the next 15 years:</p>



<p><strong>For our 15th anniversary, we’re aiming to raise $15,000. </strong></p>



<p>A fair chunk of our budget comes from individual donations. These funds help pay freelancers to report stories, for public records requests, for tech tools to help us do our jobs, and much more. And because such donations are typically unrestricted, they can fill in the gaps where needed, and extend the life of grant-funded projects, leaving us more time to do the work rather than fundraise.</p>



<p>As an added incentive, for a limited time, <strong>your donation will be matched, up to $7,500</strong>. Every dollar counts, and for this fundraising cycle, your dollars will count double!</p>



<p>Retraction Watch stories have always been free, and we are committed to keeping it that way. Show your support and appreciation for the work we do by donating at the link below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to make a tax-deductible contribution to support our work? For donations to Retraction Watch or The Center for Scientific Integrity, donate <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1909130">here using Paypal</a> or <a href="https://the-center-for-scientific-integrity.square.site/">here using Square</a>. You can also donate directly to the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/NPCVYBMC6G7XW47GKMVJ4D3H">Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund</a>, the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/A5DINJ5GJL6IC72H6YXF6PE7">Medical Evidence Project</a>, the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/4CYWDUCYBL33I7U3HAQJD3YF">Sleuths in Residence Program</a>, or the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/RUB6DXONZMZX52GISYSGJWKN">Hijacked Journal Tracker</a> using those links. And thanks! </p>

<p>A journal purporting to be “cited by esteemed scholars and scientists all around the world” claims a false impact factor and attempts to charge authors a fee for withdrawing articles, Retraction Watch has learned. And the editor in chief publicly disavows any relationship with the title on his website.</p>



<p>The <em>International Journal of Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Computation</em>, or <em>IJSIEC</em>, <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/swarm-intelligence-evolutionary-computation.html">claims to publish</a> research on robotics, AI, “bacterial forging [sic],” bioinformatics and computing, among other topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Retraction Watch reader brought the journal to our attention earlier this month. The researcher had submitted a paper to the journal but then noticed some red flags. Among them: One of the two listed editors-in-chief, Qiangfu Zhao, states on <a href="https://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/~qf-zhao/">his website,</a> “some journals are using my name to attract academic papers. I have no relation with these journals.” Zhao, a professor at the University of Aizu in Aizuwakamatsu, Japan, confirmed to us he has “no relation with this journal.”</p>



<span id="more-132458"></span>



<p>When the author asked the journal to withdraw his manuscript during the review process, the journal said the researcher would have to pay €1219, the equivalent of around $1,400, within a week, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Swarm-Intelligence-email_Redacted.pdf">an email</a> we have seen. The researcher, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the publisher, refused, at which point the journal published the paper — and then retracted it.</p>



<p><em>IJSIEC </em>is one of <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/scientific-journals-list.html">77 journals</a> published by Walsh Medical Media, a “global leader” in open access publishing, <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/">according to the company’s website</a>. Although it bills itself as a “healthcare publishing company dedicated to providing physicians” with research “directly relevant to patient care,” its journals have specialties such as <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/advanced-chemical-engineering.html">chemical engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/coastal-development.html">coastal zone management</a>, and <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/intellectual-property-rights.html">intellectual property rights</a>. </p>



<p>Neither <em>IJSIEC </em>nor Walsh Medical Media responded to our multiple requests for comment to two listed emails associated with the journal and publisher, WhatsApp and the online communication form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal lists its impact factor as 1.61, despite not being indexed in Clarivate, the company responsible for assigning that metric. None of Walsh Medical Media’s journals are covered by Scopus, although<em> IJSIEC</em> lists a CiteScore on their website. <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/what-is-citescore-and-why-should-you-care-about-it">CiteScore</a> is a citation metric developed by Elsevier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its “universally prominent” editorial board members, while real people, are not associated with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The listed executive editor, <a href="https://pankajmishra000.github.io/000/">Pankaj Mishra</a>, is a researcher at the University of Udine in Italy, according to his website. He did not respond to our request for comment regarding his association with the journal; however, the picture on the <em>IJSIEC</em> website is of <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/pankaj-mishra-in-conversation-with-ian-buruma">novelist and writer Pankaj Mishra</a>. His bio on the <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/editor/pankaj-mishra-16438">journal’s website</a> has a link to an “Interview session” with Mishra but opens to a <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/admin/editor-interviews/16438-pankaj-mishra-interview.JPG">screenshot</a> of an email from Udine’s Mishra agreeing to be editor of a special issue. The email appears to have been sent to his university-affiliated email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other editor-in-chief is researcher <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0755-1046">Pandian Vasant</a>, who prominently lists his position as editor of the Springer Nature journal <em>Intelligent Computing and Optimization</em> on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasant/?originalSubdomain=my">his LinkedIn</a> profile —&nbsp; with no mention of <em>IJSIEC.</em> Vasant did not respond to our request for comment confirming his association with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the publisher’s purported address is in London, the ISSN listed on the journal’s cover <a href="https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2090-4908#">registers to Egypt</a> – and with a typo in the journal name. A search of the title with no typos was not registered to any ISSN. The company’s director Anitha Mavudi is also listed as the director of <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/fvS7xVbmQJzmM6Oz7Omc9I-JsUk/appointments">five other companies</a> in the UK Government’s business registry. All of those companies are registered at the same mailing address as Walsh Medical Media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3138/jsp-2023-0095">an article</a> in the <em>Journal of Scholarly Publishing</em> last May, Graham Kendall, the deputy vice chancellor at MILA University in Nilai, Malaysia, detailed possible connections between Walsh Medical Media and the publishing group OMICS. In 2019 the publisher was ordered to pay the U.S. government $50 million in 2019 for “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/02/court-orders-publisher-omics-to-pay-u-s-govt-50-million-in-suit-alleging-unfair-and-deceptive-practices/">unfair and deceptive practices</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from the metrics, we were unable to verify the metadata of the six articles in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bl_n5JENiKK6YJwTRVIxLXcarqDPXlCP3cjt86nh8-k/edit?usp=sharing">most recent issue</a>. Three papers are labeled “commentry [sic],”two are review articles, and one a research article. All six papers have digital object identifiers, or DOIs, that did not come up in a <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI search</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the authors of the articles have no record in ORCID or ResearchGate: Andrew Vander of the University of Nevada, Reno, Shang Zhou of Department of Iwate Prefectural University in Japan, and Nguyen Kwok of the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Papers with authors we could verify were seemingly copied from other work, usually by the same author. For example, the review article “<a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/open-access/underwater-acoustic-target-recognition-in-passive-sonar-using-spectrogram-and-modified-mobilenet-network-classifier-133839.html">Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition in Passive Sonar Using Spectrogram and Modified MobileNet Network Classifier</a>” by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6022-9806">Hassan Akbarian</a> and<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6937-9176"> Mohammad Hossein Sedaaghi</a> is nearly identical to “<a href="https://adst.ihu.ac.ir/article_208359.html?lang=en">Surface Vessels, Deep Learning, Passive Sonar, Underwater Acoustic Recognition</a>,” published in <em>Advanced defense science technology</em> in 2023 by the same authors. Notably, the paper in <em>Advanced defense science technology</em> also has a fake DOI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Akbarian and Sedaaghi did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Anna Abalkina, who is also responsible for the Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, wrote about a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/16/scopus-indexed-journal-science-of-law-fake-editorial-board-sham-archive/">similar instance</a> of a predatory journal that had an editorial board with fake names, an anonymously registered website domain and potentially back-dated archive. And in 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/30/unethical-and-misleading-researcher-finds-his-name-on-editorial-boards-of-journals-hes-never-heard-of/">we covered a case</a> of a researcher who found his name on editorial boards of journals he’d never heard of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/22/clare-francis-scores-a-bullseye-journal-of-cell-biology-paper-retracted-for-image-manipulation/">flagged thousands of papers</a> over the years, so they rarely see something new. But an email from Frontiers about an upcoming retraction on a paper Francis originally flagged offered just that: The option to be acknowledged in the retraction notice.</p>



<p>After years of publishers not routinely – or even often – naming sleuths despite <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/data-sleuths-work-thankless-they-must-get-credit-retractions">many asking for their often unpaid</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/08/journals-acknowledge-that-a-critical-reader-has-a-name-elisabeth-bik/">risky work</a> to be acknowledged, the trend of acknowledging who identified issues in papers may be gaining momentum. Frontiers is one of several publishers developing such policies, and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) plans to release new guidelines in August that would recommend this practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers began offering acknowledgements last year, a spokesperson for the company told Retraction Watch. “Once investigations are complete, the third party is informed of the outcome and, if a retraction is to be published, offered the option to be recognized in the notice with a standardized statement,” they said.</p>



<span id="more-132452"></span>



<p>In the email Francis received, they were offered the option to be thanked by name, or as “the concerned reader.” (Francis chose the latter.)</p>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.939224">retraction published in March</a> gave a shout-out to another sleuth familiar to our readers: “Frontiers would like to thank Alexander Magazinov for contacting the journal regarding the published article.”</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2025.1673270/abstract">some</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1575634">retractions</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1642419">now</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1548141">contain</a> this standardized statement, the publisher uses it only when the investigation originated from a third party raising concerns, the spokesperson told us.</p>



<p>Other publishers plan to follow suit. Both Springer Nature and Wiley representatives told us they are working on policies to acknowledge third parties across their journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are a number of important areas that we believe need careful consideration,” Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions, for Springer Nature told us, “including potential legal risk to those who are named in notices, permanence of records of investigations, thresholds for inclusion, an effective process for opting in or out of recognition, and a process for launching it across over three thousand journals.”</p>



<p>For Wiley journals, “if the concern was shared with us in confidence, we will only include the source&#8217;s name if they have provided permission, and if the journal’s editor also agrees,” a spokesperson told us. As this process varies by journal, “we are working toward a more standard approach across our portfolio.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We asked Francis, as well as sleuths Alexander Magazinov, David Bimler, and Dorothy Bishop, for their thoughts on new policies to name third parties in retraction notices. All four favored this type of policy because it increases transparency into the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ideally publishers should link to a PubPeer thread and contributors&#8217; pseudonyms, if they were notified through public channels,” said Bimler, a retired perceptual psychologist from Massey University in New Zealand.</p>



<p>He and the others noted that giving credit should not come at the expense of offering anonymity. “It is extremely important not to disclose the third party&#8217;s name if they don&#8217;t explicitly consent to that,” said Magazinov, a software engineer in Kazakhstan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sleuths emphasized that getting credit was secondary to the main goal, “decontamination of the scientific literature,” as Magazinov put it.</p>



<p>“It might also help forge a more positive relationship between sleuths and publishers,” said Bishop, an emeritus professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. These relationships have been strained in the past, partially due to policies explicitly denying sleuths credit. Thomas Tischler, a senior editor at Springer Nature, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/data-sleuths-work-thankless-they-must-get-credit-retractions">told sleuths last year</a> that “by policy, we do not mention how the case came to us and do not acknowledge any external parties.”</p>



<p>The Frontiers spokesperson said the initiative “has been positively received by third parties and the broader publishing community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>COPE Chair Nancy Chescheir told <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/45157_06-2025_corrections-and-retractions-study-committee-meeting-1#sectionWebFriendly">a committee of the National Academy of Sciences </a>in June her group would be revising its guidelines for retractions later this summer. “If concerns about the article are raised by a third party, their name could be included in the retraction notice, if relevant, with permission,” she said at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holden Thorp, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Science </em>family of journals, told the same committee that <em>Science </em>would prefer to acknowledge sleuths, but institutions and authors “are often very hostile to the idea of including the sleuths.” He said he was happy to hear about the new policy because “if we can fall back on a COPE guideline that allows us to put that in there, we’ll definitely start doing it.”</p>



<p>Sleuths aren’t the only ones receiving credit under the new guidelines. “If concerns were raised by an institutional investigation, this information should be included,” Chescheir told the National Academies committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A COPE spokesperson said the updated retraction guideline is being finalized and requires trustee approval, but they expect it to launch in August.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2025/07/edgewise/">Edgewise</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>I have been involved in the open science movement for nearly 20 years now. By now,  it seems to me the problems have been clearly recognized and formulated, the experts agree on the necessary technical solutions (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.230206">replacing the journals</a>) and the funding is available. And yet, academia keeps trying to put band-aids on an unfixable, FUBAR system, despite all the obvious signs of decay, the counter-productive effects of the band aids and the waste of it all. Being merely a science nerd, I lack the word-smithing abilities to put my frustration into prose. In my helplessness, I described how I perceived the situation to an LLM &#8211; it&#8217;s about language, after all &#8211; and asked it to write a short story. I can&#8217;t say anything about the quality of the writing, English is not my first language and the author is only an LLM after all, but in a weird and funny, yet somewhat melancholic way, it does capture the, to me at least, most important aspects. But that&#8217;s probably just because I recognized my idea in the story, and no-one else will. No matter,  it works for me. In my experience, Dr. Blenkinsop (no intended relation to any potentially existing persons with this name) is only all too representative:</em></p>



<p><br /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Edgewise”</strong></h2>



<p><strong>By Roger T. Blenkinsop, PhD</strong><br /><em>Plenary Speaker, Fellow of the Anthropocentric Perimeter Institute, Vice Chair of the Committee on Edge-Event Forecasting (EEF)</em></p>



<p>Look, all I’m saying is: if people <em>could</em> fall off the edge of the Earth—and let’s be honest, it still hasn’t been definitively proven that they <em>couldn’t</em>—then wouldn’t we all feel like jackasses for not having built the fence?</p>



<p>That’s what I asked Marcy last week at the airport, and she gave me that look. The one that means, <em>Roger, you’re being embarrassing in public again.</em> But I stand by it. Because really, what’s more embarrassing: speaking up for human survival in the face of complex and evolving geospatial paradigms, or just sitting back and doing nothing while toddlers in the Global South toddle ever closer to the lip of the abyss?</p>



<p>And yes, I <em>have</em> read the new data. I’ve seen the satellite images, the curvature metrics, the whole shebang. But that doesn’t negate twenty years of evidence-based policymaking. It just… reframes it. In light of new parameters. Which is <em>exactly</em> what science is supposed to do.</p>



<p>I mean, we were never dogmatists. That was always the Flat-Earther’s problem, ironically. <em>We</em> were empirical. Rational. Willing to adapt. And if the Earth happens to be a sphere—or spheroid, technically—then the fence just needs to be reconceptualized as a <strong>Circumglobal Perimeter Awareness System</strong>. Which, by the way, is something I’ve already proposed in draft form to the European Regional Advisory Sub-Cluster. (Pending feedback.)</p>



<p>Besides, by now it’s not just about the edge. It’s about <em>fence equity</em>. About <em>geoboundary justice</em>. About reminding people that some of us tried to do something, even if it was, strictly speaking, based on a misapprehension of topological fundamentals. The <em>intent</em> was sound. The funding mechanisms were transparent. And the symposium sandwiches were, in many cases, quite reasonable.</p>



<p>Anyway, we board in twenty minutes. I need to work on my plenary slides. I’m calling it <strong>“From Edge to Embrace: Toward a Holistic Model of Horizon-Responsive Infrastructure.”</strong> Marcy says that sounds like I’m giving up. I say it sounds like tenure.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>We arrived in Oslo to light sleet and heavy guilt. The &#8220;Global Summit on Terminal Geography&#8221; was hosted in a former ski lodge now serving as a climate-neutral academic retreat. The building had no corners. Only curves. Symbolic, they said.</p>



<p>The plenary panel was titled <strong>“Flattening the Curve: Ethics and Optics in a Post-Flat World.”</strong> I was slotted between a geo-anthropologist from Stanford and a behavioral economist from Zurich who had developed a fence-cost calculator app called “FallStop,” which predicted potential edge casualties in developing nations based on altitude, GDP, and media coverage.</p>



<p>After my presentation—modestly received, some light clapping, two nods from the Norwegian delegation—I was approached by Dr. Lubna Al-Fajr, who had once chaired the now-defunct “Wall Subcommittee.” She looked worn.</p>



<p>“Roger,” she said, “we’ve got to let it go. The fence. The grants. The think pieces. All of it.”</p>



<p>“Lubna,” I said, gently, “we’re not building a fence. We’re building <em>confidence</em>. A global sense of spatial dignity. Even if the Earth <em>is</em> round—”</p>



<p>“Which it is.”</p>



<p>“—the fence was always metaphorical. An organizing principle. A boundary against chaos.”</p>



<p>She looked at me like I was trying to sell her expired milk.</p>



<p>“Roger,” she said, “they found a paper you co-authored in 2007 that describes the Earth as an ‘inverted lasagna of potential descent vectors.’”</p>



<p>“Well,” I coughed, “metaphor.”</p>



<p>“You also used Comic Sans for the footnotes.”</p>



<p>I had no defense for that.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>Back in my room, I opened the minibar, took out a tiny gin labeled <em>Arctic Botanicals</em>, and began revising my proposal for the rebranded initiative: <strong>Fence 2.0: Reclaiming the Edge in a Borderless World<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong>.</p>



<p>I used more passive voice this time. Phrases like <em>stakeholder decoupling</em> and <em>post-linear safety affordances</em>. I added a diagram shaped like a Möbius strip and an appendix featuring testimonials from communities who said the fence &#8220;made them feel safe,&#8221; even though it didn’t exist yet and never would.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>Later that night, during the networking sauna, I found myself beside Dr. Sijuwade from Lagos, who was studying the psychological effects of cartographic overcertainty.</p>



<p>“Maybe,” he said, sweat streaking his glasses, “we build the fence anyway. As art. A kind of memorial. For all the things we feared but never happened.”</p>



<p>I nodded slowly. &#8220;A fear monument.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A <em>Hope-fence</em>,&#8221; he said, eyes glinting.</p>



<p>It sounded ridiculous. Then it sounded like funding.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>As I write this, I&#8217;m en route to Kyoto for the “Third Workshop on Post-Factual Infrastructures.” The turbulence is mild. The sky is clear. The Earth, curiously, continues to curve beneath us, like some old betrayal we can’t stop loving.</p>



<p>And somewhere down there—perhaps along a forgotten fault line in the Altiplano, or the ghost of an edge we once imagined—we will plant the ceremonial first post of the fence-that-will-never-be, and call it progress.</p>

<p><em>Nature </em>has issued an editorial expression of concern on a paper published 27 years ago — and nearly nine years after learning of an “irregularity” in a figure.</p>



<p>According to the June 18 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09239-w">statement</a>, a figure in the 1998 paper showed duplicated control lanes, with one of them flipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis flagged the issue on PubPeer in 2016, and reported the problem to the journal at the same time, Francis told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132443"></span>



<p>The 1998 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/29093">paper</a> has been cited 333 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, 32 of which were after 2016 when the image issue was first flagged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/ethel-cesarman">Ethel Cesarman</a>, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, told us she learned of the issue with the figure from the comment on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C540D0FE29B0D75B4F44F6A0DF4DAC#null">PubPeer,</a> although she did not learn about it until 2018, “when a ‘Claire Francis’ contacted my institution and collaborators, who then reached out to me.”</p>



<p>“We have procedures to assess the claims and for the institution to conduct an investigation, which in this case found an issue related to the use of cropped gels leading to an inadvertent image duplication on negative control lanes,” Cesarman told us. She said she contacted the journal about the paper after the conclusion of the investigation in 2021. “After reviewing the institution’s report, the journal makes their own decision regarding informing their readers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Weill Cornell Medicine confirmed the institute investigated the paper, and that the wording of the notice “reflects the findings of our evaluation through institutional processes.”</p>



<p>All the authors except one, for whom the journal could not obtain current contact information, agreed with the journal’s decision.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Nature</em> did not address our question about when they first heard about the problem with the figure.</p>



<p>“Given the age of the article and the fact that the authors no longer have the original raw data for the figure, we determined in consultation with the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group that issuing an Editorial Expression of Concern (EEoC) was the most appropriate course of action,” the spokesperson said. “This allows us to alert readers to interpret the results with caution while acknowledging that the concern could not be fully resolved.”</p>



<p>Cesarman has one previous retraction with different coauthors. Published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Medicine</em>, the 2004 paper earned a correction in 2006 and was retracted in 2021 ”due to multiple instances of splicing and the image manipulation to remove background gel artifacts” following an investigation by Weill Cornell Medicine, according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.2003146702062021r">retraction notice</a>. Including this retraction and a correction, Cesarman has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Ethel+Cesarman">14 papers</a> with comments on PubPeer.</p>

                For too long, biomedical studies have favoured male subjects, leaving gaps in our understanding of how diseases affect women. A new review in Communications Biology explores the past, present, and future of sex-inclusive preclinical research and why it’s essential for better science and safer treatments.

<p>The publisher Frontiers has begun retracting a batch of 122 articles across five journals after an investigation found a network of authors and editors engaged in “unethical actions” such as manipulating citations and reviewing papers without disclosing conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher&#8217;s research integrity team has identified more than 4,000 articles linked to the network in journals owned by seven other companies, according to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/07/29/frontiers-research-integrity-team-uncovers-peer-review-manipulation-network">a company statement</a>. The team said it is willing to share details and the methodology of their investigation with other publishers upon request. The company is a member of the STM Hub, a platform publishers use to share such information.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132423"></span>



<p>As the publishing industry comes to grips with its <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mill</a> problem, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">many</a> firms have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">issued</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/02/sage-retracts-more-than-200-papers-from-journal-for-compromised-peer-review/">retractions</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">in bulk</a>. Frontiers retracted a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">batch of 40</a> in 2023, and a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/11/frontiers-retracts-a-dozen-papers-many-more-expected/">dozen</a> the year before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest tranche of retractions began to appear July 28. By our count, at least 25 were posted that day. According to one of the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/energy-research/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2025.1674607/abstract">notices</a>, which are identical for each paper, the publisher’s investigation “identified this article as one for which the integrity of the peer review process has been undermined, resulting in the loss of confidence in the article&#8217;s findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation “was not able to determine whether all authors, editors, or reviewers were aware of or involved in the misconduct, but this misconduct was significant enough to determine that the scientific integrity of the article cannot be guaranteed,” the notices state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frontiers-mass-retractions-July-2025-Google-Sheets.pdf">list of the forthcoming retractions</a> Frontiers provided us names one paper from <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>, six from <em>Frontiers in Public Health, </em>29 from <em>Frontiers in Energy Research</em>, 33 from <em>Frontiers in Environmental Science</em>, and 53 from <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. Most were published in 2022. </p>



<p>The investigation began after a reader noted undisclosed conflicts of interest in the peer review of a single paper, according to the statement. PubPeer user “Desmococcus antarctica” has posted comments on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/68DA1131B4B7B9121ADE6B0E59899B">some</a> of the papers to be retracted, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C4E349B3C0DA5B657C1AE351771426">identifying</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6394AEA709E5043763916708FA33F4">instances</a> in which an author and reviewer had previously coauthored a paper together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the first tip, the research integrity team began investigating all the authors’ previous submissions, publications, and coauthor networks, the publisher’s statement said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the investigation proceeded, it became clear that a broad and sophisticated network of about 35 authors were potentially colluding over a very large number of journals and published papers, a fraction of which were published by Frontiers,” according to the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers has an artificial intelligence review system for submitted manuscripts, which now includes verification of the reviewers’ and handling editors’ conflict of interest statements, the company said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Desmococcus antarctica’s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6394AEA709E5043763916708FA33F4">comments</a> on PubPeer pertains to “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/energy-research/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2022.830286/full">Households’ Perception and Environmentally Friendly Technology Adoption: Implications for Energy Efficiency</a>,” published in 2022 in <em>Frontiers in Energy Research</em>. The user pointed out that reviewer <a href="https://cyjj.ujs.edu.cn/info/1061/1372.htm">Muhammad Mohsin</a>, an associate professor in the school of finance and economics at Jiangsu University in China, had previously coauthored a paper with one of the authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mohsin also served as an editor for the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/23204/the-future-of-energy-efficiency-in-post-covid-19-era/magazine">collection</a> in which the paper appeared. Many papers from the collection, which Frontiers calls a “Research Topic,” have been retracted, and Mohsin is listed as the handling editor on several. He did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this paper, the first author (Mahendra Kumar Trivedi, also
 known as “Guruji” on the Divine Connection website) makes extraordinary
 and unvalidated claims about his ability to change the state of matter –
 and the mental and physical health of human volunteers – via 
transmission of his thoughts (described as “blessing” throughout the 
manuscript). A peer-reviewed journal that accepts such declarations 
without incontrovertible scientific evidence, which was never provided, 
has compromised its scientific reputation. Furthermore, the study’s 
design is flawed and much of the data contained in the paper is 
  implausible and inauthentic.</p><p>. . .</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Time flies<br />Time crawls</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">–ibid</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Six months later (<span class="epub-date">24 January 2025), the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgf2.773" target="_blank">issued a retraction</a> based on my concerns.</span><sup><b><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></b></sup>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="epub-date">&nbsp;</span></p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><p><b>RETRACTION</b>: M.

an inappropriate control group used as the placebo group of the trial,

physiological range, and unsupported claims regarding the scientific 
evidence behind the biofield energy treatment. The authors were 
informed, however, the explanation and the partial raw data provided 
were deemed insufficient to address the concerns. Thus, the editors have
 lost confidence in the presented data and consider the results and 
conclusions of this manuscript insufficiently supported and
