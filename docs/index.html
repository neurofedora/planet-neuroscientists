<p>Following an investigation launched by Cornell University, a committee recommended pulling several papers by lung-disease researcher Augustine M. K. Choi, who served as dean of Weill Cornell Medicine until this year, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>Choi’s latest retraction, which brings him up to three so far,&nbsp; came on March 15, when <em>The Journal of Clinical Investigation </em>pulled “<a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/169986">UCP2-induced fatty acid synthase promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation during sepsis.</a>” The paper has been cited 178 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/169986#FN">retraction notice</a> reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126801"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Cornell University, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital jointly notified the JCI that Figures 3A, 4D, 7B, and 8B and Supplemental Figures 4 and 7A are not reliable. In accordance with the institutional recommendations, the JCI is retracting this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Choi served as dean of Weill Cornell Medicine and provost of medical affairs at Cornell University from 2017 to 2022. He has been a professor of both medicine and genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College since 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported earlier, Choi had a paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/04/02/retraction-and-republication-for-lancet-resp-med-tracheostomy-paper/">retracted and then republished</a> in 2015. Five years later, in 2020, <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajplung.00212.2002_RET">he lost another article</a> “due to inclusion of data that were published previously … and represent different results.” That same year, commenters on PubPeer started flagging potential image problems in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Augustine+M.K.+Choi">several of Choi’s other publications</a>.</p>



<p>Following the latest retraction, we reached out to Cornell, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s for comment on the recommendations the notice refers to. No one from Harvard replied and a spokesperson from Brigham and Women’s declined to comment, deferring to Cornell. Joel M. Malina, Cornell University vice president for university relations, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In 2020, Cornell learned of data integrity inquiries involving research published out of Dr. Choi’s laboratory. Cornell launched an independent investigation at that time, conducted by a committee of preeminent scientists from outside of Cornell and led by external counsel, which resulted in a detailed analysis of a number of publications and a thorough review of lab practices. The final report found that Dr. Choi did not commit research misconduct. The report made recommendations for retraction of several papers because certain figures were not reliable and, given the absence of original data, the scientific record could not be corrected. Retraction is consistent with academic norms in such circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Malina did not directly say whether Choi’s leaving of his dean and provost positions was influenced by the investigation, but he said that Choi ultimately chose not to seek another term in these positions. Malina also highlighted the contributions Choi has made to Cornell, including his leadership during the pandemic and establishing a debt-free tuition plan for medical students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choi did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.</p>

          <p>Today we hear about from <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/about-us/nick-devito/">Nicholas DeVito</a> on how he works to improve clinical research transparency with the TrialsTracker project.

<p>Clinical trials are essential to evidence generation in medicine. When a trial is conducted everyone from funders, to participants, to practicing clinicians expect, and deserve, the results to be fully reported in a timely manner. This should be uncontroversial but <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114023">every</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35314864/">study</a> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.12.012">the matter</a> has shown that many trials remain unreported for years after their supposed completion. It is against this backdrop that my colleagues and I created the TrialsTracker project.</p>



<p>This aim of the project is simple: bring public audit and accountability to the trial reporting landscape. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-110publ85/pdf/PLAW-110publ85.pdf">The US</a> and <a href="http://academy.gmp-compliance.org/guidemgr/files/2012_302-03_en.pdf">the EU</a> have both implemented regulations that require the sponsors of certain clinical trials to register their trials and report results directly to registries within a year of completion. This bypasses common excuses for non-publication regarding journal delays and rejections and removes discretion about if and when results get disseminated. No matter what else a sponsor decides to do with their findings, the public should be guaranteed timely access to summary results from these trials.</p>



<p>The problem, however, was that no one ensured results were being reported. Having rules in place is a major step but without concerted efforts to enforce them they risk becoming ceremonial at best. Neither the US Food and Drug Administration nor the European Medicines Agency seemed particularly interested in publicly (or privately) tracking and pursuing missing results, so we decided to step in and fill the gap.</p>



<p>The requirements of US and EU regulations were carefully translated into simple algorithms that check if a registered trial appears covered under the relevant laws, if it completed and due to report, and if it has results. My software engineering colleagues at the <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/">Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science</a> turned this code into applications that pull data from the registries on a regular schedule, process it, and put it on websites detailing who has and has not reported their clinical trials. The <a href="https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/">FDAAA TrialsTracker</a> and the <a href="https://eu.trialstracker.net/">EU TrialsTracker</a>, both launched in 2018. Users can see an overall picture of reporting, the current status of individual trials, and reporting rates aggregated by sponsor. Sponsors are not only held to public account for their performance but can also use the Trackers as a resource to help manage the reporting of their trial portfolios.</p>



<p>Since we&rsquo;ve launched, the TrialsTracker project has inspired a full <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(19)33220-9.pdf">research</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3218">programme</a> and become a valuable tool for transparency. Our Trackers have been used by <a href="https://old.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/clinical-trials-letters-published-2019/">parliamentary committees</a> to address<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435621003577?via%3Dihub"> trial reporting in the UK</a>, are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2021/09/09/fda-clinical-trials-transparency-warning/">cited routinely</a> by <a href="https://endpts.com/what-do-mass-general-the-nci-and-mayo-clinic-have-in-common-they-routinely-blow-off-an-fda-rule-on-posting-trial-results/">the press</a>, and relied on <a href="https://www.transparimed.org/">by advocates</a> who push for increased attention to research transparency. My <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:3c901316-5c24-4b42-a78e-1037d56d35e4">doctoral thesis</a> was built on the back of data from the Trackers and the interesting questions they raised about the trial reporting landscape.</p>



<p>The TrialsTrackers show the benefit of building tools that exist outside of simple one-off cross-sectional analyses. We were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa1409364">not</a> the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7373">first</a> to examine reporting under the FDA Amendments Act but we aimed to create a living tool that tracks progress in real time. Now, you could get a concrete view of current compliance with a single click, rather than wait for the next paper on the topic.</p>



<p>My colleagues and I are now looking towards the future of the TrialsTracker project. Technical infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance to function. Data fields and flows change, software needs upgrading, and updates are necessary to respond to changing conditions. Additionally, enhancements to the existing trackers can be developed, piloted, and validated. For instance, the trackers could grow to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2780022">include additional monitoring</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g5579">notifications for users</a> about trials coming due to report. New European regulations have moved registration and results reporting to a new registry, the <a href="https://euclinicaltrials.eu/search-for-clinical-trials/?lang=en">Clinical Trials Information System</a>, and a new tracker is needed to stay abreast of transparency developments throughout the EU. This all requires a blend of expert knowledge and technical capacity, which is exactly the environment we aim to foster at the Bennett Institute, and all of this requires resources. In return for this investment, the TrialsTracker will continue to provide an ongoing audit and feedback service on a critical issue in clinical medicine, act as a catalyst for future research, and serve as a conversation starter with key decision makers on how to improve transparency and reporting.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wires-native-language-neurons">Your brain wires itself to match your native language</a></h4>

              
                <p>The language we learn growing up seems to leave a lasting, biological imprint on our brains.</p>



<p>German and Arabic native speakers have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811923001015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different connection strengths in specific parts of the brain’s language circuit</a>, researchers report February 19 in <em>NeuroImage,</em> hinting that the cognitive demands of our native languages physically shape the brain. The new study, based on nearly 100 brain scans, is one of the first in which scientists have identified these kinds of structural wiring differences in a large group of monolingual adults.</p>





<p>“The specific difficulties [of each language] leave distinct traces in the brain,” says neuroscientist Alfred Anwander of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. “So we are not the same if we learn to speak one language, or if we learn another.”</p>



<p>Every human language expresses itself using a different set of tricks. Some use rich systems of suffixes and prefixes to build enormous, dense words. Others change how words sound or how they are arranged within phrases to create meaning. Our brains process these tricks in a constellation of brain regions connected by white matter. This tissue routes long, cablelike nerve cells from one part of the brain to another and speeds up communication between them. Wiring brain regions together this way is part of how we learn: The more often we use a connection, the more robust it becomes.</p>



<p>Different parts of the brain’s language circuit have different jobs. But while the large-scale structure of this circuit is universal, every language has “its own difficulties,” which might result in different white matter networks, Anwander says.</p>



<p>He and his team recruited 94 healthy volunteers who spoke one of two unrelated native languages — German or Levantine Arabic — for structural MRI brain scans. The Arabic speakers had arrived recently in Germany as refugees and didn’t yet speak German. They tended to have stronger connections across their left and right hemispheres, the scans revealed, whereas the German speakers had a denser network of connections within the left hemisphere.</p>



<p>“This corresponds to the specific difficulties in the respective languages,” Anwander says.</p>

<p>For instance, the complexity of Arabic’s roots — trios of consonants that buddy up with vowel patterns to produce words — might demand extra effort from parts of the brain involved in parsing sounds and words. A common example of this kind of root is<em> k-t-b,</em> which forms words related to writing like <em>kitaab</em> (book), <em>taktub</em> (you or she writes) and <em>maktab</em> (office). Arabic text is also written right to left, which the researchers speculate might demand more communication between the hemispheres.</p>



<p>German, for its part, has a complex and flexible word order that allows the language to create subtle shades of meaning just by shuffling around words within a phrase. While an English speaker can’t rearrange the words <em>woman</em>, <em>ball</em> and <em>dog</em> in the sentence “the woman gave the dog a ball” without garbling the core meaning, it’s possible to do exactly that in German. This could explain the German speakers’ denser white matter networks within parts of the left hemisphere that parse word order.</p>



<p>Still, it’s possible that the Arabic speakers’ recent arrival in Germany could have tweaked their white matter networks too, says Zhenghan Qi, a cognitive neuroscientist at Northeastern University in Boston who was not part of the study.</p>



<p>Just one month of learning a new language, she says, can lead to more engagement of the brain’s right hemisphere and greater interaction between the two hemispheres. Examining MRI scans of Arabic speakers living in their home countries or tracking brain changes as people learn new languages would help separate the effects of language learning from those of native language, Qi says.</p>



<p>While the new study focused just on the language circuit, parts of that circuit handle more than just language, Qi says. And language learning “might also change nonlinguistic regions of the brain,” so it’s possible that people with different language experiences might process nonlanguage information differently too, she says.</p>



<p>It’s still controversial whether language-associated white matter rewiring affects more than just language, Anwander says. But at least within the language circuit, the new results hint that our mother tongues are far more than just the words we happened to grow up with — they are quite literally a part of us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-rotten-putrid-paleo-diet-fire-neanderthal">A surprising food may have been a staple of the real Paleo diet: rotten meat</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a book about his travels in Africa published in 1907, British explorer Arnold Henry Savage Landor recounted witnessing an impromptu meal that his companions relished but that he found unimaginably revolting.</p>



<p>As he coasted down a river in the Congo Basin with several local hunter-gatherers, a dead rodent floated near their canoe. Its decomposing body had bloated to the size of a small pig.</p>



<p>Stench from the swollen corpse left Landor gasping for breath. Unable to speak, he tried to signal his companions to steer the canoe away from the fetid creature. Instead, they hauled the supersize rodent aboard and ate it.</p>





<p>“The odour when they dug their knives into it was enough to kill the strongest of men,” Landor wrote. “When I recovered, my admiration for the digestive powers of these people was intense. They were smacking their lips and they said the [rodent] had provided most excellent eating.”</p>



<p>Starting in the 1500s, European and then later American explorers, traders, missionaries, government officials and others who lived among Indigenous peoples in many parts of the world wrote of similar food practices. Hunter-gatherers and small-scale farmers everywhere commonly ate putrid meat, fish and fatty parts of a wide range of animals. From arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, native populations consumed rotten remains, either raw, fermented or cooked just enough to singe off fur and create a more chewable texture. Many groups treated maggots as a meaty bonus.</p>



<p>Descriptions of these practices, which still occur in some present-day Indigenous groups and among northern Europeans who occasionally eat fermented fish, aren’t likely to inspire any new Food Network shows or cookbooks from celebrity chefs.</p>



<p>Case in point: Some Indigenous communities feasted on huge decomposing beasts, including hippos that had been trapped in dug-out pits in Africa and beached whales on Australia’s coast. Hunters in those groups typically smeared themselves with the fat of the animal before gorging on greasy innards. After slicing open animals’ midsections, both adults and children climbed into massive, rotting body cavities to remove meat and fat.</p>



<p>Or consider that Native Americans in Missouri in the late 1800s made a prized soup from the greenish, decaying flesh of dead bison. Animal bodies were buried whole in winter and unearthed in spring after ripening enough to achieve peak tastiness.</p>



<p>But such accounts provide a valuable window into a way of life that existed long before Western industrialization and the war against germs went global, says anthropological archaeologist John Speth of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Intriguingly, no reports of botulism and other potentially fatal reactions to microorganisms festering in rotting meat appear in writings about Indigenous groups before the early 1900s. Instead, decayed flesh and fat represented valued and tasty parts of a healthy diet.</p>





<p>Many travelers such as Landor considered such eating habits to be “disgusting.” But “a gold mine of ethnohistorical accounts makes it clear that the revulsion Westerners feel toward putrid meat and maggots is not hardwired in our genome but is instead culturally learned,” Speth says.</p>



<p>This dietary revelation also challenges an influential scientific idea that cooking originated among our ancient relatives as a way to make meat more digestible, thus providing a rich calorie source for brain growth in the <em>Homo</em> genus. It’s possible, Speth argues, that Stone Age hominids such as Neandertals first used cooking for certain plants that, when heated, provided an energy-boosting, carbohydrate punch to the diet. Animals held packets of fat and protein that, after decay set in, rounded out nutritional needs without needing to be heated.</p>

<h4>Putrid foods in the diets of Indigenous peoples</h4>



<p>Speth’s curiosity about a human taste for putrid meat was originally piqued by present-day hunter-gatherers in polar regions. North American Inuit, Siberians and other far-north populations still regularly eat fermented or rotten meat and fish.</p>



<p>Fermented fish heads, also known as “stinkhead,” are one popular munchy among northern groups. Chukchi herders in the Russian Far East, for instance, bury whole fish in the ground in early fall and let the bodies naturally ferment during periods of freezing and thawing. Fish heads the consistency of hard ice cream are then unearthed and eaten whole.</p>



<p>Speth has suspected for several decades that consumption of fermented and putrid meat, fish, fat and internal organs has a long and probably ancient history among northern Indigenous groups. Consulting mainly online sources such as Google Scholar and universities’ digital library catalogs, he found many ethnohistorical descriptions of such behavior going back to the 1500s. <a href="https://paleoanthro.org/media/journal/content/PA20170044.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putrid walrus, seals, caribou, reindeer</a>, musk oxen, polar bears, moose, arctic hares and ptarmigans had all been fair game. Speth reported much of this evidence in 2017 in <em>PaleoAnthropology</em>.</p>



<p>In one recorded incident from late-1800s Greenland, a well-intentioned hunter brought what he had claimed in advance was excellent food to a team led by American explorer Robert Peary. A stench filled the air as the hunter approached Peary’s vessel carrying a rotting seal dripping with maggots. The Greenlander had found the seal where a local group had buried it, possibly a couple of years earlier, so that the body could reach a state of tasty decomposition. Peary ordered the man to keep the reeking seal off his boat.</p>



<p>Miffed at this unexpected rejection, the hunter “told us that the more decayed the seal the finer the eating, and he could not understand why we should object,” Peary’s wife wrote of the encounter.</p>



<p>Even in temperate and tropical areas, where animal bodies decompose within hours or days, Indigenous peoples have appreciated rot as much as Peary’s seal-delivery man did. Speth and anthropological archaeologist Eugène Morin of Trent University in Peterborough, Canada, described some of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364794172_Putrid_Meat_in_the_Tropics_It_Wasn&#039;t_Just_for_Inuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those obscure ethnohistorical accounts</a> last October in <em>PaleoAnthropology</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032523_putrid_inline2.png" alt="illustration of a rotting steak with maggots and mushrooms growing on it" class="wp-image-3123165" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032523_putrid_inline2.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032523_putrid_inline2-579x383.png 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032523_putrid_inline2-281x186.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3123165">Emile Holmewood</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Early hominids may have scavenged rotten meat</h4>



<p>These accounts undermine some of scientists’ food-related sacred cows, Speth says. For instance, European explorers and other travelers consistently wrote that traditional groups not only ate putrid meat raw or lightly cooked but suffered no ill aftereffects. A protective gut microbiome may explain why, Speth suspects. Indigenous peoples encountered a variety of microorganisms from infancy on, unlike people today who grow up in sanitized settings. Early exposures to pathogens may have prompted the development of an array of gut microbes and immune responses that protected against potential harms of ingesting putrid meat.</p>



<p>That idea requires further investigation; little is known about the bacterial makeup of rotten meat eaten by traditional groups or of their gut microbiomes. But studies conducted over the last few decades do indicate that putrefaction, the process of decay, offers many of cooking’s nutritional benefits with far less effort. Putrefaction predigests meat and fish, softening the flesh and chemically breaking down proteins and fats so they are more easily absorbed and converted to energy by the body.</p>



<p>Given the ethnohistorical evidence, hominids living 3 million years ago or more could have scavenged meat from decomposing carcasses, even without stone tools for hunting or butchery, and eaten their raw haul safely long before fire was used for cooking, Speth contends. If simple <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucys-kind-used-stone-tools-butcher-animals">stone tools appeared as early as 3.4 million years ago</a>, as some researchers have controversially suggested, those implements may have been made by hominids seeking raw meat and marrow (<em>SN: 9/11/10, p. 8</em>). Researchers suspect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire">regular use of fire</a> for cooking, light and warmth emerged no earlier than around 400,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/5/12, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>“Recognizing that eating rotten meat is possible, even without fire, highlights how easy it would have been to incorporate scavenged food into the diet long before our ancestors learned to hunt or process [meat] with stone tools,” says paleoanthropologist Jessica Thompson of Yale University.</p>



<p>Thompson and colleagues suggested in <em>Current Anthropology</em> in 2019 that before about 2 million years ago, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/701477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hominids were primarily scavengers</a> who used rocks to smash open animal bones and eat nutritious, fat-rich marrow and brains. That conclusion, stemming from a review of fossil and archaeological evidence, challenged a common assumption that early hominids — whether as hunters or scavengers — primarily ate meat off the bone.</p>



<p>Certainly, ancient hominids were eating more than just the meaty steaks we think of today, says archaeologist Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo of Rice University in Houston. In East Africa’s Olduvai Gorge, butchered animal bones at sites dating to nearly 2 million years ago indicate that hominids ate most parts of carcasses, including brains and internal organs.</p>



<p>“But Speth’s argument about eating putrid carcasses is very speculative and untestable,” Domínguez-Rodrigo says.</p>



<p>Untangling whether ancient hominids truly had a taste for rot will require research that spans many fields, including microbiology, genetics and food science, Speth says.</p>



<p>But if his contention holds up, it suggests that ancient cooks were not turning out meat dishes. Instead, Speth speculates, cooking’s primary value at first lay in making starchy and oily plants softer, more chewable and easily digestible. Edible plants contain carbohydrates, sugar molecules that can be converted to energy in the body. Heating over a fire converts starch in tubers and other plants to glucose, a vital energy source for the body and brain. Crushing or grinding of plants might have yielded at least some of those energy benefits to hungry hominids who lacked the ability to light fires.</p>



<p>Whether hominids controlled fire well enough to cook plants or any other food regularly before around 400,000 to 300,000 years ago is unknown.</p>

<h4>Neandertals may have hunted animals for fat</h4>



<p>Despite their nutritional benefits, plants often get viewed as secondary menu items for Stone Age folks. It doesn’t help that plants preserve poorly at archaeological sites.</p>



<p>Neandertals, in particular, have a long-standing reputation as plant shunners. Popular opinion views Neandertals as burly, shaggy individuals who huddled around fires chomping on mammoth steaks.</p>



<p>That’s not far from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1814087116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an influential scientific view of what Neandertals ate</a>. Elevated levels of a diet-related form of nitrogen in Neandertal bones and teeth hint that they were committed carnivores, eating large amounts of protein-rich lean meat, several research teams have concluded over nearly the last 30 years.</p>



<p>But consuming that much protein from meat, especially from cuts above the front and hind limbs now referred to as steaks, would have been a recipe for nutritional disaster, Speth argues. Meat from wild, hoofed animals and smaller creatures such as rabbits contains almost no fat, or marbling, unlike meat from modern domestic animals, he says. Ethnohistorical accounts, especially for northern hunters including the Inuit, include warnings about weight loss, ill health and even death that can result from eating too much lean meat. </p>



<p>This form of malnutrition is known as rabbit starvation. Evidence indicates that people can safely consume between about 25 and 35 percent of daily calories as protein, Speth says. Above that threshold, several investigations have indicated that the liver becomes unable to break down chemical wastes from ingested proteins, which then accumulate in the blood and contribute to rabbit starvation. Limits to the amount of daily protein that can be safely consumed meant that ancient hunting groups, like those today, needed animal fats and carbohydrates from plants to fulfill daily calorie and other nutritional needs.</p>



<p>Modern “Paleo diets” emphasize eating lean meats, fruits and vegetables. But that omits what past and present Indigenous peoples most wanted from animal carcasses. Accounts describe Inuit people eating much larger amounts of fatty body parts than lean meat, Speth says. Over the last few centuries, they have favored tongue, fat deposits, brisket, ribs, fatty tissue around intestines and internal organs, and marrow. Internal organs, especially adrenal glands, have provided vitamin C — nearly absent in lean muscle — that prevented anemia and other symptoms of scurvy.</p>



<p>Western explorers noted that the Inuit also ate chyme, the stomach contents of reindeer and other plant-eating animals. Chyme provided at least a side course of plant carbohydrates. Likewise, Neandertals in Ice Age Europe probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/neandertals-ate-stomach-goop-and-you-can-too">subsisted on a fat- and chyme-supplemented diet</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/11/13</em>), Speth contends.</p>



<p>Large numbers of animal bones found at northern European Neandertal sites — often viewed as the residue of ravenous meat eaters — may instead reflect overhunting of animals to obtain enough fat to meet daily calorie needs. Because wild game typically has a small percentage of body fat, northern hunting groups today and over the last few centuries frequently killed prey in large numbers, either discarding most lean meat from carcasses or feeding it to their dogs, ethnographic studies show.</p>



<p>If Neandertals followed that playbook, eating putrid foods might explain why their bones carry a carnivore-like nitrogen signature, Speth suggests. An unpublished study of decomposing human bodies kept at a University of Tennessee research facility in Knoxville called the Body Farm tested that possibility. Biological anthropologist Melanie Beasley, now at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., found moderately elevated tissue nitrogen levels in 10 deceased bodies sampled regularly for about six months. Tissue from those bodies served as a stand-in for animal meat consumed by Neandertals. Human flesh is an imperfect substitute for, say, reindeer or elephant carcasses. But Beasley’s findings suggest that decomposition’s effects on a range of animals need to be studied. Intriguingly, she also found that maggots in the decaying tissue displayed extremely elevated nitrogen levels.</p>



<p>Like arctic hunters did a few hundred years ago, Neandertals may have eaten putrid meat and fish studded with maggots, Speth says. That would explain elevated nitrogen levels in Neandertal fossils.</p>



<p>But Neandertal dining habits are poorly understood. Unusually extensive evidence of Neandertal big-game consumption has come from a new analysis of fossil remains at a roughly 125,000-year-old site in northern Germany called Neumark-Nord. There, Neandertals periodically hunted straight-tusked elephants weighing up to 13 metric tons, say archaeologist Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser of Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany and colleagues.</p>



<p>In a study reported February 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>, her group <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed patterns of stone-tool incisions on bones</a> of at least 57 elephants from 27 spots near an ancient lake basin where Neandertals <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-first-hominid-modify-environment-forest-grassland">lit campfires and constructed shelters</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/22, p. 8</em>). Evidence suggests that Neandertal butchers — much like Inuit hunters — removed fat deposits under the skin and fatty body parts such as the tongue, internal organs, brain and thick layers of fat in the feet. Lean meat from elephants would have been eaten in smaller quantities to avoid rabbit starvation, the researchers argue.</p>



<p>Further research needs to examine whether the Neandertals cooked elephant meat or boiled the bones to extract nutritious grease, Speth says. Mealtime options would have expanded for hominids who could not only consume putrid meat and fat but also heat animal parts over fires, he suspects.</p>



<p>Neandertals who hunted elephants must also have eaten a variety of plants to meet their considerable energy requirements, says Gaudzinski-Windheuser. But so far, only fragments of burned hazelnuts, acorns and blackthorn plums have been found at Neumark-Nord.</p>

<h4>Neandertals probably carb-loaded</h4>



<p>Better evidence of Neandertals’ plant preferences comes from sites in warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern settings. At a site in coastal Spain, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-spain-cave-warm-weather-landscape-art-illustration">Neandertals probably ate fruits, nuts and seeds</a> of a variety of plants (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 32</em>).</p>



<p>Neandertals in a range of environments must have consumed lots of starchy plants, argues archaeologist Karen Hardy of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Even Stone Age northern European and Asian regions included plants with starch-rich appendages that grew underground, such as tubers.</p>



<p>Neandertals could also have obtained starchy carbs from the edible, inner bark of many trees and from seaweed along coastlines. Cooking, as suggested by Speth, would have greatly increased the nutritional value of plants, Hardy says. Not so for rotten meat and fat, though Neandertals such as those at Neumark-Nord may have cooked what they gleaned from fresh elephant remains.</p>



<p>There is direct evidence that Neandertals munched on plants. Microscopic remnants of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dental-plaque-tells-tales-neandertal-diet-and-disease">edible and medicinal plants have been found in the tartar</a> on Neandertal teeth (<em>SN: 4/1/17, p. 16</em>), Hardy says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248421001573?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbohydrate-fueled energy</a> helped to maintain large brains, enable strenuous physical activity and ensure healthy pregnancies for both Neandertals and ancient <em>Homo sapiens</em>, Hardy concludes in the January 2022 <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>. (Researchers disagree over whether Neandertals, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago, were a variant of <em>H. sapiens</em> or a separate species.)</p>

<h4>Paleo cuisine was tasty</h4>



<p>Like Hardy, Speth suspects that plants provided a large share of the energy and nutrients Stone Age folks needed. Plants represented a more predictable, readily available food source than hunted or scavenged meat and fat, he contends.</p>



<p>Plants also offered Neandertals and ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> — whose diets probably didn’t differ dramatically from Neandertals’, Hardy says — a chance to stretch their taste buds and cook up tangy meals.</p>



<p>Paleolithic plant cooking included preplanned steps aimed at adding dashes of specific flavors to basic dishes, a recent investigation suggests. In at least some places, Stone Age people apparently cooked to experience pleasing tastes and not just to fill their stomachs. Charred plant food fragments from Shanidar Cave in Iraqi Kurdistan and Franchthi Cave in Greece consisted of crushed pulse seeds, possibly from starchy pea species, combined with wild plants that would have provided a pungent, somewhat bitter taste, microscopic analyses show.</p>



<p>Added <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/cooking-in-caves-palaeolithic-carbonised-plant-food-remains-from-franchthi-and-shanidar/0CB510C9E528CD7AD923469D78E14E42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingredients included wild mustard, wild almonds, wild pistachio</a> and fruits such as hackberry, archaeobotanist Ceren Kabukcu of the University of Liverpool in England and colleagues reported last November in <em>Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Four Shanidar food bits date to about 40,000 years ago or more and originated in sediment that included stone tools attributed to <em>H. sapiens</em>. Another food fragment, likely from a cooked Neandertal meal, dates to between 70,000 and 75,000 years ago. Neandertal fossils found in Shanidar Cave are also about 70,000 years old. So it appears that Shanidar Neandertals spiced up cooked plant foods before Shanidar <em>H. sapiens </em>did, Kabukcu says.</p>



<p>Franchthi food remains date to between 13,100 and 11,400 years ago, when <em>H. sapiens </em>lived there. Wild pulses in food from both caves display microscopic signs of having been soaked, a way to dilute poisons in seeds and moderate their bitterness.</p>



<p>These new findings “suggest that cuisine, or the combination of different ingredients for pleasure, has a very long history indeed,” says Hardy, who was not part of Kabukcu’s team.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty dollop of irony in the possibility that original Paleo diets mixed what people in many societies today regard as gross-sounding portions of putrid meat and fat with vegetarian dishes that still seem appealing.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In June 2021, Espen Flo Bødal began to believe that a paper he’d co-authored had been stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news came via a ResearchGate alert that the Norwegian researcher’s work had been cited, according to the publication <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning-forskningsetikk-juks/forskerne-ble-frastjalet-artikkel-men-fikk-til-slutt-publisert-den-i-et-seriost-tidsskrift/362275"><em>Universitets</em></a><em> </em>(article in Norwegian). When Bødal checked the alert, he saw that part of his doctoral thesis had been published, essentially word for word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But instead of his name and those of his collaborators at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the article listed researchers at the Huzhou Power Supply Company and North China Electric Power University as its authors.</p>



<span id="more-126780"></span>



<p>The allegedly pirated article, “<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2021/6635829/">A Stochastic Rolling Horizon-Based Approach for Power Generation Expansion Planning</a>,” appeared in a special issue of <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/"><em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em></a>, a Hindawi title that was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">one of 19 recently delisted</a> from Clarivate’s Web of Science for failing to meet quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hindawi’s special issues<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv/"> have had problems with paper mills</a>, according to independent researcher Dorothy Bishop. Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, recently disclosed that it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publishing the special issues</a> for three months, losing $9 million in revenue. Last year, the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retracted more than 500 papers</a> after discovering manipulations in the peer review process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bødal and his doctoral advisor Magnus Korpås suspect that their article was copied when they submitted it to a journal that ended up rejecting it. Their article was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779621007100?via%3Dihub">published</a> in <em>Electric Power Systems Research</em>, an Elsevier title, on Jan. 2, 2022. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We attempted to contact the editor-in-chief of <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, Guangming Xie of Peking University, but received no reply. We also did not hear back from the article’s corresponding author, Xinji Wang, of North China Power Electric University.</p>



<p>When Bødal and his doctoral advisor Magnus Korpås’ complaints to <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em> and Hindawi went nowhere, Norway’s registry of journals moved to demote the title so researchers in the country wouldn’t get credit for publishing their work in it. The registry will discuss removing more Hindawi journals at a future meeting, an advisor told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Norway produces a database of validated journals that scholars are encouraged to publish in, called the <a href="https://kanalregister.hkdir.no/publiseringskanaler/Forside.action?request_locale=en">Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers</a>. The database has a hierarchy, with some journals at level 1 and others at level 2.</p>



<p>Level 2 journals are the most prestigious, but publishing in level 1 journals also earns authors credit, Lena-Cecilie Linge, a senior advisor about the contents of the publication register, told us. Norwegian educational authorities use the publication tallies to reallocate research funds among different universities, Linge added.</p>



<p>The concerns about <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, which had been a level 1 journal, first led to changing its status to “level x.” The status change from level 1 to level x allowed for an investigation into the journal and publisher’s practices, and further concerns about paper mill activity in Hindawi journals came to light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today the journal is level 0; any Norwegian scholar who wishes can still publish in it, but neither they nor their institution will get any credit for doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We removed the journal mainly because of the journal’s response to the Norwegian scholars behind the original article,” Linge told us. The official removal decision provided by Linge reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal was listed as level x after consultation with the publication committee in mathematics. The journal published a stolen article and did not remove the article after making the editors aware of the article’s origin. During the last 6 months the journal have receive new worrying comments also linking the journal to machine produced articles (papermills) and the publication committee in mathematics advise us to remove the journal from the registry as a valid level 1 journal. The national board of scholarly publication have chosen to follow the advice from mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Per S. Refseth, a librarian who has taken an interest in this case, told <em>Universitets – </em>an NTNU publication – that<em> </em>he believes <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning-forskningsjuks-morten-oksvold/ber-om-at-alle-tidsskrifter-fra-forlaget-hindawi-svartelistes/377048">all Hindawi journals </a>should now be removed from the publication register, not just <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em> (article in Norwegian). Refseth points to the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv/">research</a> showing that Hindawi journals can become outlets for paper mills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, of course much Hindawi content is valid,” Refseth told us, noting that the problems with paper mills appear to be concentrated in Hindawi special issues. His request to remove all Hindawi journals from the publication register is meant to be temporary, Refseth added, “until Hindawi has shown that they maintain the minimum standard which is expected of an academic publisher.” But if the register only removes some Hindawi journals, Refseth would support that decision.</p>



<p>In any case, appears that Refseth’s desire for a sweeping Hindawi demotion will not be realized, at least in the near future.</p>



<p>“The National Board of Scholarly Publishing, who has the final say in approving journals, series, and publishers, has decided that we must consider each journal independently. So, we will not automatically downgrade all the Hindawi journals in the Register,” Linge told us. </p>



<p>That said, she added that other Hindawi titles will be evaluated at the next meeting to discuss the register, which will happen this June.</p>

                <p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, March 28</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &ndash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a> are now fully indexed in PubMed Central (PMC), expanding our reach and furthering our mission of ensuring research content is accessible and discoverable as widely as possible.</p>



<p>Both journals have an explicit mandate to promote equity in research that can tackle the most urgent priorities for the field, such as access to healthcare, or addressing bias in AI and developing machine learning tools for underserved communities. PLOS is proud to feature perspectives from all over the world, and we make sure that research is peer reviewed by experts with significant, context-appropriate expertise.</p>



<p>&ldquo;With over 1000 published articles, a diverse editorial board of over 600 editors, and now indexing in PubMed Central, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> is excited to continue our vision of enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion in global public health,&rdquo; said Dr. Madhu Pai and Catherine Kyobutungi, Co-Editors-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Global Public Health.</em></p>



<p>&ldquo;Indexing in PubMed acknowledges the time and effort that our authors, reviewers, and editors have contributed to creating a community that values diversity in the research at the intersection of technology and healthcare,&rdquo; said Dr. Leo Anthony Celi, Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to grow this village whose goal is to improve health equity through digital technologies.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Work published in <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> will now be accessible to an even wider audience, meeting researchers where it is convenient for them to access knowledge. With the vast majority of article views coming from PMC or Google Scholar searches, it is imperative that research in both journals be highly visible on these platforms.</p>



<p>Critically, the inclusion of <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> in PMC is an endorsement of the rigor and reliability of the work published within and is the principle reason that researchers prefer to browse research on the platform. Journals indexed in PMC have undergone both technical and scientific benchmarking checks, allowing researchers to trust the findings, methods, and datasets shared. Of particular importance to the mission of both journals, this means local perspectives and expertise reported in rigorously reviewed published research will receive the attention and visibility that it deserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, PLOS hopes that this discoverability will help connect research and researchers from different parts of the world and will ultimately further our fundamental mission: to broaden the range and diversity of perspectives at the forefront of public health and advance the health of all humankind.</p>



<p>This news serves as an important milestone for a journal like PLOS Digital Health, which actively promotes code sharing and data accessibility as a means to further inclusive participation, trust and reproducibility within this growing field of research. Accessibility beyond the journal platform for a high-quality body of open research, as well as open research artifacts extends the reach, impact, and use of authors&rsquo; work. It&rsquo;s a testament to the growing desire for researchers to share their work in a reputable Open Access title that encourages transparency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/renaissance-artists-egg-oil-paintings">Here’s why some Renaissance artists egged their oil paintings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Art historians often wish that Renaissance painters could shell out secrets of the craft. Now, scientists may have cracked one using chemistry and physics.</p>



<p>Around the turn of the 15th century in Italy, oil-based paints replaced egg-based tempera paints as the dominant medium. During this transition, artists including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/leonardo-da-vinci-may-have-invented-3-d-image-mona-lisa">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and Sandro Botticelli also experimented with paints made from oil and egg (<em>SN: 4/30/14</em>). But it has been unclear how adding egg to oil paints may have affected the artwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Usually, when we think about art, not everybody thinks about the science which is behind it,” says chemical engineer Ophélie Ranquet of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.</p>



<p>In the lab, Ranquet and colleagues whipped up two oil-egg recipes to compare with plain oil paint. One mixture contained fresh egg yolk mixed into oil paint, and had a similar consistency to mayonnaise. For the other blend, the scientists ground pigment into the yolk, dried it and mixed it with oil — a process the old masters might have used, according to the scant historical records that exist today. Each medium was subjected to a battery of tests that analyzed its mass, moisture, oxidation, heat capacity, drying time and more.</p>



<p>In both concoctions, the yolk’s proteins, phospholipids and antioxidants helped <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36859-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow paint oxidation</a>, which can cause paint to turn yellow over time, the team reports March 28 in <em>Nature Communications.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the mayolike blend, the yolk created sturdy links between pigment particles, resulting in stiffer paint. Such consistency would have been ideal for techniques like impasto, a raised, thick style that adds texture to art. Egg additions also could have reduced wrinkling by creating a firmer paint consistency. Wrinkling sometimes happens with oil paints when the top layer dries faster than the paint underneath, and the dried film buckles over looser, still-wet paint.</p>



<p>The hybrid mediums have some less than eggs-ellent qualities, though. For instance, the eggy oil paint can take longer to dry. If paints were too yolky, Renaissance artists would have had to wait a long time to add the next layer, Ranquet says.</p>



<p>“The more we understand how artists select and manipulate their materials, the more we can appreciate what they&#8217;re doing, the creative process and the final product,” says Ken Sutherland, director of scientific research at the Art Institute of Chicago, who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>Research on historical art mediums can not only aid art preservation efforts, Sutherland says, but also help people gain a deeper understanding of the artworks themselves.</p>

                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — A young, ultrabright Jupiter may have <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2263.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desiccated its now hellish moon Io</a>. The planet’s bygone brilliance could have also vaporized water on Europa and Ganymede, planetary scientist Carver Bierson reported March 17 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. If true, the findings could help researchers narrow the search for icy exomoons by eliminating unlikely orbits.</p>



<p>Jupiter is among the brightest specks in our night sky. But past studies have indicated that during its infancy, Jupiter was <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/509759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more luminous</a>. “About 10 thousand times more luminous,” said Bierson, of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>





<p>That radiance would have been inescapable for the giant planet’s moons, the largest of which are volcanic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-magma-ocean-hot-metal-core-jupiter">Io</a>, ice-shelled <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europa-water-shallow-liquid-double-ridges-moon">Europa</a>, aurora-cowled <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aurora-shift-confirms-ganymedes-ocean">Ganymede</a> and crater-laden Callisto (<em>SN: 12/22/22, SN: 4/19/22, SN: 3/12/15</em>). The constitutions of these four bodies obey a trend: The more distant the moon from Jupiter, the more ice-rich its body is.</p>



<p>Bierson and his colleagues hypothesized this pattern was a legacy of Jupiter’s past radiance. The team used computers to simulate how an infant Jupiter may have warmed its moons, starting with Io, the closest of the four. During its first few million years, Io’s surface temperature may have exceeded 26° Celsius under Jupiter’s glow, Bierson said. “That’s Earthlike temperatures.”</p>



<p>Any ice present on Io at that time, roughly 4.5 billion years ago, probably would have melted into an ocean. That water would have progressively evaporated into an atmosphere. And that atmosphere, hardly restrained by the moon’s weak gravity, would have readily escaped into space. In just a few million years, Io could have lost as much water as Ganymede may hold today, which may be more than 25 times the amount in Earth’s oceans.</p>



<p>A coruscant Jupiter probably didn’t remove significant amounts of ice from Europa or Ganymede, the researchers found, unless Jupiter was brighter than simulated or the moons orbited closer than they do today.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that icy exomoons probably don’t orbit all that close to massive planets.</p>

<p>A journal has issued an expression of concern about five papers by a psychology researcher whose studies related to women’s sexual behavior and perceived attractiveness have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/09/heard-about-the-study-claiming-men-who-carry-guitar-cases-are-more-attractive-its-been-retracted/">raised eyebrows</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/09/after-18-months-and-recommended-retractions-no-movement-in-psychology-case/">previously reported</a>, sleuths have identified seemingly impossible and likely fabricated results in the work of Nicolas Guéguen, a professor of marketing at the Université de Bretagne-Sud in France, leading to the retraction of four of his papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest expression of concern relates to five articles in <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em>, a SAGE title, which has published eight studies of Guéguen’s, including several on which he is listed as the sole author.</p>



<p>The notice applies to:</p>



<span id="more-126783"></span>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.105.4.1294-1298">Bust Size and Hitchhiking: A Field Study</a> (published 2007, cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science)</li>

</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00315125231164820">expression of concern</a> states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>SAGE Publishing has been made aware of scientific concerns regarding the work of Dr. Nicholas Guéguen. Multiple concerns have been raised regarding the integrity of the research including but not limited to concerns around data fidelity, replicability of findings, and ethical consent and oversight for studies involving human participants. SAGE Publishing’s Research Integrity Team, in cooperation with this journal&#8217;s editors, are currently conducting an investigation into these articles.</p>



<p>This expression of concern will remain in place until the investigation is completed and any further needs for appropriate action have been taken.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Guéguen did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2017, researchers Nick Brown and James Heathers<a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2017/12/a-review-of-research-of-dr-nicolas.html"> published a report</a> on 10 of Guéguen’s studies published prior to 2015, not including the five in <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em>. They found many examples of impossible or implausible standard error measures, result distributions, effect sizes, fieldwork scenarios, and response rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, the Université de Bretagne-Sud investigated Guéguen’s work and <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2019/05/an-update-on-our-examination-of.html">cleared him of wrongdoing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of the investigation, Guéguen said he would retract two studies that contained data collected as part of his undergraduate fieldwork. One, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0422-z">High Heels Increase Women’s Attractiveness</a>,” published in <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/12/in-2014-a-study-claimed-high-heels-made-women-more-attractive-now-its-been-retracted/">was indeed retracted</a> in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other paper, published in <em>Color Research and Application</em> and titled “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/col.20651">Color and women hitchhikers’ attractiveness: Gentlemen drivers prefer red</a>,” has not yet been retracted, but another paper on the same topic, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2011.605398">Color and Women Attractiveness: When Red Clothed Women Are Perceived to Have More Intense Sexual Intent</a>,” which was published in <em>The Journal of Social Psychology</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/02/paper-about-sexual-intent-of-women-wearing-red-retracted-seven-years-after-sleuths-raised-concerns/">has been</a> removed. (We posted about the retraction last December, but the notice didn’t appear online until a few days ago.)</p>



<p>All of the studies cited in the expression of concern are over a decade old, and one was published over two decades ago.. We asked the editors of <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em> why they took so long to issue an expression of concern for the articles. J.D. Ball, the editor in chief of the journal, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All of these articles were published under previous editorial leadership – Perceptual and Motor Skills was acquired by Sage Publications in 2016 and I began as its Editor in Chief in the fall of the same year.&nbsp; The articles came to my attention through others within Sage within the last month, and we quickly issued an Expression of Concern while we embark on a closer study of their content and the concerns raised by them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Brown told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I welcome these expressions of concern. If the authors do not produce satisfactory responses within a reasonable time, I hope that Perceptual and Motor Skills will proceed to retract all of these articles.</p>



<p>To the best of my knowledge, I have only read one of these five articles previously, namely &#8220;Bust Size and Hitchhiking: A Field Study&#8221;. However, I have now read the other four, and they are every bit as implausible as the other 50 or more articles from Dr Guéguen that I have read since 2015.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-planet-trappist-1b-no-atmosphere">The biggest planet orbiting TRAPPIST-1 doesn’t appear to have an atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rocky planet that circles a small star nearly 40 light-years from Earth is hot and has little or no atmosphere, a new study suggests. The finding raises questions about the possibility of atmospheres on the other orbs in the planetary system.</p>



<p>At the center of the system is the red dwarf star dubbed TRAPPIST-1; it hosts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star">seven known planets with masses ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 times Earth’s</a>, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-trappist-1-planets-may-be-water-worlds">few of which could hold liquid water</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/17; 3/19/18</em>). The largest, TRAPPIST-1b, is the closest to its parent star and receives about four times the radiation Earth receives from the sun, says Thomas Greene, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif.</p>





<p>Like all other planets in the system, TRAPPIST-1b is tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star, and one side looks away. Calculations suggest that if the stellar energy falling on TRAPPIST-1b were distributed around the planet — by an atmosphere, for example — and then reradiated equally in all directions, the planet’s surface temperature would be around 120° Celsius.</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05951-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dayside temperature of the planet is actually around 230° C</a>, Greene and colleagues report online March 27 in <em>Nature. </em>That, in turn, suggests that there’s little or no atmosphere to carry heat from the perpetually sunlit side of the planet to the dark side, the team argues.</p>



<p>To take TRAPPIST-1b’s temperature, Greene and his colleagues used the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the planet in a narrow band of infrared wavelengths five times in 2022. Because the observations were made just before and after the planet dodged behind its parent star, astronomers could see the fully lit face of the planet, Greene says.</p>



<p>The team’s results are “the first ‘deep dive’ look at this planet,” says Knicole Colon, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md, who was not involved with the study. “With every observation, we expect to learn something new,” she adds.</p>



<p>Astronomers have long suggested that planets around red dwarf stars might not be able to hold onto their atmospheres, largely because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-small-far-planets-space">such stars’ frequent and high-energy flares would blast away any gaseous shroud</a> they might have during their early years (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). Yet there are some scenarios in which such flares could heat up a planet’s surface and drive volcanism that, in turn, yields gases that could help form a new atmosphere.</p>



<p>“To be totally sure that this planet has no atmosphere, we need many more measurements,” says Michaël Gillon, an astrophysicist at the University of Liège in Belgium who was not part of the new study. It’s possible that when observed at a wider variety of wavelengths and from other angles, the planet could show signs of a gaseous shroud and thus possibly hints of volcanism.</p>



<p>Either way, says Laura Kriedberg, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, who also did not participate in the study, the new result “definitely motivates detailed study of the cooler planets in the system, to see if the same is true of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-fast-radio-burst">A neutron star collision may have emitted a fast radio burst</a></h4>

              
                <p>A neutron star pileup may have emitted two different kinds of cosmic signals: ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves and a brief blip of energy called a fast radio burst.</p>



<p>One of the three detectors that make up the gravitational wave observatory LIGO picked up a signal from a cosmic collision on April 25, 2019. About 2.5 hours later, a fast radio burst detector picked up a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01917-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal from the same region of sky</a>, researchers report March 27 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>





<p>If strengthened by further observations, the finding could bolster the theory that mysterious fast radio bursts have multiple origins — and neutron star mergers are one of them.</p>



<p>“We’re 99.5 percent sure” the two signals came from the same event, says astrophysicist Alexandra Moroianu, who spotted the merger and its aftermath while at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “We want to be 99.999 percent sure.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, LIGO’s two other detectors didn’t catch the signal, so it’s impossible to precisely triangulate its location. “Even though it’s not a concrete, bang-on observation for something that’s been theorized for a decade, it’s the first evidence we’ve got,” Moroianu says. “If this is true … it’s going to be a big boom in fast radio burst science.”</p>



<h4>Mysterious radio bursts</h4>



<p>Astronomers have spotted more than 600 fast radio bursts, or FRBs, since 2007. Despite their frequency, the causes remain a mystery. One leading candidate is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">highly magnetized neutron star called a magnetar</a>, which could be left behind after a massive star explodes (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). But some FRBs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fast-radio-burst-steady-beat">appear to repeat</a>, while others are apparent one-off events, suggesting that there’s more than one way to produce them (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Theorists have wondered if a collision between two neutron stars could spark a singular FRB, before the wreckage from the collision produces a black hole. Such a smashup should <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">emit gravitational waves</a>, too (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>).</p>



<p>Moroianu and colleagues searched archived data from LIGO and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, or CHIME, a fast radio burst detector in British Columbia, to see if any of their signals lined up. The team found one candidate pairing: GW190425 and FRB20190425A.</p>





<p>Even though the gravitational wave was picked up only by the LIGO detector in Livingston, La., the team spotted other suggestive signs that the signals were related. The FRB and the gravitational waves came from the same distance, about 370 million light-years from Earth. The gravitational waves were from the only neutron star merger LIGO spotted in that observing run, and the FRB was particularly bright. There may even have been a burst of gamma rays at the same time, according to satellite data — another aftereffect of a neutron star merger.</p>



<p>“Everything points at this being a very interesting combination of signals,” Moroianu says. She says it’s like watching a crime drama on TV: “You have so much evidence that anyone watching the TV show would be like, ‘Oh, I think he did it.’ But it’s not enough to convince the court.”</p>



<h4>Neutron star secrets</h4>



<p>Despite the uncertainty, the finding has exciting implications, says astrophysicist Alessandra Corsi of Texas Tech University in Lubbock. One is the possibility that two neutron stars could merge into a single, extra-massive neutron star without immediately collapsing into a black hole. “There’s this fuzzy dividing line between what’s a neutron star and what’s a black hole,” says Corsi, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>In 2013, astrophysicist Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas suggested that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/780/2/L21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a neutron star smashup could create an extra-massive neutron star</a> that wobbles on the edge of stability for a few hours before collapsing into a black hole. In that case, the resulting FRB would be delayed — just like in the 2019 case.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">most massive neutron star</a> yet observed is about 2.35 times the mass of the sun, but theorists think they could grow to be around three times the mass of the sun without collapsing (<em>SN: 7/22/22</em>). The neutron star that could have resulted from the collision in 2019 would have been 3.4 solar masses, Moroianu and colleagues calculate.</p>



<p>“Something like this, especially if it’s confirmed with more observations, it would definitely tell us something about how neutron matter behaves,” Corsi says. “The nice thing about this is we have hopes of testing this in the future.”</p>



<p>The next LIGO run is expected to start in May. Corsi is optimistic that more coincidences between gravitational waves and FRBs will show up, now that researchers know to look for them. “There should be a bright future ahead of us,” she says.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXivLabs, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a framework for enabling the arXiv community to contribute to arXiv, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to grow. We recently rolled out two new integrations—DagsHub and Influence Flower—to provide our users with access to data, code, and other materials underlying research and present a map of influence for individual articles on arXiv, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its web platform based on open source tools, </span><a href="https://dagshub.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DagsHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a central location where projects can be hosted, discovered, and collaborated on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects related to arXiv papers will contain the papers’ code, data, models, and experiments allowing them to be fully reproducible. Readers can find DagsHub content on arXiv.org by clicking on the “Code, Data, Media” tab on an article’s abstract page and then activating DagsHub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The DagsHub/arXiv integration enables researchers to quickly discover full and reproducible implementations of research papers on arXiv, reducing the barrier to reproduce scientific work and making research more accessible,” said Dean Pleban, cofounder and CEO of DagsHub. “We&#8217;re really excited to see how the integration helps the machine learning and data science research communities.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence Flower</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provides a visualization tool that allows users to easily understand the flow of academic influence. Influence is calculated as a function of the number of citations between two entities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resulting in a knowledge graph that resembles a flower. Influence Flowers for arXiv papers can be found by clicking on the “Related Papers” tab on an articles abstract page and activating Influence Flower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My research team and I have been iterating on Influence Flower since 2016 and are delighted that it is now an arXivLabs integration,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minjeong Shin, lead developer of Influence Flower.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  &#8220;We hope arXiv readers will enjoy the flower visualization that portrays a paper&#8217;s intellectual input and outcomes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is the case for all  arXivLabs projects, the DagsHub and Influence Flower integrations were built by members of the community and extend the functionality of arXiv. A paper will only display results from integrations if the external service has data relevant to the paper.  Learn more about arXivLabs here: </span><a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://labs.arxiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-sulfur-barn-owls-red-feathers">Volcanic sulfur may make barn owls grow redder feathers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life on a volcanic isle appears to give barn owls a blush of red-brown plumage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high-sulfur environment on such islands <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influences the birds’ coloration</a>, researchers report March 13 in the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>. Darker feathers might also play a role in detoxifying harmful sulfur-based chemicals or help the owls blend in better with the islands’ humid, shadowy forest backdrop. The findings are among the first evidence that environmental sources of sulfur — such as the soil — can influence the color of integument like fur or feathers.</p>





<p>Barn owls (<em>Tyto alba</em>) are found across most continents and on many islands. The owls’ plumage varies considerably across the globe, with bellies ranging from almost completely white to a much darker copper color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, evolutionary ecologist Andrea Romano and his colleagues discovered that barn owls on some islands<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.14053" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> are paler than mainland populations</a>.&nbsp;“However, such a difference disappears on small and remote islands and archipelagos, where in some cases, owls are darker than the continental ones,” says Romano, of the University of Milan.</p>



<p>The researchers wondered if there was something special about these smaller, more isolated islands that was causing a color pattern reversal in the owls: sulfur. Many of the remote islands are volcanic in origin, with volcanoes loading the air and soil with sulfur dioxide. Sulfur also has a crucial role in the development of some melanin pigments. For instance, pheomelanin — which is biochemically built using sulfur compounds — imparts a reddish hue in vertebrate soft tissues, while eumelanin, which creates blacks and dark browns, doesn’t rely on sulfur.</p>



<p>Some studies have linked sulfur-rich diets or artificial sulfur sources like pollution to plumage and fur color, Romano says. So the team hypothesized that a volcanic environment full of sulfur might encourage the owls to produce more pheomelanin, making their plumage darker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers examined the preserved, feather-covered skins of more than 2,000 barn owl museum specimens from dozens of island groups. They scored the relative redness of the owls’ belly plumage, finding an average color for each geographic location. On islands with sulfur-rich volcanic soils or recently active volcanoes — such as Sulawesi in Indonesia or the Canary Islands — the owls had darker, redder plumage than those on nonvolcanic islands such as Tasmania, the team found.</p>



<p>The influence of volcanic sulfur on barn owl colors explains less than 10 percent of the color variation, the researchers estimate. Other inputs like genetics play a major role. For instance, one gene called <em>MC1R</em> is responsible for as much as 70 percent of the color variation, says Thomas Kvalnes, an ecoevolutionary biologist at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Trondheim who was not involved with this study.</p>



<p>“Still there is variation left to explain, both within and between populations,” Kvalnes says. “This is where different environmental factors need to be taken into account.”</p>





<p>It’s possible that sulfur-driven colors provide benefits to the owls, Romano says. Volcanic islands are often thick with vegetation supported by dark, fertile soil. Darker feathers might help the predatory owls disappear into their forest surroundings. The owls might also avoid the toxic effect of high sulfur exposure by shuttling a glut of sulfur into making more pheomelanin. Melanin has been previously tied to detoxifying pollutants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polluted-water-its-where-sea-snakes-wear-black">in sea snakes</a>, for instance (<em>SN</em>: <em>8/14/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among birds, the connection between plumage color and volcanic sulfur might not be limited to just barn owls. Multiple bird species in Iceland, for example, are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-023-02051-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a pheomelanin boost from environmental sulfur</a>, another group reported February 25 in the <em>Journal of Ornithology</em>. But some of these are migratory birds, Kvalnes points out, which dilutes the link between the local setting and the level of pigmentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also possible the volcanic sulfur–pheomelanin relationship is even more widespread in vertebrates. “Studies on different species are highly needed to confirm whether this pattern is general,” Romano says. “Theoretically, however, the same process should apply to at least other birds and mammals.”</p>



<p>Romano is also interested in investigating how the sulfur is moving from the environment into the plumage pigmentation. Is it through the diet? The water? Maybe the air? “We know nothing about how sulfur reaches the soft tissues of this top predator,” he says.</p>

<p>A space scientist formerly based at the University of Sydney made up data in an unpublished manuscript, an investigation by the institution has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachim-schmidt-63370730/?originalSubdomain=au">Joachim Schmidt</a>, “utilised Adobe Photoshop to make up results,” according to a letter dated Feb. 15, 2023, from Emma Johnston, deputy vice-chancellor of research at the University of Sydney, to scientists at the University of Michigan who reported complaints in late 2019 about work by Schmidt and his former professor <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/iver-cairns.html">Iver Cairns</a> to the Australian institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the above, the Panel found there had been breaches of the Research Code on the part of Dr Schmidt. The breaches were viewed as serious, and the Panel considered them to be sufficiently serious to warrant a finding of research misconduct as defined in the <em>Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</em>,” the letter, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/230215-Letter-to-Prof-Toth-Dr-vanderHolst-Prof-Manchester-re-Investigation-outcome-1-1-1.pdf">obtained by Retraction Watch</a>, stated.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126776"></span>



<p>The fabricated image appears in a manuscript about the effects of weather in space Schmidt wrote with Cairns. The paper has yet to be published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sydney has also launched a probe into all the images published in papers Schmidt co-authored in the last five years, according to the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2020, Sydney <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/11/20/university-wins-coveted-space-award.html">was named</a> the Academic Institution of the Year at the Australian Space Awards, and Cairns was one of the scientists who accepted the award. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachim-schmidt-63370730/?originalSubdomain=au">his LinkedIn page</a>, Schmidt was a lecturer at Sydney’s School of Physics from November 2010 to March 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schmidt could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Sydney told <em>Retraction Watch</em> that Schmidt had not been dismissed from the university; instead, he left the institution after his fixed-term contract expired.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/toth-gabor/">Gábor Toth</a>, one of the scientists at the University of Michigan whose model Schmidt used, noticed the fishy image in the manuscript when Cairns emailed it to him and asked if he wanted to be a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Schmidt-Cairns-Investigation-report_redacted-1.pdf">redacted version of a Jan. 2023 report</a> on the case obtained by <em>Retraction Watch</em>, the investigation panel determined that Schmidt used Photoshop “to alter or create” a figure in the 2019 manuscript that was purported to be the output of Toth’s model. Neither Schmidt nor digital forensics experts could reproduce the image with the model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel concluded that Schmidt alone produced the Photoshopped figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At interview, Professor Cairns explained that he has no experience with Photoshop, confirmed that he did not make any amendments, and could not recall asking Dr Schmidt to make any adjustments using Photoshop,” the report stated. It noted that the creation or alteration of the figure “amounted to fabrication and falsification on the part of Dr Schmidt.”</p>



<p>“​​The cheating is so obvious that it can be understood by anyone, no scientific knowledge is needed,” Toth told <em>Retraction Watch.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/richard-de-grijs">Richard de Grijs</a>, a physicist at MacQuarie University in Australia, and <a href="https://staffprofile.usq.edu.au/Profile/Rob-Wittenmyer">Rob Wittenmyer</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of South Queensland, who carried out the investigation, wrote in the report that if one were to accept Schmidt’s claim that he used Photoshop to make the internal structures of the image brighter and more visible, there would need to be an explanatory note in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This should have been done at the draft stage so that Professor Cairns and other prospective authors were made aware of the adjustments for the purposes of their consideration of the draft paper,” they wrote.</p>



<p>The report exonerated Cairns of any wrongdoing, noting that he had no involvement in producing the figure in question and wasn’t aware that Schmidt had fabricated and falsified the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Toth isn’t satisfied. He said Cairns deserves some blame and that clearing him of wrongdoing is “completely irresponsible”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cairns declined to comment, citing confidentiality agreements. Wittenmyer and de Grijs also declined to comment on their report, citing confidentiality.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Toth has claimed nobody in the community believes the results described in Schmidt and Cairns’ other papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.167751578.81634844/v1">rebuttal he published on another of Schmidt and Cairns’ preprints last month</a>, Toth wrote the results were so outlandish they had “only one reasonable explanation”: that they “were most likely not obtained by reproducible numerical simulations.” Previous papers by the duo using the same technique are “similarly questionable,” Toth wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It also seems likely that several published papers with questionable content have slipped through the peer review process,” Toth continued. “Readers and reviewers who only rely on the manuscript and published papers may or may not be able to distinguish genuine science from the type of content presented by [Schmidt and Cairns].”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seeds-alan-turing-patterns-nature-math">Chia seedlings verify Alan Turing’s ideas about patterns in nature</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> – Chia seeds sprouted in trays have experimentally confirmed a mathematical model proposed by computer scientist and polymath Alan Turing decades ago. The model describes how patterns might emerge in desert vegetation, leopard spots and zebra stripes.</p>



<p>These and other blotchy and stripy features in nature are examples of what are called Turing patterns, so named because in 1952, Turing presented equations for how simple interactions between competing factors can lead to surprisingly complex surface patterns. In the case of arid regions, the competition for moisture among plants would drive the intricate distribution of vegetation.</p>





<p>But proving that Turing’s model explains patterns in the real world <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tweaking-pattern-equations">has been challenging</a> (<em>SN: 10/21/15</em>). It wasn’t clear whether Turing’s idea is really behind natural distributions of vegetation. It could be that the idea is a mathematical just-so story that happens to produce similar shapes in a computer, says physicist Flavio Fenton of Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>



<p>In research presented at the American Physical Society meeting, Brendan D’Aquino, who studied in Fenton’s lab during the summer of 2022, described an experiment that seems to confirm that <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/F46.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing’s model truly underlies patterns in vegetation</a>.</p>



<p>The team grew chia seeds in even layers in trays and then adjusted the available moisture. In essence, the researchers were experimentally tweaking the factors that appear in the Turing equations. Sure enough, patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged. The patterns also strongly resembled computer simulations of the Turing model.</p>

Simulated landscapes show similar patterns as rainfall increases (left to right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122978">Brendan D’Aquino (photos), Abouzar Kaboudian (simulations)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“In previous studies,” said D’Aquino, who is an undergraduate computer science student at Northeastern University, “people kind of retroactively fit models to observe Turing patterns that they found in the world. But here we were actually able to show that changing the relevant parameters in the model produces experimental results that we would expect.”</p>



<p>Although Turing patterns have been produced in some chemistry experiments and other artificial systems, the team believes this is the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified Turing’s mathematical insight.</p>

                <p>Tiny particles of plastic have been found everywhere — from the deepest place on the planet, the Mariana Trench, to the top of Mount Everest. And now more and more studies are finding that microplastics, defined as plastic pieces less than 5 millimeters across, are also in our bodies.</p>



<p>“What we are looking at is the biggest oil spill ever,” says Maria Westerbos, founder of the Plastic Soup Foundation, an Amsterdam-based nonprofit advocacy organization that works to reduce plastic pollution around the world. Nearly all plastics are made from fossil fuel sources. And microplastics are “everywhere,” she adds, “even in our bodies.”</p>





<p>In recent years, microplastics have been documented in all parts of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722020009?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the human lung</a>, in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal and fetal placental tissues</a>, in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9269371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human breast milk</a> and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human blood</a>. Microplastics scientist Heather Leslie, formerly of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and colleagues found microplastics in blood samples from 17 of 22 healthy adult volunteers in the Netherlands. The finding, published last year in <em>Environment International</em>, confirms what many scientists have long suspected: These tiny bits can get absorbed into the human bloodstream.</p>



<p>“We went from expecting plastic particles to be absorbable and present in the human bloodstream to knowing that they are,” Leslie says.</p>

<h3>Microplastics in the blood</h3>



<p>Microplastic particles were detected in blood samples from 17 of 22 healthy adult volunteers in the Netherlands. The types of polymer present varied across the group — as did the concentrations. Donors 11, 12 and 13 contributed two samples, both with microplastics. For many others (starred), one sample had microplastics and a second did not.</p>

<p>The findings aren’t entirely surprising; plastics are all around us. Durable, versatile and cheap to manufacture, they are in our clothes, cosmetics, electronics, tires, packaging and so many more items of daily use. And the types of plastic materials on the market continues to increase. “There were around 3,000 [plastic materials] when I started researching microplastics over a decade ago,” Leslie says. “Now <a href="https://www.campusplastics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are over 9,600</a>. That’s a huge number, each with its own chemical makeup and potential toxicity.”</p>



<p>Though durable, plastics do degrade, by weathering from water, wind, sunlight or heat — as in ocean environments or in landfills — or by friction, in the case of car tires, which releases plastic particles along roadways during motion and braking.</p>



<p>In addition to studying microplastic particles, researchers are also trying to get a handle on nanoplastics, particles which are less than 1&nbsp;micrometer in length. “The large plastic objects in the environment will break down into micro- and nanoplastics, constantly raising particle numbers,” says toxicologist Dick Vethaak of the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who collaborated with Leslie on the study finding microplastics in human blood.</p>



<p>Nearly two decades ago, marine biologists began drawing attention to the accumulation of microplastics in the ocean and their<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oceans-plastics-offer-floating-fortress-mess-microbes"> potential to interfere with organism and ecosystem health</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;2/20/16, p. 20</em>). But only in recent years have scientists started focusing on microplastics in people’s food and drinking water — as well as in indoor air.</p>



<p>Plastic particles are also intentionally added to cosmetics like lipstick, lip gloss and eye makeup to improve their feel and finish, and to personal care products, such as face scrubs, toothpastes and shower gels, for the cleansing and exfoliating properties. When washed off, these microplastics enter the sewage system. They can end up in the sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, which is used to fertilize agricultural lands, or even in treated water released into waterways.</p>



<p>What if any damage microplastics may do when they get into our bodies is not clear, but a growing community of researchers investigating these questions thinks there is reason for concern. Inhaled particles might irritate and damage the lungs, akin to the damage caused by other particulate matter. And although the composition of plastic particles varies, some contain chemicals that are known to interfere with the body’s hormones.</p>



<p>Currently there are huge knowledge gaps in our understanding of how these particles are processed by the human body.</p>



<h4>How do microplastics get into our bodies?</h4>



<p>Research points to two main entry routes into the human body: We swallow them and we breathe them in.</p>



<p>Evidence is growing that our <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food and water is contaminated with microplastics</a>. A study in Italy, reported in 2020, found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics in everyday fruits and vegetables</a>. Wheat and lettuce plants have been observed taking up microplastic particles in the lab; uptake from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0567-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soil containing the particles</a> is probably how they get into our produce in the first place.</p>



<p>Sewage sludge can contain microplastics not only from personal care products, but also from washing machines. One study looking at sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in southwest England found that if all the treated sludge produced there were used to fertilize soils, a volume of microplastic particles equivalent to what is found in more than 20,000 plastic credit cards could potentially be released into the environment each month.</p>



<p>On top of that, fertilizers are coated with plastic for controlled release, plastic mulch film is used as a protective layer for crops and water containing microplastics is used for irrigation, says Sophie Vonk, a researcher at the Plastic Soup Foundation.</p>



<p>“Agricultural fields in Europe and North America are estimated to receive far higher quantities of microplastics than global oceans,” Vonk says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Microplastics in everyday produce</h3>



<p>Fruits and vegetables purchased at local markets in Catania, Italy, showed wide variability in the numbers of microplastic particles present. The research highlights the need for more studies on the sources of microplastic exposure.</p>

<p>A recent pilot study commissioned by the Plastic Soup Foundation found microplastics in all <a href="https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Final-Report-pilot-study-plastic-particles-in-livestock-feed-milk-meat-and-blood-SIGNED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood samples collected from pigs and cows on Dutch farms</a>, showing livestock are capable of absorbing some of the plastic particles from their feed, water or air. Of the beef and pork samples collected from farms and supermarkets as part of the same study, 75 percent showed the presence of microplastics. Multiple studies document that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-021-00885-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastic particles are also in fish muscle</a>, not just the gut, and so are likely to be consumed when people eat seafood.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214799321000333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microplastics are in our drinking water, whether it’s from the tap or bottled</a>. The particles may enter the water at the source, during treatment and distribution, or, in the case of bottled water, from its packaging.</p>



<p>Results from studies attempting to quantify levels of human ingestion vary dramatically, but they suggest people might be consuming on the order of tens of thousands of microplastic particles per person per year. These estimates may change as more data come in, and they will likely vary depending on people’s diets and where they live. Plus, it is not yet clear how these particles are absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the human body, and if not excreted immediately, how long they might stick around.</p>



<p>Babies might face particularly high exposures. A small study of six infants and 10 adults found that the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00559" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infants had more microplastic particles in their feces</a> than the adults did. Research suggests <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics can enter the fetus via the placenta</a>, and babies could also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9269371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingest the particles via breast milk</a>. The use of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00171-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic feeding bottles</a> and teething toys adds to children’s microplastics exposure.</p>



<p>Microplastic particles are also floating in the air. Research conducted in Paris to <a href="https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01195546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document microplastic levels in indoor air</a> found concentrations ranging from three to 15 particles per cubic meter of air. Outdoor concentrations were much lower.</p>



<p>Airborne particles may turn out to be more of a concern than those in food. One study reported in 2018 compared the amount of microplastics present <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within mussels harvested off Scotland’s coasts</a> with the amount of microplastics present in indoor air. Exposure to microplastic fibers from the air during the meal was far higher than the risk of ingesting microplastics from the mussels themselves.</p>



<p>Extrapolating from this research, immunologist Nienke Vrisekoop of the University Medical Center Utrecht says, “If I keep a piece of fish on the table for an hour, it has probably gathered more microplastics from the ambient air than it has from the ocean.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where in the air?</h3>



<p>Concentrations of microplastics and nanoplastics in the air likely vary with location. Researchers are interested in studying various settings to better understand human exposure and risk including traffic lights, indoor sports stadiums, textile factories and living rooms.</p>

<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722020009?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study of human lung tissue</a> reported last year offers solid evidence that we are breathing in plastic particles. Microplastics showed up in 11 of 13 samples, including those from the upper, middle and lower lobes, researchers in England reported.</p>



<p>Perhaps good news: Microplastics seem unable to penetrate the skin. “The epidermis holds off quite a lot of stuff from the outside world, including [nano]particles,” Leslie says. “Particles can go deep into your skin, but so far we haven’t observed them passing the barrier, unless the skin is damaged.”</p>



<h4>What do we know about the potential health risks?</h4>



<p>Studies in mice suggest microplastics are not benign. Research in these test animals shows that lab exposure to microplastics can disrupt the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653519327328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut microbiome, lead to inflammation</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389420314199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower sperm quality and testosterone levels</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389422002199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negatively affect learning and memory</a>.</p>



<p>But some of these studies used concentrations that may not be relevant to real-world scenarios. Studies on the health effects of exposure in humans are just getting under way, so it could be years before scientists understand the actual impact in people.</p>



<p>Immunologist Barbro Melgert of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands has studied the effects of nylon microfibers on human tissue grown to resemble lungs. Exposure to nylon fibers reduced both the number and size of airways that formed in these tissues by 67 percent and 50 percent, respectively. “We found that the cause was not the microfibers themselves but rather the chemicals released from them,” Melgert says.</p>



<p>“Microplastics could be considered a form of air pollution,” she says. “We know air pollution particles tend to induce stress in our lungs, and it will probably be the same for microplastics.”</p>



<p>Vrisekoop is studying how the human immune system responds to microplastics. Her unpublished lab experiments suggest immune cells don’t recognize microplastic particles unless they have blood proteins, viruses, bacteria or other contaminants attached. But it is likely that such bits will attach to microplastic particles out in the environment and inside the body. </p>



<p>“If the microplastics are not clean … the immune cells [engulf] the particle and die faster because of it,” Vrisekoop says. “More immune cells then rush in.” This marks the start of an immune response to the particle, which could potentially trigger a strong inflammatory reaction or possibly aggravate existing inflammatory diseases of the lungs or gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>Some of the chemicals added to make plastic suitable for particular uses are also known to cause problems for humans: Bisphenol A, or BPA, is used to harden plastic and is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960076011001063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known endocrine disruptor</a> that has been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890623813003456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developmental effects in children and problems with reproductive systems and metabolism in adults</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/09, p. 5</em>). Phthalates, used to make plastic soft and flexible, are associated with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389417304570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adverse effects on fetal development and reproductive problems in adults</a> along with insulin resistance and obesity. And flame retardants that make electronics less flammable are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412014002736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with endocrine, reproductive and behavioral effects</a>.</p>



<p>“Some of these chemical products that I worked on in the past [like the polybrominated diphenyl ethers used as flame retardants] have been phased out or are prohibited to use in new products now [in the European Union and the United States] because of their neurotoxic or disrupting effects,” Leslie says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Concerning chemicals</h3>



<p>Bits of plastic floating in the world’s air and water contain chemicals that may pose risks to human health. A 2021 study identified <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c00976?source=cen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2,400 chemicals of potential concern</a> found in plastics or used in their processing. Here are a few of the most worrisome.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Short-chain chlorinated paraffins</strong> are used as lubricants, flame retardants and plasticizers. They can cause cancer in lab rodents, but the mechanisms may not be relevant for human health.</li>



<li>The chlorinated compound<strong> mirex</strong> was once used as a flame retardant and can persist in the environment. It’s suspected of being a human carcinogen and may affect fertility.</li>



<li><strong>2,4,6-Tri-tert-butylphenol</strong> is an antioxidant and ultraviolet stabilizer, added to plastics to prevent degradation. There’s evidence that it causes liver damage in lab animals with prolonged or repeated exposure.</li>



<li><strong>Benzo(a)pyrene</strong> is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon that can be released when organic matter such as coal or wood burns. It is also produced in grilled meats. It has been shown to cause cancer, damage fertility and affect development in lab animals.</li>



<li><strong>Dibutyl phthalate</strong> is a plasticizer that is known to cause endocrine disruption, may interfere with male fertility and has been shown to affect fetal development in lab animals.</li>



<li><strong>Tetrabromobisphenol-A</strong> is a flame retardant that can cause cancer in lab animals and may be an endocrine disruptor. It is chemically related to bisphenol&nbsp;A, which has been linked to developmental effects in children.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are the open questions?</h4>



<p>The first step in determining the risk of microplastics to human health is to better understand and quantify human exposure. Polyrisk — <a href="https://polyrisk.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five large-scale research projects</a> under CUSP, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and experts from 75 organizations across 21 European countries <a href="https://cusp-research.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying micro- and nanoplastics</a> — is doing exactly that.</p>



<p>Immunotoxicologist Raymond Pieters, of the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences at Utrecht University and coordinator of Polyrisk, and colleagues are studying people’s inhalation exposure in a number of real-life scenarios: near a traffic light, for example, where cars are likely to be braking, versus a highway, where vehicles are continuously moving. Other scenarios under study include an indoor sports stadium, as well as occupational scenarios like the textile and rubber industry.</p>



<p>Melgert wants to know how much microplastic is in our houses, what the particle sizes are and how much we breathe in. “There are very few studies looking at indoor levels [of microplastics],” she says. “We all have stuff in our houses — carpets, insulation made of plastic materials, curtains, clothes — that all give off fibers.”</p>



<p>Vethaak, who co-coordinates <a href="https://momentummicroplastics.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOMENTUM</a>, a consortium of 27 research and industry partners from the Netherlands and seven other countries studying microplastics’ potential effects on human health, is quick to point out that “any measurement of the degree of exposure to plastic particles is likely an underestimation.” In addition to research on the impact of microplastics, the group is also looking at nanoplastics. Studying and analyzing these smallest of plastics in the environment and in our bodies is extremely challenging. “The analytical tools and techniques required for this are still being developed,” Vethaak says.</p>



<p>Vethaak also wants to understand whether microplastic particles coated with bacteria and viruses found in the environment could spread these pathogens and increase infection rates in people. Studies have suggested that microplastics in the ocean can serve as safe havens for germs.</p>



<p>Alongside knowing people’s level of exposure to microplastics, the second big question scientists want to understand is what if any level of real-world exposure is harmful. “This work is confounded by the multitude of different plastic particle types, given their variations in size, shape and chemical composition, which can affect uptake and toxicity,” Leslie says. “In the case of microplastics, it will take several more years to determine what the threshold dose for toxicity is.”</p>



<p>Several countries have banned the use of microbeads in specific categories of products, including rinse-off cosmetics and toothpastes. But there are no regulations or policies anywhere in the world that address the release or concentrations of other microplastics — and there are very few consistent monitoring efforts. California has recently taken a step toward monitoring by approving the world’s first <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/09/27/california-leads-the-world-in-testing-drinking-water-for-microplastics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements for testing microplastics in drinking water sources</a>. The testing will happen over the next several years.</p>



<p>Pieters is very pragmatic in his outlook: “We know ‘a’ and ‘b,’” he says. “So we can expect ‘c,’ and ‘c’ would [imply] a risk for human health.”</p>



<p>He is inclined to find ways to protect people now even if there is limited or uncertain scientific knowledge. “Why not take a stand for the precautionary principle?” he asks.</p>



<p>For people who want to follow Pieters’ lead, there are ways to reduce exposure.</p>



<p>“Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate,” Melgert says. She recommends not only proper ventilation, including opening your windows at home, but also regular vacuum cleaning and air purification. That can remove dust, which often contains microplastics, from surfaces and the air.</p>



<p>Consumers can also choose to avoid cosmetics and personal care products containing microbeads. Buying clothes made from natural fabrics like cotton, linen and hemp, instead of from synthetic materials like acrylic and polyester, helps reduce the shedding of microplastics during wear and during the washing process.</p>



<p>Specialized microplastics-removal devices, including laundry balls, laundry bags and filters that attach to washing machines, are designed to reduce the number of microfibers making it into waterways.</p>



<p>Vethaak recommends not heating plastic containers in the microwave, even if they claim to be food grade, and not leaving plastic water bottles in the sun.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest thing people can do is rely on plastics less. Reducing overall consumption will reduce plastic pollution, and so reduce microplastics sloughing into the air and water.</p>



<p>Leslie recommends functional substitution: “Before you purchase something, think if you really need it, and if it needs to be plastic.”</p>



<p>Westerbos remains hopeful that researchers and scientists from around the world can come together to find a solution. “We need all the brainpower we have to connect and work together to find a substitute to plastic that is not toxic and doesn’t last [in the environment] as long as plastic does,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-fish-rainbow-light-iridescent">These transparent fish turn rainbow with white light. Now, we know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ghost catfish transforms from glassy to glam when white light passes through its mostly transparent body. Now, scientists know why.</p>



<p>The fish’s iridescence comes from light bending as it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2219300120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travels through microscopic striped structures in the animal’s muscles</a>, researchers report March 13 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Many fishes with iridescent flair have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hardyhead-silverside-fish-crystals-colorful-dots">tiny crystals in their skin or scales</a> that reflect light (<em>SN: 4/6/21</em>). But the ghost catfish (<em>Kryptopterus vitreolus</em>) and other transparent aquatic species, like eel larvae and icefishes, lack such structures to explain their luster.</p>





<p>The ghost catfish’s see-through body caught the eye of physicist Qibin Zhao when he was in an aquarium store. The roughly 5-centimeter-long freshwater fish is a popular ornamental species. “I was standing in front of the tank and staring at the fish,” says Zhao, of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “And then I saw the iridescence.”</p>



<p>To investigate the fish’s colorful properties, Zhao and colleagues first examined the fish under different lighting conditions. The researchers determined its iridescence arose from light passing through the fish rather than reflecting off it. By using a white light laser to illuminate the animal’s muscles and skin separately, the team found that the muscles generated the multicolored sheen.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When backlit with a white light, the mostly transparent ghost catfish becomes iridescent. Microscopic striped structures in the fish’s muscles diffract the light, separating it into different wavelengths. These structures change in length as the fish swims, causing the rainbow colors to flicker. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers then characterized the muscles’ properties by analyzing how X-rays scatter when traveling through the tissue and by looking at it with an electron microscope. The team identified sarcomeres — regularly spaced, banded structures, each roughly 2 micrometers long, that run along the length of muscle fibers — as the source of the iridescence.</p>



<p>The sarcomeres’ repeating bands, comprised of proteins that overlap by varying amounts, bend white light in a way that separates and enhances its different wavelengths. The collective diffraction of light produces an array of colors. When the fish contracts and relaxes its muscles to swim, the sarcomeres slightly change in length, causing a shifting rainbow effect.</p>

<p>The purpose of the ghost catfish’s iridescence is a little unclear, says Heok Hee Ng, an independent ichthyologist in Singapore who was not involved in the new study. Ghost catfish live in murky water and seldom rely on sight, he says. But the iridescence might help them visually coordinate movements when traveling in schools, or it could help them blend in with shimmering water to hide from land predators, like some birds, he adds.</p>



<p>Regardless of function, Ng is excited to see scientists exploring the ghost catfish’s unusual characteristics.</p>





<p>“Fishes actually have quite a number of these interesting structures that serve them in many ways,” he says. “And a lot of these structures are very poorly studied.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">Mathematicians have finally discovered an elusive ‘einstein’ tile</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 13-sided shape known as “the hat” has mathematicians tipping their caps.</p>



<p>It’s the first true example of an “einstein,” a single shape that forms a special tiling of a plane: Like bathroom floor tile, it can cover an entire surface with no gaps or overlaps but only with a pattern that never repeats.</p>



<p>“Everybody is astonished and is delighted, both,” says mathematician Marjorie Senechal of Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who was not involved with the discovery. Mathematicians had been searching for such a shape for half a century. “It wasn’t even clear that such a thing could exist,” Senechal says.</p>





<p>Although the name “einstein” conjures up the iconic physicist, it comes from the German <em>ein Stein</em>, meaning “one stone,” referring to the single tile. The einstein sits in a weird purgatory between order and disorder. Though the tiles fit neatly together and can cover an infinite plane, they are aperiodic, meaning they can’t form a pattern that repeats.</p>



<p>With a periodic pattern, it’s possible to shift the tiles over and have them match up perfectly with their previous arrangement. An infinite checkerboard, for example, looks just the same if you slide the rows over by two. While it’s possible to arrange other single tiles in patterns that are not periodic, the hat is special because there’s no way it can create a periodic pattern.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="412" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1.jpg" alt="An image of a &quot;hat&quot; which is made up of eight dark gray, small, kite shapes." class="wp-image-3123084" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1-632x383.jpg 632w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323_ec_einstein-tiles_inline1-307x186.jpg 307w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123084">The “hat” (one highlighted) is a polygon made up of eight smaller kite shapes (dark gray lines).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123084">D. Smith <em>et al</em>/<em>arXiv.org</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Identified by David Smith, a nonprofessional mathematician who describes himself as an “imaginative tinkerer of shapes,” and reported in a paper posted online March 20 at arXiv.org, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hat is a polykite</a> — a bunch of smaller kite shapes stuck together. That’s a type of shape that hadn’t been studied closely in the search for einsteins, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss of the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City, one of a group of trained mathematicians and computer scientists Smith teamed up with to study the hat.</p>



<p>It’s a surprisingly simple polygon. Before this work, if you’d asked what an einstein would look like, Goodman-Strauss says, “I would’ve drawn some crazy, squiggly, nasty thing.”</p>



<p>Mathematicians previously knew of nonrepeating tilings that involved multiple tiles of different shapes. In the 1970s, mathematician Roger Penrose discovered that just two different shapes formed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-islamic-penrose-tiles-0">tiling that isn’t periodic</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/07</em>). From there, “It was natural to wonder, could there be a single tile that does this?” says mathematician Casey Mann of the University of Washington Bothell, who was not involved with the research. That one has finally been found, “it’s huge.”</p>

<p>Other shapes have come close. Taylor-Socolar tiles are aperiodic, but they are a jumble of multiple disconnected pieces — not what most people think of as a single tile. “This is the first solution without asterisks,” says mathematician Michaël Rao of CNRS and École Normale Supérieure de Lyon in France.</p>



<p>Smith and colleagues proved that the tile was an einstein in two ways. One came from noticing that the hats arrange themselves into larger clusters, called metatiles. Those metatiles then arrange into even larger supertiles, and so on indefinitely, in a type of hierarchical structure that is common for tilings that aren’t periodic. This approach revealed that the hat tiling could fill an entire infinite plane, and that its pattern would not repeat.</p>





<p>The second proof relied on the fact that the hat is part of a continuum of shapes: By gradually changing the relative lengths of the sides of the hat, the mathematicians were able to form a family of tiles that can take on the same nonrepeating pattern. By considering the relative sizes and shapes of the tiles at the extremes of that family — one shaped like a chevron and the other reminiscent of a comet — the team was able to show that the hat couldn’t be arranged in a periodic pattern.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mathematicians found the first true “einstein,” a hatlike shape that can be tiled to cover an infinite plane, but with a pattern that can’t repeat. The hat is one of a family of related tiles with many different shapes. In this video, the hats morph into these different shapes. By comparing shapes at the extremes of this family, one shaped like a chevron and the other reminiscent of a comet, the researchers were able to show that the hat couldn’t form a pattern that repeats.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the paper has yet to be peer-reviewed, the experts interviewed for this article agree that the result seems likely to hold up to detailed scrutiny.</p>



<p>Nonrepeating patterns can have real-world connections. Materials scientist Dan Shechtman won the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unusual-crystal-patterns-win-chemistry-nobel">his discovery of quasicrystals</a>, materials with atoms arranged in an orderly structure that never repeats, often described as analogs to Penrose’s tilings (<em>SN: 10/5/11</em>). The new aperiodic tile could spark further investigations in materials science, Senechal says.</p>



<p>Similar tilings have inspired artists, and the hat appears to be no exception. Already the tiling has been rendered artistically as <a href="https://twitter.com/alytile/status/1638506055381708801?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smiling turtles</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/RobFathauerArt/status/1638244474349555714?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumble of shirts and hats</a>. Presumably it’s only a matter of time before someone puts hat tiles on a hat.</p>

<p>And the hat isn’t the end. Researchers should continue the hunt for additional einsteins, says computer scientist Craig Kaplan of the University of Waterloo in Canada, a coauthor of the study. “Now that we’ve unlocked the door, hopefully other new shapes will come along.”</p>

                <p>This month we have an intriguing interview with Dr. Paco Calvo from the Minimal Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Mercia in Spain. We talk with him about his new book Planta Sapiens: The New Science of Intelligence.</p> <p>We discuss the scientific evidence for plant intelligence while acknowledging that intelligence and consciousness are not the same. It is interesting to think of plants as demonstrating embodied cognition in contrast to the "intelligence" demonstrated by computer software. We also consider the pioneering work of Charles Darwin, who actually studied plant behavior before the invention of time lapse photography.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3EeZo3o" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Planta Sapiens: The New Science of Plant Intelligence</em></a>  by Paco Calvo</li> <li><a href= "https://www.um.es/en/web/minimal-intelligence-lab/contenido/the-team/paco-calvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paco Calvo</a> (University of Mercia, Spain)</li> <li> Gagliano, M., Vyazovskiy, V.

<p>Three major publishers have removed several authors’ names from five papers, most published a decade ago, following correspondence from an attorney representing one of the individuals.</p>



<p>Three of the papers appeared in <em>PLOS ONE </em>in 2013, one appeared in Springer Nature’s <em>Tumor Biology</em> the same year, and one appeared in Elsevier’s <em>Obesity Research &amp; Clinical Practice</em> in 2014. As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/11/author-loses-five-papers-most-for-compromised-peer-review/">reported in 2016</a>, the journals retracted the articles because one of the authors – Lishan Wang – had forged the rest of his co-authors’ names and manipulated the peer review process.</p>



<p>Years later, Yongyong Shi, a distinguished professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Bio-X Institutes and one of the authors whose name Wang forged, hired a lawyer named <a href="https://www.dorsey.com/people/l/lewin-joseph">Joseph Lewin</a>, a solicitor with Dorsey &amp; Whitney (Europe) LLP. Lewin, in turn, requested that the three publishers remove Shi’s name from the original papers.</p>



<span id="more-126758"></span>



<p>Elsevier <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871403X17300807">appears to have done that in September 2021</a>. Springer Nature complied in March 2022. And PLOS <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160299">did so in June 2022</a>.</p>



<p>The move is “extremely rare,” Renee Hoch, managing editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team, told Retraction Watch. “Over a period of several years, I recall fewer than 5 cases at PLOS.” Hoch continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is not uncommon for us to receive such requests from authors, but in accordance with the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/files/cope-retraction-guidelines-v2.pdf">COPE Retraction Guidelines</a> we almost always decline these requests and preserve the original published record of the research, including the article’s authorship and contributions. We hold authors to the contributor information they provided prior to publication, and we recognize that requests to remove authors following a retraction decision may be motivated by competing interests involving anticipated impacts of a retraction on the requestor’s professional standing.</p>



<p>However, we have had a couple of cases in which there was very strong evidence to support claims that an individual did not contribute to the published work and was included on an author list without their knowledge or consent. In these cases, we concluded that the individual in question was not truly an author of the article in question and we amended the published record accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Asked about any involvement from Shi’s attorney, Hoch said: “We cannot provide any details about this case beyond what was published in the retraction notices.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature confirmed that Shi was removed as an author in March 2022, but said that “due to legal reasons, I’m afraid we cannot share any further information.” An Elsevier spokesperson would not confirm when Shi and the others were removed as authors, saying only:&nbsp; “We are bound by confidentiality on this retraction, so the only official statement is the retraction notice itself.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We learned of the authorship changes on Dec. 20, 2022, when Lewin emailed us a letter demanding we remove Shi’s name from the five relevant entries in the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?http://retractiondatabase.org/">Retraction Watch Database</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lewin’s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">letter</a>, which we interpreted as a legal threat, also demanded we respond within 10 business days. (Note that the letter arrived by email just a few business days before the traditional Christmas holiday.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the event that the confirmation requested above is not received within that time limit, our client will need to take the appropriate legal next steps,” Lewin concluded, citing various statutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told us this week that he was “sorry” we found the letter threatening, adding: “We do not agree with that characterisation.”</p>



<p><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">Judge for yourself</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This was the first we had heard from Shi, or anyone representing him, since our post in 2016. We told Lewin that to make any changes to the database we would need to learn more about what had happened in the intervening years that prompted three major publishers to take an unusual step. We also informed him that for the sake of transparency – and because it is an interesting story about retractions – we would publish a post on Retraction Watch about the development.</p>



<p>Lewin did not agree, writing that “we do not understand that there would be any need to update previous coverage or to quote from any confidential correspondence.” He added: “If Retraction Watch believes it would be helpful to make a post, then we would require that the wording of such a post to be agreed in advance with our client to avoid any further damage being caused.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch readers will not be surprised that we did not find that suggestion acceptable.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After more than two months of back and forth, we asked Lewin for his client’s responses to these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Please tell us, in your own words, how you came to be listed as an author on the original paper.</li>



<li>Please forward any reports of the “institutional investigation, conducted by the Administration Office of Bio-X Institutes at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,” referred to by several of the retraction notices.</li>



<li>Please indicate what steps, including legal threats to journals and/or publishers, that you took to have your name removed as an author of the five papers to which your attorney’s Dec. 20, 2022 letter refers.</li>



<li>Please forward any correspondence you and/or your attorneys have had with PLOS, Elsevier, and Springer Nature regarding these five papers.</li>



<li>Please indicate when your name was removed from the original papers.</li>



<li>We did not hear from you from 2017 until the letter from your attorney in December 2022, years after these entries were added to the database. Can you explain the delay?</li>
</ul>



<p>Lewin reiterated – more gently this time – that he did not agree with our publishing a new post about this case:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We again repeat our client’s request that Retraction Watch reconsider whether it really wishes to publish an article in relation to our client.&nbsp; He understandably wants nothing to do with these articles and does not want his name linked with them any further.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He did not respond directly to the first question, writing only that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is our understanding that Retraction Watch, which has published on this matter already, is aware that our client had no involvement in these articles, and that his name was falsely added to them without his knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given these circumstances, there is nothing surprising or unexpected about the fact that publishers would agree to remove an attribution of authorship in an article to an individual whom they know was not an author.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we and PLOS’s Hoch noted, publishers ceding to such requests is unusual.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Despite the reports of the investigations having been shared with the three publishers, Lewin declined to share them with us, claiming that “the contents of the investigations, requested at bullet point two, are set out clearly in the retraction notes and letter statements by the publishers.”</p>



<p>We pointed out that all that was included in those retraction notices and letters – more on those later – were descriptions of what the report said, not “the contents of the investigations.” We and others have long <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01728-z">recommended</a> that universities make public in the interests of transparency and improvement.</p>



<p>Lewin also declined to share any of his letters to the three publishers, providing only one letter each from Elsevier and Springer Nature to him that he said “set out what had happened and explain why the publishers agreed to remove Professor Shi’s name.” He said “no equivalent letter exists in respect of the PLOS article.” As a condition of seeing those letters, we agreed not to publish them, but Lewin said we could “refer to, paraphrase or quote from them in a limited fashion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter from Elsevier, dated Sept. 22, 2021, says that “the attribution was incorrect,” based on the publisher’s investigation and the university report, and that they had removed Shi as an author of the original article and published a retraction notice. That presumably refers to an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2017.08.004">updated retraction notice</a> – confusingly labeled as an “erratum”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Publisher would like to bring to your notice that certain individuals who were listed as authors of the paper “Association between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, UCP3 and lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms and obesity in Chinese adolescents ” have informed the journal that this occurred without consent or knowledge of the submission. In addition the email address provided with the paper was not the correct email address. Please note that these authors previously identified by the submitting author as co-authors in the original publication of the paper were not the authors of this manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsevier also asks Shi to “Please accept our apologies that this occurred.”</p>



<p>The letter from Springer Nature, dated March 3, 2022, is similar, but does not include an apology.</p>



<p>Given that we consider publishers to be the entities that determine who an author is, and that they have removed Shi and others’ names from the original papers, we have done the same for the seven relevant entries – five retractions, and two corrections to relevant papers – in our database. (Note that Elsevier has done so inconsistently; Shi&#8217;s name is removed from the original article and a related erratum, but the publisher removed author Jianhua Chen only from the erratum. All other author names remain the same on both Elsevier pages.)</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We of course still have questions about what happened between 2016 and 2022. When we asked Lewin for the second time to respond to our final question, about why we did not hear from his client for more than six years until receiving what we perceived as a legal threat from his solicitor, Lewin responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our client does not propose to respond further.&nbsp; For the sake of clarity, you will note that the answers to your first and last questions are already set out in the letter that we sent to you in December 2022.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As readers will see, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022.12.20-Letter-to-CFSI-incl-Appendices-1.pdf">they are not</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/raccoon-dog-dna-covid-origins-debate">How raccoon dog DNA fits into the COVID-19 origins debate</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been three years since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Yet the mystery of how it got started continues to make headlines again and again and to fuel a heated, and oft-time political, debate.</p>



<p>While what exactly happened in the earliest days of the pandemic remains an ongoing question, some genetic studies have tipped the scales in favor of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breathless-book-covid-19-pandemic-coronavirus">pandemic originating from a viral spillover from animals</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/22</em>). A hypothesis, but no evidence, suggests the virus could have been leaked, either accidentally or deliberately, from a lab.</p>





<p>U.S. intelligence agencies are split over which scenario they deem more likely. The Department of Energy and the FBI lean more toward the possibility of a lab leak, while the National Intelligence Council and others suspect a natural origin. It is important to note that most of these agencies drew their conclusions with “low confidence,” which means the available data the intelligence community had to rely on is “scant, questionable or very fragmented,” according to the National Intelligence Council.</p>



<p>Very soon, we will see what that intelligence looks like. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/20/statement-by-the-president-on-s-619-the-covid-19-origin-act-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill into law on March 20 to declassify government information</a> on the virus’s origins within 90 days.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a new genetic analysis adds another piece to the puzzle in favor of the spillover scenario, this time with a possible suspect: raccoon dogs.</p>



<p>“These data do not provide a definitive answer to how the pandemic began,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a March 17 news briefing. “But every piece of data is important to moving us closer to that answer.”</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about the latest data and what they mean for pinning down the events that sparked the pandemic.</p>



<h4>What is the latest line of evidence for a natural origin?</h4>



<p>The first cluster of coronavirus cases in humans was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers">linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market</a> in Wuhan, China (<em>SN: 1/24/20</em>). Environmental samples taken in 2020 from the southwest corner of the market, where live animals were sold, carried <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-origins-research-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market-lab-leak/673390/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetic material from both the coronavirus and animals</a>, the <em>Atlantic</em> first reported on March 16.</p>





<p>In some virus-positive samples, computational biologist Alex Crits-Christoph and an international team of colleagues also found DNA from the common raccoon dog (<em>Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>). The foxlike animal native to Asia is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7706974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">susceptible to coronavirus infections</a>, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that traces of both animal and coronavirus were uncovered in the same samples suggest that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-mutation-pandemic-covid-genetics-bat-human">the virus may have jumped from bats</a> to raccoon dogs or other animals at the market and then to people, the team writes (<em>SN: 7/12/21</em>). It posted <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7754299#.ZBtS8OzMJhH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its analysis</a> March 20 on Zenodo, a repository where scientists can post research results that have not yet been reviewed by their peers.</p>



<p>This analysis builds on evidence from two studies published in <em>Science </em>in July 2022. In the first study, researchers reported that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants from the pandemic’s early days suggest that there may have been <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two separate jumps from animals to people</a>: one in late November 2019 and another weeks later. The second study used the first known COVID-19 cases and coronavirus-positive environmental samples from the seafood market to identify the southwest part of the market with live animal vendors as the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely epicenter of the pandemic’s spread</a>.</p>



<p>In the new analysis, Crits-Christoph, who works from Baltimore for the nonprofit Cultivarium, and colleagues analyzed public genetic data that had been released in early March from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That data, linked to a February 2022 preliminary study from the China CDC (which is now under review at a scientific journal), allowed the team to zoom in on an animal stall in the southwest part of the market that had the most virus-positive samples. A sample from a cart in that stall also contained plenty of genetic material from raccoon dogs, as well as a handful of other animals such as ducks.</p>



<p>There was no evidence of human DNA in that sample, a finding that hints that animals, not necessarily people, were close to the coronavirus in that spot. Raccoon dogs or another animal, the results suggest, might have served as a bridge to take the coronavirus from bats to humans. </p>



<h4>Does this finding confirm where the coronavirus originated? &nbsp;</h4>



<p>No. As Ghebreyesus said on March 17, the findings aren’t a nail in the coffin to confirm the spillover hypothesis. Finding evidence of animal and coronavirus together in samples hints that the two were mighty close to one another. But this particular spillover story is still circumstantial. It&#8217;s unclear if animals housed in the stalls might have been infected with the virus, and if these animals then passed the virus on to humans.</p>



<p>It would have been better to have a positive swab from a live animal that was for sale at the market in late November or December 2019. Or to find the virus in wild animals. But both of those things may now be almost impossible.</p>



<p>By the time officials came to investigate the market in early 2020, any infected animals were probably long gone. And the virus has evolved since then. It’s morphed in people — giving us the alpha and delta variants as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">omicron and its spawn</a> (<em>SN:10/17/22</em>). And it’s still evolving in animals, too. Coronaviruses circulating in animals now, or even two years ago, probably won’t look the same as SARS-CoV-2 did at the end of 2019, so viruses from nature won’t be an exact match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s like a cold criminal case,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “There may be mounting evidence that, you know, John Doe did it. But not conclusive enough to try John Doe for the crime.”</p>



<p>That isn’t unusual when it comes to pinning down the source of an outbreak. Such investigations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-origins-bats-virus">can take years</a> and may never provide a definitive answer (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). Eventually, we may reach a point where we’re relying on the best evidence available and will have to accept that it’s as close as we’re going to get.</p>



<h4>Do we need to know COVID-19’s origins to prepare for the next pandemic?</h4>



<p>Not really. While the evidence we have leans toward spillover, we’re “mired in the mud,” says Osterholm, who notes that he’s agnostic for how the pandemic got started. He says it’d be better to focus on preparing for the next pandemic, rather than paying attention to only this one. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unavoidable that another pandemic is in our future; whether it will be another coronavirus, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">bird flu</a> or something else entirely is anyone’s guess (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>).</p>



<p>What we can do now is think more carefully about how we use land and do research.</p>



<p>As wildlife habitats disappear, humans come across animals more often, perhaps introducing more opportunities to exchange pathogens. Farming animals in tight quarters provides more opportunities too. Fixing those problems could help prevent spillover, or at least make it less likely.</p>



<p>Lab regulations — making sure potentially risky work is done safely or not done at all — can help to stop a lab leak.</p>



<p>There’s no reason we can’t start doing these things now, Osterholm says. “I wish we’d move on and start addressing … what we’re going to do to be better prepared” for the next potential spillover or lab leak, he says. “Because we’re not.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-recorded-brain-waves-free-octopus">Scientists have now recorded brain waves from freely moving octopuses</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, scientists have recorded brain waves from freely moving octopuses. The data reveal some unexpected patterns, though it’s too early to know <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00145-8#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how octopus brains control the animals’ behavior</a>, researchers report February 23 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“Historically, it&#8217;s been so hard to do any recordings from octopuses, even if they’re sedated,” says neuroscientist Robyn Crook of San Francisco State University, who was not involved in the study. “Even when their arms are not moving, their whole body is very pliable,” making attaching recording equipment tricky.</p>





<p>Octopuses also tend to be feisty and clever. That means they don’t usually put up with the uncomfortable equipment typically used to record brain waves in animals, says neuroethologist Tamar Gutnick of the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To work around these obstacles, Gutnick and colleagues adapted portable data loggers typically used on birds, and surgically inserted the devices into three octopuses. The researchers also placed recording electrodes inside areas of the octopus brain that deal with learning and memory. The team then recorded the octopuses for 12 hours while the cephalopods went about their daily lives — sleeping, swimming and self-grooming — in tanks.</p>



<p>Some brain wave patterns emerged across all three octopuses in the 12-hour period. For instance, some waves resembled activity in the &nbsp;human hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. Other brain waves were similar to those controlling sleep-wake cycles in other animals.</p>



<p>The researchers also recorded some brain waves that they say have never been seen before in any animal. The waves were unusually slow, cycling just two per second, or 2 hertz. They were also unusually strong, suggesting a high level of synchronization between neurons. Sometimes just one electrode picked up the weird waves; other times, they showed up on electrodes placed far apart,</p>



<p>Observing these patterns is exciting, but it’s too early to tell whether they’re tied to a specific behavior or type of cognition, Gutnick says. Experiments with repetitive tasks are necessary to fully understand how these brain areas are activated in octopuses during learning.</p>



<p>The new research is exciting in that it provides a technique for future researchers to observe brain activity in awake and naturally behaving octopuses, Crook says. It could be used to explore brain activity behind the animals’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/skin-color-changes-reveal-octopus-drama">color-changing abilities</a>, spectacular vision, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-sleep-stages-active-color-quiet-rem-brain">sleep patterns</a> and adept arm control (<em>SN: 1/29/16; SN: 3/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Octopuses are highly intelligent, so by studying the creatures “you can get ideas about what is important for intelligence,” Gutnick says. “The problems that the animals face are the same problems, but the solutions that they find are sometimes similar and sometimes different and all of these comparisons teach us something.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/math-black-holes-proof-space-physics">Here’s a peek into the mathematics of black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Black holes exist in our universe. That’s widely accepted today. Physicists have detected the X-rays emitted when black holes feed, analyzed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">gravitational waves from black hole collisions</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">imaged two of these behemoths</a>.</p>



<p>But mathematician Elena Giorgi of Columbia University studies black holes in a different way. “Black holes are mathematical solutions to the Einstein equation,” Giorgi says — the “master equation” that is the basis of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">general theory of relativity</a>.</p>



<p>She and other mathematicians seek to prove theorems about these solutions and otherwise probe the math of general relativity. Their goal: unlock unsuspected truths about black holes or&nbsp;verify existing suspicions.</p>

<p>Within general relativity, “one can understand clean mathematical statements and study those statements, and they can give an unambiguous answer within that theory,” says Christoph Kehle, a mathematician at ETH Zurich’s Institute for Theoretical Studies. Mathematicians can solve equations that have bearing on questions about the nature of black holes’ formation, evolution and stability.</p>



<p>Last year, in a paper posted online at arXiv.org, Giorgi and colleagues settled a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14808.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-standing mathematical question</a> about black hole stability. A stable black hole, mathematically speaking, is one that if poked, nudged or otherwise disturbed will eventually settle back into being a black hole. Like a rubber band that has been stretched and then released, the black hole doesn’t rip apart, explode or cease to exist, but returns to something like its former self.</p>





<p>Black holes seem to be physically stable — otherwise they couldn’t endure in the universe — but proving it mathematically is a different beast.</p>



<p>And a necessary feat, Giorgi says. If black holes are stable, as researchers presume, then the math describing them had better reflect that stability. If not, something is wrong with the underlying theory.</p>



<p>“Most of my work,” Giorgi says, “is about proving things that we already expected to be true.”</p>



<p>Mathematics has a history of big contributions in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/history-black-holes-science-news">the realm of black holes</a>. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild published a solution to Einstein’s equations for general relativity near a single spherical mass. The math showed a limit to how small a mass could be squeezed, an early sign of black holes. More recently, British mathematician Roger Penrose won the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics for his calculations showing that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-prize-2020-black-hole-roger-penrose-reinhard-genzel-andrea-ghez">black holes were real-world predictions</a> of general relativity. In a landmark paper published in 1965, Penrose described how matter could collapse to form a black hole with a singularity at its center.</p>





<p>Just a couple of years earlier, in 1963, New Zealand mathematician <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/1975/04/00368423.ap071689.07a00220.pdf">Roy Kerr found a solution</a> to Einstein’s equation for a rotating black hole. This was a “game changer for black holes,” Giorgi noted in a public lecture given at the virtual 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians. Rotating black holes were much more realistic astrophysical objects than the non-spinning black holes that Karl Schwarzschild had solved the equations for.</p>



<p>“Physicists really had believed for decades that the black hole region was an artifact of symmetry that was appearing in the mathematical construction of this object but not in the real world,” Giorgi said in the talk. Kerr’s solution helped establish the existence of black holes.</p>



<p>In a nearly 1,000-page paper, Giorgi and colleagues used a type of “proof by contradiction” to show that Kerr black holes that rotate slowly (meaning they have a small angular momentum relative to their mass) are mathematically stable. The technique entails assuming the opposite of the statement to be proved, then discovering an inconsistency. That shows that the assumption is false. The work is currently undergoing peer review. “It’s a long paper, so it’s going to take some time,” Giorgi says.</p>



<p>The result doesn’t yet extend to Kerr black holes that rotate quickly with respect to their mass, which are also known to exist in the universe.</p>



<p>Though the result isn’t likely to upend our view of black holes, these kinds of mathematical journeys can yield new insights.</p>



<p>That’s been true in Giorgi’s study of black holes with an electric charge, which are also solutions to Einstein’s equations. She’s been exploring what happens to those black holes in the face of disturbances that feature both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. These waves may surround black holes, fall inside them or interact with them at a distance, she says. Through that work, she reached a new mathematical definition of electromagnetic radiation that could be used in additional research on charged black holes.</p>



<p>Giorgi has straddled the fields of physics and math since high school, when she realized that “if I know math, I can also do physics.” Her enduring interest in physics and attraction to differential geometry, which deals with geometry of smooth spaces, made general relativity a natural fit. But her straddling has led some colleagues to misunderstand her work.</p>



<p>Some physicists think black hole mathematicians are proving things “more rigorously that they have already sort of proven, that they’re convinced of,” Giorgi says. Meanwhile, some mathematicians consider her work “more physics than math” — that is until they see the length of her full mathematical proofs.</p>



<p>Giorgi likes the freedom she has found in research. “You can choose to work on whatever you want,” she says. “You have to find your own problems.”</p>

<p>When researchers with disabilities, such as blindness or dyslexia, cannot access the research papers in their field, can we really call it &#8220;open&#8221; science?</p>
<p>On April 17th, arXiv will be hosting a half-day online forum for everyone invested in making research outputs accessible to every researcher, regardless of disability. The forum will center the experiences of academic researchers who face barriers to accessing and reading papers, and will be useful for people across the authoring and publishing ecosystem. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">We hope you will join us</a>. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.</p>
<h2>Why a forum?</h2>
<p>In December, arXiv <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.07286">published our research results on the accessibility of research papers</a> in preparation for improving the accessibility of the arXiv corpus. What we heard from researchers is that not only are the vast majority of papers not fully accessible, but that efforts to improve those outcomes have largely stalled.</p>
<p>As we work on offering HTML versions of papers published on arXiv alongside the existing PDF and source files, we also discovered how intertwined our efforts are with those of authors, authoring tools, publishers, conferences, standards, and more. We are part of an ecosystem and hope others who are also committed to making accessible research papers a reality will join us for informative presentations, a panel discussion, and digging more deeply into specific challenges in breakout discussion groups. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">Learn more about the forum here</a>, and <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_br1lFL94OVQB5nE">register for free</a>.</p>

                <p>DNA from strands of Beethoven’s hair is helping to uncover what may have caused his death, researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The composer was plagued with health issues for most of his life. On March 26, 1827, he succumbed to what many historians suspect was liver failure while in his apartment in Vienna. Now, an analysis of several locks of hair passed down through families and gathered by collectors shows that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beethoven carried several genetic risk factors for liver disease</a>, the scientists report March 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>This elevated risk — paired with a potential liver infection and the composer’s alleged drinking habits — may have hastened Beethoven’s premature death at the age of 56, says Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>It’s well-known that Beethoven’s storied career was cut short by progressive hearing loss that left the composer completely deaf by age 45. Beethoven also suffered from gastrointestinal issues and a deteriorating liver. That faulty organ is thought to be responsible for the composer’s skin reportedly turning yellow in the summer of 1821. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The root cause of Beethoven’s plethora of health issues has been a source of fascination to many. But working out what ailed a man that lived nearly two centuries ago is no easy task. Researchers have had to rely on notes from the composer’s two autopsies, preformed after he was exhumed in 1863 and 1888, and other historical documents.</p>

Genetic analyses are helping to uncover the source of some of his ailments.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123009">Beethoven-Haus Bonn</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Clues, however, could hide in Beethoven’s DNA. Only a few historical figures — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/genetic-tests-confirm-remains-are-those-king-richard-iii">such as Richard III</a> — have had their DNA analyzed (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). But these genetic treasure troves can provide information that “no anatomical examination, after two hundred years, could provide,” says Carles Lalueza-Fox, a paleogeneticist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In 2014, Begg and his colleagues decided to reconstruct Beethoven’s genetic instruction book, or genome. First, the team needed a piece of the composer himself. Luckily, around 30 separate locks of hair attributed to Beethoven had survived, in the possession of collectors and the descendants of people who first received the hair in the 19th century.</p>



<p>Begg partnered with Beethoven enthusiasts to ask the owners of these locks to part with a few strands. The team was able to gather samples from eight locks said to have been snipped from 1821 to 1827.</p>





<p>One lock didn’t yield enough DNA for analysis. Of the others, two locks could not have come from the composer; one belonged to a woman with an ancestry consistent with Ashkenazi Jews, the researchers found. But five of the locks, which came from various sources, clearly belong to a single individual with central European ancestry, which Beethoven would have had. The natural degradation of DNA over time in these locks was also consistent with the hair dating to the early 19th century.</p>



<p>Those common features — along with a clear record of who owned these separate locks of hair over the centuries — makes Begg “extremely confident” that these locks are Beethoven’s.</p>



<p>Lalueza-Fox agrees. “I think they provide compelling evidence of five samples being from the composer,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers used some of the best-preserved locks to reconstruct the composer’s genome. This analysis didn’t uncover any genetic markers for deafness or intestinal issues. But the team did identify several risk factors for liver disease, including a variant of the gene <em>PNPLA3 </em>that would have tripled the composer’s risk of developing liver issues in his lifetime.</p>



<p>Those risk factors alone shouldn’t have doomed Beethoven. But the scientists also found traces of the hepatitis B virus, which damages livers, in one of the strands reportedly collected shortly after Beethoven’s death. The risk to the liver from a hepatitis B infection would have been further compounded by regular alcohol use, the researchers say. Some contemporaries claimed that the composer was drinking heavily by the end of his life.</p>



<p>While we don’t know exactly what combination of factors killed Beethoven, “this is a fascinating detective story,” says Ian Gilmore, a hepatologist at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in England, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>A fascinating story with a new twist: The Y chromosome in the five hair samples doesn’t match those of five people who share a 14th century ancestor with Beethoven. (The composer never had any known children.) This could be a sign that the hair is inauthentic. Or, more likely, one of Beethoven’s direct ancestors on his father’s side had a child outside of marriage, possibly sometime between the 16th and 18th centuries, Begg says.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262047548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Off-Earth</a><br><em>Erika Nesvold<br>MIT Press, $27.95</em></p>



<p>Astrophysicist Erika Nesvold once asked an executive of a company aiming to mine the moon how he planned to address risks that mining equipment might carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life">microbes from Earth and contaminate the moon</a> (<em>SN: 1/10/18</em>). His response: “We’ll worry about that later.”</p>



<p>That’s a reckless mind-set when it comes to preparing for people to live and work in space, Nesvold argues in her new book, <em>Off-Earth</em>. It means making decisions with your eyes closed. History is full of cautionary tales of mutinies, exploitation, and humanitarian and ecological disasters that would be all too easy to reproduce in space.</p>





<p>“Space settlement advocates often advertise space as a blank slate where we can build utopian societies free from the crowded territory and bloodied history of our terrestrial home,” Nesvold writes. “But adopting a ‘worry about it later’ attitude toward human rights and ethics strikes me as a path to repeating the tragedies of that history through ignorance.”</p>



<p>Nesvold is a developer for the education software/video game <a href="https://universesandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Universe Sandbox</em></a>. In the last several years, she has shifted her focus to how to build a fair and just future in space, cofounding the <a href="https://justspacealliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JustSpace Alliance</a>, a nonprofit working to do just that. <em>Off-Earth</em> is an extension of her 2017 podcast, <a href="https://makingnewworlds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Making New Worlds</em></a>, which asked ethical questions about space settlement. The book takes some of the same questions and expands on them. Each chapter title is a question: “Why are we going?” “Who gets to go?” “Who’s in charge?” “What if I get sick?” “Which way is Mecca?”</p>



<p>Most chapters start with three vignettes, usually from different time periods. A chapter outlining debates over whether to settle space at all starts by asking the reader to imagine being in the 1600s and deciding to uproot your family and head to the New World. A chapter on how land usage and ownership rights might work in space imagines a person recently freed from slavery in the U.S. South in 1865 and worrying that the new president will take back the land they finally own. A chapter on the ethical questions that will arise when people get sick in space conjures a hospital worker in 2020 making gut-wrenching triage decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The third vignette is usually set in the year 2100, on a space settlement.</p>



<p>Then Nesvold examines how various ethical scenarios related to the chapter’s theme might play out in space. She quotes experts in fields that don’t often come up in space science: ethics, philosophy, Indigenous history, law.</p>



<p>This approach is a departure from many books about the future of life on the final frontier, forcing readers to confront hard realities and possible points of friction. A lot of arguments for moving humankind off Earth assume space is a land of infinite resources. But at least at first, settlers will have much more limited resources than they did on Earth. And situations where humans are isolated with limited resources, like on ships or in colonial settlements, have often been recipes for disaster.</p>





<p>So how will space settlers share what little they have? How will they decide who lives and dies, and what quality of life and death they’ll have? Will living in the harsh conditions of an early space settlement nurture innovation and creative progress, or encourage humankind’s worst tendencies toward exploitation and tyranny?</p>



<p>Most of these questions don’t have clear answers. That’s partly because ethical questions rarely do. The book “has undoubtedly revealed much about my own political opinions and priorities, not to mention the influence of my personal background and the culture in which I was raised,” Nesvold writes. “In the same way, your position on these issues is likely deeply connected with your own values and beliefs.”</p>



<p>Finding answers is also challenging because it requires anticipating what our descendants, who will live in the space communities we are already creating, will want, need and believe. To have the best chance of avoiding disaster, the time to consider these questions is now, not later, even though space settlement may be decades or centuries away, Nesvold argues.</p>



<p><em>Off-Earth</em> should be required reading for anyone who dreams about living in space. Space is not a blank slate, but imagining a better world there can help us build one — and can help make our earthbound civilizations better too.</p>

<p>One more paper co-authored by Australian health journalist Maryanne Demasi has earned an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388198123000331">expression of concern</a> for image duplication.</p>



<p>The move comes seven years after the journal <em>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</em> (<em>BBA</em>) was first made aware of potential problems with a figure in Demasi&#8217;s paper that showed Western blots. It marks the third time one of the former researcher&#8217;s scientific publications has been officially <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/26/controversial-australian-journalists-paper-flagged-journal/">flagged as concerning</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">retracted</a>.</p>



<p>Demasi, who <a href="https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/22067">earned her PhD</a> from the University of Adelaide in 2004, has been in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/do-mask-mandates-work.html">news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/03/face-masks-work-study/">recently</a> after she did a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/opinion/masks-work-cochrane-study.html">controversial interview</a> with the <a href="https://drtomjefferson.com/">lead author</a> of a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full">Cochrane review</a> that cast doubt on face masks. She has drawn <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-challenges-the-mainstream/9980708">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-cops-criticism-over-wi-fried/9973056">rebuke</a> over the past decade, beginning with a 2013 program in which her reporting questioned statins. She and her co-authors <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">told us</a> in 2018 that they believe her work as a journalist made her research a target of criticism.</p>



<span id="more-126749"></span>



<p>Following a yearslong probe by the university into allegations of image manipulation in Demasi’s PhD thesis, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/09/controversial-australian-science-journalist-admits-to-duplication-in-her-phd-thesis/">she admitted</a> she had &#8220;duplicated or probably duplicated&#8221; some images. However, as we reported earlier, this practice was felt to have been acceptable at the time and Demasi was not found guilty of research misconduct.</p>



<p>In its new notice, published March 11, <em>BBA</em> referred to another probe:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following an investigation by the Central Adelaide Local Health Networks (CALHN) panel, concerns have been raised relating to the veracity of the data presented in Fig. 6. These concerns cannot be resolved since the original data are no longer available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The problematic images were first spotted in 2016 by <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a> of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne (Vaux is a member of the board of directors of The Center for Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organization). He shared his misgivings with <em>BBA</em> and the University of Adelaide that same year, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/21/paper-co-authored-by-australian-journalist-maryanne-demasi-to-be-marked-with-expression-of-concern/">we reported earlier</a>. The journal told him the paper would receive an expression of concern in October, but the notice did not appear until this month&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux welcomed the new development, but told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While having the original data might have helped them determine which of the authors was responsible for making the figure, the availability of the original images is not necessary to show, on balance of probabilities, that parts of the image had been duplicated and altered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Judging by <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#3">a comment she left</a> on PubPeer in 2021, sleuth Elisabeth Bik seems to agree:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Not only appear the four lanes to be showing the same blot strip, the molecular weights and aspect ratios appear to have changed as well, suggesting this is not a simple mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vaux also pointed out that an earlier comment on PubPeer had also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#2">raised concerns</a> about other images in the paper that were not addressed in the journal&#8217;s statement. According to that comment:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All points are same in Fig. 2A and Demasi [PhD] thesis Fig. 7.5 except 18 hr hypoxia point, which has different mean and SEMs. Could the authors please explain?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Demasi as well as the corresponding and first authors, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388198106002721">paper</a>, titled &#8220;Endothelial cell COX-2 expression and activity in hypoxia,&#8221; was published in 2006. It has been cited 31 times, including twice this year, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The authors &#8220;would like us to believe the [paper&#8217;s] conclusions are not affected, as concerns have not been raised about Figs. 3, 4, and 5,&#8221; Vaux told us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormone-shot-drunk-mice-sober-quickly">A hormone shot helped drunk mice sober up quickly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The only cure to being drunk is to wait it out. But that might not always be the case: Injecting drunk mice with a naturally occurring hormone helped them sober up more quickly than they otherwise would have, a new study shows.</p>



<p>Mice that received a shot of FGF21 — a hormone made by the liver — <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00041-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woke up from a drunken stupor roughly twice as fast </a>as those that didn’t, researchers report in the March 7 <em>Cell Metabolism</em>.</p>





<p>The find could one day be used to help treat alcohol poisoning, a sometimes-deadly side effect of heavy drinking that lands millions of people in the emergency room every year, says molecular endocrinologist David Mangelsdorf.</p>



<p>The sobering effect of FGF21 isn’t the first time the hormone has been linked to drinking. Scientists have previously shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877817305525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livers ramp up production of this hormone</a> when alcohol floods the bloodstream. And while FGF21 doesn’t help break down alcohol, researchers have found that the hormone can help protect livers from the toxic effects of liquor while dampening the desire to continue drinking in mice and monkeys.</p>



<p>Those findings made Mangelsdorf, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and his colleagues curious whether FGF21 also plays a role in recovering from too much alcohol. So the team fed mice enough alcohol to knock them out and waited to see how long it took for them to wake up.</p>



<p>Mice that were genetically altered to be unable to produce their own FGF21 took around an hour and a half longer to wake up than normal mice. But regular mice given an extra dose of FGF21 woke up twice as fast than those that hadn’t received a shot. Drunk mice that were injected with FGF21 were also able to keep their balance for longer than their peers while placed on a slowly rotating platform.</p>



<p>FGF21 probably helps mice sober up by activating nerve cells in a part of the brain involved with stimulating wakefulness, the researchers say. If the hormone works in similar ways in people, it could be used to nudge people suffering from alcohol poisoning back into wakefulness, Mangelsdorf says.</p>



<p>That ability could be useful because — aside from the hazard of choking while unconscious — doctors sometimes must wait for people with alcohol poisoning to wake up before being able to address their symptoms.</p>



<p>“There is no drug for treating alcohol poisoning,” Mangelsdorf says. A drug that could help people wake up — much in the same way that the medication <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/opioid-crisis-overdose-death&#039;">Narcan prods consciousness along in opioid overdoses</a> — would be a “phenomenal” improvement for treating people rushed to the emergency room, he says (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-cure-intoxication-sober">found ways to sober up mice before</a>, but these treatments didn’t work well in people (<em>SN: 11/29/22</em>). FGF21 might be a different story, Mangelsdorf thinks, because of the previous research on the hormone in monkeys, which are more like humans than mice.</p>



<p>Any drugs derived from FGF21 wouldn’t have to stick to treating alcohol poisoning. Researchers are also looking to use the hormone to address liver disease and alcohol addiction, says Lorenzo Leggio, a physician scientist with the National Institutes of Health who is based in Baltimore and was not involved with the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Leggio says, this study adds “an important piece to the puzzle” for understanding the role of FGF21 and developing new treatments for alcohol addiction and other ailments.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hindawi-wiley.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hindawi-wiley-300x150.png?resize=300%2C150&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-125721" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hindawi-wiley.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hindawi-wiley.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Nineteen journals from the open-access publisher Hindawi were removed from Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science Monday when the indexer refreshed its Master Journal List. </p>



<p>The delistings follow a disclosure by Wiley, which bought Hindawi in 2021, that the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">suspended publishing special issues</a> for three months because of “compromised articles.” That lost the company $9 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate updates its Master Journal List of titles included in Web of Science on a monthly basis. It dropped more than 50 journals from its indexes in March, according to a <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/supporting-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-our-commitment-to-curation-and-selectivity-in-the-web-of-science/">blog post</a> by Nandita Quaderi, editor in chief and vice president of Web of Science, for failing to meet <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">24 quality criteria</a> such as adequate peer review, appropriate citations, and content that’s relevant to the stated scope of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delisting 50 journals at once is more than usual for Clarivate, and may be the beginning of a larger culling. Quaderi wrote that the company developed an AI tool “to help us identify outlier characteristics that indicate that a journal may no longer meet our quality criteria.” The tool flagged more than 500 journals at the beginning of this year, according to her blog post, and Web of Science’s editors continue to investigate them.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126734"></span>



<p>Removing a journal from Web of Science means Clarivate will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a>, as universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions. The company also suppresses journals from its yearly Journal Citation Report that publishes impact factors, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">we’ve reported</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in the past</a>.</p>



<p>The data company does <s>has a new policy</s> not to publish a list of journals removed from Web of Science, a Clarivate spokesperson told us, though it does say which journals it suppresses from its Journal Citation Report. We compared the <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/collection-list-downloads">new lists of journals</a> included in the four indices of the Web of Science Core Collection with the lists from last month to identify journals that were delisted. We identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><s>83 </s>82 delisted titles</a>, which a Clarivate spokesperson told us included journals removed for “not meeting production requirements.” [See update at the end of this post.]</p>



<p>Hindawi confirmed to Retraction Watch that the following 19 journals were delisted from Web of Science:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Biomed Research International</em></li>



<li><em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em></li>



<li><em>Contrast Media &amp; Molecular Imaging</em></li>



<li><em>Disease Markers</em></li>



<li><em>Education Research International</em></li>



<li><em>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Nanomaterials</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Oncology</em></li>



<li><em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Mobile Information Systems</em></li>



<li><em>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em></li>



<li><em>Scanning</em></li>



<li><em>Scientific Programming</em></li>



<li><em>Security and Communication Networks</em></li>



<li><em>Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing</em></li>
</ol>



<p>We’ve previously reported on issues with the content of several of the journals on the list: A special issue of <em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em> hosted the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">Twitter-famous paper</a> with capital Ts standing in for error bars, and an investigation by Hong Kong Polytechnic University found that one of its PhD students let a former professor “borrow” his email account to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">edit two special issues</a> of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Hindawi and Wiley said last year that they were retracting more than <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">500 papers linked to peer review rings</a>.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">analysis of papermill activity</a> in Hindawi journals, sleuth Dorothy Bishop looked at special issues from ten journals, nine of which were among those delisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was pleased to see that these journals have been delisted,” Bishop told us, “because their inclusion in Clarivate’s Web of Science seemed inappropriate because they were publishing many articles from paper mills, where the editorial and/or review process appeared to be compromised.”</p>



<p>Paper mills targeted the journals, Bishop said, “precisely because they are included in Web of Science, which gives them kudos and means that any citations count towards indicators such as H-index, which is used by many institutions in hiring and promotion.”</p>



<p>“I feel sorry for the honest authors who have published in these journals,” she said, “as they will find their publications tainted by association with these journals.”</p>



<p>Separately, the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> recently delisted 10 Hindawi journals, all of which were also delisted from Web of Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wiley has taken important actions to address research integrity challenges impacting Hindawi’s Special Issues,” Jay Flynn, executive vice president and general manager of Wiley’s research division told us in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Once we identified misconduct in the external peer review process, we immediately paused the publication of special issues, purged bad actors and implemented rigorous new checks throughout our publishing workflows. Additionally, we added expert staffing, increased editorial controls, introduced AI-based screening tools, and accelerated the retraction process to ensure the integrity of the scholarly record. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though integrity challenges are an issue across the industry, we are confident in the value and demand for research publishing and steadfast in our commitment to research integrity as we serve researchers around the globe who deliver life-changing findings every day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We take full responsibility for the quality of the content we publish at Wiley. We also must work together as an industry to strengthen the lines of defense against those attempting to subvert the scholarly record. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 2200 UTC, 3/22/23: After this post was published, the Clarivate spokesperson identified the journals from our list that were dropped for editorial reasons–which the company had previously declined to do–and we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">updated it accordingly</a>. The spokesperson said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We do think it is important that misinformation is corrected and in this case we are happy to clarify which journals have been dropped for failing to meet quality criteria. We continue to listen to the scholarly community and keep our policies under constant review in order to protect research integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/building-block-life-asteroid-ryugu">A crucial building block of life exists on the asteroid Ryugu</a></h4>

              
                <p>Uracil, a building block of life, has been found on the asteroid Ryugu.</p>



<p>Yasuhiro Oba and colleagues discovered the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36904-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precursor to life in samples collected from the asteroid</a> and returned to Earth by Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft, the team reports March 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“The detection of uracil in the Ryugu sample is very important to clearly demonstrate that it is really present in extraterrestrial environments,” says Oba, an astrochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>





<p>Uracil had been previously detected in samples from meteorites, including a rare class called CI-chondrites, which are abundant in organic compounds. But those meteorites landed on Earth, leaving open the possibility they had been contaminated by humans or Earth’s atmosphere. Because the Ryugu samples were collected in space, they are the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">purest bits of the solar system scientists have studied to date</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). That means the team could rule out the influence of terrestrial biology.</p>



<p>Oba’s team was given only about 10 milligrams of the Ryugu sample for its analysis. As a result, the researchers were not confident they would be able to detect any building blocks, even though they’d been able to previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">detect uracil and other nucleobases in</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">meteorites</a> (<em>SN: 4/26/22).</em></p>



<p>Nucleobases are biological building blocks that form the structure of RNA, which is essential to protein creation in all living cells. One origin-of-life theory suggests RNA predated DNA and proteins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quite-switch">that ancient organisms relied on RNA for the chemical reactions associated with life</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/04</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="345" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032023_ag_ryugu_inline1.jpg" alt="Two photos side by side showing two samples taken from the asteroid Ryugu.

Analysis of about 10 milligrams of the sample revealed the presence of uracil, a key building block of life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122968">Y. Oba <em>et a</em>l/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2023, JAXA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team used hot water to extract organic material from the Ryugu samples, followed by acid to further break chemical bonds and separate out uracil and other smaller molecules.</p>



<p>Laura Rodriguez, a prebiotic chemist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, who was not involved in the study, says this method leaves the possibility that the uracil was separated from a longer chain of molecules in the process. “I think it’d be interesting in future work to look at more complex molecules rather than just the nucleobases,” Rodriguez says.</p>





<p>She says she’s seen in her research that the nucleobases can form bonds to create more complex structures, such as a possible precursor to the nucleic acid which may lead to RNA formation. “My question is, are those more complex structures also forming in the asteroids?”</p>



<p>Oba says his team plans to analyze samples from NASA’s OSIRIS-REX mission, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">grabbed a bit of asteroid Bennu in 2020</a> and will return it to Earth this fall (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-sickness-elimination-experimental-drug-africa">Sleeping sickness is nearing elimination. An experimental drug could help</a></h4>

              
                <p>The patient arrived at the hospital one hot night in Masi-Manimba, an agricultural town unfurled along the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Lukula River.</p>



<p>He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t walk, he was conscious but “barely could make … gestures,” says Béatrice Kasita, a nurse who was there when he came in. She remembers his deformed posture, how his body curved into a fetal position.</p>



<p>He was also unusually drowsy — a telltale sign of his illness. The patient, a 27-year-old man, had been brought in by a medical team screening villagers for sleeping sickness, a deadly parasitic disease spread via the bite of a blood-feeding fly.</p>





<p>Since the first case report in the late 14th century, the illness has ebbed and flowed in sub-Saharan Africa. Across the continent, the predominant form of sleeping sickness shows up in about two dozen countries, most cases now occurring in the DRC. The disease is a nightmarish scourge that can maim the brain and ultimately kill. But today, cases hover near an all-time low. In 2021, the World Health Organization <a href="https://apps.who.int/neglected_diseases/ntddata/hat/hat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported just 747 cases</a> of the predominant form, down from more than 37,000 in 1998.</p>



<p>That precipitous plunge came out of decades of work, millions of screenings, spinal taps upon spinal taps, toxic treatments and the rapid rise of safer though often burdensome ones, countless IV infusions, long hospital days and nights, medicine lugged to remote villages, and communities on constant alert for sleeping sickness’s insidious symptoms.</p>



<p>Now, a promising drug has fanned hope for halting transmission of the disease. Called acoziborole, the drug is taken by mouth in just a single dose. Kasita’s patient, who arrived at the hospital in June 2017, was among the first to try it.</p>



<p>Her hospital is one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea working to test the drug with the <a href="https://dndi.org/diseases/sleeping-sickness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative</a>, or DNDi, a nonprofit organization based in Geneva. In a small trial reported last year, the drug appeared to be safe and effective. A larger trial is ongoing, with results expected by the end of this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="449" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg" alt="photo of nurse Béatrice Kasita holding some papers seated at a table outside a clinic surrounded by other healthcare workers" class="wp-image-3122753" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-580x383.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-282x186.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122753">Béatrice Kasita (center) is a nurse at a hospital in Masi-Manimba, one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea for a new sleeping sickness drug. She has been caring for people with the disease for 10 years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122753">PAUL SHEMISI/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the findings hold up, the drug would be “a game changer,” says Emmanuel Bottieau, an infectious disease specialist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is not involved with the clinical trial. A single-dose medication is “really a dream for us, coming from such a long history of very difficult or toxic or cumbersome treatments.”</p>



<p>But he and others know that even a game-changing drug doesn’t guarantee a win. The dominant form of sleeping sickness is on a short list of neglected tropical diseases the WHO is targeting for elimination by 2030. That means bringing cases in certain areas down to zero knowing that some control efforts may still be required. Vastly harder to achieve is disease eradication, where cases worldwide stay parked at zero permanently. (To date, just a single human infectious disease — smallpox — has been eradicated.)</p>





<p>Even elimination is no easy task — and can get harder as you approach the finish line. “We are advancing very well,” says José Ramón Franco, a WHO medical officer based in Geneva, “but we [haven’t] reached the last mile.”</p>



<p>Still, tiptoeing along the edges of optimism, some, like Kasita, are finding moments to cheer. For the severely ill patient, her team initially wondered if acoziborole would work. “Are we really going to help him with this single-dose treatment?”</p>



<p>Two weeks later, he could stand, with some support, and had started speaking again, a radical recovery. Kasita smiles widely as she remembers it. Watching him heal “was a great pleasure,” she says.</p>

<p>About 400 kilometers to the west of Masi-Manimba, physician Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji is preparing to visit Kasita’s hospital. Afterward, he’ll hit up hospitals in Idiofa, Bagata and then Bandundu, three other acoziborole clinical trial sites in the DRC. To reach the sites, Mutombo will travel by boat, plane, car and motorbike. He’ll stay in both modern hotels and hotels without running water or electricity. Then, he’ll return home to Kinshasa, the DRC’s bustling capital. It’s a great and noisy city, he grins, with people playing music in the streets and “many, many, many traffic jams.”</p>



<p>In Kinshasa, Roi Baudouin hospital is one of the DNDi’s acoziborole trial sites. Mutombo has been organizing logistics and ensuring that each site has what it needs to treat and monitor patients. That includes generators for electricity, an internet connection, medical equipment and trained clinical trial staff.</p>



<p>Mutombo has worked with sleeping sickness patients since 2004. Two weeks after finishing his medical training in Kasaï province, he shipped out to Kasansa, becoming the only medical doctor in a village of about 11,000 people. In Kasansa, which lies in western DRC, north of the Angola border, sleeping sickness was then, and still remains, endemic.</p>



<p>The disease, also called human African trypanosomiasis, is caused by a single-celled, ruffle-edged parasite that worms its way into the brain. One subspecies, <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em>, causes the vast majority of cases and tends to plague western and central Africa. Another, <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> occurs in the eastern and southern parts of the continent and causes a more rapid, acute illness with far fewer cases in people.</p>

MAE MELVIN/CDC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Both subspecies can ride in the guts and glands of tsetse flies, which often buzz near bodies of water; many of Mutombo’s patients in Kasansa were fishers or farmers. When the fly bites, the parasite enters the bloodstream. From there, it can get picked up again when other flies feed, shuttling from insects to humans in a disease-spreading cycle.</p>



<p>In the blood, <em>T.b. gambiense</em> sparks a slow-burning illness that can begin with a fever and, if left untreated, end with death. As the parasite multiplies, lymph nodes enlarge and the head, muscles and joints ache. Patients can also become intensely itchy, scratching hard enough to damage the skin, Kasita says.</p>



<p>When the parasite slips past the blood-brain barrier, patients enter the second stage of the disease. No one knows exactly where the parasite lodges in the brain, but neurological symptoms can vary. Doctors and nurses describe a range of distressing and bizarre behaviors. One common behavior gives the illness its name. Somehow, the parasite reverses people’s sleep/wake cycle. “They will sleep a lot during the day, and at night, they will be up, watching,” Kasita says.</p>



<p>Patients can also feel depressed and confused, neglect to care for themselves, hallucinate or experience logorrhea, words cascading from lips in nonsensical streams. In some infected people, personalities can swing like a wrecking ball. Jacques Pépin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, worked with sleeping sickness patients in the 1980s and remembers one who suddenly threw a large rock at his head.</p>



<p>Such outbursts can be scary for patients and families, says Antoine Tarral, a pharmacologist and infectious disease physician who works with Mutombo and led the DNDi’s sleeping sickness program for 10 years. Fear of the disease can prompt villages to reject infected individuals, he says.</p>



<p>Sleeping sickness carries a social stigma that makes people feel like outcasts, Mutombo agrees. “This disease is terrible.” When he first began treating patients, he says, “I was doing my best to make them feel like human beings.”</p>



<p>But for decades, available treatments were terrible, too.</p>

<h4>Sleeping sickness has a history of terrible treatments</h4>



<p>For most of treatment history, injected or intravenous drugs were the only option for sleeping sickness. They could cure patients, but only if doctors administered them in time. And when cases advanced to the second stage, medical staff had to switch tactics. For patients, that meant a spinal tap to confirm diagnosis followed by different drugs.</p>



<p>Until the late 2000s, the most-used treatment for advanced gambiense sleeping sickness was the highly toxic melarsoprol. The drug is derived from arsenic (and it’s still the leading treatment for advanced rhodesiense cases). Medical staff administered the drug for 10 days via daily intravenous infusions that burned entering patients’ veins, Mutombo says. The treatment could also be lethal, killing some 5 percent of patients.</p>



<p>Mutombo grows somber remembering two of his patients who died, young men he tried to cure in Kasansa. “That was a very bad experience,” he says. “When patients come to the hospital, they come to receive a treatment, not to die … [from] the drug we gave them.”</p>



<p>But doctors didn’t have a lot of options. Without melarsoprol, patients with serious cases faced near-certain death.</p>



<p>Not long after his patients died, Mutombo heard that the DNDi was launching a project on a new, less toxic treatment for advanced cases. He jumped at the chance, applied to be an investigator and joined the project in 2006. The new treatment, called NECT, combined eflornithine, an IV drug developed for cancer, with the oral drug nifurtimox. Eflornithine was already being used to treat sleeping sickness, but required dozens of infusions, and nifurtimox was a treatment for Chagas disease.</p>



<p>In 2009, after a clinical trial and the WHO’s endorsement, NECT took off, rocketing past melarsoprol or eflornithine alone as the first-line treatment for advanced sleeping sickness. But NECT had some logistical snafus, Mutombo says. It wasn’t easy to transport, for one. Treatment for four patients came in 40-kilogram packages that had to be trucked over bad roads into rural areas that lacked medical workers. “That was a problem with NECT,” Mutombo says. “It was effective, but it was heavy and needed trained staff.”</p>



<p>Less than a decade later, Mutombo, Tarral and their DNDi colleagues debuted an easier alternative. Fexinidazole, at long last, was a drug doctors could deliver exclusively via pills rather than an IV. It’s not perfect — it’s administered by a nurse, patients need to take it for 10 days and it’s not best for the most severe cases (for these, the WHO still recommends NECT). But easy-to-use oral drugs lower the burden on health systems, Mutombo says. Medical staff could more easily bring treatments to remote patients. And that brought scientists one step closer to sleeping sickness’s elimination.</p>

<h3>Sleeping sickness efforts pay off</h3>



<p>The number of reported sleeping sickness cases caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> (yellow) and <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> (orange) has dropped steadily since the late 1990s. The World Health Organization hopes to eliminate transmission of gambiense sleeping sickness by 2030. </p>

<h4><strong>A new drug could help bring cases to zero</strong></h4>



<p>Acoziborole, the drug now being tested in clinical trials, may be another big step in the right direction. Just one dose cured some <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00660-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of patients with late-stage infections</a>, Mutombo, Tarral and colleagues reported November 29 in the <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. That’s comparable to treatment with NECT. “Acoziborole is one solution to manage this disease,” Tarral says.</p>



<p>Not only does the drug seem to be effective, but “it’s given orally … and it needs to be given only once,” says the University of Sherbrooke’s Pépin, who was not involved with the trial but <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00686-7/fulltext?rss=yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote an opinion piece</a> that appeared alongside the new report.</p>



<p>Yet, as Pépin points out, the acoziborole study has some limitations. The scientists tested the drug in just 208 patients, so no one knows if serious adverse effects might occur in larger populations. And the study wasn’t performed like the classic gold-standard clinical trial, with patients randomly assigned into different groups receiving different interventions.</p>



<p>Tarral acknowledges these drawbacks, which he says were due to low participant numbers. The researchers included only people with video-confirmed parasitic infections, which required years of searching for patients across 10 hospitals in two different countries.</p>



<p>“It’s not the standard approach, but that was the only possible approach,” Pépin says. “They did what could be done with the number of cases that are occurring now.”</p>



<p>The study’s promising results spurred a new, larger trial that will include 1,200 participants. This time, the team is enrolling people with positive antibody blood tests even if the parasite’s presence hasn’t been confirmed. Many of these participants may not actually be sick, says Veerle Lejon, a scientist at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Montpellier who was not involved in developing the drug but is collaborating with the DNDi on evaluating sleeping sickness diagnostics.</p>



<p>What this trial will offer, she says, is a raft of new data that will help determine the drug’s safety.</p>

<h4>The challenges of eliminating an infectious disease</h4>



<p>Even if acoziborole gets the green light, stamping out sleeping sickness isn’t a sure bet.</p>



<p>Eliminating an infectious disease is a slippery task. Success can, paradoxically, churn out new challenges. When case numbers dip low enough, for instance, interest in the disease can wane. Donors move money to other public health priorities, and once-robust control programs wither.</p>



<p>That happened for sleeping sickness in the 1960s, the last time cases dropped. Over the next few decades, cases ratcheted up, and epidemics broke out in Angola, the DRC and South Sudan. “Control of the disease was neglected, and then slowly, the disease came back,” says WHO medical officer Franco.</p>



<p>A doubled-down effort to find cases and treat them with ever-improving drugs got sleeping sickness under control again, with case numbers cratering to their low point today. But that level of surveillance is not sustainable, Franco says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="674" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg" alt="photo in which Felix Akwaso Massa appears in the foreground holding a notebook with his back to the camera as he speaks to Charnelle Mafuta and her four children who are seated in front of a building" class="wp-image-3122739" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-573x383.jpg 573w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-278x186.jpg 278w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-868x580.jpg 868w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122739">Physician Felix Akwaso Massa (far left), an investigator with the DNDi’s sleeping sickness clinical trials, speaks with Charnelle Mafuta (pictured with her family), a woman who was treated for sleeping sickness with the oral drug fexinidazole.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122739">XAVIER VAHED/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Health care workers can also lose knowledge of how to recognize the disease as they encounter fewer and fewer infected individuals, says Jennifer Palmer, a medical anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The challenge is really in making sure that people are aware that sleeping sickness is still a problem,” she says. In a small study in South Sudan, reported in 2020, Palmer and colleagues found that lay people encouraging people in the community to get tested <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/5/2/52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for more than half of detected cases</a>.</p>



<p>Still, getting patients tested and treated can depend on whether they’re able to safely travel to health facilities. With the threat of violence in South Sudan and armed conflict in eastern DRC, the fate of sleeping sickness may also be shaped by the whims of war.</p>



<p>Even if every infected person was promptly found and treated, the disease-causing parasite would likely linger in wild and domestic animals. Scientists have found <em>T.b. gambiense</em>, for instance, in dogs, pigs, goats and sheep. No one knows the role infected animals play in reigniting outbreaks in humans.</p>



<p>Though the road to elimination may still be rocky, the patients Kasita and others are treating in Masi-Manimba and beyond offer a lesson for those working on disease elimination: Don’t give up too soon. Maybe the world won’t reach zero sleeping sickness cases by 2030, Lejon says, “but I think we should really give it a try,” she says. “We have momentum at this moment to do it.”</p>



<p>Mutombo echoes her enthusiasm. In less than 20 years, new drugs have completely overhauled patient care, he says. “We’ve made a great change in less than one generation…. Now, we expect that elimination is within reach.”</p>
