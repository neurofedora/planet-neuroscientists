              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/unravelling-alzheimer-s-a-deeper-look-at-neuronal-loss">Unravelling Alzheimer's: A Deeper Look at Neuronal Loss</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Scientists discover a way to prevent cell death, but how will this affect treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s disease? </em></p>

<p>A recent study published in Nature aimed to unravel the relationship between Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and neuronal loss. The study highlighted the primary driver behind neuronal death in Alzheimer's: necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This process occurs during the development of AD when neurons are exposed to amyloid plaques and tau tangles - two hallmark features implicated in AD. </p>

<p>This newfound research not only provides insight into the intricacies of Alzheimer's but also hints that there may be potential to target specific pathways and genes in new therapeutic approaches. </p>

<p><strong>A new model: From mice to humans</strong></p>

<p>While prior studies hinted at the mechanisms of cell death in AD, this study underscores the limitations of past models as the pathology was trigged though external interventions and therefore, unable to demonstrate the natural pathology in humans. Building on an established xenotransplantation model, the researchers proposed a new model: transplanting human neurons into a mouse brain engineered to develop amyloid plaques, allowing for greater exploration of AD pathology over time. </p>

<p>Remarkably, the model revealed that amyloid plaques alone were insufficient to induce Alzheimer's-like pathology in mouse neurons. This emphasised a human-specific vulnerability, as transplanted human neurons exhibited AD features in the presence of amyloid pathology, where the control mice did not. This suggests a distinctive susceptibility of human neurons to changes associated with AD.</p>

<p><strong>Decoding gene expression: What is MEG3?</strong></p>

<p>Through gene expression analysis, the researchers identified that the long non-coding RNA, MEG3, was strongly expressed in human neurons in response to amyloid plaques. The upregulation of MEG3 was a key finding, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathological processes associated with AD.</p>

<p><strong>Potential avenues for treatment</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the study highlights the road for several exciting potential treatments:</p><ul>
  <li>Reducing the levels of MEG3 led to the prevention of cell death, suggesting the potential to target MEG3 expression. </li>
  <li>Necroptosis is an active area of drug development in other conditions like cancer and ALS, so may hold potential for repurposing or developing new inhibitors specific to AD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></p>

<p>While the discovery of MEG3 and its role in necroptosis provides a promising direction for AD research, the journey from discovery to effective human treatments is complex and involves rigorous testing and validation. Realistic hope exists, but successful translation will require continued research, collaboration, and careful clinical development. Additionally, advancements in our understanding of AD and the development of targeted therapies will likely be incremental, involving a combination of approaches to address the multifaceted nature of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>No planet for Barnard’s star?</strong> —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/no-planet-barnards-star"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;December 1, 1973</p>



<p>Over the years evidence has been brought forward for planetary companions revolving around two or three stars other than the sun. The first of these was Barnard’s star, which had been studied by Peter van de Kamp…. The presence of a planet could cause a wobble in a star’s motion across the sky. Van de Kamp found a wobble.… [Further] scrutiny does not find the [wobble].… Thus there would be no planet.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Astronomers now know of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">thousands of exoplanets in the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 5</em>). But Barnard’s star is still without a confirmed exoplanet despite careful scrutiny. <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1837/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2018 claim</a> of an exoplanet about three times as massive as Earth <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac0057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been questioned</a>. In July, a survey of 200&nbsp;low-mass red dwarfs, including Barnard’s star, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-planets-rare-red-dwarf-stars">found no Jupiter-sized exoplanets</a> (<em>SN: 7/15/23 &amp; 7/29/23, p. 9</em>). Such stars may have enough debris around them to form only small exoplanets.</p>

<p>Wiley will cease using the beleaguered Hindawi brand name, the publisher announced on an <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/812717746/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q224-Earnings-Presentation-Final.pdf">earnings call</a> Wednesday morning. Wiley plans to integrate Hindawi’s approximately 200 journals into the rest of its portfolio by the middle of next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Problems with Hindawi, the open access publisher that Wiley acquired in 2021, have cost the company $18 million in revenue in its latest financial quarter compared to the same quarter of last year, Wiley <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/812717746/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q224-Earnings-Release-Final-combined.pdf">also disclosed</a>. Hindawi’s journals have been overrun by paper mills and published “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">meaningless gobbledegook</a>,” in the words of one sleuth, leading to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">thousands of retractions</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">journal closures</a> and a major index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisting several titles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the current fiscal year, Wiley expects $35-40 million in lost revenue from Hindawi as it works to turn around journals with issues and retract articles, Matthew Kissner, Wiley’s interim president and CEO, said on the earnings call. The company expects revenue to begin to recover in its next fiscal year, he said. </p>



<span id="more-128378"></span>



<p>“To that end, we feel that now is the time to sunset the Hindawi brand and begin to fully integrate its 200 journals into Wiley’s 2,000 journal portfolio,” Kissner said on the call. “This reflects the now close alignment of the practices and infrastructure behind the two portfolios, and it enables a much wider audience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Liz Ferguson, senior vice president, Wiley Research Publishing, said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that the continued integration of the Hindawi journals into Wiley’s portfolio benefits authors, editors, and the communities we serve by providing a more consistent user experience, delivering more sophisticated technology, and expanding open access publishing routes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers who submit their work to Hindawi journals “will not notice a change for some months,” Ferguson said, as the company works to migrate Hindawi titles to Wiley Online Library.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is also implementing a new submission and peer review system for both Wiley and Hindawi journals. “Ensuring a consistent author experience is one of the drivers for this change,” Ferguson said. “As we integrate the two portfolios, we are taking care to ensure that the characteristics and benefits of Hindawi journals to authors remain.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are no plans to change the fees authors pay for publishing in Hindawi journals, Ferguson said. “Publishing policy or editorial changes will be driven by the needs of our portfolios, as usual.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the publisher has “considerably revised our approach to special issues in Hindawi journals and have been operating tightened processes” since it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">temporarily suspended publishing special issues</a> for three months about a year ago, Ferguson said. The suspension – due to “compromised articles” – initially cost Wiley $9 million in lost revenue for the quarter in which it took place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The $18 million revenue hit Wiley reported for the second quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, August through October, “is a consequence of the volume decline we experienced as a result of the publishing pause and a reduction in submissions to journals that were delisted, coupled with decisions we took for the long-term health of the portfolio,” Ferguson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">removed 19 Hindawi journals</a> from its Web of Science index for failing to meet editorial quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">shut down four Hindawi journals</a> it had identified as “heavily compromised by paper mills.” No additional journal closures are planned, Ferguson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since September 2022, when Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">announced a batch of 500 retractions</a> for manipulated peer review, we’ve logged more than 3,400 retractions from Hindawi journals in our database. In April, an executive said the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">would retract 1,200 more</a> for the same reason. (We’re aware of over 7,100 in this year alone, but are behind in entering them as they alone are more retractions than we’ve ever seen in total for a year.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked Ferguson if more big batches of retractions are planned, she said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>We continue to issue retractions on an ongoing basis as part of our comprehensive effort to correct the scholarly record. We remain committed to continuing to clean the portfolio, and we anticipate further retractions following our new approach to retractions at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson declined to share specifics about the “new approach.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-heat-hottest-year-record-2023">Here’s how 2023 became the hottest year on record</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This year didn’t just shatter records. It changed the scales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graph after graph tracking this year’s soaring global temperatures reveal that not only were the numbers higher than ever recorded in many places around the world, but the deviation from the norm was also astonishingly large.</p>



<p>“The margins by which records are being broken this year have surprised not just me but [other climate scientists] that I trust, even my very unalarmist friends,” says Doug McNeall of the U.K. Met Office Hadley Centre in Exeter, England.</p>





<p>As of late November, months of sweltering global temperatures easily put 2023 on track to be Earth’s hottest year since record keeping began about 150 years ago. The 12-month period from November 2022 through October 2023 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">is officially the hottest such period on record</a> — a record that’s likely to be broken in 2024, according to the nonprofit group Climate Central (<em>SN: 11/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Extreme heat waves baked many regions, which in turn fueled catastrophic wildfires. Ocean heat was off the charts, with global average sea surface temperatures sustaining record highs for much of the year. And in the water surrounding Antarctica, sea ice reached new lows.</p>



<p>These records had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change all over them, according to the international scientific consortium World Weather Attribution. Climate change made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">July’s extreme heat waves</a> in North America, Southern Europe and North Africa hundreds of times as likely, and another in China about 50 times as likely (<em>SN: 7/25/23</em>). Climate change was also the primary cause behind <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/strong-influence-of-climate-change-in-uncharacteristic-early-spring-heat-in-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a brutal winter and early spring heat wave in South America</a>, making that event at least 100 times as likely.</p>



<p>On social media, many climate scientists who posted jaw-dropping screenshots of 2023’s temperature anomalies struggled to find words to explain them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Surprising. Astounding. Staggering. Unnerving. Bewildering. Flabbergasting. Disquieting. Gobsmacking. Shocking. Mind boggling,&#8221; Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading in England, <a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1709825752705753105?t=e98tYCGzgpLwV6JeNFRADw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter, about September&#8217;s air temperatures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Global temperatures smashed records</h4>



<p>From January through September, Earth’s average global surface air temperature was about <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/9/1850-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 degrees Celsius</a> (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the 20th century average of 14.1° C (57.5° F).&nbsp;</p>



<p>June, July, August, September and October were each the hottest ever recorded for those months — and <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/topping-charts-september-2023-was-earths-warmest-september-in-174-year-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September was hotter than an average July</a> from 2001 to 2010. The year isn’t out yet, but temperatures so far suggest 2023 has a <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/land_ocean/202309#ytd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater than 99 percent chance of being the hottest year on record</a>, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In the red</h3>



<p>The global average of daily air temperatures in 2023 (red) climbed to extraordinary heights during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months, soaring over global temperatures recorded each year since 1981 (gray). </p>

<p>The Southern Hemisphere had a particularly sweltering winter and early spring, with temperatures in August and September soaring above 40° C (104° F) across parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina. In some areas, daytime temperatures were about 20 degrees C (36 degrees F) above normal. Madagascar also had its warmest October on record, with some spots 2.5 degrees C (4.5 degrees F) above average.</p>



<p>The second half of 2023 saw the onset of an El Niño climate pattern, which generally means higher global temperatures, says John Kennedy, a climate scientist with the U.N. World Meteorological Organization. But most El Niño–related warming generally comes the year <em>after</em> an El Niño event, he says, as the heat that’s been accumulating in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean gets transported elsewhere. That’s what happened in 2016, previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">the hottest year on record</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>Ocean temperatures began reaching new highs long before El Niño kicked in. From late March through October, the world’s average sea surface temperature consistently broke daily records. By July, these temperatures were nearly 1 degree C (about 1.8 degrees F) above average, as marine heat waves racked nearly half of the global ocean, compared with a more typical 10 percent.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sweltering seas</h3>



<p>Beginning in late March, 2023’s average ocean surface temperatures (red) were higher for latitudes spanning 60° N to 60° S than in any year going back to at least 1981 (gray).</p>

<p>Such warm waters are unprecedented in the modern record — and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">possibly in the last 125,000 years</a>, researchers note (<em>SN: 8/9/23</em>). Ocean life suffered, as the relentless accumulation of all that heat took its toll. Coral reefs, for instance, suffered widespread bleaching across the Gulf of Mexico, the northern Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">High temps can lead to health problems</h4>



<p>Most of the unprecedented temperatures to hit the news were daytime maximums, but the record-breaking heat continued into the night, endangering human health.</p>



<p>On July 6, the city of Adrar, Algeria, faced the hottest night ever recorded in Africa — nighttime temperatures never dipped below 39.6° C (103.3° F). And just after midnight on July 17, a weather station in Death Valley, Calif., recorded a temperature of 48.9° C (about 120° F). If confirmed, that is the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere for that dark hour.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In most parts of the world, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nights have been warming</a> faster than days for decades. That’s a concern because, when nights are hot, the body <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-human-body-climate">loses a chance to recover from the heat of the day</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balmier bedtime temperatures also diminish the quantity and quality of sleep. Last year, data scientist Kelton Minor of Columbia University and colleagues published an analysis of billions of sleep-duration measurements from nearly 70 countries. The team estimated that, as of 2017, warmer nights contributed to eroding <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00209-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an average of about 44 hours of slumber from each person every year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extrapolating to this year’s extreme heat, Minor says, “you would expect that this summer, on a global scale, would have eroded probably the most [sleep] in the observational record.”</p>



<p>Extreme heat can also lead to heat stroke, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and death. And heat-related deaths have been on the rise for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many parts of the world — such as Africa, where a prolonged spring heat wave in Madagascar would have been virtually impossible without climate change, according to World Weather Attribution — the number of lives lost to extreme heat is unknown. But an analysis of Eurostat data estimated that in Europe last year there were more than 60,000 heat-related deaths, up from around 40,000 in 2018. Provisional data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 1,700 people in the United States died from heat in 2022</a>. That’s more than four times the number of U.S. lives lost to heat just eight years earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It appears 2023 may have continued the trend. By October, hundreds of heat-related deaths had been reported from multiple counties in the American Southwest, where people sweltered through some of the summer’s highest temperatures. A record-breaking 579<a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/1858/Heat-Surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> such deaths</a> have so far been reported out of Arizona’s Maricopa County — the fourth most populous county in the United States — up from 386 confirmed fatalities in 2022. Neighboring Pima County reported 175 heat-related deaths this year, up from 58 the previous year.</p>



<p>Part of the problem is that the danger of heat is often underestimated. There “is really low awareness that heat is a killer,” says Kristie Ebi, a climate and health researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>Moving forward, it will be crucial to spread greater awareness about the dangers and to invest in more interventions like cooling centers and urban green spaces. “Nobody needs to die and this is not like somebody being caught in a flash flood,” Ebi says. “There is enough known that it&#8217;s possible to protect people.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It was a bad year for wildfires</h4>



<p>Hotter nights may have also exacerbated wildfires. “In the past, you would get a drop in temperatures overnight, and that would help abate the wildfire spread,” says climate and atmospheric scientist Danielle Touma, of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics in Austin. “But more recently, especially during a heat wave, these temperatures have not been dropping as much as they used to,” she adds. “That means that the fire continues to spread overnight.”</p>



<p>This year, heat contributed to an especially bad fire season in the Boreal region, a colossal area that wraps around the Earth just south of the Arctic Circle and contains close to one-third of the world’s forests. The largest intact stretch of this forest lies in Canada, which had its worst fire year on record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hundreds of megafires burned across the country, and some 200,000 people were forced to evacuate in the face of approaching flames. Blazes in Quebec billowed smoke that engulfed<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate"> the U.S. East Coast and Midwest</a>, turning the skies orange and subjecting millions to hazardous air quality (<em>SN: 6/9/23</em>). As of October, the area burned in Canada surpassed 180,000 square kilometers, an area larger than Greece, more than doubling the previous national record from 1995.</p>

<p>Wildfires contribute to carbon emissions, which intensify global warming. The estimated carbon emissions from the Canadian fires amounted to nearly 410 million metric tons, shattering another record for the country. It’s also more than a quarter of the world’s wildfire emissions this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a whole, though, 2023’s wildfire emissions didn’t break global records. In fact, wildfire emissions have been decreasing for decades, largely because humans have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">cleared away many forested areas </a>for agriculture, ultimately decreasing the total area where wildfires could burn (<em>SN: 6/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, terrifying wildfires scorched many parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, summer heat contributed to a wildfire in Greece that became the largest ever recorded in the European Union. In Hawaii, a wildfire fueled in part by drought destroyed much of the town of Lahaina and left at least 99 dead, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire since 1918.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere’s warm winter helped fires spread in many regions including Argentina and the Amazon rainforest. In Australia, an unusual spring heatwave helped the fire season kick off early; by August, around 70 blazes had already been reported out of New South Wales, the country’s most populated state, two months before the official start of the bushfire season in that state.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Antarctic sea ice hit a record low extent</h4>



<p>Dwindling sea ice in the Arctic has become a familiar story in recent decades, while the southernmost continent’s sea ice has waxed and waned more erratically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in the last few years, satellite data have shown an uptick in the rate of Antarctic sea ice loss, says climate scientist Mark Serreze, director of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then came 2023. Antarctica’s sea ice “just plummeted,” Serreze says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sea ice expanse <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-2023">was at near record-low levels for much of the year</a> (<em>SN: 7/5/23</em>). February, the peak of summer, saw a record low minimum extent. By late July, the height of winter, <a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sea ice was more than 2.6 million square kilometers below the 1981–2010 average</a>. On September 10, the sea ice extent hit its annual maximum at about 17 million square kilometers. That’s roughly 1 million square kilometers smaller than the previous lowest maximum in 1986.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These numbers were “far outside anything observed in the 45-year modern satellite record,” Serreze says.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shrinking sea ice</h3>



<p>The expanse of sea ice surrounding Antarctica has remained at record low levels for nearly all of 2023 (red), reaching its lowest point in February, the height of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. In September, when Antarctic sea ice typically reaches its largest extent, the sea ice was far below the 1981–2022 median (black).&nbsp;</p>

<p>El Niño and other regional climate patterns probably played a role. Shifting ocean circulation or wind directions could have either packed the ice in or shuttled it farther out to sea. But growing evidence suggests that warmer ocean waters may also be complicit, Serreze says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the case, this year’s trail of shattered records has made it clearer than ever that human-caused climate change is not a problem for tomorrow. “We’re standing in the aftermath of one of the biggest waves in the climate system in recent history,” Minor says, “and we need to also prepare for bigger waves that are approaching.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/landscape-explorer-interactive-map-american-west">Landscape Explorer shows how much the American West has changed</a></h4>

              
                <p>With the click of a mouse, a new mapping tool shows how places in the American West have changed over the last 70 years.</p>



<p>With just a Web browser, anyone can open <a href="https://www.landscapeexplorer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landscape Explorer</a>, which will pull up a modern Google map of the United States beside a black-and-white aerial image of the western states circa 1950. A slider button allows for scrolling back and forth between past and present.</p>



<p>You can type a place or address into the search bar, then zoom in or out. Search for “Lake Powell” and watch the Colorado River’s red rock canyons of the past turn into a reservoir. Type in “Las Vegas” and see Sin City’s sprawling grid of streets disappear into desert arroyos as you swipe back in time.</p>





<p>The free tool is an easy way for anyone with an interest in the American West to peruse the past. But Landscape Explorer also has a loftier purpose: helping government agencies, landowners and conservation professionals make complex decisions about how to manage land.</p>



<p>The powerful visual contrast between the historical snapshot and modern-day satellite imagery “allows us to go from zero to 100” in terms of understanding ecosystem changes, says Scott Morford, an applied spatial ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula who led the development of Landscape Explorer. The project was supported by Working Lands for Wildlife, a conservation initiative led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other partners. The impetus, Morford says, was to “give us a reference for how rapidly things are changing across biomes that we care about.”</p>



<p>Before Landscape Explorer, most collections of historical imagery of large-scale landscapes went back to only the 1980s. Finding earlier imagery of large landscapes was expensive and time-consuming. While some previous projects have stitched together historical imagery at small scales to look at how a particular watershed or county has changed, “the real revolution is that we were able to figure out how to do it at scale,” Morford says. “We wanted to make something that was universal and accessible” for everyone, not just remote sensing specialists.</p>



<p>Morford and colleagues processed about 170,000 aerial images that were taken by U.S. Army pilots during the Cold War and later digitized. <a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rse2.357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To create a continuous mosaic</a>, the team used specialized software to stitch together images of adjacent patches of land, the researchers explained in a paper published in July in <em>Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</em>. The final step was pairing the mosaic with satellite imagery using Google Earth Engine.</p>



<p>Landscape Explorer began as a small project to assess the extent of woody encroachment onto grasslands in western Montana. Due to fire suppression, conifers like western juniper or eastern red cedar are taking over ecosystems that were historically treeless, such as sagebrush steppe and prairies. A monoculture of these water-guzzling trees is bad news for local biodiversity and increases the risk of catastrophic wildfire.</p>



<p>Third-generation Montana rancher Bruce Peterson says that seeing historical and current aerial imagery side by side made him realize how the steady infiltration of trees had devalued his family’s livestock pastures. “It’s a little bit like losing your hearing or your vision with these trees. They eat away a little of your land at a time, and then by the time you get hearing aids or glasses, you realize it’s gotten really out of hand,” Peterson says.</p>



<p>Using Landscape Explorer, Peterson and dozens of other landowners involved in the Southwest Montana Sagebrush Partnership have prioritized where to remove invading trees. The group has restored nearly 50,000 acres of treeless rangeland since 2020, according to the Nature Conservancy, a member of the partnership.</p>



<p>Landscape Explorer also helped the Clark Fork Coalition, a Montana-based nonprofit that protects and restores waterways, to see how urban and industrial development has impacted floodplains. “This tool gives us the power of time travel. It’s like a time-lapse showing all that’s been lost and where the continued pressure is very real,” says Karen Knudsen, the coalition’s executive director.</p>



<p>After seeing the successes in Montana, the makers of Landscape Explorer extended the tool to 17 states in the West to show where forests, grasslands or rivers are most at risk of disappearing and where intact habitats can still be preserved.</p>



<p>Since the expanded tool was released in September, researchers have used it to assess glacial retreat in the Pacific Northwest, measure the historical extent of sand dunes in coastal California and pinpoint where wetlands have dried up. Morford is excited to see all the ways Landscape Explorer can help land managers. “It’s going to be used in ways we haven’t even thought of yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-how-s-what-s-and-why-s-of-becoming-a-postgraduate-student">The 'how's, 'what's and 'why's of becoming a postgraduate student</a></h4>

              
                <h5><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. Here, Ailie McWhinnie questions <em>why </em>you want to study, <em>what</em> is the right programme for you, and <em>how</em> to bring it all together into a successful application.</strong></h5>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2b3eb4308c544db3bdf6b3c0d210634c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Windows via Unsplash" ></figure><h5>Why are you applying?</h5><p>Making applications is hard. Doing a postgraduate course is hard. Before rushing to apply, you need to know <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>An undergraduate degree can be somewhat of a default path to trudge forwards onto from school, and that is perfectly fine. It is great for your personal and social development and the education is still relatively broad, giving you a rounded preparation for wherever life takes you. A postgraduate degree is much more focused, preparing you for a specific future and so you should only pursue one if it fits your future goals.</p>

<p>This does not necessarily mean academia - there are plenty of good reasons to pursue a Master’s or PhD besides becoming a professor. A Master’s can divert you from one field to another or tip you into a specific niche if you have had a broad undergraduate – it lets you explore your interests and gives you a more focused, technical preparation for a given field. A PhD is for those who already have a clear research interest and enough passion to commit themselves to it for the next few years. It gives you a competitive edge for many jobs and may even be a requirement for some, but you must be motivated for the PhD itself as well as for what comes after. Whatever the reason is, make sure you are confident in it and are aware of the alternatives. </p> <h5>Which programme style suits you best?</h5><p>Following on from this, you need to choose the appropriate type of programme for your goals or experience. Inconsistent branding across countries and institutions overcomplicates a system that can be distilled down to research vs taught Master’s and doctoral training programmes vs traditional project PhDs.</p>
<p><p><strong>Master’s</strong></p>
<p>Looking to deepen your knowledge, move fields or narrow down your interests? A taught Master’s is for you. Akin to the final year of an undergraduate, these courses will give you a strong theoretical background in a topic with structured classes, coursework and a part-time research project/thesis. This is useful for, for example, transitioning into neuroscience from chemistry or a broad biology undergraduate.</p>

<p>If you are already set on pursuing a PhD and are looking to boost your CV ahead of the application, consider a research Master’s. This will see you work full time on a research project, giving you much more independence and project management experience, closer to the reality of life as a researcher. This is useful if you already have clear research interests and are looking to build practical research skills.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p>In the UK, there is an increasing prevalence of doctoral training programmes. These aim to bring more structure and standardisation to the PhD process. Many take a 1+3 format, in which the first year is spent rotating around labs, and throughout the programme you will follow structured training alongside your research with a small cohort. Such programmes are ideal for those who are not exactly sure what research niche they would like to occupy yet, or for those without a Master’s degree, because they let you explore different techniques, topics and lab cultures before settling down for the thesis project itself.</p>

<p>A more traditional project PhD will see you join a lab right from the get-go, so requires you to apply with a project proposal. You need to be sure of your interests and find the lab which aligns best with them before getting started - this includes making sure the supervisor and lab culture are the right fit for your working style. This format doesn’t mean you cannot access any training outside the lab, but unlike the structure of a doctoral training programme, it will be up to you to organise yourself (don’t worry - departments will make it easy for you to browse and access these opportunities and if a certain amount of training credits are required, it will all be made clear). This pathway is ideal for those with strong research interests and reasonable experience, for whom a whole year of structured training would be overkill.</p>

<p>Course structures can vary from country to country so do take this into account when considering where to apply. For instance, a PhD in the US will typically take several years longer than in Europe. Most EU programmes will strictly require a Master’s degree, whereas UK recruiters will want to see research experience but not necessarily a Master’s. Many people move abroad for postgraduate studies for these reasons and more – certain institutions or countries have different research focuses, for example. Postgraduate study is a fantastic opportunity to travel and experience other cultures, but it of course makes life more complicated too.</p></p> <h5>How do you prepare for the application?</h5><p>The pre-application process can be just as important as the application itself. This is where <em>you </em>do the assessing (to select a project and your supervisor) and gather all the information you can to prepare for your application. You should shortlist your programmes of interest so that you can invest properly in each application. Unlike applying for undergraduate degrees, each application may have a unique structure and should be specially tailored. Generic applications will be discarded, so focus your efforts!</p> 
 <p>With labs and programmes narrowed down, bear in mind that the supervisor and lab members are a mine of insider knowledge - use this if you can. The input they are willing to give will vary from supervisor to supervisor. Some may give you feedback on your application or project proposal whereas others may expect you to do everything independently after your initial meeting. Most should at least be willing to explain the application and funding options to you, even if this is by email (if they are not happy to direct you to this basic information, it may be a red flag about them as a supervisor). In many cases, there will be multiple ways to join their lab as a PhD student (e.g. via a DTP, via departmental funding or via university scholarship) which could all require separate applications, so it is important to make sure you research this thoroughly and have all avenues covered. If you meet with existing lab members, feel free to ask for their personal tips on applying – after all, they were successful going through the same process.</p>
<h5>What makes a successful application?</h5><p>You will be ranked based on your academic record, your references, and against a whole grid of criteria including relevant research experience, independent working, technical knowledge, motivation, troubleshooting, management, organisation and learning potential. Everyone knows that this is what recruiters are looking for and so everyone puts these trigger words into their applications. The battle is over proving it. </p>

<p>For every skill or experience you claim, give hard evidence. Proactive researcher? Explain which aspects of past research projects were driven by you. Motivation? Demonstrate how you have actively sought opportunities outside the default educational experience to pursue these interests already. Remember that examples do not necessarily have to be purely academic – you can prove that you have a good capacity to understand new topics through experience editing articles for your university’s science magazine or your proactivity through a campaign you set up yourself. Mention the skill, tell the relevant story and explain what aspect of postgraduate life that experience has prepared you for. – it is about explaining it right. </p>

<p>Also remember that this should not just be a repetition of your CV – the recruiters will have that already. Select key experiences to expand on to prove your skills and prove why you would be a good candidate.</p>

<p>Equally, any research experience you mention should not read as a methods section. There is no need to explain technical details. Mention the project question and techniques then focus on wider skills you exhibited through that project. How independent were you, what problems did you overcome, what did you learn about the research process? </p>
<p>Don’t forget that as a postgraduate student you are joining the science community, you are not just there to work on an isolated project alone for four years. Research life is not just about lab work – teaching, leadership and  communication are all crucial. Dig around the lab, department and programme websites to see what they value, and demonstrate how you fit with that culture. This should come naturally as hopefully, by this point, you have already narrowed down your top programmes based on not just the project, but the wider context of the supervisor and the life you would have in that lab, department and city. If you feel yourself having to force the motivation and fit, it's probably not the right programme for you.</p>
<hr><ol>
  <li><strong>Choose the right style of course for your experience and goals</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Use the insider knowledge of the supervisor and lab members</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your statement should expand on your CV, not repeat it</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Don’t claim to have certain skills, share moments in which you have used them</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Explain why you are the right fit and wider contributions you can make, not just your technical skills</strong></li>
</ol><hr><p>A successful application depends on the <em>why</em>. A postgraduate course should serve a specific purpose for your future or be driven by a deep and genuine interest in the subject, and recruiters will expect you to be able to explain this as well as your competency.</p>

<p><em>Why </em>study further, <em>why </em>that type of programme and <em>why </em>that particular project. If you can answer these questions, the application should come somewhat naturally. This means you need to explain your goals and how this course will prepare you for them; how you have pursued this interest already; and why the project and wider lab environment is the right fit with your experience and working style.</p>

<p>Then, choose key moments in your past experience - both in research and in your wider life - during which you have used those all-important  transferable skills like resiliency, problem solving and management and be ready to storytell rather than list. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Several sports physicians at Harvard have earned two retractions and await another after publishing work based on “unreliable” survey data that was misrepresented in the papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles, &#8220;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmrj.12649">Running-related injuries in middle school cross-country runners: Prevalence and characteristics of common injuries</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmrj.12673">Prevalence and factors associated with bone stress injury in middle school runners</a>,&#8221; were published in the journal of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, <em>PM&amp;R</em>, in 2021. The papers have been cited a total of 17 times since publication, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmrj.13097">Identical retraction notices</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmrj.13096">issued in November</a> this year state the decision followed “a joint review by the authors&#8217; institutions which identified the dataset of this article to be unreliable and not accurately represented in the paper.” The institutions did not find the authors to be responsible for the problematic data, but recommended the papers be retracted, according to the notices. Several of the authors are affiliated with Harvard Medical School, which did not respond to a request for comment. </p>



<span id="more-128370"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Adam Tenforde, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, a part of Mass General Brigham, wrote that the authors supported the decision to retract “as our goal is to advance science with accurate data.”</p>



<p>Tenforde, who serves as senior editor for <em>PM&amp;R, </em>added the group is anticipating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221226722101039X">a third retraction from the <em>Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</em></a> and is preparing an editorial to accompany the retraction.</p>



<p>All three papers rely on online surveys sent to a database of 900 coaches, runners, and parents of middle school runners in Massachusetts and surrounding states. None list a funding source. The two retracted papers indicate the original research was conducted at Spaulding.</p>



<p>In response to a request for details on the retraction, a media relations officer at the hospital wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are committed to preserving the highest standards of biomedical research and fostering scientific innovation. Any questions, concerns or allegations regarding research conducted at Spaulding are confidentially assessed per hospital policy and federal regulations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PM&amp;R </em>journal editor Janna Friedly wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any specific questions about the data or how they discovered that the data was erroneous would best be answered by the authors and/or the institution. </p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>JAND</em> journal editor Linda Snetselaar and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation have not responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p>In school, students often learn that the point of math is to solve equations and compute right-or-wrong answers to questions. But exploration is also fundamental to the field. By considering a series of seemingly simple questions, like why 1 + 1 = 2, a mathematician delves into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/real-math-book-cheng-answers">the logical foundations of Western mathematics</a> to reveal the discipline’s true nature (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 32</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/telescope-dark-matter-data-rescue-balloon">A telescope dropped dark matter data from the edge of space. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>Doomsday came on May 25 for the payload of a pumpkin-shaped balloon at the edge of space.</p>



<p>The floating gourd — inflated with more than 500,000 cubic meters of helium and large enough to fit 60 Goodyear blimps inside it — traversed the southern hemisphere some five times in 40 days, toting a telescope that could see the unseeable. NASA’s Super Pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope, or SuperBIT, was on a mission to probe the cosmos for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-map-galaxies-early-universe">dark matter</a>, the invisible substance thought to scaffold the universe and bind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-cluster-milky-way-old-universe">galaxy clusters</a> together (<em>SN: 8/8/22, SN: 6/23/23</em>). By observing how cosmic structures with strong gravity deflect nearby light, SuperBIT could infer dark matter&#8217;s presence.</p>





<p>But things had not gone as planned. Early in the mission, satellite communications failed and the telescope’s operators could not retrieve data wirelessly. As SuperBIT made a sixth pass over South America, projections showed the solar-powered telescope heading toward gloomy weather and away from another stretch of land to safely alight upon. </p>



<p>Operators decided to terminate the flight early and anticipated a rough landing, so astrophysicist Ellen Sirks and colleagues instructed the aloft apparatus to send its data to Earth via capsules. The team simulated weather conditions to predict where the escape pods would land.</p>



<p>“We sort of envisioned these [drop capsules] as a redundant way of backing up the data,” says Sirks, of the University of Sydney in Australia. But they became important, she says, “because all the worst-case scenarios came true.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="509" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C509&#038;ssl=1" alt="Researchers pack a drop capsule for a NASA balloon telescope" class="wp-image-3133649" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=512%2C383&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=601%2C450&amp;ssl=1 601w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=248%2C186&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=263%2C197&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/112923_no_dark-matter-data_AjayEllen_inline.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133649">Astrophysicists Ajay Gill and Ellen Sirks (right) pack a drop capsule for the SuperBIT mission.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133649">Steven Benton</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>By the end of the day, SuperBIT had been destroyed; the telescope’s parachute failed to detach upon landing and dragged the craft to pieces. But at 12:31 p.m. UTC, two small packages containing precious dark matter data separated from SuperBIT. Each 1.28-kilogram capsule contained a battery-powered circuit board that stored the data, encased in a foam-wrapped plastic shell sealed in a waterproof chicken roasting bag. They were also equipped with parachutes — bright orange to aid recovery. The team described the new <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/aerospace10110960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop capsule system</a> November 15 in <em>Aerospace</em>.</p>



<p>While descending into a rural area in Argentina, the capsules drifted horizontally about 60 kilometers. A search-and-rescue team, following transmissions from the capsules, found the first one 3.8 km from its predicted landing site. The second capsule was found nearly 2 km away and a few meters from its signaled location.</p>



<p>A cougar may have moved the capsule, as a set of tracks was found nearby. Thankfully, the cat was nowhere to be found and had left the capsule unscathed. “We surmise that foam and parachute nylon are intriguing but not tasty,” Sirks and colleagues wrote in the study.</p>



<p>Researchers recovered data from both capsules and, eventually, the telescope’s remains. Sirks and colleagues are still analyzing those data, which she hopes will help map the distribution of dark matter in the universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crash-landing underscores the need for contingency plans, Sirks says, especially since NASA plans to execute many more balloon-borne missions. Her team is working on insulating the batteries in the capsules, which could enable them to transmit their locations as they descend through the cold atmosphere. Eventually, the researchers plan to make the capsule system available for future balloon missions. “It&#8217;s a fairly easy, lightweight solution,” Sirks says. “So why not?”</p>

A lot of focus is placed on the manager’s role in orchestrating 1:1s, where they are responsible for addressing direct reports’ practical and personal needs. However, it is also important to recognize that direct reports have agency in 1:1s and should play an active, not passive, role in the effectiveness of these meetings. When direct reports feel empowered to seek help, there are benefits to both the individual and organization.</p><p>As an employee, you need to take an active role in your 1:1s to get the most out of them. These 10 key behaviors are critical in making sure you are receiving the help that you need to grow in your career:</p><ol><li><strong>Know what you need: </strong>be ready to discuss your own needs, hopes, and goals, not just what you think you should say to your manager.</li><li><strong>Be curious: </strong>do not just have a curious mindset, but also engage in curious behaviors such as asking questions, listening, and challenging yourself to discover new things.</li><li><strong>Build rapport: </strong>get to know your manager on a personal and professional level by learning about their interests.</li><li><strong>Actively engage: </strong>get the most out of your meeting by doing things like asking questions, expressing yourself, taking notes, and paying attention to non-verbal communication like maintaining good eye contact.</li><li><strong>Communicate well: </strong>strive to be clear, concise, focused, honest and pay attention to voice infliction and tone. For difficult conversations, consider practicing before bringing them to your manager.</li><li><strong>Problem solve:</strong> come to your 1:1 not only with your problems but also possible solutions. Be ready to constructively discuss counterarguments and differing viewpoints.</li><li><strong>Ask for help (constructively):</strong> seek assistance from your manager that encourages independent problem solving. This includes asking to recommendations or help of others when your manager cannot assist you.</li><li><strong>Ask for feedback:</strong> ask specific questions that focus on receiving suggestion on future behaviors such as “I want to improve at X, do you have any suggestions on how to get better at this?”</li><li><strong>Receive feedback well:</strong> show that you are appreciative of the feedback by thanking your manager and asking further questions about issues that were raised.</li><li><strong>Express gratitude:</strong> let your manager know you are grateful for their time and feedback.</li></ol><p>Finally, as you proceed with these behaviors, it is important to keep in mind the science around asking for help. Namely, help-seeking behaviors have been categorized by social psychologists into two main types: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-1843-7_17">autonomous help-seeking and dependent help-seeking</a>.</p><p>Autonomous help-seeking can be understood as seeking information that enables individuals to be independent, accomplish tasks, and solve problems on their own. This tends to promote long-term independence—similar to the adage, “Give a person a fish and they’ll eat for a day but teach them to fish and they’ll eat for a lifetime.”</p><p>Dependent help-seeking, on the other hand, refers to searching for a “quick fix” and an “answer” from someone else. This style of help-seeking conserves time and effort and leads to immediate gratification, but typically doesn’t yield long-term self-sufficiency.&nbsp;Interestingly, job performance ratings have been shown to have a positive relationship with autonomous help-seeking, but a negative relationship with its counterpart—dependent help-seeking.</p><p>Bottom line: do your part in the 1:1 to maximize its value to you and approach it as an opportunity to learn to be the best you can seeking meaningful insights that enable you to thrive and grow both short-term and long-term. </p><p><em><sub>Featured image via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/two-women-taking-to-each-other-while-holding-pens-4PU-OC8sW98?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> (public domain)</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/844176716/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/844176716/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f11%2fchristina-wocintechchat-com-4PU-OC8sW98-unsplash-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/844176716/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/11/five-unexpected-things-about-medical-debt/">Five unexpected things about medical debt</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/11/seven-predictions-for-the-biggest-management-trends-in-the-next-few-years/">Seven predictions for the biggest management trends in the next few years</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/11/a-spotlight-on-native-american-language-and-religion-podcast/">A spotlight on Native American language and religion [podcast]</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-brain-stimulation-patients-traumatic-brain-injury">Electrical brain implants may help patients with severe brain injuries</a></h4>

              
                <p>For people with traumatic brain injuries, cognitive functions like memory, attention and mood regulation can become exceedingly difficult.&nbsp;But “there is no therapy for this kind of problem, even though it&#8217;s so prevalent,” says Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.</p>



<p>Now, in a small study of individuals who have suffered moderate to severe brain injury, five patients <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02638-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored better on a test of attention</a> and information processing after having electrodes surgically implanted into the thalamus, an early stop for information coming in through the senses, Schiff and colleagues report December 4 in<em> Nature Medicine</em>. The study participants and their families also reported improvements in their symptoms and daily lives after deep brain stimulation.</p>





<p>The results suggest that direct stimulation of the thalamus could be used to treat cognitive impairment caused by traumatic brain injuries. More than 5 million people in the United States alone live with the effects of moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries, often caused by common events like falls and car crashes.</p>



<p>In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are implanted into the brain and — powered by a pacemaker — used to electrically stimulate targeted brain regions. The technique has long been used successfully to treat other conditions, for instance to quiet the tremors caused by Parkinson’s disease or the seizures of epilepsy. More recently, scientists are studying its ability to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">deep depression</a> (<em>SN: 9/21/23</em>).</p>



<p>To see if the same approach could restore cognitive function in individuals with traumatic brain injuries, Schiff and colleagues recruited six patients to undergo surgery and have the electrical devices implanted. The time since the patients were injured ranged from three to 18 years ago.</p>



<p>The researchers decided to target the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, a brain region responsible for relaying information to the brain’s prefrontal and frontal cortexes, which handle executive function. After a severe brain injury, “you have the situation that lots of cells have been disconnected, [and] many cells have died,” Schiff says. Electrically stimulating the relay center of the thalamus, he says, might restore those lost connections.</p>



<p>After identifying the target areas in each person’s brain and implanting the electrodes, the researchers programmed the devices for a 12-hour on/off cycle and optimized them for each patient over a two-week period. One patient developed a scalp infection and had the device removed. The remaining five were put to the test.</p>



<p>The patients were each given a sheet of paper with 25 circles, each containing a number from 1 to 13 or a letter from A to L. The task, called the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/trail-making-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trail Making Test</a>, is to draw a line connecting the dots in ascending order while alternating between numbers and letters: 1-A-2-B-3-C and so on.</p>



<p>After receiving stimulation for at least three months, patients decreased the time it took them to connect the circles by about a third on average. One patient, for example, took about 171 seconds to complete the test before treatment, but only about 89 seconds with electrical stimulation. Though the researchers suspected they would see improvement, “our whole group was super gratified and surprised by the effect size,” Schiff says.</p>



<p>In a separate paper published October 18 in <em>Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics</em>, the researchers <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/abs/subject-and-family-perspectives-from-the-central-thalamic-deep-brain-stimulation-trial-for-traumatic-brain-injury-part-ii/BDAE709CB2FD86B4C1F5DBDEE4361D36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the participants’ and their families’ thoughts</a> on the treatment. Patients were better able to do everyday things — such as reading, playing video games and watching television — that their injuries had made difficult or impossible. One patient said the treatment made him “more as I was before the accident.” The mother of another told the researchers: “I got my daughter back, I got my daughter back. It’s a miracle.”</p>



<p>Work like this can help patients while also addressing “really fundamental questions about the basic science of human brain function,” says Winston Chiong, a neurologist and ethicist at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved with the study. Enough is known about potential risks to make treatments reasonable for patients, he says, but there are still many unknowns about the brain.</p>



<p>With deep brain stimulation now shown to be safe and preliminarily effective for treating traumatic brain injuries, Schiff plans to conduct another trial with more patients and for a longer duration. “It&#8217;ll be five to 10 times as many patients,” he says, to collect information for an even larger third trial “to try to turn it into therapy.”<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Eight years ago, since the Omniglot data was first released, very few papers have
addressed the original Omniglot challenge, which is to carry out within-alphabet one-shot
classification tasks as opposed to selecting the test samples between the al- phabets.
Most researchers have made the task easier by introducing new splits in the dataset and
have taken advantage of significant sample and class augmentation. Amongst the deep
learning models that have adopted the Omniglot challenge as it is, the Recursive Cortical
network has the highest performance of 92.75%. In this presentation , I will talk about a
new similarity function to aid in the training procedure of matching network, which helps
achieve 95.75% classification accuracy on the Omniglot challenge without requiring any
data augmentation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-maya-politics-power-neighborhoods-lidar">Ancient Maya power brokers lived in neighborhoods, not just palaces</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Pots with fancifully molded eyes, noses and mouths were one of the tip-offs.</p>



<p>Adrian Chase already had a growing sense that Maya society wasn’t quite what it’s been traditionally portrayed as: powerful rulers reigning while powerless commoners obeyed — or perhaps lived far enough from seats of power to operate largely on their own. Work by Chase and others had started to create a picture of a more politically complex society.</p>



<p>An archaeologist at the University of Chicago, Chase leads excavations of residential sites in and near the ancient Maya city center of Caracol in what’s now Belize. This city once sprawled across valleys, hillsides and hilltops. At its height, Caracol stretched 240 square kilometers, about the size of Milwaukee, before it was abandoned and swallowed by the forest.</p>





<p>Accumulating archaeological evidence had convinced Chase that shared social practices, such as placing pottery and other ritual items in special shrines, bonded groups of farm families into dozens of distinct neighborhoods within Caracol’s urban sprawl.</p>



<p>Consider those face-decorated pots. Varying shapes and spacings of molded eyes and other facial features added up to signature ceramic looks at different neighborhood-linked shrines. And those pots were just one element of a range of shrine offerings — including three-legged plates, curved jars with thin necks, and small medicine bottles and paint pots — that neighborhoods appeared to combine in distinctive ways.</p>



<p>And then there were the teeth. Individuals buried at some neighborhood shrines had either carved jade nuggets implanted in their teeth or their teeth filed in one of two styles. No such dental decorations appeared among the dead interred at other shrines. Various tooth alterations further defined neighborhood- specific shrine practices.</p>



<p>Pottery styles and tooth alterations together formed patterns specific to neighborhoods, Chase says. “There is a community aspect to these finds that reflects tight-knit neighborhoods.”</p>



<p>Caracol citizens, including those who lived well beyond downtown temples and pyramids, were not simple farmers growing crops in the service of a king, Chase suspects. Groups of as many as several hundred people had formed farming neighborhoods that built local ritual structures and followed distinctive ceremonial practices, apparently through their own collective efforts.</p>



<p>Neighborhoods, in turn, belonged to administrative districts with ties to royalty and other downtown political big shots. Stone compounds scattered throughout the city — each with their own ceremonial centers and plazas that probably hosted marketplaces and ritual events attended by crowds from nearby neighborhoods — represented districts’ bureaucratic service centers.</p>



<p>Neighborhoods and districts formed rungs of a political system in which central rulers sometimes gained power and laid down the law. At other times, royal dynasties crumbled and lower rungs in the political hierarchy assumed primary control.</p>

<p>Chase’s findings at Caracol have contributed to a shift in thinking about ancient Maya societies that has intensified over the last decade.</p>



<p>These societies, which originated as early as around 3,000 years ago, came to be known for giant stone pyramids, vast plazas and elite ballcourts discovered at jungle sites across Mesoamerica, a cultural region that extended from central Mexico to much of Central America before Spanish contact in the 1500s. These edifices had long suggested to researchers that Maya rulers wielded absolute power. So did hieroglyphics carved on stone slabs, which described kings’ exploits.</p>





<p>But expanded archaeological research, ongoing translations of Maya writings and the rise of airborne laser technology that sees through jungles are revealing a vast urban sprawl around major Maya ceremonial sites. Similarly extensive, low-density settlements have recently been discovered in other tropical areas around the world previously known only for giant ritual structures, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-unveil-secrets-and-mysteries-angkor-wat">Cambodia’s Angkor Wat temple</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/16, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Among the Maya, shifting circumstances would have tilted the balance of power. For instance, rural population booms might strengthen the hand of neighborhood-level elites. Military defeats of a royal dynasty could shift power to midlevel, district officials.</p>



<p>“A lot of Mesoamerican settlements probably had nested units of power,” Chase says. “There was no simple division between Maya elites and commoners.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Vaulted stone structures give insight into Maya political structures</h4>



<p>Laura Gilabert-Sansalvador did not have Mesoamerican politics on her mind in 2013 when she began studying stone palaces at La Blanca, an ancient Maya site in Guatemala. But her project ended up providing insights into not just physical structures, but also power structures.</p>



<p>Working toward a doctorate in architecture, Gilabert-Sansalvador wanted to decipher ancient techniques for erecting roofs on structures ranging from huts to temples.</p>



<p>Large rooms inside La Blanca palaces featured vaulted roofs, a tricky technical feat that Maya stonemasons worked to improve for more than 1,000 years. Inspired by La Blanca’s artfully angled room toppers, Gilabert-Sansalvador launched a project to draw, digitize and analyze vaulted buildings throughout the Maya lowlands of southern Mexico and Guatemala.</p>



<p>Vaulted structures featured two horizontal stone walls topped by rows of stones arranged to angle inward and meet at a central row of stones, creating an inverted V- or U-shaped roof.</p>



<p>Because Maya vaults required thick, load-bearing walls, they rarely exceeded 3 meters in width. Long, narrow vaulted structures in urban centers were often connected to form rectangular, oval or L shapes around courtyards. Some sites from the Classic Maya period — which ran from about A.D. 250 to 900 and is considered by many to be the zenith of the Maya civilization — include small numbers of vaulted stone buildings. These structures were much fancier and sturdier than farmers’ huts and thus researchers suspect high-ranking officials lived there. Other Classic Maya sites contain a high percentage of vaulted structures that may have served a variety of purposes, including storing important objects, hosting feasts and housing elites.</p>

Gilabert-Sansalvador</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>With her doctorate and a database of measurements for the remains of 200 vaulted stone buildings in hand, Gilabert-Sansalvador arrived at Tulane University’s Middle American Research Institute in New Orleans in 2021 as a visiting researcher. There she met Tulane archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli, who viewed her architectural expertise as essential for solving a Maya mystery.</p>



<p>Estrada-Belli had spent two decades excavating small structures that had been covered in dirt over time on forest floors at several ancient Maya sites. Some structures retained only plaster floors, consistent with having been farmers’ huts made of thatch and wooden poles that had long since decayed. But others were bordered by remains of thick stone and mortar walls, raising questions about who had lived there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/120223_maya_inline2-1.jpg?resize=680%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="A modern thatched-roof hut" class="wp-image-3133565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/120223_maya_inline2-1.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/120223_maya_inline2-1.jpg?resize=579%2C383&amp;ssl=1 579w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/120223_maya_inline2-1.jpg?resize=281%2C186&amp;ssl=1 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133565">In the urban sprawl of Maya cities, farmers may have lived in thatched-roof huts, similar to this modern one.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133565">L. Gilabert-Sansalvador</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In reviewing aerial images of ancient Maya buildings across southern Mexico and Guatemala, Estrada-Belli had surmised that earth-covered mounds at least 1 meter tall corresponded to the rubble of collapsed stone structures, including those with vaulted roofs, like the ones he had excavated. But he could not be sure.</p>



<p>Gilabert-Sansalvador’s database offered an opportunity to evaluate that suspicion with lidar, short for light detection and ranging. In archaeology, airborne lidar technology uses laser pulses to detect remains of ancient structures and objects otherwise hidden by forests and ground cover. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">Lidar has revealed general features of interconnected Maya cities</a> and extensive rural drainage channels and terraces dating to at least 2,300 years ago (<em>SN: 10/27/18, p. 11</em>).</p>





<p>The challenge was to develop a geometric measure of collapsed vaulted structures that lidar could detect.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lidar illuminates Maya neighborhoods</h4>



<p>In 2021 and 2022, Gilabert-Sansalvador, now at the Polytechnic University of València in Spain, joined Estrada-Belli and three other researchers to review measurements in her database plus measurements of another 251 vaulted structures collected by other excavation teams. Those buildings come from throughout Maya territory, from southern Mexico and Central America to as far north as the Yucatán Peninsula.</p>



<p>Inspecting the entire sample of 451 structures, the researchers found that collapsed vaulted buildings had a much higher volume of rubble, formed taller mounds and had steeper sides than same-sized buildings made of perishable materials, such as thatched-roof huts.</p>



<p>To verify that these mound dimensions spotlight only crumpled stone structures with vaulted roofs, the team examined stone buildings previously identified in excavations and ground surveys at the Classic Maya site of Tikal in Guatemala. Overall, the researchers’ method correctly distinguished between remnants of vaulted and nonvaulted structures, such as ballcourts lined by stone walls, ceremonial buildings and inscribed stone monuments, up to 97 percent of the time.</p>



<p>Confident in the method, the team then analyzed 11 lidar data­sets that covered Tikal and seven other Classic Maya urban centers, along with several rural territories. Lidar analyses encompassed a total of around 60,000 square kilometers, nearly the area of West Virginia. About 111,000 previously identified structures were analyzed for signs of having been built with vaulted roofs.</p>



<p>A picture emerged of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440323001152?via%3Dihub4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clusters of vaulted stone buildings</a>, typical of ruling elites’ houses in major centers. But they were in farming communities as far as five kilometers from the nearest urban core. As lidar images of rural stone compounds accumulated, Estrada-Belli felt increasingly surprised: “We checked our tests many times and concluded that this result was in fact correct.”</p>



<p>Small groups of huts, possibly occupied by extended families of farmers and other settlers, encircled shared plazas. Neighborhoods were made up of sets of huts clustered around stone buildings, which may have housed low-level nobles or other elites, the researchers reported in the September<em> Journal of Archaeological Science</em>. Sets of neighborhoods, in turn, clustered around large stone structures that may have housed higher-ranking officials, to form administrative districts.</p>



<p>“We now have quantitative measures of ancient Maya neighborhoods, which have been hard to define or identify,” Estrada-Belli says.</p>



<p>Urban sprawl managed by low- and midlevel officials flourished despite a lack of horses and wheeled vehicles, Estrada-Belli says. Transportation consisted of walking and river travel.</p>



<p>Raised roads, or causeways, ran from farmsteads, neighborhoods and districts to urban centers, making foot travel easier and pit stops convenient. Public plazas dotting the country­side hosted ritual gatherings and served as marketplaces. Rural elites’ duties included mediating local disputes and organizing community projects such as reservoir and causeway construction, Estrada-Belli suspects. In exchange, local officials probably collected taxes on market transactions.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the Classic Maya period, from around A.D. 600 to 900, local political authorities lived among many farming communities, Estrada-Belli says.</p>

<p>Causeways linked many administrative centers (district nodes) within Caracol. At its peak of about 100,000 residents, estimated population densities reached over 1,000 people per square kilometer in the city center (dark red; lower densities in pink, yellow then green).</p>

<p>Any lingering suspicions that Maya farmers played no part in political decisions that affected their daily lives do not hold up, he contends. “We can now talk about one common model of urban organization among the Classic Maya that included the less populated countryside,” Estrada-Belli says. Maya political elites directed the construction of stone compounds at prominent locations in interconnected neighborhoods and administrative districts. This highlights the importance of central rulers in forming and running these complex political systems, he suspects.</p>



<p>Even among researchers impressed by the new lidar findings, though, some doubt that multilayered political systems always revolved around a king or elite political power brokers, as proposed by Estrada-Belli.</p>



<p>Some ancient Maya cities featured collective actions by local communities while others emphasized royal edicts, these investigators contend. And the same community could dramatically alter its political system as times and conditions changed.</p>



<p>Political variation across sites fits with <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2211558120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archaeological and lidar discoveries over the last two decades</a> that challenge a popular idea that Classic Maya cities collapsed rapidly around A.D. 900, over a span of 50 to 100 years. A group of 15 Maya researchers summarized these recent findings July 24 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Residents of Maya urban centers often found ways, whether through local or centralized decision making, to survive droughts and military defeats previously thought to have been society killers, research now suggests. Major sites suffered population losses over as many as 100 to 200 years before emptying out.</p>



<p>At that point, Maya people who had developed a taste for social and political flexibility established towns and smaller cities elsewhere. Maya culture soldiered on after Classic period cities lost their appeal.</p>



<p>Why urban centers turned into ghost cities over a couple of hundred years, some more quickly than others, is poorly understood. That raises questions about precisely who lived in Estrada-Belli’s newly identified Maya stone structures and what they were up to.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who lived in vaulted buildings?</h4>



<p>Excavations of those stone structures, guided by the lidar findings, will help to clarify who lived there.</p>



<p>Some occupants of rural vaulted structures may have belonged to noble lineages that served the royal interests, says anthropological archaeologist Andrew Scherer of Brown University in Providence, R.I. Ancient DNA evidence indicates that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asia-xiongnu-nomadic-empire-expansion">rulers of a 2,000-year-old nomadic empire in Asia followed a similar strategy</a>, sending members of royal lineages to oversee distant territories (<em>SN Online: 7/2/23</em>).</p>



<p>But Maya rural elites may have acquired wealth and power in local communities without being appointed by a paramount ruler, Scherer cautions. If so, it’s not clear who, if anyone, pulled the strings of neighborhood and district officials.</p>



<p>Advances in deciphering Maya writing and ongoing excavations indicate that midlevel authorities wielded considerable power at rural settlements aligned with urban centers such as Tikal, says anthropological archaeologist John Walden of Harvard University. <a href="https://www.goafar.org/themayanist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midlevel elites ran public rituals and feasts</a>, hosted marketplaces and maintained diplomatic ties with their counterparts in nearby communities, Walden concluded in the Spring 2023 issue of <em>The Mayanist</em>.</p>



<p>It’s an open question whether some vaulted structures served as homes for heads of local kin groups or clans that prioritized their own interests over those of kings and urban big shots, Walden says.</p>



<p>But the new lidar findings underscore a central point, Scherer says. “Authority in some fashion was dispersed on the landscape and not clustered in Maya civic ceremonial centers.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Reconstructing Caracol politics</h4>



<p>At Caracol, one of the largest Classic Maya cities, authority took chameleon-like turns, Chase says. “Caracol shifted between more collective and more autocratic systems of governance over its 1,500-year life span,” he says. “The city experienced great transformations and changes as it grew.”</p>



<p>Chase has <a href="https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/9553?&amp;ln=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconstructed Caracol’s wild historical ride</a> using an array of evidence accumulated over the last four decades, including deciphered Maya written records carved on stone slabs, archaeological finds and lidar imagery. His conclusions appear in the 2023 <em>Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology</em> and in a chapter of an upcoming book that he coedited, <em>Ancient Mesoamerican Population History</em>. For instance, carved hieroglyphics include dates when specific rulers assumed power and won or lost battles with kings of rival cities. And lidar maps have guided ongoing excavations of farming sites outside Caracol’s city core.</p>



<p>Chase’s own connection to Caracol began before he could talk. His parents, anthropological archaeologists Diane Chase and Arlen Chase, both at the University of Houston, brought him there every year, starting as an infant, after launching a Caracol fieldwork project in 1985.</p>



<p>As a high school junior steeped in archaeology, Chase helped run a Caracol excavation. Now he oversees multiple excavations and on-site lab investigations of unearthed artifacts.</p>



<p>Caracol started out small too. Around 600 B.C., three villages collectively built reservoirs, causeways and ceremonial sites. Residents of the villages formed a single site that was governed without central rulers for about 700 years. A royal dynasty assumed power in A.D. 331. Successful wars against the nearby cities of Tikal and Naranjo between 553 and 680 sparked a population boom. A minimum of 100,000 people inhabited Caracol at its peak.</p>



<p>Urban and rural areas coalesced into a “garden city,” Chase says. He has mapped 373 neighborhoods, each linked to a nearby public space that hosted market and ritual events. In each neighborhood, residents carved agricultural terraces out of adjacent hillsides and constructed small reservoirs. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416523000302?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Groups of neighborhoods formed 25 districts</a>, each containing a monumental center with reservoirs, ballcourts or other large structures that provided public services, he reported in the June <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>

Estrada-Belli <em>et al</em>/<em>Journal of Archaeological Science</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Chase ended up defining neighborhoods not just by combinations of pottery offerings and dental practices, but also by distances of farmers’ huts to the nearest district plaza. Farmers who would have walked similar routes over Caracol’s rugged hills to district sites presumably forged ties on those trips, which cultivated feelings of belonging to neighborhoods with common practices, such as leaving certain types of offerings at local shrines, Chase suspects.</p>



<p>Naranjo’s military defeat of Caracol in 680 ushered in roughly a century of decentralized government, Chase says. “Faceless administrators” who went unnamed in Maya writings oversaw taxation and the provision of services to urban communities. Policies at that time led to widespread wealth, community-wide ritual ceremonies and relatively equal access to market products and agricultural land.</p>



<p>New rulers who aligned themselves with powerful Maya gods assumed power in 798. These kings instituted autocratic policies and oversaw a sharp rise in wealth disparities. Those developments may have instigated a population exodus from Caracol. By 900, the garden city had been abandoned.</p>



<p>Estrada-Belli suspects a system of Caracol neighborhood and district officials operated out of regularly spaced, elite residences, much like the compounds of vaulted structures his team has identified elsewhere. Plans are in the works to probe lidar data at Caracol for signs of collapsed vaulted structures in or near previously identified neighborhoods, Chase says.</p>



<p>Classic-era sites in the northern Maya lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula, which generally have drawn less scientific attention than Classic Maya sites to the south, also deserve closer lidar scrutiny. Vaulted structures still stand at some of those centers, including large sites such as Chichén Itzá, Estrada-Belli says.</p>



<p>New excavations guided by lidar discoveries, and lidar analyses informed by the dimensions of excavated buildings, may clarify Classic Maya power structures at sites on the Yucatán Peninsula.</p>



<p>The layering of authority and its reach across ancient Maya urban areas is just beginning to emerge from a forested shroud.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polygon-rock-patterns-mars-climate">Giant polygon rock patterns may be buried deep below Mars’ surface</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enormous polygon patterns in rock lie dozens of meters below Mars’ surface, ground-penetrating radar data suggest.</p>



<p>Similar patterns develop on the surface in Earth’s polar regions when icy sediments cool and contract. A comparable process long ago may have created the shapes on Mars, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02117-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found near the planet’s dry equator</a>, researchers report November 23 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>If so, the finding hints that the Red Planet’s equator<em> </em>was much wetter and icier, more like a polar region, when the polygons formed 2 billion to 3 billion years ago.</p>





<p><em>“</em>Buried possible polygons at that depth have yet to be reported” on Mars, says planetary scientist Richard Soare of Dawson College in Montreal, who was not involved in the study. Searching for ancient polygonal terrain on Mars using ground-penetrating radar is a new idea that “could be powerful,” he adds, and could help scientists understand how Mars&#8217; climate has changed in the past.</p>



<p>On Earth, polygonal terrain forms in chilly climes when sharp temperature drops cause icy ground to contract and crack open. These thermal fractures are small at first. But the little cracks can fill with ice, sand, or a bit of both, forming “wedges” that prevent the cracks from healing and gradually pry open the earth as they grow. Because this wedging process requires multiple cycles of freezing and thawing, polygonal ground is a good hint that the terrain was icy when the patterns formed.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">the Chinese Zhurong rover’s landing site</a>, on a part of Mars called Utopia Planitia, is not the kind of place one would expect to find the terrain on Earth&nbsp;— at least not today (<em>SN: 5/19/21</em>). Polygons have been spotted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-ice-could-be-sculpting-surface-patterns">at higher latitudes</a> on the Martian surface from orbit, but the landing site sits near the Martian equator in a dry, sandy dune field (<em>SN: 8/24/04</em>).</p>



<p>The polygons appear to be roughly 70 meters across and are bordered by wedges nearly 30 meters wide and tens of meters deep — about 10 times as large as typical polygons and wedges on Earth. So it’s possible, Soare says, the structures here formed a bit differently than ice-wedge polygons on Earth.<br><br>Forming polygons near the Martian equator wouldn’t be possible today, says study coauthor Ross Mitchell, a geoscientist also at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics. To form polygons, the region must have been colder and wetter in the past, he says — much like a polar region.</p>



<p>Changes in the tilt of Mars’ axis could explain such a shift in climate. Simulations of Mars’ orbit have suggested that the planet’s spin axis has at times been so extremely tilted that the planet essentially lay halfway on its side. This would cause the poles to receive more direct sunlight while equatorial regions froze. Finding potential polygons buried near the Martian equator, Mitchell says, is “smoking gun evidence” supporting the idea that the tilt of Mars’ axis has varied so substantially in the past.</p>



<p>“We think of every planet other than Earth as dead,” Mitchell says. But if Mars’s axis does swing around often, he says, our neighboring planet’s climate would be far more dynamic than currently believed.</p>

<p>A deluge of bizarre and malicious emails targeting a professor at Harvard Medical School has left him reeling, while raising questions about the smear campaign’s use of a popular online forum where scientists publicly critique research.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/labs-and-projects/loscalzo/joseph-loscalzo-md-phd-bio">Joseph Loscalzo</a> sent a letter to PubPeer, the online forum, in September describing an “aggressive cyberstalking and harassment campaign” that “has relentlessly targeted myself and my colleagues” for many months with “misleading and often inaccurate comments.” He called PubPeer “a vehicle” for the attacks, alleging anonymous comments raising concerns about at least 15 papers were posted “in bad faith” and then used to defame and badger him in emails to other researchers, journals, and universities.</p>



<p>Loscalzo, physician-in-chief emeritus and former chair of the department of medicine at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston, asked PubPeer to remove the offending comments and impose a six-month moratorium on anonymous posts about his work. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Stell-Brandon-CEO-PubPeer-re-Loscalzo-Joseph.pdf">letter</a> was obtained by Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-128360"></span>



<p>PubPeer has gained prominence in recent years as a place where amateur sleuths have flagged data manipulation and other scientific misconduct involving high-profile scientists, including most recently Stanford President and neuroscientist Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who resigned earlier this year after <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/19/marc-tessier-lavigne-stanford-president-resignation/">an investigation confirmed data manipulation</a> in papers he co-authored.&nbsp; (Full disclosure: Ivan Oransky, a co-founder of Retraction Watch, is a volunteer member of PubPeer’s board of directors.)</p>



<p>The online forum denied responsibility for how posts on its website are used and the intentions behind them. “We&#8217;re not yet president of the internet,” said Boris Barbour, who helped launch PubPeer. “All we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that what is on PubPeer is fair according to our guidelines.”</p>



<p>As for what goes onto the site, he explained, it is either posted “by a trusted commenter and subject to post-moderation as required, or will be examined before it&#8217;s posted.” To protect users, “we&#8217;re set up not to know who&#8217;s commenting and not to know if it&#8217;s the same person,” Barbour added.</p>



<p>He said PubPeer had removed “a few comments” that required more context or explanation, but most appeared to be valid points “about relatively minor things.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not as if it&#8217;s revenge porn or some fabrication or something,” Barbour said, adding that the organization would not halt legitimate comments. “We to date have never yet practiced a moratorium under legal threat.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Loscalzo is not the only researcher to complain about the nonprofit organization. Nobel Prize winner Thomas Südhof of Stanford University, who earlier this year <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/nobel-laureates-study-earns-expression-of-concern-over-data-integrity-issues/">earned two corrections and an editorial expression of concern</a> following PubPeer posts, has <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231030164110/https:/med.stanford.edu/sudhoflab/science-resources/integrity---pubpeer.html">accused the forum</a> of lacking transparency and censoring comments. In 2021, a pair of controversial researchers in France&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/22/world-expert-in-scientific-misconduct-faces-legal-action-for-challenging-integrity-of-hydroxychloroquine-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a police report against the highly regarded scientific sleuth Elizabeth Bik and Barbour</a>&nbsp;for harassing them by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/elisabeth-bik-didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposing problems with their research</a>&nbsp;on the website. Bik said the complaint&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/1732572332563238968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never resulted in legal action</a>.</p>



<p>And in 2014, a cancer researcher at Wayne State University, in Detroit, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/26/scientist-sues-pubpeer-commenters-subpoenas-site-for-names/">brought claims against anonymous PubPeer commenters</a>, subpoenaing the site for the commenters’ names, after allegedly losing a job offer due to posts raising concerns about his papers. He was unsuccessful.</p>



<p>Loscalzo declined several requests for an on-the-record interview. But Brigham and Women’s Hospital said in an emailed statement: “The allegations raised by these anonymous accounts are meritless and the ongoing cyber harassment of a member of our faculty and research team is extremely concerning.”</p>



<p>Loscalzo is a former collaborator of Piero Anversa, who left Harvard <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/16/hms-requests-anversa-retractions/">in 2015</a> after having <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/harvard-brigham-retractions-stem-cell/">fudged dozens of studies</a>, according to a subsequent investigation, to make it look as if adult stem cells could repair damaged hearts. No evidence has implicated Loscalzo in the deception, but his tormentor, or tormentors, have weaponized PubPeer in an ever-widening online campaign to discredit him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter, dated Sept. 19, 2023, cites three examples of “many malicious emails,” all of which were sent from untraceable Proton Mail accounts using aliases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, an email sent this summer by someone impersonating one of Loscalzo’s coauthors asked the editor of <em>Circulation Research</em> “to withdraw” <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321879">a recent paper</a> by the two researchers after “PubPeer comments brought to our attention to possible research integrity issue on our article [sic].”</p>



<p>Another email, sent to several faculty members at Brigham and Women’s, began: “Many people know Loscalzo Lab has a lot of academic and other ethical misconduct issues,” and linked to comments on PubPeer about his research.</p>



<p>The extent of the smear campaign is unclear. But the emails targeting Loscalzo are likely to number in the hundreds, if not more. During the past several months, Retraction Watch alone has received dozens of messages from Proton Mail accounts that were later deleted. Many claimed to be from South Korean academics, but included text lifted from Wikipedia about the sender; several pointed to comments on PubPeer and urged investigations of Loscalzo. Some struck a professional tone; others appeared unhinged.</p>



<p>“Loscalzo Lab people are crazy and full of the mentally disturbed,” wrote a self-described “former postdoctoral fellow” in the lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simultaneously, even more outlandish emails began arriving in Retraction Watch inboxes. They also came from Proton Mail accounts. Many were signed by a “Jennie Lee,” who described herself as a “manager and coordinator” of what appeared to be a campaign to defend Loscalzo called “Together Joe – We are stronger together with Joe Loscalzo.” Several ended with a nursery rhyme, of sorts, consisting of five stanzas and titled “Joey Lo and His Morning Report.”</p>



<p>One email read, in part: “We will do our best to protect Dr. Loscalzo from constant slander, research integrity allegations, and defamation directed at Dr. Loscalzo. Please ignore any malicious emails sent to Retraction Watch and also ignore malicious PubPeer comments by bad actors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Whether these emails, which were sent out widely, were a bona fide attempt to shield the professor or a twisted part of the plot against him is unclear. Leonid Schneider, in an Oct. 23, 2023, post on his blog For Better Science, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231024112802/https:/forbetterscience.com/2023/10/23/joe-loscalzos-drag-show/">suggested Loscalzo had sent the emails himself using sock-puppet accounts</a>. Schneider also posted a drawing of Loscalzo as a heavy-breasted drag queen.</p>



<p>Who is behind the scores of inimical Proton Mail emails also remains unclear – but in the letter to PubPeer, the researcher speculated that the onslaught has roots in a case involving a South Korean medical student who briefly worked in his Brigham lab. “In South Korea, this student was the subject of false allegations of research misconduct by other South Korean scientists,” Loscalzo wrote in his letter. “The allegations were formally dismissed by his university after an internal investigation, and the scientists who brought forward the allegations were discredited. Shortly thereafter, which is why we believe the conduct is related and retaliatory, the cyberstalker began harassing the student, as well as me and other colleagues who have worked with me and/or the student.”</p>



<p>The former student appears to have worked in the lab of a prominent cardiologist at Yonsei University in South Korea. Earlier this year, the cardiologist, Hui-Nam Pak, was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/19/exclusive-probe-suggests-new-retraction-awaiting-embattled-korean-heart-doctor/">found guilty</a> of duplicate publication, a type of academic misconduct, by his institution. Since Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/03/prominent-korean-heart-doctor-earns-two-retractions-in-a-month/">first wrote about Pak</a> last February, hundreds of hateful comments defending Pak and vilifying whistleblowers have flooded the blog; many were not posted because they violated commenting policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even Bik seems to have been snared in the campaign. She said she started looking into papers Loscalzo had coauthored after receiving a tip from someone using a Proton Mail account and signing off with an Asian name. Among several issues she flagged on PubPeer in October, she said only <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6E0F71AD366DC9DC4BACB505926ADB">one</a> seemed potentially serious: an image in a 2003 paper she said appeared to have “been digitally altered.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not like the Stanford president or like other cases I&#8217;ve followed,” she said, referring to Tessier-Lavigne. “I did search a lot of [Loscalzo’s] papers and I didn&#8217;t really find much other than the eight or seven that I reported, but it seemed to be all minor problems.”</p>



<p>After this story published, Bik told us she had found additional problems with Loscalzo’s papers, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8D2E2E1CF3C279E04DFDDB921D3CF7#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B229E5912F3098C41492962FABB638#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two</a>, following our interview in October. She said some &#8220;<a href="https://x.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/1732572332563238968?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look very serious</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an email, Loscalzo dismissed any suggestion of image manipulation, adding that “if there was an error, it was unintentional. Importantly, the internal consistency of the other experiments in the [2003] paper strongly supports the conclusions, which have since been independently confirmed by other research groups.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the cyberattacks continue. After declining several interview requests, Loscalzo forwarded an email showing that on November 8, someone using a Proton Mail account had submitted a manuscript titled “Abilify Network medicine: Drug repurposing of aripiprazole in cardiovascular diseases” to Preprints.org, a server for archiving scholarly works in advance of publication. Loscalzo and several of his colleagues were listed as authors, but had never heard of the article, he wrote in an email to Preprints.org.</p>



<p>“No doubt, after the paper is published, the plan would be for the malicious culprit to post errors on PubPeer that would be used to defame us yet again,” Loscalzo said.</p>



<p>Update, 12/7/23, 1500 UTC: We have corrected a passage in this story characterizing the status of a police report filed against Barbour and Bik, and have added two sentences with an update on findings Bik made after our reporter spoke to her in October.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-grave-sword-mirror-woman-warrior">A mysterious ancient grave with a sword and mirror belonged to a woman</a></h4>

              
                <p>A roughly 2,000-year-old woman with a potentially violent streak has emerged from skeletal rubble found on an island off southwestern England’s coast.</p>



<p>A jumble of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.104099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tooth and bone fragments in a Late Iron Age grave belonged to a young woman</a> who was interred with items that include a sword, shield and bronze mirror, researchers report in the December <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>. The team used a sex-linked protein extracted from tooth enamel to classify the remains as female.</p>





<p>The island grave dates to roughly 100 B.C. to 50 B.C., based on radiocarbon dating of a partial bone and the types of metal objects found in the burial. Given tooth wear, the woman died between the ages of 20 and 25.</p>



<p>Since the burial’s accidental discovery in 1999 by a farmer plowing a field on England’s Bryher Island, researchers have wondered whether the stone-lined grave contained a man or woman. No other Western European Iron Age grave includes a sword, typically found in male burials from that region, and a mirror, often associated with female burials.</p>

<p>Human skeletal biologist Simon Mays of Historic England, a public organization that protects and studies historical places, in Portsmouth and colleagues speculate that the woman may have fought in raids and helped to fend off enemy attacks. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-skeletons-iron-age-massacre-prehistoric-europe-spain">Violence between communities may often have occurred</a> in Iron Age Europe (<em>SN: 10/6/20</em>). And growing evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-ignites-debate-over-whether-women-were-viking-warriors">ancient women</a>, not just men, could be warriors too (<em>SN: 9/13/17</em>).</p>



<p>One possible use of the mirror was to flash beams of reflected sunlight as a way of communicating with people on nearby islands and with seacraft, the researchers speculate. If so, and given the sword’s presence, it’s possible the Bryher woman helped to plan raids and defensive actions.</p>



<p>Still, the remains bear no signs of violent conflict. So it’s also possible that mourners placed the sword and mirror in the grave as tokens of allegiance to the woman’s kin group or as heirlooms, the researchers say.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-engineering-un-report-ethical-framework">A new UN report lays out an ethical framework for climate engineering</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world is in a climate crisis — and in the waning days of what’s likely to be the world’s hottest year on record, a new United Nations report is weighing the ethics of using technological interventions to try to rein in rising global temperatures.</p>



<p>“The current speed at which the effects of global warming are increasingly being manifested is giving new life to the discussion on the kinds of climate action best suited to tackle the catastrophic consequences of environmental changes,” the report states.</p>





<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-geoengineering-worth-risks">broad variety of climate engineering interventions</a> are already in development, from strategies that could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-climate-change-carbon-capture-deforestation">directly remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a> to efforts to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geoengineering-tactic-cool-planet-could-hurt-crops">modify incoming radiation from the sun</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/19; SN: 7/9/21; SN: 8/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>But “we don’t know the unintended consequences” of many of these technologies, said UNESCO Assistant Director-General Gabriela Ramos at a news conference on November 20 ahead of the report’s release. “There are several areas of great concern. These are very interesting and promising technological developments, but we need an ethical framework to decide how and when to use them.”</p>



<p>Such a framework should be globally agreed upon, Ramos said — and that’s why UNESCO decided to step in. The new report proposes ethical frameworks for both the study and the later deployment of climate engineering strategies.</p>



<p>In addition to explicitly addressing concerns over how tinkering with the climate might affect global food security and the environment, ethical considerations must also include accounting for conflicting interests between regions and countries, the report states. Furthermore, it must include assessing at what point the risks of taking action are or are not morally defensible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not [for] a single country to decide,” Ramos said. “Even those countries that have nothing to do with those technological developments need to be at the table … to agree on a path going forward. Climate is global and needs to be a global conversation.”</p>



<p>The ethics-focused report was prepared by a UNESCO advisory body known as the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology. Its release coincided with the start of the U.N.’s international climate action summit, the 28th Conference of the Parties, or COP, in Dubai. COP28 runs from November 30 through December 12.</p>



<p>To delve more into the goals of the study and what climate engineering strategies the report considers, <em>Science News</em> talked with report coauthor Inés Camilloni, a climate scientist at the University of Buenos Aires and a resident in the solar geoengineering research program at Harvard University. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: There have been a lot of reports recently about climate engineering. What makes this one important?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: One thing is that this report includes the views from the Global South as well as the Global North. This is something really important, there are not many reports with the voices of scientists from the Global South. <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/Solar-Radiation-Modification-research-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The U.N. Environment Programme’s report this year</a> [on solar radiation modification] was another one. [This new report] has a bigger picture, because it also includes carbon dioxide removal.</p>



<p>I’m a climate scientist; ethics is something new to me. I got involved because I was a lead author of a chapter in the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-limit-degrees-ipcc-climate-change">1.5-degrees-Celsius special report</a> in 2018, and there was a box discussion about climate engineering (<em>SN: 10/7/18</em>). I realized I was not an expert on that. The discussion was among scientists in the Global North, who had a clear position in some ways about the idea, but not Global South scientists. We were just witnessing this discussion.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: The report raises a concern about the “moral hazard” of relying too much on climate engineering, which might give countries or companies an excuse to slow carbon emission reductions. Should we even be considering climate engineering in that context?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: What we are saying in the report is that the priority must be the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. But the discussion on climate engineering is growing because we are not on track to keep temperatures [below] 1.5 degrees C. We are not [at] the right level of ambition really needed to keep temperatures below that target. There are so many uncertainties that it’s relevant to consider the ethical dimensions in these conversations, to make a decision of potential deployment. And in most IPCC scenarios that can limit warming to below 1.5 degrees, carbon dioxide removal is already there.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What are some of the carbon dioxide removal strategies under consideration?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: Carbon dioxide removal combines two different methods: Restoring natural carbon sinks, like forests and soils, and investing in technologies that are maybe not yet proven to work at the scale that’s needed. That includes direct air capture [of carbon dioxide] and storage; bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; increasing uptake by the oceans of carbon dioxide, for example by iron fertilization; and enhancing natural weathering processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But there are potential consequences that need to be considered. Those include negative impacts of terrestrial biodiversity, and effects on marine biodiversity from ocean fertilization. As for sequestering carbon dioxide — how do you store it for hundreds of years or longer, and what are the consequences of rapid release from underground reservoirs? Also there’s potential competition for land [between bioenergy crops or planting trees] and food production, especially in the Global South.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: </strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-cooler-earth"><strong>Solar radiation modification</strong></a><strong> is considered even more controversial, but some scientists are saying it should now be on the table (<em>SN: 5/21/10</em>). What type of solar radiation modification is the most viable, technologically?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: That’s an umbrella term for a variety of approaches that reduce the amount of incoming sunlight reflected by the atmosphere back to space.</p>



<p>There’s increasing surface reflectivity, for example with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reflective paints on structures</a>, or planting more reflective crops (<em>SN: 9/28/18</em>). That reflects more solar radiation into space. It’s already being used in some cities, but it has a very local effect. Similarly, increasing the reflectivity of marine clouds — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were some experiments in Australia to try to protect the Great Barrier Reef</a>, but it seems that also the scale is not global.</p>



<p>Another proposed strategy is to thin infrared-absorbing cirrus clouds — I don’t really know much about that or if it’s really possible. And there’s placing reflectors or shields in space to deflect incoming solar radiation; I also don’t really know if it’s possible to do that.</p>



<p>Injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, to mimic the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption, is the most promising for a global impact. It’s not so challenging in terms of the technology. It’s the only way that we have identified that can cool the planet in a few years.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How soon could aerosol injection be used?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: We need at least 10 to 20 years before we can think of deployment. The limitation is that we need the aircraft that can fly at around 20 kilometers altitude. Those are already being designed, but we need about 10 years for those designs, and another 10 to build a fleet of them.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What are some of the ethical concerns around aerosol injection or other solar radiation modification technologies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni: </strong>These new technologies may be risky in the potential for exacerbating climate problems or introducing new challenges. There are potential risks to changing precipitation patterns, even overcooling in some regions. A key consideration in deciding whether to pursue them is the need for a full characterization of the positive and negative effects of the different technologies around the globe, and a comparison against the risk of <em>not</em> intervening.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: In 2021, a </strong><a href="https://www.keutschgroup.com/scopex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>research group at Harvard</strong></a><strong> was barred from launching a balloon into the stratosphere to test equipment for possible future aerosol release. How might this report address similar studies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: In our report, we want to make a distinction among the different types of research. You can have indoor research — simulations, social analysis — and this is not so controversial. When you consider outdoor research — releasing particles into the atmosphere — that is more controversial. We are calling for more indoor research. We need to understand the potential impacts.</p>



<p>[For example,] I studied the impact of solar radiation modification on the hydrology of the La Plata Basin [which includes parts of southeastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina]. It’s the most populated region on the continent, and very relevant for hydropower production. And it’s already a very impacted region by climate change.</p>



<p>However, that research was based on just one climate model. We need more — more resources, more capacity building in the Global South. My research group was the first to explore those impacts in Latin and South America. There are others doing research on this over the next few months, but I can count those groups on one hand.</p>



<p>We need more resources to be part of any discussion. Those resources include the <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cop27-ends-announcement-historic-loss-and-damage-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loss and Damage Fund </a>to provide support to nations most vulnerable to the climate crisis [agreed to at the end of COP27 in 2022]. But nobody really knows now how that will be implemented.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: The report’s release was timed to the start of COP28. What are you hoping that policymakers will take away from it over the next two weeks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Camilloni</strong>: These recommendations are really important to have in mind, of course. We need more research to make a decision about whether this is a good idea or a bad idea. And maybe people will cut admissions faster if they’re afraid of climate engineering.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As part of our commitment to championing reproducibility, transparency, and the continual advancement of scientific methods,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> BMC Methods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is excited to introduce two article types designed to assist our authors in effectively showcasing their innovative techniques and procedures: Methodology Articles and Protocols. We are also pleased to announce that publication costs for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Methods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> are covered by Springer Nature until December 1, 2024. Authors whose articles are accepted for publication before that date won&#8217;t be charged an article-processing fee. </span></p>
<p><b>Methodology Articles: advancing scientific frontiers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Methodology articles are expected to introduce experimental or computational methods that represent an advance in their respective fields. Whether it&#8217;s an entirely novel approach or an improved version of an existing method, authors are encouraged to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their methodology in comparison to other alternatives. The method should have undergone testing, validation, and ideally, practical application demonstrating its value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s important to note that Methodology articles do not provide a step-by-step description of the method. Instead, authors are encouraged to submit a detailed step-by-step protocol separately as a Protocol article type, or reference a previously published protocol.</span></p>
<p><b>Protocols: a deep dive into experimental techniques</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Protocols offer detailed step-by-step descriptions of experimental techniques. To be considered for publication, protocols must provide sufficient details for easy replication, include evidence of the protocol&#8217;s success by referencing at least one peer-reviewed publication and represent an advance on previously available methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We strongly recommend that authors share their step-by-step protocols on </span><a href="https://www.protocols.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">protocols.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> before submission. Protocols submitted to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Methods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> will then consist of two interlinked components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, including detailed methodological information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A peer-reviewed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Methods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> article contextualizing the protocol, discussing background, advantages, applications, limitations, troubleshooting, expected results, benchmarking data, and sample datasets.</span></li>

<p>The publisher Elsevier is investigating an unspecified number of articles by authors affiliated with a French research institute for concerns about “the appropriate conduct of research involving human participants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a “Publisher’s Note” that appeared November 9 in Elsevier’s <em>New Microbes and New Infections</em>, “concerns have been raised about a number of articles” published in the journal by researchers affiliated with the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection (IHU-MI) in Marseille.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal and Elsevier’s “Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise” are investigating the allegations “by confidentially consulting with the authors and, where necessary, liaising with the institution where the studies took place,” the note said. It continued: </p>



<span id="more-128340"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Expressions of Concern will be issued to articles published in NMNI if it is deemed that there is a particular need to alert readers to serious concerns while investigation is ongoing.</p>



<p>These Expressions of Concern will remain appended to the articles until the investigation has concluded, and the journal has taken any further action deemed necessary (which may include updates to the Expressions of Concern). In instances where a permanent correction is deemed necessary, the journal will make appropriate corrections to the record, in accordance with Elsevier policies.</p>



<p>The journal wishes to thank those who have alerted us to these concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The notice did not state which articles, or even how many, are under investigation, and an Elsevier spokesperson did not answer our direct questions about the matter. Instead, the spokesperson provided this statement, which indicates the publisher’s investigation extends beyond a single journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have recently published a &#8220;Publisher&#8217;s Note&#8221; at <em>New Microbes and New Infections</em> which outlines our approach to an ongoing investigation into articles authored by researchers from IHU &#8211; Méditerranée-Infection, Marseille.&nbsp; In addition to papers published in <em>NMNI</em>, a central investigation is being conducted by the Elsevier Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics team that is assessing articles from IHU &#8211; Méditerranée-Infection, Marseille published in other journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In accordance with COPE guidelines, we are currently discussing these articles with both the authors and field experts as a matter of due process, and where any corrections to the record are deemed necessary, these will be clearly communicated online in due course.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Didier Raoult, the French infectious disease scientist who came to prominence for promoting <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/12/elsevier-investigating-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-paper/">hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment</a>, last year retired as director of IHU-MI, which he had overseen since 2011. His departure followed an inspection by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products that found “serious shortcomings and non-compliances with the regulations for research involving the human person.”</p>



<p>Raoult has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A group of researchers identified 456 clinical studies by authors affiliated with IHU-MI with “serious concerns on the ethics approvals of the trials,” such as nearly 250 that use the same ethics approval number despite significant differences in design. Of the studies they flagged with ethical concerns, 135 were published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/new-microbes-and-new-infections"><em>New Microbes and New Infections</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The critics <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">published their findings</a>, as well as their correspondence with editors and publishers of journals where the studies with ethical concerns had appeared. Their records indicate that Elsevier has been aware of their concerns since July 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after the article was published in August containing a figure identifying journals that had published more than three papers with ethical concerns, nothing seemed to happen, Lonni Besançon and Fabrice Frank, two of the article’s authors, said in an interview with Retraction Watch before Elsevier’s note was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I guess this speaks to the accountability of publishers about them publishing potentially fraudulent science,” Besançon said. “I don’t think they care much.”</p>



<p>The Springer Nature journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> in October <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/31/controversial-french-researcher-loses-two-papers-for-ethics-approval-issues/">retracted two papers</a> the sleuths had flagged, which Besançon hoped would spur the publication of expressions of concern for other articles. Such notices “would have been the right course of action when we reached out to editors initially,” he said. </p>



<p>Last December, the publisher PLOS <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/plos-flags-nearly-50-papers-by-controversial-french-covid-researcher-for-ethics-concerns/">marked nearly 50 papers</a> by Raoult with expressions of concern while it continued to investigate the ethics approvals. The sleuths had reported 12 articles to PLOS, Frank said, and he wonders how many more articles have issues than have been publicly flagged: “Maybe we have seen only the part of the iceberg that is outside of the water and not the whole one below.”</p>

<p>This pilot study in Uganda aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of peer-delivered HIV self-tests (HIVST) and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to young women with suboptimal PrEP adherence. Despite adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) accounting for a disproportionate 29% of new HIV infections in Uganda, this group remains underrepresented in the population. The study involved 30 young women aged 18–24 with suboptimal PrEP adherence. Peer-delivered interventions were well-received, with high completion rates at three and six months. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed positive experiences and motivation through peer support, emphasizing the importance of peer support in adherence to PrEP. The study concludes that peer delivery of these interventions is both feasible and acceptable, suggesting potential effectiveness in addressing HIV prevention challenges among African AGYW. Future controlled studies are recommended to further evaluate effectiveness on a wider scale.</p>

<p>In this study researchers investigated the factors influencing comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among adolescent girls in Rwanda using data from the 2020 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. They found that of the 3258 participants, 53.6% demonstrated comprehensive HIV knowledge. Those with secondary education, health insurance, a mobile phone, exposure to television, and a history of HIV testing had where more likely to have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Conversely, girls in Kigali and Northern regions, as well as those practicing the Anglican religion, had lower odds. The findings of this study highlight the importance of expanding HIV preventive education through education and social media. Continued involvement of decision-makers and community actors, particularly religious leaders, is crucial for enhancing comprehensive understanding of HIV/AIDS among adolescent girls.</p>

<p>This study investigates the challenges and facilitators of implementing shared care models for people living with HIV in rural Australia. With improved HIV management, the aging HIV population faces comorbidities, necessitating coordinated care between general practitioners and specialists. However, those in rural areas experience barriers to accessing shared care. Thirteen qualitative interviews revealed that accessibility to general practice significantly influenced shared care engagement, moreover, participants doubted the additive value of general practitioners. Healthcare beliefs, stigma, and preferences for specialist care further impacted the use of shared care. The authors of the study found continuity of care in general practice helped facilitated shared care, however, logistical issues such as affordability and transport posed challenges. They concluded that overcoming patient priorities, anticipated stigma, and resource limitations in rural healthcare is crucial for effective shared care. Building rapport with general practitioners and ensuring continuity of care are essential strategies for quality primary care in shared models, supported by specialist physicians.</p>

<p>In fishing communities near Lake Victoria in Uganda, where HIV prevalence is high, <em>Schistosoma mansoni </em>(<em>S. mansoni</em>) infection rates are also significant. More than 50% of local fishermen are infected with <em>S. mansoni</em>. The authors of this study investigated how <em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection might modify immune responses against HIV. Using polychromatic flow cytometry and Gran-ToxiLux assays, the study compared HIV-specific responses, T cell phenotypes, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADCC) potency and titres between individuals with HIV-<em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection and those with HIV alone. Interestingly, the findings revealed that <em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection was associated with modified anti-HIV responses, including a lower frequency of bifunctional CD4 T cells, higher overall CD4 T cell activation, and lower HIV ADCC antibody titres compared to individuals with HIV alone. The results suggest that <em>S. mansoni</em> infection affects T cell and antibody responses to HIV in coinfected individuals, highlighting the importance of understanding the impact of <em>S. mansoni</em> treatment upon HIV-specific immune responses and disease progression.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The authors of this mixed-methods study investigated the attitudes, facilitators, and barriers to HIV drug resistance mutations (DRM) testing among pregnant women and children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya. Despite lower rates of viral suppression in this population, the significance of DRM in treatment decisions is recognized, leading to the scaling up of national DRM testing programs in resource-limited settings. They conducted interviews with adolescents, caregivers, pregnant women, providers, and policymakers in five HIV treatment facilities. Results from the interviews highlighted the value of DRM testing in clinical decision-making and patient reassurance, with a desire among providers and policymakers for a streamlined, potentially decentralized testing process with greater patient and provider “empowerment” to increase comfort with testing protocols. The study highlights the potential of DRM testing to improve patient health outcomes and emphasizes the need for simplified and efficient implementation strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bottlenosed-dolphins-sense-electric-fields-hunt-prey">Fish beware: Bottlenosed dolphins may be able to pick up your heartbeat</a></h4>

              
                <p>To snap up fish, bottlenosed dolphins may rely on more than just sharp sight and sonar detection. The creatures might also pick up on the weak electric pulses prey produce each time their hearts beat or air filters through their gills.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, two bottlenosed dolphins named Dolly and Donna <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.245845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliably sensed faint electric fields on the scale of microvolts</a>, says Tim Hüttner, a sensory biologist formerly affiliated with the University of Rostock in Germany. That puts the marine mammals’ Spidey sense on par with the Guiana dolphin (<em>Sotalia guianensis</em>) and some egg-laying mammals like platypuses.</p>





<p>The ability to detect the electrical signals living things give off is called electroreception. It has been previously documented in fish, amphibians and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-jelly-strong-proton-conductor">sharks</a> <em>(SN: 6/27/16</em>). But it was only in 2011 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-may-sense-body-electric#:~:text=It%20detects%20electrical%20fields%20using,remnants%20of%20long%2Dlost%20whiskers">the Guiana dolphin made the list</a>, as researchers discovered telltale sensory receptors hidden in an organ on the animals’ snouts (<em>SN</em>: 7<em>/27/11</em>).</p>



<p>In 2022, Hüttner and his colleagues&nbsp; identified the same structure in bottlenosed dolphins and confirmed that the creatures could detect electric fields on the scale of 0.5 millivolts per centimeter (or 500 microvolts), similar to those that some large fish and crustaceans emit. The new finding suggests that common bottlenosed dolphins (<em>Tursiops truncatus)</em> can likely make out the much subtler signals emanating off the majority of fish, the team reports November 30 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology.</em></p>



<p>For the new study, the researchers trained Dolly and Donna to position their snouts in a metal apparatus and to swim away if they could sense an electrical impulse delivered to their sensory organs. The dolphins proved sensitive to both direct current and alternating current, two forms of electricity that living things generate. The dolphins excelled, however, at detecting direct current, which produces a steady signal. Donna picked up on fields as low as 5.5 microvolts and Dolly on those of 2.4 microvolts.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A bottlenosed dolphin primed to respond to an electric stimulus places its snout in the experimental apparatus. If the dolphin sensed an electric field, it would swim away quickly. If not, it would stay put for several seconds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The study provides solid evidence for an intriguing theory, says Paul Nachtigall, a marine biologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Scientists have long regarded dolphins’ sensory organs, pits on their snouts, which prior to birth carried whiskers, as vestigial structures. It’s plausible that the organs may have evolved to fit another purpose, he says.</p>



<p>Electroreception may come in handy in situations where sight and echolocation are impaired. For instance, Guiana dolphins are benthic feeders, primarily hunting for food on the seafloor, where the sediment can muck up their senses.</p>



<p>Bottlenosed dolphins don’t hunt the same way but do often reside in murky waters and occasionally stick their heads into the sand to look for fish, in a hunting method called crater feeding. Echolocation stops working close up, but electroreception allows dolphins to spot prey a few centimeters away. The ability may just give the creatures the last push they need to nail a target, Hüttner says.</p>



<p>To test this idea, the team would like to study the dolphins’ electroreception while they are moving, Hüttner says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other species of dolphins have pits on their snouts as well, raising the possibility that electroreception is more widespread, he notes. Given that these creatures adopt different hunting strategies, the ability may serve an additional function: helping dolphins to orient themselves along Earth’s magnetic field lines as they migrate.</p>



<p>“There’s just so much to find out,” Nachtigall says. “This study is just the first page of a book.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinstrap-penguins-sleep-seconds-micronaps">These nesting penguins nod off over 10,000 times a day, for seconds at a time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nesting chinstrap penguins take nodding off to the extreme. The birds briefly dip into a slumber many thousands of times per day, sleeping for only seconds at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The penguins’ breeding colonies are noisy and stressful places, and threats from predatory birds and aggressive neighbor penguins are unrelenting. The extremely disjointed sleep schedule may help <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh0771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the penguins to protect their young while still getting enough shut-eye</a>, researchers report in the Dec. 1 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings add to evidence “that avian sleep can be very different from the sleep of land mammals,” says UCLA neuroscientist Jerome Siegel.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Nearly a decade ago, behavioral ecologist Won Young Lee of the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon noticed something peculiar about how chinstrap penguins (<em>Pygoscelis antarcticus</em>) nesting on Antarctica’s King George Island were sleeping. They would seemingly doze off for very short periods of time in their cacophonous colonies. Then in 2018, Lee learned about <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2016.0082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frigate birds’ ability to steal sleep</a> while airborne on days-long flights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lee teamed up with sleep ecophysiologist Paul-Antoine Libourel of the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France and other researchers to investigate the penguins’ sleep. In 2019, the team studied the daily sleep patterns of 14 nesting chinstrap penguins using data loggers mounted on the birds’ backs. The devices had electrodes surgically implanted into the penguins’ brains for measuring brain activity. Other instruments on the data loggers recorded the animals’ movements and location.</p>

Lee</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nesting penguins had incredibly fragmented sleep patterns, taking over 600 “microsleeps” an hour, each averaging only four seconds, the researchers found. At times, the penguins slept with only half of their brain; the other half stayed awake. All together, the oodles of snoozes added up, providing over 11 hours of sleep for each brain hemisphere across more than 10,000 brief sleeps each day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some marine mammals and other types of birds have strange or restricted sleep patterns too, often when staying alert is important. Dolphins can sleep with half their brain at a time, letting them remain vigilant for over two weeks straight. To stay wary of predators, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/half-asleep-birds-choose-which-half-dozes">mallard ducks can sleep with one half of their brain</a> at a time too (<em>SN: 2/6/99</em>)<em>.</em> And elephant seals dramatically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">reduce their sleeping hours</a> while out at sea (<em>SN: 4/20/23</em>). But the sheer number of microsleeps seen in chinstrap penguins is unprecedented among animals, Lee says.</p>



<p>“It seems that the penguins do not have any time where they decrease their vigilance,” Libourel says. “Just a slight increase of microsleep-bout length around noon.”</p>



<p>The sleep pattern may help the penguins balance the brain’s need for rest with the demands of nesting. Predatory birds like brown skuas (<em>Stercorarius antarcticus</em>) patrol penguin colonies looking to plunder undefended eggs and chicks. “Penguin parents should be vigilant all the time during breeding to keep their offspring safe,” Lee says.&nbsp;There’s also constant commotion and noise in the colony disrupting sleep. Such extremely interrupted sleep may reflect the penguins’ flexibility in handling the stressors of raising chicks.</p>



<p>The many micronaps did appear to be at least partially restorative to their brains, since the studied penguins were able to function well enough to both survive and successfully raise their chicks. It’s unclear if the penguins’ sleep pattern changes after the breeding season.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sleep seems to be very diverse and flexible among species,” Lee says. “I believe that there are still many things unrevealed about animal sleep. By studying their sleep behavior, we can understand how animals have evolved to achieve brain restoration.”</p>

<p>A paper that claimed to have developed a new method to predict acid drainage from mines was not so novel after all, according to one of its authors.</p>



<p>In a series of emails to Retraction Watch, Dulian Zeqiraj of the Polytechnic University of Tirana, Albania, admitted to lifting figures and tables from other articles and said he might also have left some “text as it is in original.”</p>



<p>His paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095758202301011X">A Novel Stochastic Approach for Modeling Acid Mine Drainage in Three Dimensions</a>,” was published November 17 in <em>Process Safety and Environmental Protection</em>, an Elsevier title.</p>



<p>That the article managed to clear peer review is astonishing, said <a href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-muniruzzaman-8760b864">Muhammad Muniruzzaman</a>, a senior scientist at the Geological Survey of Finland in Espoo, who discovered last week that Zeqiraj’s team had plagiarized his work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128324"></span>



<p>At first, Muniruzzaman said, he was pleasantly surprised when he got an email from Google Scholar notifying him that some of his studies had been cited. “That did not last beyond 10 seconds when I started browsing through the paper,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A dozen figures and tables from two of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883292720301682?via%3Dihub">Muniruzzaman’s</a> <a href="https://tupa.gtk.fi/julkaisu/bulletin/bt_408_pages_027_042.pdf">papers</a> appeared, without citation, in the new article as examples ostensibly validating the modeling. And several chunks of text were simply paraphrases of sections in Muniruzzaman’s work.</p>



<p>“I tried to read their paper,” said Muniruzzaman, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Turku. “It doesn&#8217;t really make sense. If you try to link from one section to another, there is no link whatsoever. It&#8217;s almost like gibberish, you feel like it&#8217;s not even human generated.”</p>



<p>He added that one of his coauthors had looked into other publications by Zeqiraj and had found what appeared to be a pair of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590037422000048">duplicate</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666720722000200?via%3Dihub">papers</a>, both crammed with mathematical formulas, in two Elsevier titles.</p>



<p>Zeqiraj said that although he had failed to cite Muniruzzaman’s work appropriately, “essentially my work is true and I can demonstrate the code in MATLAB. At this point I apologize for not mentioning the authors. I can do this now by asking Elsevier to give me the opportunity to cite the figures.”</p>



<p>In a later email, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is true that figures and tables are not cited. As for the text it is true that I have read his paper. <strong>But it works so</strong>: You for example read a paper and take from it the resume. Maybe in may [sic] case I have not made the resume but have left the text as it is in original. As for the plagiarism check it cost about 5 euros to control a paper online, practically nothing. I repeat: I have not used ChatGPT AND I AM OPEN FOR ANY DISCUSSION. Please give me the opportunity to speak with the Professor. But one thing is for sure. I will request the retraction from Elsevier if they don&#8217;t allow me to make the changes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Elsevier how the plagiarized paper could have passed peer review and whether it had gone through a plagiarism check. The publisher told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manuscript was run through iThenticate and had a total similarity index of 28%, with a maximum of 5% from any one source. The manuscript was sent for peer-review, and following revision, was accepted for publication in Process Safety and Environmental Protection.</p>



<p>We are now investigating Dr Muniruzzaman’s concerns and have put the paper, which is an Article-in-Press, on hold until our investigation is complete.</p>

<p>A PhD student in Switzerland who blogged about <a href="https://solalpirelli.github.io/2023/01/25/troubling-acm-venues.html">a series of dubious conferences</a> linked to potential citation fraud is being sued by one of the conference chairs, a professor of computer science, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/flpfY">Shadi Aljawarneh</a> of the Jordan University of Science and Technology, reaped a prodigious number of citations from the conference proceedings, often <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zui-mmVs_7NbDS-yTe1dtorQCAZ7YNjPaOoZ25q7BwE/edit#gid=0">in highly questionable ways</a>.</p>



<p>“Fraud can pay off,” <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/solal.pirelli/?lang=en">Solal Pirelli</a>, a doctoral student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, wrote on his blog in January. “Shadi Aljawarneh has <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/scholar.google.com/citations?user=xm2Hp7YAAAAJ">6082 citations</a> and an h-index of 38 per Google Scholar, above many well-regarded researchers. This probably helped him sit on the editorial board of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/peerj.com/SJawarneh/">PeerJ</a> Computer Science, alongside well-regarded researchers.”</p>



<span id="more-128329"></span>



<p>Aljawarneh, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, also is a visiting professor at Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>The conferences were put together by an organization called the International Association of Researchers (IARES), of which Aljawarneh is a member, under the auspices of two major industry groups, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many conference papers published by these groups have been found to suffer from plagiarism and other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/15/plague-of-anomalies-in-conference-proceedings-hint-at-systemic-issues/">problems hinting at compromised peer review</a>, as we have reported before.</p>



<p>Pirelli, who moonlights as a scientific sleuth, said he decided to blog about his findings after he reported them to the ACM but didn’t hear back. In July, he got a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-letter-redacted.pdf">letter</a> (in French) from a lawyer representing Aljawarneh threatening legal action unless he took down his post. He didn’t.</p>



<p>Then on November 28, Pirelli received a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-appeal-judgment-redacted-new.pdf">judgment</a> (in French) from an appellate court showing that, unbeknownst to him, Aljawarneh’s lawyer had filed defamation charges already in June. </p>



<p>“This guy is suing me because … I uncovered his whole … scam association that was organizing a bunch of conferences that may or may not have even happened,” Pirelli told Retraction Watch. “One of them was supposedly in Kazakhstan in a time when Kazakhstan was closed due to COVID.”</p>



<p>An ACM press officer told us: “As part of ACM’s plagiarism and fraud practices, we do not comment on ongoing investigations.”</p>



<p>From the judgment, Pirelli learned that the charges against him had been dismissed by the public prosecutor. The appellate court, however, decided to let the lawsuit proceed.</p>



<p>The judgment also revealed that, following the blog post, an upcoming conference had been canceled and Aljawarneh had been removed from the editorial board of <em>PeerJ Computer Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s like, you know, yay, I did some sleuthing and I prevented more bullshit from being added to the pile of stuff in computer science, but at the same time I now have somebody suing me,” Pirelli says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, he added, “in Switzerland, truth that is said in the general-public interest is a defense to libel, to slander, so I&#8217;m not too worried about that.”</p>
