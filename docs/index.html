<p>Several studies have tackled the issue of what effect a retracted paper has on a scientist’s reputation and publication record. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/11/07/doing-the-right-thing-scientists-reward-authors-who-report-their-own-errors-says-study/">answer is</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/27/authors-retract-honest-error-say-arent-penalized-result/">by and large</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/">it depends</a>: The contribution the researcher made on the paper, their career stage, the field of study and the reason for the retraction all play a role.</p>



<p>Three researchers from New York University’s campus in Abu Dhabi wanted to&nbsp; better understand how a retraction affects a scientist’s career trajectory and future collaborations. Using the Retraction Watch Database, they looked at papers retracted between 1990 and 2015, and merged that data with Microsoft Academic Graph to generate information on researchers’ pre- and post-retraction publication patterns, as well as their collaboration networks. They also looked at Altmetric scores of retractions to factor in the attention a retraction got.</p>



<p>From that data, they extrapolated if and when researchers with retracted papers left scientific publishing, and looked for trends in researchers’ collaboration networks before and after the retraction.</p>



<span id="more-131856"></span>



<p>Shahan Ali Memon, Kinga Makovi and Bedoor AlShebli wrote the article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02154-0">Characterizing the effect of retractions on publishing careers</a>,” published in April in <em>Nature Human Behavior. </em>We asked them about their research, their findings and the inspiration for the study.</p>



<p>Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Your study looks across all disciplines. What trends did you find? And what differences did you find among the fields of science?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Memon: </strong>Our analysis centered on STEM, particularly the natural sciences, and revealed a consistent pattern across fields: Retracted authors who remained in publishing careers retained and gained more collaborators than their matched counterparts who did not have retractions, with the largest gaps appearing in biology and medicine.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Of the researchers with retractions in your dataset, how many left science? What trends did you find in that data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Memon:</strong> We found that about 46% of the retracted authors leave their academic publishing around the time of the retraction, and that the early-career authors, those whose papers are retracted due to misconduct and plagiarism, and those with higher online attention were more likely to leave when experiencing a retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found that the retracted authors who remained in publishing careers did not suffer a reduction in the size of their collaboration networks post-retraction; instead, they built larger collaborations than their counterparts. However, this increase in size – both retaining more old and creating more new collaborations – was accompanied by qualitative differences, with retaining less senior, less productive and less impactful collaborators, which was balanced by gaining more impactful ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that these are the broad contours of the results and rely on averages using all fields and academic ages of authors. When we disaggregate these analyses by, say, seniority of retracted authors, we don’t find these patterns in all cases, but overall, these trends describe the results in broad strokes.</p>



<p><strong>RW: How do you account for the growth of collaboration networks for researchers who have retracted their work and continued to publish?  We have written in the past about “</strong><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/25/science-self-refereed/"><strong>trust dividends</strong></a><strong>” that seem to accrue to researchers who retract for honest error. Is the same thing at work here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Makovi</strong>: This is a great question, which our data can not address directly, and where qualitative work and future research would be helpful. Here are two hypotheses, which address this question from either the supply or the demand side of collaborators. </p>



<p>On the demand side, retracted authors might change their strategy in seeking collaborators. Specifically, prior research has documented that having a retraction might have a stigmatizing effect, and as we and others have shown, has negative impacts on various career outcomes. To counteract these, some retracted authors might act particularly agentically seeking collaborators to increase the volume and impact of their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The supply side may be how the environment around the retracted author changes: Senior colleagues in one’s department might become especially agentic in bringing retracted authors on as collaborators, especially if their retractions were due to a mistake, and/or if the retracted author experienced a retraction early on during their career. They might broker connections to help them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these remain hypotheses that we are unable to test with the data at hand. There could be other explanations as well, therefore, we would take this explanation with a heap of salt, as it points beyond the analysis we conducted in the paper.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Were you able to tease out whether specific authors in your dataset had responsibility for the factors that led to retraction? And were you able to observe and study a “bystander effect”?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Makovi: </strong>This is an excellent question, and I wish we had a straightforward answer. As part of our analysis we trained a large group of students to identify and hand-code retraction notices to categorize retraction reasons, and collect other data, for instance if the retraction was led by authors or journal editors. In the process we have read many retraction notices ourselves. It is a rare occasion that the notice doles out responsibility to specific authors. We only found a handful where this was the case. </p>



<p>What we have done is a disaggregation of our findings by author position, separating first, last and middle authors, which correlate with the typical roles in a paper, but we would not find it convincing to base “responsibility” on this. This, again, is an aspect where more qualitative work would come in handy.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Your study focuses on papers retracted between 1990 and 2015, and includes data up through 2021. Since then, the number of papers has gone up and so has the retraction rate. How do you think things may have changed since your analysis and since the cutoff of your datasets?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> We focused on this period to allow for a long enough observation window, up to five years after retraction, to assess career outcomes like collaboration patterns and attrition. Since then, several dynamics may have changed. For one, there’s been increased awareness and transparency around research integrity, and platforms like Retraction Watch have expanded coverage, possibly shifting the norms around retraction and its stigma. At the same time, with the rise of open science and preprints, new challenges around reproducibility and misconduct have also emerged. Not to mention the newly available AI tools that might shape how authors write, cite and conduct research more generally. These changes could affect both the frequency of retractions and how they impact scientists’ careers.</p>



<p>That said, while the scale has grown, we believe that many of the structural dynamics we document, like career attrition or collaboration loss, might still hold today. We hope future research, using newer data, will build on our findings to track how these patterns evolve over time.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Two of you (AlShebli and Makovi) </strong><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/21/nature-communications-retracts-much-criticized-paper-on-mentorship/"><strong>had a paper retracted</strong></a><strong>, which you mention in a note at the end of the paper. How did that experience inform this study? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> Yes, two of us experienced a shared retraction firsthand, and we felt it was important to be transparent about that in the paper. That experience gave us a personal understanding of how painful and disorienting the process can be. We were very fortunate to have strong support from our colleagues and peers, which helped us recover and continue our research. But our experience, as the data shows, could have been very different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That contrast really motivated this study. We wanted to understand how retractions affect scientists more broadly, especially early-career researchers, and to highlight the structural factors that can either mitigate or exacerbate the impact. Ultimately, our hope is to inform an evidence-based approach to research integrity that is perhaps more compassionate.</p>



<p><strong>RW:  How can scientists help early-career researchers move beyond a retraction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> Retractions are a necessary self-correcting mechanism of science and scientific progress. They are meted out collectively, and as an institution, we do not believe that retractions should be done away with. The challenge lies in communicating what they mean to the public, and to fellow scientists. Our findings highlight just how vulnerable early-career researchers are in the wake of a retraction. They face higher rates of career attrition which can derail promising trajectories.</p>



<p>One possible takeaway is that institutions, funders, and senior collaborators need to be more proactive in distinguishing between culpability and proximity. When early-career scientists are caught up in retractions they didn’t cause, they need support systems, such as mentorship, opportunities to re-establish their credibility, and clear institutional statements where appropriate. Transparency in responsibility and a culture that allows for recovery, rather than guilt by association, are crucial to protecting the next generation of researchers.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Manal Helal will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;When the Robotic Maths Tutor is Wrong - Can Children Identify Mistakes Generated by ChatGPT?&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This study delves into integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT-
powered robots, as educational tools in primary school mathematics. Against the backdrop
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating educational settings, our
investigation focuses on the response of young learners to errors made by these LLM-
powered robots. Employing a user study approach, we conducted an experiment using the
Pepper robot in a primary school classroom environment, where 77 primary school students
from multiple grades (Year 3 to 5) took part in interacting with the robot. Our
statistically significant findings highlight that most students, regardless of the year
group, could discern between correct and incorrect responses generated by the robots,
demonstrating a promising level of understanding and engagement with the AI-driven
educational tool. Additionally, we observed that students' correctness in answering the
Maths questions significantly influenced their ability to identify errors, underscoring
the importance of prior knowledge in verifying LLM responses and detecting errors.
Additionally, we examined potential confounding factors such as age and gender. Our
findings underscore the importance of gradually integrating AI-powered educational tools
under the guidance of domain experts following thorough verification processes. Moreover,
our study calls for further research to establish best practices for implementing AI-
driven pedagogical approaches in educational settings.</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal is investigating a paper by a controversial author after a Retraction Watch inquiry about the article. The article concluded that “placebo effects have a significant impact on observed outcomes” in both placebo and treatment groups in clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The senior author of the paper is Harald Walach, whose name <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=harald+walach">may be familiar</a>. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/02/journal-retracts-paper-claiming-two-deaths-from-covid-19-vaccination-for-every-three-prevented-cases/">one paper</a>, now retracted, Walach and his coauthors claimed COVID-19 vaccines killed two people for every three deaths they prevented. In a different <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/16/jama-journal-retracts-paper-on-masks-for-children/">paper</a>, also retracted, Walach and his colleagues claimed children’s masks trap carbon dioxide; they later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/01/one-would-not-want-to-tarnish-another-journal-why-a-republished-covid-19-masks-study-doesnt-say-it-was-retracted/">republished</a> the article in a different journal. He <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWalach%252c%2bHarald">lost two papers</a> and a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/07/university-terminates-affiliation-with-researcher-who-had-paper-on-covid-19-vaccines-retracted-as-mask-study-comes-under-scrutiny/">university affiliation</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of his latest papers, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435624004141#bib11">Treatment effects in pharmacological clinical randomized controlled trials are mainly due to placebo</a>,” appeared online December 27 in the <em>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131842"></span>



<p>Walach’s group analyzed 30 clinical trials for each of five conditions — osteoarthritis, depression, migraines, sleep disorders and irritable bowel syndrome — and analyzed the improvement in both the placebo and treatment groups. The authors conclude “that the placebo-effect is the major driver of treatment effects in clinical trials that alone explains 69% of the variance.”</p>



<p>Stephen Rhodes, a researcher at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Ohio, criticized the study in a <a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(25)00055-1/abstract">letter to the editor in February</a>, citing a “number of errors that lead to some sweeping conclusions.” In the letter, Rhodes wrote those leaps “reflect a misunderstanding of what a ‘treatment effect’ is,” noting that in a placebo-controlled trial, the measure can’t be “due to placebo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked <a href="https://gidmk.medium.com/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Gideon+Meyerowitz-Katz">a sleuth</a> and research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia, to take a look at the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz called the work “bizarre” and told us the results seem to indicate “simply being in a clinical trial is the main component of healing.” The studies included in the analysis had “very low average treatment effects,” meaning they didn’t show a huge benefit for the interventions tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The clinical trials included had another issue: one was <a href="https://www.jrheum.org/content/45/12/1713.2">retracted in 2018</a> after journal editors realized&nbsp; all its participants had been enrolled and randomized <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/18/this-is-something-that-we-have-never-seen-before-in-any-study-group-loses-two-more-papers/">on the same day</a>. “I do not think that a meta-analysis which includes work retracted nearly a decade ago can be relied on as evidence,” Meyerowitz-Katz said.</p>



<p>When he attempted to replicate the methods, Meyerowitz-Katz wasn’t able to do so. The researchers claimed to have taken one of the formulas from a <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-8-52">previous paper</a>; however, the referenced paper used a regression model, and the formula was not listed, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz also pointed out a potential undisclosed conflict of interest. Walach runs the <a href="https://chs-institute.org/">Change Health Science Institute</a>, which <a href="https://chs-institute.org/news/50-verschwoerungstheorie.html">promotes</a> “homeopathy and various COVID-19 conspiracy theories,” he said.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="417" height="323" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-122498" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg 417w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach-300x232.jpeg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Harald Walach</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Walach, in response to Meyerowitz-Katz’s comments, called the term “conspiracy theory” “an analytically void terminology, because it is dependent on the political mainstream view, which is in turn dependent on political power.”</p>



<p>He did not respond to any of Meyerowitz-Katz’s critiques of the paper.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz touched on many of the same issues Rhodes had raised in his letter. Rhodes questioned if the results really suggest there is “limited space for effects due to pharmacological substances,” quoting from the original paper. He also wrote by weighing clinical trials by study size rather than standard deviation, the researchers are “throwing information away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers responded to Rhodes in their own letter to the editor, conceding they should have used “treatment response” rather than “treatment effect” in the title “to avoid confusion.” The authors also argued they had demonstrated “whenever a treatment is very effective, so is the improvement in the placebo group and vice versa.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch sent questions to the <em>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</em>, including the above critiques of the paper. <a href="https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/tricco-andrea-catherine/">Andrea Tricco</a>, the co-editor-in-chief of the publication, told us the journal was investigating the concerns and was “treating this as a matter of highest urgency.”</p>



<p>Stefan Schmidt, the corresponding author of the paper, told us his group has been asked to give “a detailed reply within 30 days.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bioengineered-kbie20.v016.i01.cover_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="259" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bioengineered-kbie20.v016.i01.cover_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131832" style="width:200px"/></a></figure></div>


<p><em>Bioengineered </em>has lost its spot in Clarivate’s Web of Science index, as of its April update. The journal has been working to overcome a flood of paper mill activity, but sleuths have questioned why hundreds of papers with potentially manipulated images have still not been retracted.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Taylor &amp; Francis, which publishes the journal, said it has taken action against the paper mill; the journal has retracted 86 papers since January 2022. They are “disappointed” at the delisting decision, the spokesperson said. The journal now faces up to a two-year embargo before it can rejoin the citation index.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/kbie20"><em>Bioengineered</em></a><em> </em>publishes bioengineering and biotechnology research. In 2021, journal editors launched an investigation when submissions spiked and several authors of submitted and accepted articles asked for authorship changes – both hallmarks of paper mill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131831"></span>



<p>The probe looked at hundreds of papers and put in place several measures to strengthen editorial processes, such as asking authors to submit raw data, enhanced vetting of peer reviewers and editor training, according to <a href="https://insights.taylorandfrancis.com/research-impact/dealing-paper-mills-bioengineered">a June 2023 post about the incident</a> on the publisher’s blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in late March, a group of sleuths led by Rene Aquarius, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, posted&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21267">a preprint at arXiv.org</a>&nbsp;that found hundreds of papers with questionable images remain unmarked. The analysis suggested actions taken by the publisher “appear to have stemmed the tide of new paper mill submission, but a backlog of contaminated articles remains in the literature,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its latest update, released April 21, Clarivate delisted <em>Bioengineered </em>because it no longer met “one or more of our 24 quality criteria,” a Clarivate spokesperson said by email. They declined to give more detail about which quality criteria.</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis is still “actively investigating a large number of articles published in&nbsp;<em>Bioengineered&nbsp;</em>that are suspected to be the product of paper mill activity,” the publisher’s spokesperson said. In addition to the retracted articles, hundreds more are currently marked as “under investigation,” they said, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Alongside this activity, with the support of the Editor and Board, we have made a range of editorial and process changes to the journal which, as acknowledged by the sleuths, have allowed us to proactively detect and prevent the publication of a sizeable amount of further paper mill content. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Twelve of the retraction notices <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/kbie20/16/1?nav=tocList">in the latest issue</a> state:&nbsp; “Since publication, significant concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data and reported results in the article.” And 11 of those add: “When approached for an explanation, the authors did not provide their original data or any necessary supporting information.”</p>



<p><em>Bioengineered </em>was notified a year ago that it could be delisted. Typically journals spend around six weeks “on hold” before a delisting decision. But this timeline can be extended depending on the nature and complexity of the case and the extent to which publishers engage with the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In cases in which publishers engage with us as per our&nbsp;<a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-appeals/">policy</a>, we will consider allowing a journal to remain on hold for longer to allow time for publishers to conduct their own investigations and take corrective action should they decide to do so,” the Clarivate spokesperson said. Clarivate expects “these actions to be completed within 12 months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the sleuths found issues in their analysis, Aquarius said he finds it “strange” the journal “apparently didn’t do a good enough job to be listed again” despite having been given a year to take action against the paper mill. “What did they miss?” he said.</p>



<p>Clarivate’s policy means <em>Bioengineered</em> has to wait two years before it can be resubmitted to Web of Science, the Clarivate spokesperson said. But Clarivate may consider reducing the embargo period for “responsible publishers who proactively investigate breaches in research integrity and correct the scholarly record in a timely and transparent manner.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://neurofrontiers.blog/when-it-comes-to-brains-size-doesnt-matter-much/">When it comes to brains, size doesn’t matter much</a></h4>

              
                <p style="font-size:12px"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="http://instagram.com/ionut.stefan.92ish">Ionut Stefan</a></p>



<p>It all started from a reasonable assumption: bigger brains pack more <a href="https://neurofrontiers.blog/neuron-structure-and-function/">neurons</a>, and more neurons make one smarter, ergo bigger brain = smarter cookie. But if there&#8217;s one thing brains love, it&#8217;s nonlinearities (to be read as &#8220;freaking messes!&#8221;). To understand what that means, we&#8217;ll talk about how brains of different sizes are structured, and if it&#8217;s not size, what features actually make them smart.</p>



<p>We can approach this discussion at two levels: between species and within species. At the first level, brain size varies dramatically (imagine mouse vs. elephant), giving us a coarse-grained understanding of why size alone doesn&#8217;t explain intelligence. At the second one, we&#8217;ll look at comparisons between people, where the differences in brain size are much smaller, but the data is richer, giving us a more fine-grained picture of what might be going on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is intelligence</h2>



<p>In both cases, we need to define what &#8220;smart&#8221; means. Intelligence, like a lot of other higher-order cognitive concepts, suffers from definition fuzziness: there are a bunch of ways to define it, and if we don&#8217;t clarify this upfront, we risk talking past each other. For this article, we&#8217;ll focus on <em>general intelligence</em>, or mental ability.</p>



<p>Another point to consider is that we&#8217;ll be talking about both humans and other species.<br>For all of them, general intelligence includes the ability to solve problems and come up with novel solutions, the capacity to learn and change one&#8217;s behavior based on experience, and the ability to think abstractly.</p>



<p>In humans, however, intelligence tests obviously rely heavily on verbal ability, and many <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108635462.003">studies</a> use something called the <em>g</em> factor. This variable summarizes positive correlations between different cognitive tasks, and is used to reflect something we&#8217;ve observed empirically: that people who do well on one cognitive test usually do well on others too.</p>



<p>There have been attempts to use the <em>g</em> factor for quantifying intelligence in other animals, but as you can imagine, the lack of verbal ability makes standardized inter-species comparisons extremely challenging. Instead, researchers rely on a set of indirect tests. These let them measure things such as learning and problem-solving, memory capacity, or even the ability for self-recognition (using the mirror test).</p>



<p>The lack of standardization makes it difficult to say with certainty that, for example, a crow is more intelligent than a baboon. Yes, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt3718">crows</a> can do geometry and <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hj3m6">baboons</a> apparently can&#8217;t, but is that all it takes to be smart? Still, imperfect as they are, these measures allow us to challenge the assumption that bigger brains are smarter: if a crow, with a much smaller brain than a baboon&#8217;s, can do geometry, clearly there&#8217;s more at play than sheer brain size.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The comparison between species</h2>



<p>But let&#8217;s back up a bit. In the section above, it seemed reasonable to define &#8220;smart&#8221;, but what if I told you we also need a definition for &#8220;brain size&#8221;? It might seem a bit ridiculous, but there really is more than one <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0180">interpretation</a> for this term. We saw the first one in the crow-baboon example, where we introduced <strong><em>absolute</em></strong> brain size. The problem with this is that absolute brain size correlates strongly with body size: larger animals have larger brains. And we don&#8217;t even need to compare crows and baboons, we can compare ourselves to whales and elephants. Even though they&#8217;re quite intelligent animals, they&#8217;re still not exactly on our level. So <em>absolute brain size</em> is not a good indicator of intelligence.</p>



<p>Another way to define brain size would be <strong><em>relative</em></strong> to the body weight. Take humans and whales again: the brain of a human weighs about 1.5 kg, and that of a whale about 9 kg. In terms of absolute brain size, whales win hands down. But if we look at brain weight as a percentage of the body weight, we get about 2.5% in humans and a measly 0.02% in whales. We now have a data point indicating that a species with a higher relative brain size is also more intelligent. We can now expand this to as many species as possible and see if it still holds. It&#8217;s not a big surprise that it doesn&#8217;t, but I bet you won&#8217;t guess which animal breaks the pattern. It&#8217;s the Etruscan shrew (<a href="https://featuredcreature.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen+shot+2010-11-06+at+3.44.30+PM2.png">this</a> little guy), with a brain weight of about 0.1 g and a body weight of only 2 g, giving us a 5% value, double that of humans!</p>



<p>Alright, that&#8217;s another simple explanation gone down the drain. Back to the drawing board it is. We said that larger bodies go hand in hand with larger brains. Now, if intelligence didn&#8217;t play any role at all, we could assume that the brain is simply increasing in size because it needs to manage a larger body. In that case, if we knew an animal&#8217;s body size, we could mathematically predict what its absolute brain size should be. If we saw any increase in size on top of that, we could only assume that&#8217;s due to the extra brain being used for intelligence. That&#8217;s the simplest explanation for what scientists termed the third way of defining brain size, the <strong><em>encephalization quotient</em></strong> (EQ). As you might already guess, that didn&#8217;t work out very well either. Humans came up pretty well on this metric, but chimpanzees, gorillas, and whales, animals which we know are fairly smart, scored quite low EQs. More attempts were made to improve the EQ calculation formula. These only succeeded in making it more complicated, so I won&#8217;t bore you with the details. Bottom line is, the idea that brain size is related to intelligence across species was examined from multiple angles and it always came up short.</p>



<p>But why? Why? Why?</p>



<p>Well, for a bunch of reasons. Let&#8217;s start with our first assumption: &#8220;bigger brains pack more neurons&#8221;. Remember that? Across species, that&#8217;s not always true. What&#8217;s more, which brain regions have more neurons is also very important. As an example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2014.00046">elephants</a> have 3 times (!) more neurons than humans. But in elephants, a lot of these neurons are found in the cerebellum, not in the cortex (presumably to control the fine-grained movements of the trunk), the neurons themselves are larger, and their number per cubic millimeter is much lower (only 6.000-7.000 neurons/mm3, compared to 25.000-30.000 neurons/mm3 in humans).</p>



<p>In contrast, although crows have tiny brains compared both to humans and elephants, their neuronal density is nothing short of impressive: in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.25298">nidopallidum</a>, a region used for executive tasks, it can reach about 130.000-160.000 neurons/mm3. With such numbers, it&#8217;s no wonder crows can rival and even outperform some primates on cognitive tasks.</p>



<p>However, as we&#8217;ll see more clearly in the next section, the number, density, or location of neurons aren&#8217;t the only factors that matter. How they are connected and how fast information can travel between them also play important roles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The comparison within species</h2>



<p>The comparisons above showed us that, <em>across</em> species, brain size isn&#8217;t a good predictor of intelligence. Brains don&#8217;t just scale up, but some of their properties, such as neuron density or size, also change between species. But within species, and more specifically between people, we don&#8217;t expect such significant differences. That&#8217;s why, before diving into more complex structural features, it&#8217;s worth asking again how the relation between brain size and intelligence holds up in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108635462">humans</a>.</p>



<p>It turns out that it works slightly better. There is a small, positive correlation between brain size and the <em>g</em> factor. The correlation coefficient <em>r</em> (which goes from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfectly correlated, 0 meaning no correlation, and -1 perfectly anticorrelated) sits in the range of 0.2-0.3. It&#8217;s not much, but it&#8217;s honest work. What&#8217;s more, separating the brain into gray and white matter and correlating their volumes with intelligence shows that gray matter is the driver of this effect. But even so, this only explains a small part of the picture. So… where is the rest coming from?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already hinted above that it has to do with connections and information speed. In more concrete terms, we know the brain is basically a network of neurons. And the information-processing capacity of this network is what translates into intelligence. Unfortunately, studying large networks like the brain and how their properties relate to constructs such as intelligence tends to be a bit…<em>complicated</em>. That&#8217;s why, even though gathering relevant data in humans is much easier compared to other species, the full picture is still quite murky.</p>



<p>What we know so far is that networks connected more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1443-09.2009">efficiently</a> appear to correlate with higher intelligence and that good myelination is important for cognitive processing speed. In terms of theories, perhaps the most well-established one is the parieto-frontal integration theory, which tells us that a network formed by lateral frontal and parietal areas is highly relevant for intelligence. However, newer studies suggest it&#8217;s not just these regions, but how the entire brain is structured, that determines intelligence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To sum up</h2>



<p>Brains are complicated. And although it seems easy to assume that larger brains with more neurons can do more, nature doesn&#8217;t agree. There still a lot of work needed to determine what makes a brain smart. But so far we&#8217;ve learned that where those neurons are situated and how efficiently information can flow between them trumps simple upscaling. Maybe something to keep in mind for other so-called &#8220;brain-like&#8221; systems.</p>

<p>A Sage journal that holds the distinction of highest number of retracted articles in the Retraction Watch Database likely made in excess of $400,000 in revenue from those papers, by our calculations.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/17/sage-journal-intelligent-fuzzy-systems-retracts-678-more-papers/">We reported in April</a> that the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (JIFS)</em> had retracted 1,561 articles as part of a cleanup operation on likely paper mill activity. The journal, which Sage acquired in November 2023 when it bought IOS Press, had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">previously retracted</a> a batch of 49 articles in October 2021. That brings its retraction total up to 1,610.</p>



<p>Commenters on the April article pointed out the journal charges a fee for all accepted papers; separate fees apply for open access. We followed up on that with a few questions for Sage.</p>



<span id="more-131821"></span>



<p>“Publication charges apply to a very small number of our journals,” Laura West, corporate communications &amp; public affairs manager for Sage, told us by email. “These fees are typically in place either because the journal was acquired with an existing publication charge model or, in a few cases, due to society requirements.” She pointed us to Sage’s <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/page-and-publication-charges-0">page and publication charges policy</a>, which includes a list of the journals charging a fee.</p>



<p>The current publication fee for <em>JIFS</em> is €300 / US$300. We found previous years’ publication charges on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Putting that information together with the number of retracted articles by publication year means the journal made $427,850 off of papers it later retracted.</p>

<p>West pointed out that “Most of the fees related to these articles were collected before the journal was acquired by Sage and under the previous publisher’s policies and procedures.”</p>



<p>We asked whether Sage has considered donating the revenue from retracted papers to charity, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/29/publisher-donating-author-fees-from-retracted-articles-to-charity/">as IOP Publishing has done</a>. Its donations go to <a href="https://www.research4life.org/">Research4Life</a>, which provides low- and middle-income countries with online access to academic and professional peer-reviewed content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>West didn’t address donations specifically. She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The fees collected since coming to Sage have contributed to investments into tools and processes to strengthen research integrity and uphold standards across our journals. For example, on transition to Sage, we made investments to strengthen editorial and research integrity processes on JIFS and to curate its archive, including the investigation we recently completed. We’ve also recently expanded our support of Research4Life <a href="https://www.sagepub.com/docs/default-source/corp-comms/sage_independence_with_impact_report_2024.pdf?sfvrsn=d1917b03_1">amongst other annual contributions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another commenter pointed out <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/IFS">the editorial board page</a> for the journal was empty. West told us the publisher “is in advanced discussions with a new editor,” and will work with them to reform the editorial board this year. “In the meantime, the journal is being managed by Sage staff who are PhD level subject experts,” she said.</p>
