<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-16-at-4.07.08%E2%80%AFPM-768x305.png" alt="" style="width:300px"/></figure></div>


<p>Two Swedish agencies have closed their investigations into a high-profile research center at Chalmers University of Technology that was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/16/lack-of-permits-selective-data-halt-research-at-swedish-prosthetics-research-center/">suspended last year</a> for “shortcomings in the operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Center for Bionics and Pain Research (CBPR), known for its work on restoring limb function, was scrutinized and ultimately shut down <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/research-at-the-centre-for-bionics-and-pain-research-is-suspended-and-deficiencies-are-reported-to-regulatory-authorities/">after a university investigation last April found</a> scientists at the center conducted research without sufficient permits, had inadequate quality assurance processes and handled sensitive personal data poorly, and found “shortcomings” in legal agreements for the center’s operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, subsequent investigations by the country’s Medical Products Agency, which regulates medical devices and clinical trials, and the Ethics Review Appeal Board have ended, with both agencies declining to pursue further action.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132213"></span>



<p>“[Chalmers] found no punctual evidence of misdoing, but only what they conveniently thought could be wrong, but not factually wrong,” Max Ortiz-Catalán, the founder and former director of CBPR, wrote to <em>Retraction Watch</em>. “No research was conducted purposely wrong.” </p>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán left the center in 2023 amid what a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/16/lack-of-permits-selective-data-halt-research-at-swedish-prosthetics-research-center/">university representative described as “issues in his leadership</a>.” In his email, he also criticized the university for failing to consult the researchers involved or provide an opportunity to respond during its internal review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Chalmers’ senior leadership has “full confidence” in the work of the ethics committee that ran the review, and contends that the committee spoke to “a number of the researchers involved,” according to Anders Palmqvist, Chalmers’ vice president of research and sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chalmers declined to comment on the Swedish agencies’ decisions and has closed its own investigation into CBPR.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Chalmers’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/C-2024-0495-EOK-rapport.pdf">initial review</a> into the center examined 50 publications linked to Ortiz-Catalán, finding 30 ethical approvals. But the university had noted it was “generally a problem” to link the approvals to individual studies because the publications did not cite registration numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether the papers had appropriate ethical approval was the main focus of the subsequent investigation by the Swedish Ethics Review Appeal Board. The board brought in Kjell Asplund, a professor emeritus of medicine and a former scientific secretary of the body, to evaluate 15 publications Chalmers had reported as suspect, but in his view, hadn’t been “really scrutinized” until then, he told us in an email.</p>



<p>Of the nine studies that fell under Sweden’s Ethics Review Act – which requires prior approval for research that may physically or mentally affect human subjects – eight had obtained the necessary approval. But according to Asplund, the documentation of that approval was either “absent or very confusing.” In some cases, incorrect registration numbers were cited. “It seems likely that this contributed to the suspicion of fraud,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán said he and his colleagues published about 60 peer-reviewed articles with many ethical approvals involved. “It&#8217;s not surprising that such an amount of work can be confusing for an external person,” he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asplund identified one “questionable” study for which no ethics approval had been obtained. Whether this was a violation of the ethics act would depend on whether the non-invasive device used in the research was intended to physically or mentally affect the participants. “I left that to the law experts,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ethics Review Appeal Board <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqiwjdyunYUHWxUovcuV6HiwEBQbMlNI/view?usp=sharing">ultimately concluded</a> none of the studies in question violated ethics law. “Either the studies had ethical review approval, or such approval was not required,” the chairman, Anita Linder, told us in an email. Linder continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It should be noted that the Appeals Board only dealt with the issue of potential violations of the Ethical Review Act. Whether the research at the Centre violates other legislation or if there have been deviations from good research practices is not within the Appeals Board&#8217;s mandate to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Chalmers’ initial review had also located only one regulatory permit from the Swedish Medical Products Agency since CBPR was established, dated June 20, 2023. The review noted that Ortiz-Catalán and his colleagues had presented research results related to the device in question at a conference in Colombia on June 4-8, 2023 — suggesting a clinical trial had taken place ahead of the necessary approvals for the medical device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This became the subject of two separate investigations by the Swedish Medical Products Agency. In a decision last August, the agency found that the clinical trial had not yet begun, and the investigator in question – Ortiz-Catalán – had since left the institution. With no evidence that the trial had begun before approval, the agency <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TyhZ0HWE9F7R8rYWupPzT147-0g7Nbb4/view?usp=sharing">chose not to investigate further</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that decision was made public, the agency then received more reports suggesting other potentially unauthorized clinical trials had taken place at CBPR. In a second review, the agency took a closer look at the conference presentation, ultimately finding that those results “appeared to be from another study.”</p>



<p>The Medical Products Agency also identified another six studies with ethical approval that had not been reported to the Medical Products Agency — despite their likely needing such review before commencing. Whether those studies had begun, or were ever completed, remained unclear, the Medical Products Agency stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Medical Products Agency <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KNJ7Ba1MoRn48m896PkWMjDKuIrOW5PT/view?usp=sharing">ultimately wrote off the case</a>, citing the fact CBPR had ceased operations and no new studies were under way. Representatives from the agency have not responded to requests for comment on the decision. This month, drug inspector Daniel Bjermo <a href="https://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/lakemedelsverket-lagger-ner-arende-om-chalmersforskning-.9565ac1b-f8b5-406a-94f0-426c04bd82b2">told a local Swedish paper</a> the agency “was not justified to investigate the matter further as the desired effect had already been achieved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked whether he felt the Medical Products Agency’s finding was a full vindication, Ortiz-Catalán told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Again, no evidence has been ever presented that there were any violations to the law regarding medical devices. However, Chalmers and the media ran a story of systematic wrongdoing judging us before anything was proven, and not a single case was actually proven. The damage is done and those who caused it, including the media, know what they did. I need no vindication. Hundreds of people have benefited from my work… and that&#8217;s what matters to me and what I continue doing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When we reported on this story last year, Ortiz-Catalán was working at a bionics institute in Australia. Now, he says he is doing humanitarian work in Ukraine and continues to be “engaged in research projects around the world.” </p>



<p>He specifically took issue with our coverage last year because we reported on Chalmers’ findings, which he says have not been substantiated by external agencies. He said our article caused harm to his students and staff at CBPR. “Please consider the evidence instead of unsubstantiated rumors,” he wrote. </p>



<p>When asked, he did not explicitly deny there was any wrongdoing at the center, but said no research was conducted “purposely wrong” and that “no other academic research group in Sweden had done more to maintain compliance with the law” for medical devices. </p>

<p>“Not a single case was proven so neither by Chalmers nor the national agencies who assessed the matter,” he said. “If violations have been happening systematically, there should be tons of evidence, right?”</p>



<p>The original investigation had also found that the center had no person in charge of compliance, and that personal data had been handled poorly. These points do not seem to have been addressed by either Swedish agency, and Ortiz-Catalán continues to maintain there’s “no evidence” for these points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the finding of shortcomings in legal agreements, “what are the ethical or legal violations here exactly?” he asked.&nbsp; “More importantly, how does this relate to scientific misconduct? These are all empty and at best inconsequential allegations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palmqvist, Chalmers’ VP of research, told <em>Retraction Watch</em> the relevant agencies “have made their decisions,” and the university would not be reviewing or commenting on the decisions. Chalmers has closed its own investigation into CBPR and does not anticipate any further decisions from external authorities, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/03/guest-post-nih-funded-replication-studies-reproducibility-crisis-preclinical-research/">recent guest post</a> on Retraction Watch by Mike Rossner takes a peculiar view of reproducibility. Rossner sets the stage talking about the executive order on “restoring gold standard science” and a call from National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya for replication studies to determine “which NIH-funded research findings are reliable.” Then Dr. Rossner takes this position: “Conducting systematic replication studies of pre-clinical research is neither an effective nor an efficient strategy to achieve the objective of identifying reliable research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If <em>systematic</em> in the above statement means &#8220;universal,&#8221; then, of course, that is impossible, considering the millions of preclinical papers published every year. If, however, <em>systematic </em>means choosing which studies to replicate and then replicating them, then, this is, indeed possible. And this is exactly what<a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/april-21-2025-agenda"> Bhattacharya&#8217;s statement</a> calls for: &#8220;<em>identification</em> of <em>key scientific claims</em>&#8221; that require replication. As explained below, this approach can, indeed, work in an effective and efficient manner, especially if it primarily focuses on new manuscript submissions.</p>



<span id="more-132196"></span>



<p>Let’s also remind ourselves: The reproducibility crisis is not a novel concept. In his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/505612a">famous “Roadmap” published in 2014</a>, then-NIH Director Francis Collins laid it out plainly:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Preclinical research, especially work that uses animal models, seems to be the area that is currently most susceptible to reproducibility issues. …. Some irreproducible reports are probably the result of coincidental findings that happen to reach statistical significance, coupled with publication bias. … Still, there remains a troubling frequency of published reports that claim a significant result, but fail to be reproducible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nature</em> even reported that NIH officials were “considering a requirement that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/500014a">independent labs validate the results of important preclinical studies</a> as a condition of receiving grant funding.” Thus, replication studies have been frequently discussed and advocated over the last decade. And there was always <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/500014a">some</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.17354">pushback</a>, as well. But this time, it feels different to me: today’s pushback may be less about the <em>substance</em> of the proposals and more about political dislike of those proposing them.</p>



<p>Dr. Rossner underestimates how serious the reproducibility problem truly is. He begins with a “folklore number” of 50% irreproducibility, jumps to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen’s</a> infamous reports claiming 66% and 89% irreproducibility,<strong> </strong>then circles back to 50% based on <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71601">a more recent study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bayer number, however, isn’t 66%; it’s much worse. Researchers at the company found that in only 7% of replication studies were the main datasets reproducible, and in just 4% was&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the data reproducible. The article says that in “~20–25% of the projects were the relevant published data completely in line with our in-house findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Errington study Dr. Rossner cites found that for the “positive findings” in original papers, 60% of them could not be reproduced. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01266-x">recently completed replication study in Brazil</a> produced a 21% rate of replication. And yet, Dr. Rossner puts the word “crisis” in scare quotes — as though the problem might not be real — and suggests irreproducibility is just part of science being a “self-correcting” enterprise. That might have flown in the 1980s, but today, it sounds outdated.</p>



<p>In the next part of his essay, he outlines his arguments for why replication studies — especially NIH-funded ones — are not the answer to the replication crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Argument #1: It’s Not Feasible</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Rossner points out that over a million scientific articles are published annually. But again, nobody is proposing to replicate <em>all of them</em>. The idea is to identify high-impact, influential claims and replicate&nbsp;<em>those</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Argument #2: Who Will Select What to Replicate?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Rossner notes that &#8220;someone who does careless work is not likely to volunteer to have it replicated.&#8221; No kidding. But that is not an argument against replication studies. That would be like arguing we shouldn’t arrest criminals because they won’t cooperate with the prosecution.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We know that many authors resist replication. Errington&#8217;s Reproducibility Project in cancer biology and the Brazilian replication project both showed how uncooperative the original authors can be. But that’s just another reason to advocate replication, not to abandon it. That’s why I’ve proposed <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/unreliable/9780231216241/">in my book</a> so-called “replication supplements”: a system where submitted manuscripts to top journals would include a key finding replicated independently, blinded and randomized, by a separate laboratory. The replication would be appended to the main article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Journals –– perhaps starting with the big ones, <em>Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS</em> –– could easily adopt this any day. But, once again, there is pushback. Here are some of the objections I’ve heard so far:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“It would delay publication.”</em> But not necessarily — replication can be built into the project timeline.</li>



<li><em>“It would cost too much.” </em>But not really. A flagship paper can easily cost $500,000–$1 million. Spending <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18938#:~:text=Repetitive%20strain,$40%2C000%20per%20experiment%20on%20average.">$40,000</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plan-replicate-50-high-impact-cancer-papers-shrinks-just-18#:~:text=Costs%20rose%20and%20delays%20ensued,available%20from%20the%20original%20labs.">60,000</a> for third-party validation of a selected key experiment is reasonable.</li>



<li><em>“There is no incentive for the replicator group.”</em> It depends. A replicator CRO would get paid, a replicator academic group could get authorship.&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>“All journals would have to do it together.”</em> Why? One brave journal could start and lead.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>My suggestion is that such a supplement shouldn’t be mandatory, but incentivized with <em>guaranteed peer review</em>. With desk rejection rates north of 90% in top journals, that alone would flip the incentive structure.</p>



<p><strong>Argument #3: What Counts as Replication?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Rossner is concerned that replication must be defined carefully, and worries that replicators might lack the technical expertise. I agree that &#8220;rerunning every assay&#8221; or checking every paper is impossible. But we can focus on some key experiments and we can start to be proactive about replication. In my view, in 90% of the papers that describe lab-based preclinical studies, one can easily identify a single, clean, replication-worthy key experiment. In some specialized fields it might be challenging to find a replicator lab. Challenging, but not impossible. But in cell biology, or preclinical pharmacology, the key experiments have standard methods and could easily be set up and used for replication.<strong> </strong>And in cases where direct replication is impractical — say, in large clinical trials — one could try an independent statistical reanalysis of the data.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Rossner&#8217;s article&#8217;s final section offers some well-trodden alternatives to direct replication: better training, more rigorous design, reagent authentication. These are all fine, and they’ve been discussed <em>ad nauseam</em>, in Collins’ Roadmap and before. But experience tells us they’re not enough. He also suggests catching bad papers through image forensics. Sure — but by that point, the damage is done. At best, forensic analysis filters out a fraction of bad submissions at the editorial stage and protects some journals –– those that are willing to dig into their profits and spend extra money on fraud detection. Also, in the end, those flawed papers will simply find another journal to publish them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Which is why I don&#8217;t see any alternative to finally putting direct replication studies on the table. What is the use of a literature where the majority of the published studies are irreproducible? Who does that serve? How can anyone build on it?<strong> </strong>It still boggles the mind that anyone in the scientific community would take the time to argue <em>against </em>replication.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>In an ideal world</em>, scientists, as a matter of routine, would design and conduct replication studies to verify their own findings. They should be <em>adamant</em> that some of the funding they have should be spent on checking and replicating their data –– well before writing up the findings for publication.&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>In an ideal world</em>, institutions would treat reproducibility as essential to their reputation. Because how could they patent and translate findings that do not stand up to validation? And which investigator would be crazy enough to go and work in an institution that is known to churn out unreproducible papers? And what founding agency would give grants to an institution with a questionable reputation? (Remember, I am still talking about <em>ideal world</em> here.)</li>



<li>Taxpayers demand validated, translatable science. So, yes, the NIH should start spending some of its money (to be exact, the American taxpayers&#8217; money) to replication and validation. Either by paying grantees to do it, or by conducting some of the replication and validation work internally. There is actually an entire NIH institute, called NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences), whose scope, in an <em>ideal world</em>, would include this type of activity.</li>



<li><em>In a perfect world</em>, scientific journals, should also be <em>adamant</em> about making sure that the material submitted to them is validated, real, and independently repeatable. Why not, then, invest a fraction of their significant profits –– for example, Elsevier&#8217;s current <a href="https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing">profit margin is 40%</a> –– in experimentally vetting some of the work they publish? Either during the peer review process, or even after the paper is out. And –– if the key findings do not reproduce –– they should amend or even retract the paper.</li>
</ul>



<p>In that sense, Dr. Rossner is half-right: it shouldn’t be the NIH who is paying for replication. Better said, it <em>shouldn&#8217;t just be the NIH</em>: institutions and journals should chip in, too. In an ideal world, they would do all of that, on their own, in their own interest, without any outside prodding. Of course, I’m aware that we don’t live in that ideal world. But we should not lose sight of the reason –– the only reason –– why we are all doing biomedical research in the first place. If with some reallocation of funding priorities, shifting of research focus and rethinking the publication process, we can create a scientific literature that is more trustworthy, by all means, we should give it a try.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="response">Response from Mike Rossner:</h4>



<p>I appreciate Dr. Szabo’s careful reading of my guest post. It seems that he interpreted my post as “against replication,” which was not my intention. I agree with Dr. Szabo that reproducibility is a problem and that replication is part of the solution. I apologize if that was unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do not, however, think that a systematic, post-publication, replication program is an effective or efficient way of doing replication studies, for the very practical reasons outlined in my original post. Politics had nothing to do with that opinion. I would have opposed such a proposal from any administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do not think that my use of the term “systematic” was unclear; I referred to a selection process several times in the post, and it was thus clear that I was not referring to a “universal” effort to replicate every study post-publication. Dr. Szabo refers to selection processes in his post, but it remains unclear who decides what a “high impact, influential claim” is, or what a “key finding” is, or what a “top journal” is? More importantly, any selection process limits the number of studies replicated, so that a large percentage of published studies remain irreproducible.</p>



<p>Dr. Szabo tries to debunk some of the practical reasons presented in my original post, but he does not address the most critical one—timing: “people will have already spent time figuring out for themselves whatever the findings of the replication initiative later reveal.” In other words, the “organic” post-publication replication system already works in some sense, in that the work that is deemed important enough to build on already gets tested quickly by people vested in the outcome.</p>



<p>In my original post, I stated that I believe researchers could be motivated by various stakeholders to replicate their own studies BEFORE publication. It seems that Dr. Szabo and I agree about the importance of pre-publication replication and the role of various stakeholders in making that happen. Dr. Szabo argues, however, that publishers make so much money that they should pay for replication studies. That’s just not going to happen at any significant scale. It took 20 years to get the large commercial publishers to begin to pay for image screening pre-publication, which has an obvious financial benefit to them of avoiding costly investigations if issues are raised post-publication. There is no obvious financial burden to a publisher if a study cannot be replicated post-publication, because that is not necessarily grounds for an investigation.</p>



<p>Once again, I appreciate Dr. Szabo’s attention to this important topic. There are a lot of issues to consider before taxpayers start spending billions of dollars on post-publication replication studies.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/peter_kotlar.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="140" height="197" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/peter_kotlar.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132192"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Peter Kotlár</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Slovakia’s national science academy has issued a strong critique of a paper on mRNA vaccines coauthored by a member of the country’s parliament. The group called the work “insufficiently detailed” and “lacking controls,” with data that “may be misleading” and conclusions “not supported by sufficiently robust data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter Kotlár, the paper’s second author, is an orthopedist and represents the far-right Slovak National Party. He is also the commissioner for a review of resource management during the COVID-19 pandemic for the government of populist prime minister Robert Fico, himself known for <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2025/04/14/corn-feed-how-slovakias-government-utilises-the-power-of-conspiracies/">questioning the science</a> around COVID-19.</p>



<p>The paper appeared May 13 in the <em>Journal of Angiology and Vascular Surgery</em>, published<em> </em>by Herald Scholarly Open Access. “The journal in which the study of Peter Kotlár was published, is not evidenced in databases Web Of Science and Scopus,” a spokesperson for the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Monika Tináková, told us. The issues with the paper reflect “the fact that the journal in which it was published is classified as a so-called predatory journal,” the statement, <a href="https://www.sav.sk/index.php?lang=en&amp;doc=services-news&amp;source_no=20&amp;news_no=12787">issued last month</a>, reads.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132189"></span>



<p>Kotlár has <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/slovak-backlash-against-pandemic-investigation-riddled-with-disinformation/">been criticized</a> by the scientific community for his controversial views that SARS-CoV-2 was lab-made and the vaccines were unsafe. Members of the science academy’s virology institute, for example, <a href="https://www.sav.sk/?lang=en&amp;doc=services-news&amp;source_no=20&amp;news_no=12255">&nbsp;declared in October</a> they were “deeply concerned” about Kotlár’s claims, which the group said “call into question facts that have been verified and accepted by the global expert community and responsible authorities, and are misleading to the general public.”</p>



<p>Kotlár’s coauthors on the <a href="https://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/quantitative-analysis-of-nucleic-acid-content-in-spikevax-moderna-and-bnt162b2-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-lots">new paper</a>, “Quantitative Analysis of Nucleic Acid Content in Spikevax (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer) COVID-19 Vaccine Lots,” include Richard M.

He continues to speak out against the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, calling their deployment “criminal” and calling for them <a href="https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1922282445665194124">to be pulled from the market</a>.</p>



<p>The other coauthor, Sona Pekova, head of Tilia Laboratories in Pchery, Czech Republic, which offers molecular genetic testing, has also questioned the natural origins of COVID-19 and the safety of mRNA vaccines, according to <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2025/04/14/corn-feed-how-slovakias-government-utilises-the-power-of-conspiracies/">an analysis</a> by the media site Balkan Insight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper says the authors analyzed 17 lots of Spikevax (Moderna) and seven of BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccines for nucleic acid content using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR and found “variations in nucleic acid quantity” across lots and detected “DNA sequences, including <em>Escherichia coli </em>genomic fragments” in some samples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It concludes: “Regulatory oversight should address the potential risks associated with genetic material inconsistencies to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy.”</p>



<p>A company spokesperson for Pfizer told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No signs of DNA mutation or COVID-19 vaccine-induced cancer have been reported to date for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Regulatory authorities around the world have authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and expert medical committees have and continue to review the data and recommended it. With billions of doses of the vaccine administered around the world, the safety profile for the vaccine for all authorized groups continues to be favourable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In its statement, the Slovak Academy of Sciences said the vaccines “have already been thoroughly examined multiple times” and the “methods described in the published article are insufficiently detailed, lacking controls, and do not clearly define the input quantities of materials.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The claims presented are not compared with existing scientific knowledge or verified by alternative methods, which is essential given the seriousness of the presented findings,” it says. “The strong conclusions drawn are not supported by sufficiently robust data.”</p>



<p>The statement goes on to say the journal “fails to meet even the basic quality criteria: it is not indexed in recognized databases, has an extremely short peer-review process with unclear review procedures, and lacks defined standards for presenting results and methodologies.”</p>



<p>The Slovak academy “strictly condemns publishing in predatory journals and emphasizes that such publications bring no value and are irrelevant to the scientific community, medical practice, or the general public,” the statement concludes.</p>



<p>The academy’s spokesperson, Monika Tináková, told Retraction Watch the academy “did not comment on the personality of the politician” in its statement, focusing instead on the scientific topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kotlár, Fleming and Pekova did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did the journal or its publisher. The Slovak government and its health ministry also did not respond to our requests.</p>



<p>Fleming has been <a href="https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1922282445665194124">promoting the study</a> on his X <a href="https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The">account</a>, and on May 14 <a href="https://x.com/Doctor_I_am_The/status/1922638978357825572">posted</a>: “Regarding the ad hominem attacks on the journal being &#8220;predatory&#8221;. It&#8217;s predatory to make people afraid of something and take advantage of them. The journal is not predatory. It also isn&#8217;t funded by BigPharma which means it isn&#8217;t a non-predatory bought and paid for journal.”</p>

<p>A journal has retracted a 22-year-old-paper whose first author is the integrity officer for the Committee on Publication Ethics over concerns about image editing that “would not be acceptable by modern standards of figure presentation.”</p>



<p>The 2003 paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002050">A recombinant H1 histone based system for efficient delivery of nucleic acids</a>,” was published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Biotechnology </em>and has been cited 41 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<p>Sleuth Sholto David, who goes by the name “Mycosphaerella arachidis” on PubPeer, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F641C30E468EF1D4FF11F445B204C6">raised concerns</a> about the image in December 2023, pointing out a “[d]ark rectangle” that appeared to be “superimposed onto the image.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132187"></span>



<p>Coauthor <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.drcrisanti">Andrea Cristani</a>, a professor at the Imperial College of London in England, responded on forum the same month, noting he was “not involved in in [sic] performing the experiments I have asked the person who produced the data to provide an explanation [sic].”</p>



<p>The first author of the article, <a href="https://publicationethics.org/about/who-we-are/cope-team">Iratxe Puebla</a>, is the facilitation and integrity officer for COPE, an organization publishers and journals often turn to for retraction standards. She is also the director for DataCite’s Make Data Count, an initiative “focused on open research data assessment metrics,” according to its <a href="https://datacite.org/make-data-count/">website</a>. The 2003 paper listed her affiliation at the time as Imperial College London.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165625000550">retraction notice</a>, Puebla agreed with the decision and conceded “there appears to be evidence of splicing.” The “step would have been taken with the intention of providing a clearer presentation of the findings,” the notice reads.</p>



<p>Puebla did not respond to our multiple requests for comment sent to her work email, or to a message on LinkedIn. COPE said they are “are not able to comment on specific cases without having a thorough understanding of the facts” and did not respond directly to our request for additional ways to contact Puebla.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hcemm.eu/teams/infectious-diseases-with-special-emphasis-on-co-morbidities/circulating-nucleic-acid-biomarker-core-group/group-leader/">Christoph Sensen</a>, the editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Biotechnology</em>, told us concerns about the paper were raised in January 2024 by a reader and investigated internally. He requested the retraction after authors on the paper failed to produce original data and declined to re-perform the experiment, he said. In a March <em>For Better Science</em> post, Leonid Schneider said he had contacted Sensen with concerns about the paper. Sensen did not say whether David or Schneider were the first to contact the journal. </p>



<p>Sensen attributed the discovery to advances in image technology. When the paper appeared, “it was printed in 8 bit. Now we have 16 bit and 32 bit imagery,” he said, which revealed the black box with two gel bands.</p>



<p>Sensen suspected the researchers “took two gels, one was darker than the other and they just cut out a piece from one gel and blotted it into the other one with Photoshop.”</p>



<p>“Even after 20 years, these things may just surface now which were hidden from sight before,” Sensen told us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/06/23/interesting-papers-on-vip-interneurons-in-cortex-and-hippocampus/">Interesting papers on VIP interneurons in cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interneurons are inhibitory neurons in the brain that are thought to shape the computations performed by principal cells. The effects of inhibition can be rather diverse, depending on which neurons &#8211; or which parts of a neuron (dendrites, soma, or the axon hillock) &#8211; are targeted. A particularly interesting inhibitory motif that is the <em>disinhibitory </em>motif, which depends on a specific interneuron type known as VIP neuron. VIP neurons primarily inhibit another interneuron type called SST neurons (also written as &#8220;&#8216;SOM&#8221;), which in turn inhibits principal or pyramidal cells, often by targeting their dendrites. Therefore, activating VIP neurons releases pyramidal neurons from SST-mediated inhibition, possibly creating a window for plasticity and learning.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, both VIP and SST neurons are not homogeneous classes but consist of multiple subtypes which might also vary across cortical and neocortical areas. Below, I’ll highlight a few recent studies on VIP neurons that caught my attention. Let me know if you know others that are similarly interesting!</p>



<p><strong>A role for hippocampal VIP neurons in place cell remapping</strong></p>



<p>In this well-designed and easy-to-read paper, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al. (2025)</a> from the <a href="https://vervaeke-lab.org/">Vervaeke lab</a> investigate how VIP neurons in the hippocampus contribute to place cell remapping. Place cell remapping is a form of hippocampal plasticity where pyramidal cells change their spatial firing fields in response to environmental novelty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al.</a> use optogentic tools to activate (ChrimsonR) and inactivate (ArchT) VIP neurons while performing calcium imaging of pyramidal neurons. They find that inactivation decreases remapping and activation increases remapping of pyramidal neurons. The effects are relatively subtle but seem convincing, and align with the idea that VIP neurons facilitate plasticity by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons. </p>

<p>The authors additionally analyze their data with respect to a specific plasticity rule in pyramidal cells termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (<a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">covered before</a> on this blog), which results in a more complex picture that is less straightforward to interpret. The authors conclude that in addition to VIP activity other factors (e.g., neuromodulatory input) may be necessary to induce remapping.</p>



<p>Overall, this study nicely shows how novelty activates VIP interneurons to help control plasticity in pyramidal neurons, presumably via SST neurons. Their findings are consistent with and extend previous results from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.009">Turi et al. (2019)</a> that demonstrated a necessary role of VIP neurons for reward location learning in hippocampal place cells.</p>



<p><strong>The subtypes of VIP neurons in neocortex</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.26.640383v2">Dellal, Zurita et al. (2025)</a> from <a href="https://www.rudyneurolab.org/">Bernardo Rudy’s lab</a> investigate subtypes of VIP neurons in neocortex (somatosensory cortex). They do so in a very systematic study with transgenic animal crossing strategies that enable identification of various subtypes. I really do not want to know how much work it was to cross and validate all these mouse lines! As a result, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.26.640383v2">Dellal, Zurita et al.</a> find four subtypes of VIP neurons.</p>



<p>The most distinctive feature of these subtypes is whether the protein CCK is expressed or not. CCK-negative VIP neurons and in particular CCK-negative CR-positive VIP neurons target mostly SST neurons, while CCK-positive VIP neurons target also pyramidal cells directly and are there not only disinhibitory but also inhibitory for pyramidal cells. It is interesting that very similar findings have been made earlier for hippocampal circuits, where two such subtypes of VIP neurons were found in the 1990s (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00609-5">Acsády et al., 1996</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-10-03397.1996">Gulyás et al., 1996</a>).</p>

<p>With the increasingly refined functional classification of interneuron subtypes, it becomes more and more difficult to not get confused by the different classification approaches. Other studies (e.g., in Figure 7 by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.013">Geiller et al., 2020</a>) used slightly different markers to delineate VIP subclasses, making it quite a puzzle to connect the dots between publications!</p>



<p>A detail that I found particularly interesting as somebody <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">working</a> on the noradrenergic system is the following finding: CR-positive VIP neurons, which target SST neurons but not pyramidal neurons, were not significantly activated by bath-applied noradrenaline (Fig. 6M,N); this is suprising because I would have expected noradrenalin to have a disinhibitory effect on the local circuit and therefore to act via VIP-CR interneurons – which does not seem to be the case. CCK-positive VIP cells as well as CCK-negative CR-negative VIP neurons (the fourth class found by the authors) were, however, activated by noradrenaline. So maybe all the disinibitory action through noradrenaline goes through CCK-negative CR-negative neurons? This definitely needs more follow-up experiments. I would be very curious to see these same experiments done in hippocampus …</p>

<p>The main take-away from this paper is quite clear: perturbations of VIP neurons using transgenic VIP lines do affect multiple subtypes with partially opposing signature, with both disinhibitory effects (via CCK-negative interneurons) and inhibitory effects directly on pyramidal cells (via CCK-positive interneurons). This confound from using VIP transgenic lines is also discussed by the above study of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al., (2025)</a>. Targeting interneurons more specifically seems essential for future studies to manipulate or replicate the disinhibitory effect of (a subset of) VIP neurons, in neocortex as well as in hippocampus.</p>



<p><strong>Hippocampal interneurons with all-optical methods</strong></p>



<p>In an beautiful technical achievement, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.20.644347">Yang et al. (2025)</a> from <a href="https://elsc.huji.ac.il/people-directory/faculty-members/yoav-adam/">Yoav Adam’s lab</a> provide a systematic study of the functional characteristics of different neuron types in hippocampus (principal cells, VIP, SST, PV). They combine 1P voltage imaging (with the voltage sensors somArchon1 and QuasAr6b) and optogenetic activation of the same neurons (somCheRiff) to both record and manipulate specific neurons in vivo. Pretty cool! I liked how they focused on recording from and perturbing only very few neurons at a time, but at a apparently high quality.</p>

<p>To describe these results, the authors analyze how optogenetic depolarization as well as state (walking vs. quiet) influences several cellular characteristics: the response to input, the amplitude of theta oscillations, and &#8211; for pyramidal neurons &#8211; the bursting propensity.</p>



<p>In a second step, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.20.644347">Yang et al.</a> use modeling to better interpret these descriptive findings. These single-cell conductance-based models are interesting to consider and consistent with the experimental results. However, I believe that the data itself and its pure description remain the strongest part of the paper. Such a dataset with voltage recordings and perturbations of several cell types in hippocampus would have been difficult to imagine just 10 or 15 years ago. I sincerely hope that the dataset will be curated and shared openly during the publication process!</p>
