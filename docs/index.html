              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/lessons-in-chemistry-a-review">Lessons in Chemistry: A Review</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>In this review, Emily Beswick discusses Bonnie Garmus&apos; bestselling and engaging novel, </strong></span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Lessons in Chemistry,</strong></span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong> which exposes the world of academia as a woman in the 1950s.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Although ostensibly a work of fiction, </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lessons in Chemistry</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> uses the story of a chemist, called Elizabeth Zott, to represent the realities of many women in 1950s America. Women who were unable to continue with their education or pursue the careers that they wanted to. Women who were discouraged from being independent, and their only role in society was to be a wife and mother. </span></span>The exclusion from education and the workplace meant many years of women’s talent, innovation and contributions were lost. Whilst progress has been made in science and society, there is still much that can be done to further address the imbalance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Elizabeth Zott is a chemist, and a great one at that. Her passion and aptitude are evident, but as the only female scientist at the company, she is excluded by her colleagues and disparaged by her employers. Ultimately, she is unfairly dismissed from her job and has to give up her research into abiogenesis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Centred around the love story of Elizabeth and her colleague Calvin (a chemistry prodigy himself), the book also deals with more difficult topics such as academic misconduct, sex discrimination in the workplace and lack of equal opportunity for women in science. The author weaves these broader social topics into the main storyline, ensuring that readers remain engaged whilst also being able to take time to reflect on the issues she raises. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Elizabeth’s senior male colleague even goes as far as to publish her research under his own name. The bias of attributing the work of female scientists to their male colleagues was first addressed by suffragist </span></span><u><a href="https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/matilda-joslyn-gage" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Matilda Joslyn Gage</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> in her 1870 essay </span></span><u><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25118273" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Woman as an Inventor&apos;&apos;</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, and termed ‘The Matilda Effect’ by science historian Margaret W Rossiter in 1993. History is full of examples of the bias illustrated by Zott’s experience in </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lessons in Chemistry</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, with </span></span><u><a href="https://www.rfi.ac.uk/about/rosalind-franklin/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Rosalind Franklin’s</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> contribution to understanding the structure of DNA often forgotten and </span></span><u><a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/lise-meitner/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lise Meitner’s</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> exclusion from receiving a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on nuclear fission.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A key part of what makes this book so engaging, and so easy to recommend, is the relatability. Although there has clearly been progress made, and women now have many more opportunities, gender equality in science and society is still the chimaera. For some women, the reality of the 1950s housewife’s denied independence is their current reality. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For example, after being fired from the chemical research company for being pregnant out of wedlock, Elizabeth is invited to host a new tv show, </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Supper at Six</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. Elizabeth has reservations about this but takes on the role because she is under pressure to provide for her daughter. Despite repeated attempts from the production company to pigeonhole her into being an archetypical cooking show host, Elizabeth insists on bringing her background as a chemist to everything that she cooks. </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Supper at Six</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> becomes a platform to remind women that their current roles as homemakers and caregivers are valued, and that they are just as capable of pursuing careers in science and medicine as men are. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The experiences of Elizabeth, and the other characters in the book, remain relatable today, and their stories of discrimination and exclusion still resonate. Organisations, such as Women in Neuroscience UK, are so important in driving the progress towards equality. These organisations provide community, support and representation to reiterate to women that they do belong in science. The reason that things have progressed is because women, like the character Elizabeth Zott, have paved the way, taken up space and encouraged other women to do the same. </span></span></p>

The neutrino oscillations require energy. This is possible by extraordinary individuals, who can negate all stray thoughts (as in meditation or intense concentration) and focus these in a single intended direction. Often, such individuals in this state emit radiation known to be halos (could be linked to photon emission). The thoughts are thus a focused beam of neutral neutrinos and can change into positive and negative on interacting with a receiver object composed of atoms and ions and replicate the original signals and thought pattern as observed in BCI and other psychic phenomena. </blockquote><br />{Physicists, please post your comments.}<br /><br />Mr. Trivedi has also published in journals from reputable publishers.

</span><p style="text-align: right;">July 23, 2024</p><br />

<p>Dr. Okayama and the Editorial Staff of the <i>Journal of General and Family Medicine</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am writing about the legitimacy of an article published in the journal:<br /><br />

</p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Trivedi, M. K., Branton, A., Trivedi, D., Mondal, S., &amp; Jana, S. (2023). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgf2.606" target="_blank">The role of biofield energy treatment on psychological symptoms, mental health disorders, and stress‐related quality of life in adult subjects: A randomized controlled clinical trial</a>.&nbsp;<i>Journal of General and Family Medicine</i>,&nbsp;<i>24</i>(3), 154-163.</span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this paper, the first author (Mahendra Kumar Trivedi, also known as “Guruji” on the Divine Connection website) makes extraordinary and unvalidated claims about his ability to change the state of matter – and the mental and physical health of human volunteers – via transmission of his thoughts (described as “blessing” throughout the manuscript). A peer-reviewed journal that accepts such declarations without incontrovertible scientific evidence, which was never provided, has compromised its scientific reputation. Furthermore, the study’s design is flawed and much of the data contained in the paper is implausible and inauthentic.</p>


<p>I am an established scientist who runs a research lab, and as I will outline below, it is ethically mandatory for the <i>Journal of General and Family Medicine</i> to reconsider this paper and for Wiley to retract it from the scientific literature for the following reasons.</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>The paper contends that the “randomized controlled clinical trial” (p. 154) used a placebo control condition when it did not. An experimental design that uses a no-treatment group does not control for expectation effects. Although the Abstract mentions that the placebo group was assigned to “naïve attunement” (p. 154), this procedure was not explained. It appears that the control group received no treatment or manipulation at all, and therefore cannot be considered “a placebo group” (see quote below).&nbsp; <br /><br /></li>
  
 <p><span style="font-family: arial;">“Besides, the placebo control group subjects did not receive any blessing or attunements.”&nbsp; (p. 156)</span></p><p><br />
  
  </p><li>&nbsp;The Psychological Questionnaires Scoring (PQS) used to assess mental 
health was “…prepared in-house with few modifications based on the 
standard scientific literatures, done by renowned experienced 
psychologists and psychiatrics, who were involved in this clinical trial
 study” (see p. 156). These individuals were not named, so we must 
assume they were authors. Although there are widely accepted 
standardized questionnaires that could have been used in the study, a 
more important concern was that the raw scores were not reported. Each 
symptom category consisted of only two questions, with a possible range 
of scores from 2 – 14. All measurements from the No-Treatment Group were
 on the first day of the study, Day 0 (baseline), with no follow-up. In 
contrast, measurements from the Biofield Energy Therapy Group were 
obtained on Day 90 (after treatment on Day 0) and on Day 180 (after a 
second treatment on Day 90). Significance for all 14 symptoms was p 
&lt;0.0001, but the raw scores were not reported for either group. And 
we don’t know how scores for the No-Treatment Group might have changed 
over time. For example, Table 2 reports lower scores (a negative 
Mean ± SD) for the symptom “Stress and confusion” for the Treatment 
Group at 90 and 180 days, compared to the baseline No-Treatment Group 
    (on Day 0).</li><p></p>
  90 days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; −4.086 ± 0.7664<p>
 180 days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; −6.114 ± 0.7230</p><p></p><br />


<li>Table 3 lists measurements for the functional biomarkers, which are the clearest evidence for unverifiable data (or error). Many of these are highly implausible, because their values are out-of-range of typical physiological levels (to an extent beyond what is seen in pathological conditions). It is unclear why these values were considered an improvement in overall health and quality of life (p. 154, 161). Concrete examples are given below.</li><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: x-small;"><u>No-Treatment</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Treat, Day 90&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Treat, Day 180</u></span><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Oxytocin</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 88.05&nbsp;± 6.39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 451.44&nbsp;± 32.93***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 257.46&nbsp;± 27.62***<br /><b><span style="color: #2b00fe;">(pg/mL)</span></b></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">***p&lt;0.001 vs. Controls<br />

<p>What do fairytales and scientific papers have in common? Consider the story of Rumpelstiltskin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A poor miller tries to impress the king by claiming his daughter can spin straw into gold. The avaricious king locks up the girl and tells her to spin out the gold. She fails, until a goblin, Rumpelstiltskin, comes to her rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In science, publishers and editors of academic journals prefer to publish demonstrably new findings – gold – rather than replications or refutations of findings which have been published already. This “novelty pressure” requires presentation of results that are “significant” – usually that includes being “statistically significant.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129740"></span>



<p>In the conventional realm of null-hypothesis testing of significance, this means using a threshold probability. Usually in biology and medicine the accepted cutoff is a probability of 0.05 (a chance of 5%, or one in 20) and its use is explicitly written into the description of the methods section of publications. Some branches of science, such as genetics and physics, use more stringent probability thresholds. But the necessity of having a threshold remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do researchers create the illusion of novelty in a result when the finding has a probability value close to, but on the wrong side of, the stated probability threshold – for example, a probability of 0.06? Talk it up, spin out a story! It’s the fairytale of Rumpelstiltskin in modern garb.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are more than <a href="https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/">500 examples</a> of pretzel logic researchers have used to make claims of significance despite p values higher than .05. It would be comical if not for the serious obfuscation of science which the stories cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the practice of claiming importance and true significance for such results has been termed “spin.” More formally, we call it “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185952">reporting that could distort the interpretation</a> of results and mislead readers.”</p>



<p>Increasingly, scholars are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28892482/">quantifying</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29531025/">analyzing</a> the practice of spinning probability values. Linked to our development of a “Quality Output Checklist and Content Assessment” (i.e. <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/9/e060976">QuOCCA</a>) as a tool for assessing research quality and reproducibility, my colleagues and I <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202121">have measured</a> <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1483">how often spin occurs</a> in three prestigious journals, the <em>Journal of Physiology</em>, the <em>British Journal of Pharmacology</em> and the <em>Journal of Neurophysiology</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found when probability values were presented in the results section of the publication, but were not quite statistically significant (greater than 0.05 but less than 0.10), authors talked up the findings and spun out a story in about 55%-65% of publications. Often, they wrote results “trended” to significance. Thus, results of straw can become results of gold! Attractive to the researchers, editors, publishing houses and universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putting spin on insignificant probability values is an egregious and shonky – that’s dubious, for our friends outside of Australia –&nbsp; scientific practice. It shows the authors’ failure to appreciate the requirement of an absolute threshold for claiming the presence (or not) of an effect, or for supporting (or not) a hypothesis. It reveals an entrenched and incorrigible capacity for bias. Furthermore, the authors seem unaware of the fact that a probability value of, say, 0.07 is not even justifiable as a trend: The addition of further samples or participants <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2215">does not inexorably move the probability</a> value below the 0.05 threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of instances of spin within a publication has no theoretical limit; any probability value above 0.05 could be talked up. However, while our previous audits of publications in three journals have occasionally found more than one example of spin within a single publication, such casess seemed rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2022 paper in the <em>British Journal of Pharmacology</em> titled “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36102035/">Deferiprone attenuates neuropathology and improves outcome following traumatic brain injury</a>,” has obliterated this impression. On at least 25 occasions, the authors overhype results linked to a probability value exceeding 0.05. Some of the offending explanations use phrases such as: “did not reach significance but showed a strong trend (p=0.075);” “a trending yet non-significant preservation of neurons was seen;” “no significant changes were seen in proBDNF despite an increased trend.”</p>



<p>In the publication, by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36102035/">Daglas and colleagues</a>, many probability values between 0.05 and 0.10 were spun, but even values above 0.10 were considered “trendy.” These included values of 0.11, 0.14, 0.16, 0.17, 0.23 and 0.24. The authors have not responded to my request for comment,&nbsp;</p>



<p>As&nbsp; the 2024 Paris Olympics get underway, it is tempting to ask: Does the featured publication set a World Record for scientific spin? Comment with your entries, please.</p>



<p>What should be done about the prevalence of spinning probability values? This question is part of a bigger dilemma. All levels of the “industry&#8221; of science know the problems caused by perpetuating shonky science, but their attempts at regulation and improvement are fraught with difficulty and impeded by self-interest. Education about science publication and mandatory requirements before publication are potentially helpful steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The messages from Rumpelstiltskin should be that spinning straw can lead to trouble, and science is not a fairytale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Infectious Diseases</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-024-09201-7">Prevalence of vaccine-derived hepatitis B surface antibodies in children and adolescents in Germany: results from a population-based survey, 2014–2017</a></p>
<p>Childhood vaccination against hepatitis B has been a standard health recommendation in Germany since 1995. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a successful primary vaccination series is marked by a hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) level of ≥10 IU/L immediately following vaccination. Anti-HBs levels can vary depending on the number of doses, type of vaccine, and the interval between the last two doses. In 2021, Germany modified its vaccination guidelines, recommending three doses of polyvalent hepatitis B vaccines instead of four. In this study the authors aimed to determine the proportion of vaccinated children in Germany with different anti-HBs levels and assess whether the number of doses and compliance with the recommended interval between the last two doses impact achieving an anti-HBs level of ≥10 IU/L.</p>
<p>The authors utilized data from a national cross-sectional survey conducted between 2014 and 2017, involving children aged 3–17 years. A recommended vaccination schedule was defined as having at least six months between the last two doses and receiving three or more doses. Two logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between the number of doses, adherence to the recommended schedule, and anti-HBs levels, taking into account the time since the last dose and the type of vaccine used.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed no significant association following a three-dose versus four-dose schedule and achieving anti-HBs levels of either ≥10 IU/L or ≥100 IU/L. This indicates that the reduction in the number of recommended doses did not affect the overall efficacy of the vaccination in terms of maintaining sufficient anti-HBs levels.</p>
<p>The authors findings suggest that in later childhood, anti-HBs levels are comparable whether children received three or four doses of the vaccine. This implies that the updated recommendation for a three-dose schedule does not compromise the anti-HBs levels among children in Germany. By ensuring continued research and monitoring, health authorities can better understand the effectiveness and durability of the hepatitis B vaccination program.</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Primary Care</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-023-02157-8">Barriers to hepatitis B virus screening of pregnant women in primary healthcare centers in Nigeria: health workers’ perspective</a></p>
<p>In Nigeria, screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a crucial aspect of antenatal care. Despite its importance, screening rates remain disappointingly low, especially at primary healthcare centres. To address this issue, a recent study explored the barriers to antenatal HBV screening from the perspective of health workers in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In this study the authors surveyed health workers, across three Nigerian states: Akwa Ibom, Anambra, and Kaduna. Using an open-ended questionnaire, the researchers gathered written responses on the perceived barriers to HBV screening and potential solutions. The data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.</p>
<p>The study identified barriers at three levels: patient, provider, and health system. This included a lack of awareness among pregnant women about the importance of HBV screening and the unaffordability of HBV tests and high costs of antiviral treatment. As well as insufficient knowledge and training among health workers regarding HBV and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct HBV screenings. Finally, the study identified a lack of HBV test kits and vaccines at PHCs and inadequate infrastructure and resources to support widespread screening programs.</p>
<p>To overcome these barriers, health workers recommended several strategies. Firstly, to ensure HBV test kits and vaccines are readily available and free of charge at PHCs. Secondly, they recommended implementation of targeted awareness campaigns to educate pregnant women about HBV and the importance of screening. Finally, the suggested investing in training programs to enhance the knowledge and skills of health workers in HBV screening and management.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that multilevel barriers significantly impacted HBV screening rates among pregnant women in Nigerian PHCs. Addressing these barriers through comprehensive and sustainable interventions is crucial as Nigeria strives to eliminate HBV. By improving access to testing and vaccines, raising awareness, and enhancing health worker training, the country can make significant strides in safeguarding maternal and child health against HBV.</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Infectious Diseases</strong></em> – <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-023-08940-3">Sustained virologic response improved the long-term health-related quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C: a prospective national study in China</a></p>
<p>Understanding the trends in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients is crucial for assessing the full impact of antiviral therapy on their well-being. In this study the authors aimed to investigate these trends and evaluate how antiviral therapy influences HRQoL over time.</p>
<p>This prospective multicentred observational study involved adults with HCV infection. The researchers collected sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, and responses to EQ-5D questionnaires, which measure HRQoL. Following this, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to analyse the associations between these variables and changes in HRQoL over time.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that achieving SVR markedly enhances the long-term HRQoL of HCV patients, particularly in the first few years following viral clearance. Sociodemographic factors, such as age, income, gender, and genotype, also play significant roles in determining long-term quality of life outcomes.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the crucial impact of antiviral therapy in improving the overall well-being of HCV patients. As healthcare providers work to manage and treat HCV, understanding the diverse factors that affect patients&#8217; quality of life can guide more personalized and effective treatment approaches.</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Immunology</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12865-023-00579-8">Characteristics of circulating immune cells in HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure following artificial liver treatment</a></p>
<p>Liver failure induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a critical condition often treated with artificial liver support systems (ALSS). In this study the authors aimed to explore the phenotypic diversity of immunocytes in patients with HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) before and after ALSS therapy.</p>
<p>To start their investigation HBV-ACLF patients undergoing ALSS therapy were enrolled, with improvement categorized based on ACLF Research Consortium scores. Demographic and laboratory data were collected during hospitalization. Immunological profiles of peripheral blood were analysed using mass cytometry before and after ALSS.</p>
<p>Out of the participants in the study, 12 patients showed clinical improvement while 10 did not. Post-ALSS analysis revealed higher circulating monocyte levels in non-improved patients, contrasting with lower γδT cell counts compared to the improved group. Further analysis identified 37 cell clusters, with significant decreases noted in effector CD8+ T cells, CD4+ TCM, CD4+ TEM, and inhibitory natural killer (NK) cells following ALSS therapy among HBV-ACLF patients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, results showed that ALSS therapy in HBV-ACLF patients is associated with significant changes in immune cell populations, notably affecting effector CD8+ T cells, CD4+ TCM and TEM cells, and inhibitory NK cells. Differences in monocytes and γδT cells were particularly pronounced between patients with varying treatment outcomes. These findings suggest that the phenotypic heterogeneity of lymphocytes and monocytes may influence the prognosis of ALSS therapy. Understanding these immunological changes could inform future strategies for immunotherapy in HBV-related liver failure.</p>
<p>This study underscores the complexity of immune responses in HBV-ACLF and highlights the potential for tailored immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at optimizing treatment outcomes in this patient population.</p>

<p>A group of researchers in Iran now have had more than 60 papers retracted for concerns about peer review and plagiarism as a publisher investigates its back catalog. One of the researchers, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dElahi%252c%2bA%2bSalar">A. Salar Elahi</a>, now ranks 7th on the Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Leaderboard</a>.</p>



<p>Previously, Elsevier said they would retract 26 papers from the research group at Islamic Azad University in Tehran for fake reviews in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/21/elsevier-retracting-26-papers-accepted-fake-reviews/">2017</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/01/04/elsevier-knew-author-faked-reviews-kept-accepting-papers-year/">2018</a>. The latest batch of 33 retracted papers originally appeared in Springer Nature’s <em>Journal of Fusion Energy</em> as far back as 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity at Springer Nature told us in addition to investigating specific concerns as they arise, his unit also is running “ongoing deep-dive investigations to assess published content that has connections with content that has already been retracted for integrity concerns by ourselves or other publishers.” The recent retractions came from such an investigation that is ongoing, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129729"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/search?new-search=true&amp;query=elahi+AND+retracted&amp;date=m3&amp;dateFrom=&amp;dateTo=&amp;sortBy=relevance">retraction notices</a> state an investigation by Springer Nature found problems “including but not limited to peer review concerns” and “significant overlap” with other published works.</p>



<p>The authors did not respond to correspondence regarding the retractions, the notices stated. Elahi and co-authors K. Mikaili Agah and S. Meshkani also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/07/25/on-the-night-train-to-fens-in-vienna/">On the night train to FENS in Vienna</a></h4>

              
                <p>The FENS is the biggest neuroscientific conference in Europe. It is 5 days long and is attended by 5&#8217;000-10&#8217;000 participants. This year, the conference took place in Austria’s capital, Vienna, roughly 600 km from my current workplace in Zürich. Of course, there are regular and cheap flight between the two cities; however, there are good reasons why to use other means of transportation instead (check out <a href="https://anneurai.net/green-neuroscience/">Anne Urai</a>&#8216;s work): busses, regular trains, and night trains. In this blog post, I will share my impression what it is like to take a night train in Europe and why it is a great option for some (but not for everybody).</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s special about night trains?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_car">Night trains</a> (also called sleeper cars) typically cover longer distances than regular trains. Traditionally, they tried to offer more comfort for an over-night stay, like comfortable beds, additional cars with proper restaurants and bars, or at least a breakfast served at your seat. Especially in times when trains were slower and airplanes not available, night trains were one of the more comfortable options to make a long trip enjoyable. I was surprised to find out that some of the earliest night trains were actually operated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_car">in the USA</a>! However, the probably most famous examples of night trains traverse the Eurasian continent. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway">Transiberian Railway</a>, which extends from the Western to the Eastern Border of Russia; or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express">Orient Express</a>, which passes through a large part of Europe from Paris to Istanbul.<strong><br /><br />Seating carriages, sleeper’s carriages and things between<span lang="en-CH"></span><br /></strong><br />In most night trains that I know, there are three different carriages. First, the cheaper carriages where you stay on a seat over night. Sometimes, these seats can be pulled out and converted into an improvised bed. Second, the couchette, which offers bunk beds, usually with 4 or 6 beds within one compartment, with 2 or 3 stories on the left and the right. And finally, a more spacious and more private sleeper compartment, with typically 1 to 3 beds. It is also possible, for an additional fee, to reserve a sleeper compartment for oneself, for a couple or a family. The prices are moderate when booked much in advance; for example, I paid &lt;150 Euros for the round trip from Zürich to Vienna. However, one must also state that (and wonder why) a cheap flight is not much more expensive than that.</p>



<p><strong>The current state of night trains in Europe</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, night trains have been on the decline for several decades in Western Europe. With more and more cheap flights or good high-speed train connections between many European cities, the operation of the slower night trains became less interesting for railway companies, and investments stalled. Around 2020, some governments in central Europe tried to countersteer this decline by pushing for a stronger network of night trains. But it will still take several years until these efforts will show some effect, and the success is not a given.</p>



<p>The re-growing interest for night trains didn&#8217;t come out of nowhere. With the public opinion looking more skeptically at short-distance intracontinental airplane flights, night trains in Europe became increasingly popular, in particular after the pandemic, as a CO2-friendly option for long distance-traveling. However, the infrastructure could not really hold up to the increasing interest. Most importantly, the fleet of trains was both too old and too small for the rising demand. The companies responded by using their trains at maximum capacity; therefore, if a carriage broke down (which was not unlikely due to their old age and the scarcity of spare parts), often there was no replacement carriage, and the passengers who were supposed to calmly sleep in a reserved bed were regrouped into an overcrowded seating carriage. Addtionally, the infrastructure inside of the carriages, like toilets, bed lights, etc. is often rather old and not always in a good state &#8211; far from the luxury atmosphere associated with, e.g., the Orient Express! Moreover, night trains are often delayed by one or several hours, especially on high-demand routes such as Zürich-Amsterdam.</p>



<p>In summary, one needs to face the fact that night trains are currently not as reliable and not as comfortable as they should be in order to make this mode of traveling attractive for a broader audience. It is likely that the situation will improve during the next years, with more modern cars being produced, replacing and supporting the existing fleets, and making night trains in Europe again more reliable and also luxurious. I have the impression that the companies have already taken some good first steps towards such an improved scenario, because when I took the night train to Vienna, the train was purposefully underbooked, most likely to prevent major problems in case a carriage would break down. But let&#8217;s see what the next years and decades will bring.</p>



<p>My own experience has so far been limited to night trains operated by the German-speaking railway companies, with the Austrian railway company ÖBB being at the heart of it. However, there are other night trains as well. For example, it&#8217;s possible to go f<a href="https://quasitaliano.com/overnight-train-italy/">rom Milano in Northern Italy to Sicily</a> within a long night, passing not only the largest part of Italy, but also the Mediterranean Sea with a train ferry (!). So if you&#8217;re planning your next series of Summer conferences to attend across Europe, maybe you can connect the conferences with an adventurous night train trip?</p>

<p><strong>Traveling from Zürich to Vienna with the night train</strong></p>



<p>The conference in Vienna started on Tuesday, June 25th, with a workshop on closed-loop neuroscience that I wanted to attend (and I was particularly impressed by the cool work from <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&amp;user=PI2P_oEAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Valerie Ego-Stengel</a>’s lab). I worked normally in Zurich on Monday and went directly from work to the main train station, where the night train departed at 8.40 pm. With me, the luggage for a Summer’s week and a big poster roll.</p>



<p>My train was, to be fair, quite old. I had booked a sleeper&#8217;s bunk bed in a 6-person compartment but the middle beds on each side were not used, as you can see below. You can also guess from the first picture and see from the second picture that there was not a lot of space between my bunk bed and the ceiling. It was enough to sit on the bed and work, but barely.</p>

<p>When I entered the compartment, I realized that I would share it with an elderly Indian couple, who were, while the train was still waiting in the station, accompanied by several family members. The couple was from Vienna and had attended a wedding in Switzerland. As most people in night trains, they had little experience with the night train experience. What are the rules? What bed should you take? When will the lights be turned off? Where are the electric plugs? Is there wifi? (Usually, there is none.) Will I be woken up in the morning? I could see the anxiety and the adventure in their eyes, and they were grateful that I could help out with some of their simplest questions.</p>



<p>We had a pleasant discussion about their lifes in Vienna, but after a short time, we decided to go to bed. I went up to my bed and spent an hour or two going through the scientific abstracts of the conference to figure out the best trajectory for the next days. Around midnight, I went to sleep. It turned out that this particular car and this particular bed was not perfect for me &#8211; the bed measured almost exactly 180 cm, which is a few cm too short for my height. I noticed that the lower beds were slightly longer, from which I benefitted gladly when I took the train back a few days later.</p>



<p>Usually, I can sleep pretty well in night trains. I like the rhythmic rattling of the train wheels, it even helps me fall asleep (to the extent that I find it difficult to sleep when the train is not rolling but standing still in the middle of the night for an hour!). It&#8217;s a pleasant feeling to know that the goal is coming closer by itself while I do nothing but sleep.</p>



<p>This time, however, I was a bit unlucky. My two cabin mates were very friendly when awake, but rather annoying during sleep. The woman was snoring in an irregular way that I found difficult to deal with, while her husband was occasionally speaking or shouting in his sleep with an agitated voice. Not my best night train night so far! I heard later that a colleague of mine who also took the night train to FENS was much luckier, sharing the cabin with other attendants of the FENS conference and having a good time during the evening and night.</p>



<p>In any case, the train arrived at 6.34 am in Vienna, perfectly on time. The breakfast in the train had not been exceptional (which is unfortunately the rule rather than the exception according to my experience). Therefore, I benefitted from the great Viennese baking culture and got a very decent breakfast at a price that seemed so much more affordable as I was directly coming from Switzerland&#8230;</p>



<p>After the 5-day conference, which was a pleasant mix of meeting old friends and meeting people for the first time I knew from Twitter, from collaborations or from eMail exchanges, interspersed with some interesting pieces of neuroscience, I spent another day with a good old friend of mine who happens to live in Vienna, before I took the train back to Zürich. My plan was to take the night train on Sunday just after 11 pm, to arrive on Monday morning in Zürich and go directly to work. Maybe an ambitious plan, but it worked out well. During the last hour before my train departed, I waited at the train station in Vienna, with the vibrant atmosphere of Summer still around me. Due to the European soccer championship, one of the games was publicly displayed on a huge screen just in front of the station, and a Spanish crowd cheered every time their team scored a goal.</p>



<p>Back on the train, I entered the compartment that was already occupied by one woman, sleeping in one of the beds, hidden below the blanket. I tried to do my best not to wake her up and took over the bed on the left.</p>

<p>I wrote a few notes on my laptop to record the recently passed very eventful and inspiring days, and then fell asleep.</p>



<p>I woke up in the early morning around 6.30 am. With joy, I noticed that we were passing by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walensee">Lake Walenstadt</a>, a beautiful lake in the East of Switzerland, and already quite close to Zürich. Through their diffuse reflection, the grey and white clouds created a beautiful metallic shimmer in the water, and I sat there, looking out of the window, being happy.</p>

<p>Soon after, we passed by Lake Zürich, and when I arrived at Zürich main station, I had my breakfast with delicious Viennese pastries before I went to work. A very efficient way of traveling!<strong><br /><br />Why you should (not) take the night train</strong></p>



<p>It should have become clear now that night trains in their current state are not for everybody. The comfort is too low and the prices are a bit too high, and delays too frequent. But still &#8230; I would recommend this experience to anybody who is not afraid of it and can manage to sleep in such a context. It&#8217;s not only about avoiding airplanes, but also about embracing the adventure that is much more palpable for the night train experience compared to airplane flights. The sense of adventure not only makes the travel special but also bonds the travellers within one compartment to each other more easily. A great opportunity to meet with people from outside your social circles!</p>



<p>The probably most famous night train, the Orient Express, has long been associated with an atmosphere of both luxury and adventure. And both aspects are reflected by its prominent occurrence in works of fiction, ranging from Agatha Christie&#8217;s famous novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Orient_Express">The murder on the Orient Express</a> to the most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJuq3zR3q4">Mission Impossible movie</a>. Nowadays, it is mostly the atmosphere of adventure which still remains part of the night train experience. Almost 20 years ago, I was deeply fascinated by the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Train_to_Lisbon">Night Train to Lisbon</a>. In this book, the daily life of a high school teacher transitions to a philosophical and linguistic adventure within a single night: in the night train from Bern to Lisbon. I still believe that this is the essence that is the most attractive aspect of night trains: the vague promise of adventure, a memorable night and a new world that opens up to the awakening senses on the morning of the next day.</p>

<p>In June, a scientist researching sarcopenia came across a <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2023N06A0919#">relevant paper</a> about treatment for elderly patients with complications from the disease as well as type 2 diabetes. The paper was “very bad,” he told us. “It looked like someone just copied two or three times the same text.” </p>



<p>The scientist, who asked to remain anonymous, became even more concerned when he realized the paper, which had the word “elderly” in its title, had been published in a pediatric journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I started reading other issues of the same journal and noticed that this is a widespread problem: Chinese papers about older adults being published in pediatric journals!” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129726"></span>



<p>He suspected the problems were the work of a “careless editor.”<br><br>“I hope that no one is getting money to publish this,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/issue.php?cod=R15Y2023N06">volume</a> of the journal with the sarcopenia paper, <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/index.php"><em>Minerva Pediatrics</em></a><em>, </em>included 29 articles, of which at least eight letters to the editor described experiments and clinical trials with adult participants, according to our analysis. Two contained the word “elderly” in their titles, including the article on sarcopenia. Others concerned <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2023N06A0934">knee osteoarthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2023N06A0932">lumbar spine fractures</a> and other conditions most often seen in geriatric, rather than pediatric, patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the authors of the out-of-scope papers were from China, most with email addresses not associated with an institution and containing seemingly random sequences of letters and numbers, which some have suggested is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/">sign of paper mill activity</a>. We attempted to email several of these addresses, but our queries went unanswered.</p>



<p>Aside from the issue with the sarcopenia paper, we found <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2023N03A0439">two</a> <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2023N03A0452">letters</a> about “elderly” patients in the June 2023 edition of the journal and <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/article.php?cod=R15Y2024N01A0128">one</a> in the February 2024 edition. We’ve <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRSNfQTIUZCV6AGT3uRmNnatDmSTAOzn5vosz3rTg8A/edit?usp=sharing">compiled a list </a>of out-of-scope papers included in <em>Minerva Pediatrics.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/dorothy-bishop">Dorothy Bishop</a>, a sleuth and emeritus professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford, England, who reviewed the articles for us, noted that in many journals, letters to the editor are not peer reviewed, and are generally “not a suitable format for papers reporting results of clinical trials, which several of these articles claim to be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal, which calls itself the “most ancient international peer-reviewed journal in the field,” <a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/aims-and-scope.php">purports to publish</a> “articles related to Pediatrics and all its various sub-disciplines.” The papers which fall outside of this scope “all look pretty terrible in terms of quality and I think would not survive peer review in a respectable journal,” Bishop said.</p>



<p><em>Minerva Pediatrics</em>’ “<a href="https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-pediatrics/publishing_options.php">publishing options” page</a> says for open access, “authors will be asked to pay” an article processing charge (APC) of €1500, or €1200 for letters to the editor. Publishing for subscription access only is free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three other journals from the publisher, Minerva Medica,<em> </em>were denied <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">impact factors</a> by Clarivate this year due to suspicion of citation manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cecilia Belletti, a representative from the publisher, thanked us for our email but did not respond to our questions about why research on elderly patients was included in the pediatric journal or whether her company would remove the suspect papers. </p>



<p>“A proper editor would be horrified to find this material in their journal and would take steps to sack the editor who let this material through,” Bishop said. “Any other reaction would be suspect.”</p>

<p>A political scientist in Canada copied his postdoc’s work without credit in a paper, according to the retraction notice and a university inquiry report<em>.</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00307270231201871">paper</a> by <a href="https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/political-science/people-in-the-department/charles-conteh/">Charles Conteh</a>, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, appeared in Sage’s <em>Outlook on Agriculture</em> in October 2023. It has one citation, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>An inquiry by Brock identified plagiarism and uncredited authorship in the article, according to the report finalized this March and seen by Retraction Watch. Failure to give post-doctoral fellows the “opportunity to publish in peer-reviewed journals negatively impacts [them] both reputationally and financially,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129719"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://brocku.ca/esrc/about-us/people/">Amy Lemay</a>, now a science analyst and founder at VISTA Science &amp; Technology Inc., was Conteh’s postdoctoral fellow from August 2020 to January 2023.</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Conteh asked Lemay and another faculty member for feedback in March 2023, on a draft of the article they were writing. After reviewing their feedback, Conteh said he could no longer proceed with the project, citing “serious reservations” about Lemay’s suggestions to publish separate papers based on <a href="https://niagaraknowledgeexchange.com/economic-prosperity/growing-agri-innovation-investigating-the-barriers-and-drivers-to-the-adoption-of-automation-and-robotics-in-ontarios-agriculture-sector/">policy reports</a> they had produced for Niagara’s Community Observatory platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can (and most likely will) cite them in future papers, but I object to the idea of us reproducing and republishing them in their current forms,” Conteh wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch. “I plan to revisit this project at a future date, but at this point, after some reflection, what I can candidly say is that I am not clear about a collaborative way forward.”</p>



<p>Months later, Lemay discovered the published paper online by accident. The article used text from the policy briefs she had worked on, without citing those sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When it finally sunk in, I was angry (outraged, really) and felt betrayed,” Lemay told Retraction Watch. “I took a couple of days to calm down and think through my options for responding. I knew what Dr. Conteh had done was wrong. I felt that I was in a unique position to call it out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lemay asked Conteh to add her as a co-author to the paper. In October, Conteh asked a journal editor if the authorship could be updated to include Lemay and another co-author&#8217;s name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conteh replied he was “glad that you&#8217;ve suddenly taken an interest in being a co-author in the manuscript now that it has been published. I am adding your name not because I think you deserve it or are entitled to it, but because it is the noble thing to do.”</p>



<p>In November, <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/author/jillian-lenne">Jillian Lenne</a>, an editor at <em>Outlook on Agriculture</em>,<em> </em>said it was too late to update the authorship as the paper was already accepted. Lemay then requested Sage retract the paper for misrepresented authorship and copying previous publications without citation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to Lemay’s request for retraction, Conteh wrote in the email she “has no basis for claiming co-authorship or requesting retraction of a paper she did not write.” Conteh said Lemay’s acknowledgment in the manuscript as a postdoc should have been sufficient. “By the logic of Amy&#8217;s claim to authorship, all research assistants I&#8217;ve hired to help me on a project should claim co-authorship whenever I publish an article that draws from a data source they helped me collect or analyze,” he wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lemay said she finds Conteh’s views on authorship troublesome and that she was responsible for the majority of the research. “This view about what constitutes co-authorship contradicts one of the most fundamental and canonical academic principles,” she said. “That it is an attitude that may be held by other faculty is a serious concern that needs to be addressed to protect graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.”</p>



<p>The article was retracted in May, with the following notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Due to the unattributed text which calls into question the author contributions in this article, the Journal Editor has retracted this article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Conteh, who disagreed with the retraction, told Retraction Watch he has no further comment beyond reiterating he was the principal investigator of the project and the retracted article came from that project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lemay said the citations listed in the retraction are incorrect because they credit Conteh as the lead author when it should be her. A spokesperson for Sage said they are working to correct the citations.</p>



<p>Though she recently finished a postdoc, Lemay worked in academia for 25 years before pursuing her PhD. At this point in her career, she said, she is not intimidated by the “power imbalance” in academia, as some younger students who are still forging a career path may be.</p>

                <p>Predictive processing is one of the most influential ideas from computational neuroscience for the experimental neurosciences. However, definitions of predictive processing vary broadly, to the extent that &#8220;predictive coding&#8221; is used sometimes in a very narrow sense (there are specific cell types for negative or positive expectation errors) or in a very broad sense (anything related to error signals or expectation mismatch is predictive processing).</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qEadPMEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Jerome Lecoq</a> now started the great initiative to write a review about error signals for predictive processing, but in a very collaborative manner. He invited anybody interested to join the writing of the review.</p>

<p>I think that this way of writing a collaborative and open review is a great idea, even though it might be difficult to reconcile all the different opinions! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-nbAIGfEMysqPjCi4bqyUkp6c2hDet_cGKl8q5nfRM/edit">This link</a> will lead you to the Google document with the main text and with the instructions on how to contribute. And if you don&#8217;t feel like you want to contribute, it is at least a useful opportunity to learn about the current opinions in the field and how people agree or disagree about the interpretation of predictive coding, error signals and the literature that covers both. Take a look!</p>

<p>Elsevier is investigating the journal <em>Geoscience Frontiers</em> after a PubPeer thread flagged an editorial advisor whose articles in the journal were edited by his frequent co-authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/geoscience-frontiers/about/editorial-board">editorial advisor</a>, <a href="https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/m.santosh">M. Santosh</a>, is a professor at the University of Adelaide in Australia and a “Highly Cited Researcher” with more than 1,500 published articles, <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-2563-2012">according to Clarivate’s Web of Science</a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0631B15B8773EAA02B76D3AC34B3DB">PubPeer commenter</a>, “Desmococcus antarctica,” noted that two associate editors of the journal, <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/EditorialBoarddetails/422.htm">Vinod O. Samuel</a> of Yonsei University in Seoul and <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/419">Erath Shaji</a> of the University of Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram, India,&nbsp; are often listed as “Handling Editors” of Santosh’s articles published in <em>Geoscience Frontiers — </em>despite each frequently publishing other work with him.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129716"></span>



<p>A representative from Elsevier told us the publisher was looking into the matter, adding that “we expect our publishing partners to uphold our publishing policies, including the proper conduct of peer-review.” Elsevier publishes <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/index.htm"><em>Geoscience Frontiers</em></a> on behalf of China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of the researchers have responded to our request for comment, nor has <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/EditorialBoard">Xuanxue Mo</a>, editor-in-chief of the journal and professor at China University of Geosciences (Beijing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel edited at least 20 of Santosh’s papers in <em>Geoscience Frontiers </em>from 2017 to 2024, according to the PubPeer post<em>.</em> “Due to the massiveness of the scale on which this happened,” the Pub Peer comment stops at 20 instances, Desmococcus states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel and Santosh have co-authored at least 15 papers together in multiple journals, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Shaji edited at least 10 of Santosh’s articles<em> </em>in <em>Geoscience Frontiers </em>from 2017 to 2024. The two were co-authors on at least 29 papers from 2016 to 2023 in different journals, according to Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Desmococcus has flagged many other <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=M.+Santosh+geoscience+frontiers">papers by Santosh in <em>Geoscience Frontiers</em></a> on PubPeer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond <em>Geoscience Frontiers,</em> Desmococcus has chronicled similar instances of Santosh’s frequent co-authors editing his papers at other journals, <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/06/28/schneider-shorts-28-06-2024-a-series-of-improper-erroneous-and-potentially-fraudulent-manipulations/#santosh">as reported</a> by For Better Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one incident, a report from the 5GH Foundation, a China-based “<a href="http://www.5gh.ac.cn/About.html">non-profit organization for promoting science and technology</a>,” <a href="http://www.5gh.org.cn/WuGH/20240603.001.html">alleged</a> Santosh had initially been listed as the handling editor of his own paper at <em>Geoscience Frontiers.</em> The <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/en/article/doi/10.1016/j.gsf.2024.101804">paper</a> now lists <a href="https://appliedgeochemistsindia.org/pdf/Manikyamba.pdf">Chakravadhanula Manikyamba</a>, a researcher at the National Geophysical Research Institute, as handling editor (although her name is misspelled as “Manikyabma”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manikyamba is another frequent editor of Santosh’s articles in <em>Geoscience Frontiers,</em> as Desmococcus <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0D28D8B0D3BBC66F04FFA6AA832E1F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">points out</a> on PubPeer. She edited at least four of his papers and has co-authored three papers with him since 2022, according to Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santosh’s record also includes a retraction. In 2020, his paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666759220300044">Hydrocarbon reserves of the south China sea: Implications for regional energy security</a>” was removed “because it inadvertently included unlawful content.” The editor-in-chief of the journal where it appeared, <em>Energy Geoscience,</em> did not respond to our request for clarity on what constitutes “unlawful content,” but an Elsevier spokesperson told us that the authors requested the removal “because they had inadvertently breached legal regulations.”</p>



<p>Elsevier’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal">website</a> states it will remove an article only in “extremely limited number of cases,” in which the article is “defamatory, or infringes others’ legal rights, and retraction is not a sufficient remedy.” An article will also be removed if Elsevier “has good reason to expect it will be” the subject of a court order, or if it would pose a “serious health risk” if acted upon.</p>

<p>In an episode reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-science-crisis-ai-generated-rat-giant-penis-image-2024-3">AI-generated graphic of a rat</a> with a giant penis, another paper with an anatomically incorrect image has been retracted after it attracted attention on social media. The authors admit using ChatGPT to make the diagram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2024/07120/assessment_of_the_efficacy_of_alkaline_water_in.91.aspx">retraction notice</a> published July 12, the article, by researchers at Guangdong Provincial Hydroelectric Hospital in Guangzhou, China, was retracted after “concerns were raised over the integrity of the data and an inaccurate figure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, published in Lippincott’s <em>Medicine</em>, purported to describe a randomized controlled trial that found alkaline water could reduce pain and alleviate symptoms of chronic gouty arthritis.</p>



<span id="more-129699"></span>



<p><a href="https://thehealthhammer.wordpress.com/about/">Morgan Pfiffner</a>, a researcher for Examine.com, an online database for nutrition and supplement research, first noticed the study while on vacation and <a href="https://x.com/MorganPfiffner/status/1808586391959326976">posted</a> on X about the erroneous diagram in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I planned to inform the journal when I got back, but that graphic was just too absurd not to share on social media once I saw it,” Pfiffner told Retraction Watch. Another X user found the paper’s introduction to be 100% AI-generated.</p>



<p>Commenters including Elisabeth Bik and Thomas Kesteman <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0662F1D2E21480EB8307A1C2DFDE4D#">chimed in</a> on PubPeer, echoing Pfiffner’s concerns. Bik pointed out that Figure 4 had the wrong number of bones in the lower leg and arm and had nonsensical labels such as &#8220;chlsinkestead atlvs no ctivktty greuedis&#8221; and &#8220;Aliainine jerve sreiter.&#8221; She also noted inconsistencies in the data and seemingly unrealistic methods.</p>



<p>Kesteman highlighted additional issues: Some of the references in the article do not appear in PubMed or Google Scholar, and the authors’ email addresses were not institutional – which, we note, is considered a red flag but not always a sign of problems. Further, the results of some statistical analyses were “virtually impossible,” Kesteman said, and data on pain scores in a table “present patterns that are impossible to find in real life.”</p>



<p>Yong Wu, the corresponding author of the study, told Retraction Watch English is not the team’s first language, and the cost for translation was prohibitively expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Therefore, our research team has resorted to using AI for text translation and refinement. Similarly, the expense of scientific illustration is beyond our means, which led us to use ChatGPT for generating research diagrams,” Wu said. “We apologize for any controversy this may have caused.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Medicine</em> said the journal is continually improving its editorial review process. “We are working on a number of initiatives to help shape the future of medical research reviews based on collaboration with other leading publishers, dedication to peer reviews and leveraging new technologies,” they said.</p>



<p>“It seems to me that AI graphic itself was just the tip of the iceberg of research misconduct permeating that study,” Pfiffner said. “I&#8217;m glad it has been swiftly retracted.”</p>

<p>Unenlagiine theropods are a group of dinosaurs that are key to understanding how living birds evolved. However, fossils of these dinosaurs are rare, especially from the Late Cretaceous period. Therefore, it has been rather challenging to piece together their evolutionary history and understand the modifications that occurred within the Unenlagiinaen lineage over time.</p>
<p>A recent paper published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> describes the discovery of <em>Diuqin lechiguanae</em> gen. et sp. nov., a new unenlagiine theropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (Santonian) Bajo de la Carpa Formation in Neuquén Province, Argentina. This new taxon, described from an incomplete postcranial skeleton, exhibits unique morphological features, particularly in the humerus, which appears intermediate between older and younger unenlagiines. Phylogenetic analysis places Diuqin within Paraves, with a strong affinity to Unenlagiinae. Interestingly, the humerus bears tooth marks, likely from a crocodyliform, mammal, or another theropod, which offers additional insights into the paleoecology of these theropods and their interactions with other animal species of their time. This finding marks a significant advancement in the field of paleontology, bridging a 15-million-year gap in the unenlagiine fossil record.</p>

<p>Iodine is crucial for producing thyroid hormones and maintaining thyroid gland health, with deficiencies leading to goiter and severe developmental issues, including growth and mental impairments. Historically, Switzerland faced significant iodine deficiency, causing high rates of goiter and cretinism until iodine fortification of salt began in the early 20th century. Despite the success of these programs in reducing goiter prevalence, some cases remain, emphasizing the need to explore additional factors, including genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>To examine the genetic factors contributing to goiter development, despite adequate iodine supplementation, a recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Genomics</em> assessed the feasibility of extracting and analyzing DNA from historical blood spots found in medical records of patients with iodine deficiency-induced goiter and thyroid cancer between 1929 and 1989 in Switzerland. The researchers found that DNA yields varied significantly between samples, with many showing substantial degradation and mixtures of DNA from different contributors. The study concludes that each sample must be individually evaluated for genetic analysis, and larger or entire blood ablations should be collected to mitigate insufficient DNA quantities.</p>
<p>The impact of this advance is significant for historical epidemiology and genetic research, as it allows for the exploration of genetic predispositions in populations from past decades, potentially leading to a better understanding of disease causes and the development of targeted interventions.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13665 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia-300x201.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The production of conventional fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate, significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation due to energy-intensive processes and the release of nitrous oxide. In contrast, green ammonia production, which uses renewable energy sources for hydrogen generation, tries to reduce carbon footprints and environmental impact, thereby offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods.</p>
<p>A recent Comment article published in <em>BMC Environmental Science</em>, takes a close look at the term &#8220;green ammonia,&#8221; especially in areas with limited water resources. The authors point out that while green ammonia is produced using green hydrogen (which comes from water split using renewable energy) and does cut down on carbon emissions, it still has other serious environmental effects. These include a high demand for fresh water and potential ecological harm from desalination.</p>
<p>The authors argue that the fertiliser industry should use a wider perspective on environmental impact, focusing not only on carbon emissions but also on reducing the flow of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus. They suggest that recycling human waste and other organic materials could be a better and more sustainable option than green ammonia. This approach could greatly cut down on carbon emissions and nutrient pollution.</p>

<p>Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which leads to higher concentrations of carbonic acid in seawater, significant effects the marine ecosystem. As we are facing increasingly adverse climatic parameters, understanding how animals respond to future environmental conditions is crucial for predicting their adaptability and survival.</p>
<p>In a recent study published in <em>BMC Genomics,</em> Thomas et al. investigated the neurobiological effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the two-toned pygmy squid (<em>Idiosepius pygmaeus</em>). By using a <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly approach, the authors assessed transcriptomic alterations in the squid&#8217;s central nervous system (CNS) and eyes under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and correlated molecular changes with varying CO<sub>2</sub> levels and behavioral modifications.</p>
<p>Their findings indicate that OA triggers transcriptomic responses related to neurotransmission, neuroplasticity, immune function, and oxidative stress. These molecular changes were also associated with changes in behavior (e.g. increased activity levels and changes in visually guided interactions), suggesting a mechanistic link between environmental changes and behavioral responses.</p>

Tetris, a popular computer game, may offer a novel method for reducing PTSS by minimizing intrusive memories associated with trauma. This review aims to evaluate the potential of Tetris as an intervention for preterm parents, exploring its feasibility and effectiveness in mitigating PTSS within this vulnerable population.</p>
<p>A study published in <em>BMC Digital Health</em> investigated the potential application of the computer game “Tetris” as an initial intervention to alleviate post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents of preterm infants within Neonatal Units (NNUs). In their scoping review of 13 relevant articles, Craig et al. identified four recurring themes: memory consolidation, the impact of Tetris on intrusive memories (IMs), its neurological effects, and its feasibility in clinical trials.</p>
<p>The review shows that playing Tetris can interfere with the consolidation of traumatic memories, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of disturbing memories. Additionally, the game is deemed both acceptable and feasible for clinical implementation, suggesting it could serve as a beneficial tool for preterm parents in mitigating PTSS.</p>
