<p>A correction to a clinical trial on a potential treatment for COVID-19 has taken more than a year — and counting — to get published. In the meantime, the article remains marked with an expression of concern that appeared in February 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Lancet Regional Health–Americas </em>published <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00138-1/fulltext">the study</a>, a randomized clinical trial of the effect of metformin on hospitalization rates among COVID-19 patients, in December 2021. It has been cited 36 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, 12 of those since the publication of the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00030-9/fulltext">expression of concern</a>.</p>



<p>In December 2023, the authors “identified small errors in the statistical analysis primary outcome,” corresponding author Edward Mills, a health research methods professor at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario, told Retraction Watch. “We immediately re-ran the analysis and submitted as an erratum,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131765"></span>



<p>At that point, the journal asked the university to investigate, a spokesperson for The Lancet Group told us by email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The editors of The Lancet Regional Health – Americas asked McMaster University for an investigation into the analyses from the TOGETHER trial in January 2024. We received the final report from McMaster University on 21st April 2025 which stated the hearing committee concluded the author did not breach the University&#8217;s research integrity policy. We are now working with the authors on the best way to correct the record and will keep you updated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The university’s final report came six days after we contacted McMaster about the paper. Jennifer Stranges, communications and media relations manager at McMaster, told us on April 15: “Information about concerns or potential investigative processes are confidential, and anything to be released to the public would be done so at the completion of the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So a year and 3 months just for them to agree that we weren’t conducting any malfeasance,” Mills said. He said he expects the correction will be published “within the next few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stranges did not reply to our question on why the investigation took so long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McMaster <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/10/spider-researcher-jonathan-pruitt-faked-data-in-multiple-papers-university-finds/">made headlines a few years ago</a> for its investigation into behavioral ecologist Jonathan Pruitt. Questions about Pruitt’s work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/20/im-starting-the-year-off-with-something-i-didnt-expect-to-ever-do-im-retracting-a-paper/">garnered public attention</a> in January 2020 and were reported to the university around the same time. The university found Pruitt “engaged in data falsification and fabrication in several papers,” all before joining the faculty, according to <a href="https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/worthmentioning/update-on-research-misconduct-case/">a May 2023 statement</a> from the university.</p>



<p>The TOGETHER trial was a multi-arm clinical trial at 13 clinics in Brazil set up to test different drugs in people with COVID-19 at high risk for complications. The metformin arm of the trial started treating patients in January 2021, and the safety committee recommended halting it that April, as the drug was not affecting outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other arms of the trial tested <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2115869">ivermectin</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779044">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00448-4/fulltext">fluvoxamine</a>, among other drugs.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/univ-of-zurich-main-building.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="604" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/univ-of-zurich-main-building.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131751" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/univ-of-zurich-main-building.jpg 1000w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/univ-of-zurich-main-building-300x181.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/univ-of-zurich-main-building-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">University of Zurich</figcaption></figure>



<p>The university ethics committee that reviewed a controversial study that deployed AI-generated posts on a Reddit forum made recommendations the researchers did not heed, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principal investigator on the study has received a formal warning, and the university’s ethics committees will implement a more rigorous review process for future studies, a university official said.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/experiment-using-ai-generated-posts-on-reddit-draws-fire-for-ethics-concerns/">we reported yesterday</a>, researchers at the University of Zurich tested whether a large language model, or LLM, can persuade people to change their minds by posting messages on the Reddit subforum r/ChangeMyView (CMV). The moderators of the forum <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">notified the subreddit</a> about the study and their interactions with the researchers in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">a post published April 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131750"></span>



<p>The identity of the researchers and the department they work in has not been made public. We reached out via their project’s email address, and they referred us to the University of Zurich media relations office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rita Ziegler, head of media relations AI at the University of Zurich, told us by email today that the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences reviewed the research study in April 2024. It was part of a larger project, and one of four studies, on “investigating the potential of artificial intelligence to reduce polarization in value-based political discourse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ziegler continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In its opinion on the project, the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences advised the researchers that the study in question was considered to be exceptionally challenging and therefore a) the chosen approach should be better justified, b) the participants should be informed as much as possible, and c) the rules of the platform should be fully complied with.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recommendations from the ethics committees are not legally binding, Ziegler said. “The researchers themselves are responsible for carrying out the project and publishing the results.”<br><br>Whether the researchers changed their approach based on that opinion or other factors is unclear, but they did not inform the CMV moderators, nor the CMV commenters, about the study until after the researchers finished their data collection, as we noted in yesterday’s story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CMV has a rule against undisclosed use of AI, and Reddit itself has a rule that states, “don’t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.” The study violated both of those policies, CMV moderator u/DuhChappers told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The relevant authorities at the University of Zurich are aware of the incidents and will now investigate them in detail and critically review the relevant assessment processes,” Ziegler said. The principal investigator of the study has been issued a formal warning, Nathalie Huber, a media relations officer, said.</p>



<p>Reddit has issued a response to the study as well. Reddit&#8217;s chief legal officer Ben Lee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/comment/mpk1u3c/">posted on the CMV thread</a>: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>What this University of Zurich team did is deeply wrong on both a moral and legal level. It violates academic research and human rights norms, and is prohibited by Reddit’s user agreement and rules, in addition to the subreddit rules. We have banned all accounts associated with the University of Zurich research effort.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reddit is &#8220;in the process of reaching out to the University of Zurich and this particular research team with formal legal demands,&#8221; Lee said in the post.</p>



<p>As a result of this study, the University of Zurich’s ethics committee of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences “intends to adopt a stricter review process in the future and, in particular, to coordinate with the communities on the platforms prior to experimental studies,” Ziegler said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers made available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eo4SHrKGPErTzL1t_QmQhfZGU27jKBjx/view">a preliminary article</a> on the work, but Ziegler told us the researchers have decided not to publish the findings.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a tad longer than I intended since our intro on differential equations came out, but hopefully that means you had some extra time for memory consolidation. Otherwise, you can refresh your memory <a href="https://neurofrontiers.blog/building-a-virtual-neuron-1/">here</a>. Today it&#8217;s finally time to tackle the long-awaited virtual neuron. But before we jump in, we need to have a quick housekeeping chat. As you can already glimpse from the list below, we mean business this time, so I strongly recommend that you read this article in chunks. Then again, I&#8217;m just a disembodied voice on the Internet and I can&#8217;t tell you what to do.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defining-the-goal">Defining the goal</h2>



<p>First, we need to understand what we want to do. &#8220;Building a virtual neuron&#8221; sounds cool (well, about as cool as math can ever sound), but it tells us surprisingly little about the task. We need to define the <em>level</em> at which we build this neuron. Do we want to simulate every protein and ion, and all their interactions? I mean, maybe. I admit that does sound pretty cool, but would we be able to interpret the results? My computational neuroscience professor used to say: &#8220;If you build a simulation as complex as the system you&#8217;re studying, you now have two systems you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; And leaving that aside, could we even construct such a simulation right now? Well, no, not really. So instead we need to define three things:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>what we want to do;</li>



<li>what we can and want to get out of it;</li>



<li>what we can realistically accomplish.</li>
</ol>



<p>For today, we want to build a model capable of producing action potentials, just like real neurons (1). We want to use this model to understand how neurons produce these potentials and how they are affected by both external stimuli and ion channel properties (2). And we can realistically accomplish this with a run-of-the-mill laptop and our own brains (3).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-plurality-of-virtual-neurons">The plurality of virtual neurons</h2>



<p>There isn&#8217;t just one single way to simulate a neuron. In fact, there are <em>a lot</em> of options. If you don&#8217;t believe me, have a look <a href="https://modeldb.science/modellist/3537">here</a>. Choosing a computational model is an act of balance between complexity and efficiency. On the one hand, we want something complex enough to capture what we&#8217;re interested in: for example, if we want to know what happens to a neuron when we mess with its calcium channels, we need a model that includes them. On the other hand, this model needs to run on the available hardware and we should be able to make some sense of its results. So if we only care about calcium channels, it&#8217;s not such a good idea to include 300 other <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-neuro-092920-121538">types</a> of ion channels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-foundation-model">The foundation model</h2>



<p>For today, I&#8217;ve chosen the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. As some of you might already know, this is kind of the bedrock of modern computational modeling, and often the first boss you will encounter if you ever attend such a course.</p>



<p>While arguably not the first computational model, the HH was pioneering as a quantitative, dynamic, biologically grounded one, and it remains remarkably elegant to this day. Of course, now it&#8217;s quite easy to look at it and think &#8220;well, big whoop, we already know how action potentials work&#8221;. But given the limited amount of information Hodgkin and Huxley had available at the time, it&#8217;s nothing short of fascinating how well the model reproduced empirical data and what predictions they were able to derive from it.</p>



<p>At the same time, coming from the biology side, I always had a bunch of questions about action potentials that remained largely unanswered until I made my way through the math jungle. For example, why do sodium (Na+) channels open slowly at first, then all at once? Why does the threshold for spike generation have that value and not another one? Why do potassium (K+) channels take so long to open? And why is it that we don&#8217;t always get one spike after another?</p>



<p>As we work our way through the model, we will be answering these questions and more. But similar to the previous article, we&#8217;ll start with a series of small, made-up examples (the code to follow along is <a href="https://codeberg.org/neuronerd/VirtualNeuron/src/branch/main/Part2">here</a>) and work our way up to the main beast. I <em>hope</em> that these examples bring clarity, but if they have the opposite effect, please let me know in the comments. That way, I can improve this guide (and future ones).</p>



<p>Throughout, I&#8217;ll try to highlight the underlying biology, as well as what Hodgkin and Huxley actually knew at the time. If you&#8217;d like a refresher on neuron structure and function, we do have&nbsp;<a href="https://neurofrontiers.blog/neuron-structure-and-function/">this older post</a>&nbsp;covering the basics, but I&#8217;ll try to weave those concepts in as we go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-cats-to-neurons">From cats to neurons</h2>



<p>Abstracting the movements of a <a href="https://neurofrontiers.blog/building-a-virtual-neuron-1/">cat</a> to math is somewhat straightforward. If we get stuck in the equation, we have something tangible to go back to. So before we start with the math, let&#8217;s try to build the same kind of concreteness for neurons and action potentials.</p>



<p>We can begin from the same information Hodgkin and Huxley had available at the time. Neurons are enclosed by membranes, which usually block the movement of ions. Since the membrane is typically sealed, we can have different concentrations of ions on both sides: more Na+ outside, more K+ inside. While they didn&#8217;t yet know how these concentration gradients were maintained, HH recognized their importance.</p>



<p>They also observed that, if one were to place an electrode outside of the neuron and stick another one inside, a potential difference in voltage of about -65 mV could be measured (by the way, these days it&#8217;s also known the exact voltage difference varies by neuron type). In other words, the inside of the cell is more negative compared to the outside. Importantly, the value and its sign don&#8217;t matter that much, at least not for understanding the general principles. What matters is that there is a measurable difference and that sometimes <em>there is a change</em> in this difference.</p>



<p>If the membrane were forever sealed to the passage of any and all ions, then that would be the end of the story. We&#8217;d have no action potential to talk about (and we couldn&#8217;t anyway, because no intelligence, language, movement, nothing). But sometimes, the membrane allows ions to flow through it. You can imagine the ion concentrations we mentioned above as water stored in a tank. There&#8217;s much more Na+ outside the neuron than inside, so when the Na+ &#8220;tap&#8221; (i.e., ion channels) opens, Na+ rushes&nbsp;into&nbsp;the neuron, like water gushing into an empty chamber. This happens very fast and leads to a temporary reversal of the voltage difference sign: the inside becomes more positive than the outside. Then the Na⁺ tap closes and the K+ tap opens, allowing K+ to flow out and bring things back to normal.</p>



<p>This information is pretty much all we need for the HH model, although I&#8217;m sure you still have some questions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="small-detour-1-hypothesized-but-not-modeled">Small detour # 1: hypothesized, but not modeled</h3>



<p>We mentioned above that Hodgkin and Huxley didn&#8217;t know how the Na+ and K+ gradients were maintained. However, they hypothesized there must be some active mechanism that pushes Na+ out and brings K+ into the neuron, thus working to maintain the concentration gradients. Otherwise, each neuron would only have a few action potentials to fire before the ion concentration on both sides of the membrane equalizes.</p>



<p>And they were right. Years later, we found out that there are proteins embedded in the membrane, called ion pumps, that are open only on one side of the neuron at a time. They act kind of like a shuttle bus that only allows Na+ to board from the inside going out and K+ from the outside going in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="small-detour-2-positive-yet-negative">Small detour # 2: positive, yet negative?</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not lost on any of you that: 1) both Na+ and K+ are positive ions, and 2) cells, including neurons, aren&#8217;t electrically charged. So how can we talk about a voltage difference?</p>



<p>There are a few key points here:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>overall, the amount of positive and negative charges is equal both inside and outside the membrane, but it&#8217;s the <strong><em>distribution</em></strong> of these charges close to the membrane that makes a difference;</li>



<li>inside the neuron, there are also large negatively charged proteins which can&#8217;t leave the cell and tend to cluster close to the membrane;</li>



<li>even though both Na+ and K+ each carry a +1 charge, the concentration of Na+ outside the cell is larger than that of K+ inside the cell (around 150 mM for Na+ vs 100 mM for K+, depending on neuron type). Additionally, the pump we mentioned earlier throws out 3 Na+ ions for every 2 K+ brought in, thus maintaining the imbalance;</li>



<li>there are also some K+ channels that remain open at rest. Due to the K+ concentration gradient, some of it flows out of the neuron, which means that some positive charge trickles outward, leaving the inside slightly more negative relative to the outside.</li>
</ol>



<p>The combination of these factors generates the voltage difference measured by Hodgkin and Huxley.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-neurons-to-circuits">From neurons to circuits</h2>



<p>Coming back to our neuron model, now that we have the biology basics, we can begin to abstract. But instead of inventing an entirely new mathematical framework to describe how neurons behave, Hodgkin and Huxley realized that it was easier to repurpose what was already in the physics of electric circuits.</p>



<p>All the elements we described above have an equivalent in a circuit:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>since the <em>membrane</em> stores charge, it behaves like something called a <strong>capacitor</strong>, i.e. a device which stores charge by accumulating it on two closely spaced surfaces insulated from each other;</li>



<li>the only way for ions to passively go through the membrane is through <em>ion channels</em>, which are typically closed. In other words, the channels provide resistance to the flow of ions, so we can represent them through <strong>resistors</strong>;</li>



<li>we also explained that there are differences in the concentration of ions between the inside and the outside of the neuron and that these differences drive the ion flow, so the <em>ion concentration differences</em> are our <strong>voltage sources</strong> or <strong>batteries</strong>;</li>



<li>and finally, although not explicitly included in the HH model, the <em>ion pumps</em> which restore the concentration gradients represent the <strong>current sources</strong> in our circuit, pushing ions in a specific direction to keep the system going.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I said, even at the time, there was already a lot of math for how to work with electrical circuits. And that&#8217;s the key for cracking our simulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-measurements-to-interventions">From measurements to interventions</h2>



<p>In the circuit above, we could measure the voltage difference of the inside compared to the outside of the membrane. In fact, that&#8217;s what Hodgkin and Huxley did at first. They used giant axons from squids and silver electrodes to measure the so-called <em>membrane</em> or <em>resting potential</em>, which we said sits at around -65 mV.</p>



<p>But measurements alone aren&#8217;t enough. And by itself, the neuron and its membrane potential at rest aren&#8217;t that exciting. We want action…potentials. Those happen when neurons receive stimuli or input. One could try to do these measurements <em>in vivo</em>, that is when the one neuron we measure receives input naturally, either from other neurons or from the environment. But in this particular situation, Hodgkin and Huxley wanted to have precise control over the neuron&#8217;s input and they wanted to use the circuit framework from above. So instead, they used another set of electrodes to directly inject current into the axon of an isolated neuron.</p>



<p>Now, looking at the circuit diagram, physics tells us that if we inject some external current (we&#8217;ll call it <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext}" class="latex" />) into this system before the point where the individual elements (capacitor and resistors) are branching out, this current will split to flow through each available path. So we&#8217;ll have a capacitive current <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_c" class="latex" /> and, for each type of channel, ionic currents, which for now we&#8217;ll lump under a generic <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ion}" class="latex" />. As nothing is lost in this idealized circuit, our original <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext}" class="latex" /> will be the sum of the currents flowing through the individual elements, so: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D+%3D+I_c+%2B+I_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext} = I_c + I_{ion}" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>Cool, but we actually care about voltage, right? That&#8217;s what the action potential is, a change in voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the neuron over time. Yes, and here&#8217;s how physics helps us again: it tells us that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_c" class="latex" /> &#8211; our capacitive or membrane current, can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the voltage, i.e. our old friend <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dx}{dt}" class="latex" />. Since we&#8217;re talking about membrane voltage, we&#8217;ll just rename <em>x</em> to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" />. And the full formula is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_c+%3D+C_m+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_c = C_m &#92;cdot &#92;frac{dV_m}{dt}" class="latex" />, where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m" class="latex" /> represents something called the membrane capacitance, and it&#8217;s just a constant, a number that we normally determine experimentally or read from a paper that already measured it. In this case, Hodgkin and Huxley measured <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m" class="latex" /> and found it equal to 1 (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+F%2Fcm%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu F/cm^2" class="latex" />, but don&#8217;t stress about the units yet; by the way, what you&#8217;ve just heard is the collective shudder of all the world&#8217;s physicists at the idea of not stressing about units).</p>



<p>With that, we can rewrite <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D+%3D+C_m+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%2B+I_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext} = C_m &#92;cdot &#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} + I_{ion}" class="latex" />, and shifting the terms, we get <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+-I_%7Bion%7D+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m &#92;cdot &#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{ion} + I_{ext}" class="latex" />. Since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m" class="latex" /> is a constant, you will often see it written on the same side as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt}" class="latex" /> (basically, constant = we don&#8217;t care much about it), but to make it clearer, we can also isolate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BC_m%7D+%5Ccdot+%28-I_%7Bion%7D+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = &#92;frac{1}{C_m} &#92;cdot (-I_{ion} + I_{ext})" class="latex" />. This will be our stepping stone for the full model. The lefthand side of the equation won&#8217;t change anymore. That&#8217;s the potential we&#8217;ve been wanting to simulate for a while now. The righthand side will gradually expand in complexity until it allows us to get something looking like the image below:</p>

<p>But just because this example is so simple, it doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t extract any information from it. We observe that the higher the input current <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext}" class="latex" /> is, the faster our membrane voltage <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" /> increases. And of course, if there is no input whatsoever, nothing happens.</p>



<p>We can also check what happens if we start from different <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" /> values at <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" /> (in this case, -100 mV, -65 mV, and 10 mV).

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to tackle <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ion}" class="latex" />. Instead of zero, we could give it another random value, like 3. But no matter what <em>fixed</em> value we give it, the only thing that would change in our equation <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BC_m%7D+%5Ccdot+%28-I_%7Bion%7D+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = &#92;frac{1}{C_m} &#92;cdot (-I_{ion} + I_{ext})" class="latex" /> would be how fast the membrane voltage increases. More importantly, we know this is unrealistic in neurons because when Na+ and K+ channels open and the ions travel from one side of the membrane to the other, the ionic currents also change.</p>



<p>That means <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ion}" class="latex" /> needs to be not a constant, but a <em>function</em>. More specifically, a function which changes over <em>time</em> (and later, over <em>voltage</em> too). One such example would be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bion%7D%28t%29+%3D+-t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ion}(t) = -t" class="latex" /> &#8211; at every time step, our ionic current would be equal to the negative value of that time step.

<p>We see that the membrane voltage now rises <em>much</em> faster, up to very unrealistic values (in practice, if we actually injected the current necessary for reaching such voltages, we&#8217;d fry the neuron long before getting there). And if we were to slightly vary either <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext}" class="latex" /> or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m%28t%3D0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m(t=0)" class="latex" /> as we did above, there would be barely any noticeable difference in the result.</p>



<p>But remember how we represented our ion channels through resistors? Similar to capacitors, there is also a formula that relates current and voltage for these elements: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bion%7D+%3D+g_%7Bion%7D+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_%7Bion%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ion} = g_{ion} &#92;cdot (V_m - V_{ion})" class="latex" />. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" /> is our membrane voltage, the one we&#8217;ve been plotting so far. So our base equation now expands into <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+-g_%7Bion%7D+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_%7Bion%7D%29+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_{ion} &#92;cdot (V_m - V_{ion}) + I_{ext}" class="latex" /> (I&#8217;ve moved <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m" class="latex" /> to the lefthand side to avoid using too many brackets). <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ion}" class="latex" /> is the conductance for that ion. Conductance is a measure of how easily electric current flows through a material. In our case, this means how easily the ions pass through their respective channels. For now, we will pretend that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ion}" class="latex" /> is a constant, like 0.1 (mS/<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cm%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="cm^2" class="latex" />).</p>



<p>And <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_{ion}" class="latex" /> is our battery from the circuit above. It represents the equilibrium potential of each ion, what they aspire to, and the voltage at which the membrane would settle if there were no other ions around and if the membrane were permeable all the time. In this case, we don&#8217;t need to pretend: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7Bion%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_{ion}" class="latex" /> is always constant for a given ion type. For example, for Na+, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_{Na}" class="latex" /> is about +45 mV. If the membrane potential, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" />, were equal to +45 mV, we would say that Na+ is at equilibrium and there would be no movement of Na+ ions across the membrane. In real neurons, this is never reached, since other ions have different equilibrium potentials (for example, K+ sits at around -82 mV), but we&#8217;ll learn more about that later.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="small-detour-3-that-nernst-guy">Small detour # 3: that Nernst guy</h3>



<p>But hold up: what does ion concentration have to do with voltage? And where do ion equilibrium potentials actually come from? Well, in practice, from neat little tables.</p>



<p>But conceptually, we need to make something clear, using Na+ as an example: we said that there are more Na+ ions outside than inside the neuron, so there is a higher concentration of Na+ on the outside of the membrane. If we open the tap, this concentration difference will push Na+ inside. But when does the pushing stop? Is it when the Na+ concentration is exactly equal on both sides of the membrane? It would be, if only Na+ were the only one around and there were no voltage difference between the two sides of the membrane.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s imagine that we also have those negatively charged proteins from earlier. This changes the game, because even though the concentration of Na+ ions might equalize at some point, there would be another force pulling it in: the negative charge of the proteins, or the electrical gradient. Because these two forces compete, the actual voltage at which no Na+ moves around anymore is the one given above.</p>



<p>We can calculate this number from yet another equation that some guy named Nernst came up with: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7Bion%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BRT%7D%7BzF%7D+%5Ccdot+ln%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Bion%5D_%7Bout%7D%7D%7B%5Bion%5D_%7Bin%7D%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_{ion} = &#92;frac{RT}{zF} &#92;cdot ln(&#92;frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}})" class="latex" />. <em>R, T, z,</em> and <em>F</em> are constants, so we again ignore them. What matters is that this formula allows us to relate the ion concentrations <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bion%5D_%7Bout%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="[ion]_{out}" class="latex" /> (outside) and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bion%5D_%7Bin%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="[ion]_{in}" class="latex" /> (inside) the neuron to voltage, thus giving us the equilibrium potential of each ion.</p>



<p>Bonus: this nifty formula tells us why sudden influxes of K+ can kill you. When the concentration of K+ outside the neuron increases a lot, the equilibrium potential of K+ ends up being much higher than -82 mV. In turn, this messes with the generation of action potentials, thus impairing communication between neurons. Once we have the full HH model, we&#8217;ll be able to check exactly how this happens.</p>

<p>For now, we see that if we were to model just Na+ currents and assume a constant conductance (in this example, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D+%3D+0.1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na} = 0.1" class="latex" /> mS/<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cm%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="cm^2" class="latex" />), the membrane potential would eventually settle to the equilibrium potential of Na+.</p>

<p>But what happens if we keep the resting state voltage the same and change the conductance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}" class="latex" />? A higher conductance means that Na+ ions barrel through channels quicker (because more channels are open, not because the ions move any faster). That translates into the equilibrium potential being reached sooner.</p>

<p>I want to stress here that conductance isn&#8217;t just an abstract thing that makes the graph sharper. In real life, alterations in Na+ channel conductance can have devastating effects. For example, tetrodotoxin, a powerful toxin derived from pufferfish, effectively decreases Na+ conductance to zero by blocking Na+ channels and preventing its influx into the cell. This is deadly. And in different types of epilepsy, Na+ conductance is again affected: either too high or too low, depending on the type of epilepsy. As we&#8217;ll see later, changes in conductance affect the properties of action potentials, such as shape and timing. At the level of the whole brain, this results in abnormal communication between neurons and can lead to the symptoms observed in epilepsy.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+-g_%7BNa%7D+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_%7BNa%7D%29+-+g_K+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_K%29+-+g_l+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_l%29+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_{Na} &#92;cdot (V_m - V_{Na}) - g_K &#92;cdot (V_m - V_K) - g_l &#92;cdot (V_m - V_l) + I_{ext}" class="latex" />. </p>



<p>Simulating this allows us to see that, like before, the membrane voltage settles at an equilibrium point. But this point is no longer equal to the equilibrium voltage of any single ion. Instead, it sits somewhere in-between. This in-between value is nothing more than the weighted average of the contributions of all ions to the membrane potential. The contribution of an ion is given by the product between its equilibrium potential and its conductance, so the full equation reads like this: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7Beq%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bg_%7BNa%7D+%5Ccdot+V_%7BNa%7D+%2B+g_K+%5Ccdot+V_K+%2B+g_l+%5Ccdot+V_l%7D%7Bg_%7BNa%7D+%2B+g_K+%2B+g_l%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_{eq} = &#92;frac{g_{Na} &#92;cdot V_{Na} + g_K &#92;cdot V_K + g_l &#92;cdot V_l}{g_{Na} + g_K + g_l}" class="latex" />.</p>

<p>We saw above that changing the Na+ conductance when only Na+ is present allows us to manipulate how fast we reach the equilibrium potential. But the equilibrium potential itself remains unchanged. But now we have more than one ion, each with their own conductance, and we see in the equation above that the membrane equilibrium potential takes into account conductances as well. So what happens if we change each ionic conductance individually?</p>



<p>We should be able to deduce this from the equation, but we&#8217;ll check it against the simulation results below. The blue line represents our original case from above. Since the K+ equilibrium potential is more negative than our original resting state potential <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" />, increasing the K+ conductance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_K&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_K" class="latex" /> while keeping the Na+ conductance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}" class="latex" /> the same means that the membrane will settle at a new, more negative potential (orange line). In contrast, since the Na+ equilibrium potential is positive, increasing the ionic conductance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}" class="latex" /> while keeping the same <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_K&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_K" class="latex" /> means that our neuron&#8217;s equilibrium potential goes up and we also reach it faster (green line). Now, if we increase <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_K&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_K" class="latex" /> while maintaining this higher <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}" class="latex" />, our membrane resting potential comes down, closer to that of K+. But we still get there fast, since the Na+ conductance is so high (red line).</p>

<p>In principle, we could also play around with the leak conductance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_l&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_l" class="latex" />. However, as we will see later, in the HH model, the leak conductance is always assumed to be static, whereas <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_K&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_K" class="latex" /> do change under certain conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-full-model-everybody-gets-a-function">The full model &#8211; everybody gets a function</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve already added quite a few details to our model, but there&#8217;s still a bit to go on. So far, we have a simulation of the membrane potential which includes multiple ion channels. This model is capable of settling at an equilibrium point, the resting state potential, but it still doesn&#8217;t produce spikes yet. So let&#8217;s fix that. Fair warning, this next part is the trickiest (<em>I know!</em> As if the novel before was <em>soooo</em> <em>easy!)</em>, so go slowly, pause often, and don’t worry if things take a few reads to click.</p>



<p><strong>Key takeaway # 1: conductances are voltage-dependent</strong><br>Let&#8217;s bridge biology and math now: we said that when the Na+ conductance increases (i.e. Na+ channels open), the membrane voltage also increases. But we also know from experiments that when the membrane voltage increases, K+ channels open. In other words, the K+ conductance increases. In math terms, that suggests conductance (for both Na+ and K+) is voltage-dependent.</p>



<p><strong>Key takeaway # 2: there is a maximum conductance</strong><br>Imagine all Na+ channels are open. Even then, there is still a limit to how much Na+ can pass through the membrane at every time step, because the ions need to wait for their turn to go through the channels, just like cars have to wait to pass through a crowded tunnel. That means conductance has a maximum value, which we can call <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D%5E%7Bmax%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na}^{max}" class="latex" />. When all channels are open, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D+%3D+g_%7BNa%7D%5E%7Bmax%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na} = g_{Na}^{max}" class="latex" /> for Na+ and similarly, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_K+%3D+g_K%5E%7Bmax%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_K = g_K^{max}" class="latex" /> for K+.</p>



<p><strong>Key takeaway # 3: we can work directly with proportions of open channels</strong><br>But what if only 50% of the channels were open? Well, the limit would be half of the maximum: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7BNa%7D+%3D+0.5+%5Ccdot+g_%7BNa%7D%5E%7Bmax%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{Na} = 0.5 &#92;cdot g_{Na}^{max}" class="latex" />. Why is it this relevant? Because instead of directly relating conductance to voltage, we can relate proportion of open (or closed) channels to voltage. The math is easier and it&#8217;s a bit more intuitive.</p>



<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong><br>First of all, since conductances are voltage-dependent and the membrane voltage changes over time, we actually have voltage- and time-dependent conductances. Important to note, only for Na+ and K+; we assume the leak conductance to be fixed.</p>



<p>Secondly, we work with the proportion of open channels, not with conductances directly. Let&#8217;s pause for a moment and think about what we want to model. We basically want a sort of push-pull mechanism, such that when the voltage goes up, the proportion of open Na+ channels goes up, and when the voltage decreases, the proportion of closed channels increases. And the same way for K+.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with K+. We can denote the proportion of open K+ channels with <em>n</em>. The proportion of closed channels will be simply <em>1 &#8211; n</em> (total minus how many are open). Since we&#8217;re interested in how this evolves over time, we need to bring back our differential equation friend, in this case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdn%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dn}{dt}" class="latex" />. The push-pull mechanism we want can be written in the following form: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdn%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+functionA_%7Bvoltage%7D+%5Ccdot+%281-n%29+-+functionB_%7Bvoltage%7D+%5Ccdot+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dn}{dt} = functionA_{voltage} &#92;cdot (1-n) - functionB_{voltage} &#92;cdot n" class="latex" /> or following the Hodgkin-Huxley convention: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdn%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Calpha_n%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+%281-n%29+-+%5Cbeta_n%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dn}{dt} = &#92;alpha_n(V_m) &#92;cdot (1-n) - &#92;beta_n(V_m) &#92;cdot n" class="latex" />. There are two parts that matter here:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>the two functions A and B act like weights for the proportion of closed, respectively open, channels. A controls how fast <strong>closed</strong> channels <em>open</em> and B controls how fast <strong>open</strong> channels <em>close</em>;</li>



<li>the above is not enough. A and B are voltage-dependent functions themselves and they need to be chosen in such a way that, when the voltage goes up, A goes up and B goes down, and vice-versa when the voltage goes down.</li>
</ol>



<p>But how to choose them? Well, the equation above is called a first-order differential equation and has a known solution. Without going further into mathematical detail, Hodgkin and Huxley used that solution together with experimental measurements of K+ currents to derive specific formulas for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_n" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta_n" class="latex" />. I am including them here for completeness and because you will see them in the code, but there is no reason to stress over them. In practice, unless you use them on a daily basis, you&#8217;re just going to look them up when needed (and by the way, depending on the neuron type, the actual numerical values in these formulas will change): <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_n%28V_m%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B0.01%2810+-+V%29%7D%7Bexp%28%5Cfrac%7B10+-+V%7D%7B10%7D%29+-+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_n(V_m) = &#92;frac{0.01(10 - V)}{exp(&#92;frac{10 - V}{10}) - 1}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_n%28V_m%29+%3D+0.125+%5Ccdot+exp%28-%5Cfrac%7BV%7D%7B80%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta_n(V_m) = 0.125 &#92;cdot exp(-&#92;frac{V}{80})" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>(Side note: <strong>the sign convention</strong>. One thing to notice above is that we use both <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m" class="latex" /> and <em>V</em>. That&#8217;s not a typo. Normally, we define the membrane voltage <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m+%3D+V_%7Binside%7D+-+V_%7Boutside%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m = V_{inside} - V_{outside}" class="latex" />, so the membrane voltage is negative at rest. In the HH model, however, <em>V</em> is defined as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D+V_%7Brest%7D+-+V_m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V= V_{rest} - V_m" class="latex" />. That means the voltage is shifted such that at rest, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V = 0" class="latex" /> mV. And because all <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" />s and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" />s were fitted to these shifted values, we need to take that into account when working with the original HH model.)</p>



<p>For Na+, they modeled the Na+ channel activation in a similar manner, except they called the proportion of activated channels <em>m</em>. Again, for completeness, the respective equations were <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_m%28V_m%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B0.1%2825+-+V%29%7D%7Bexp%28%5Cfrac%7B25+-+V%7D%7B10%7D%29+-+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_m(V_m) = &#92;frac{0.1(25 - V)}{exp(&#92;frac{25 - V}{10}) - 1}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_m%28V_m%29+%3D+4+%5Ccdot+exp%28-%5Cfrac%7BV%7D%7B18%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta_m(V_m) = 4 &#92;cdot exp(-&#92;frac{V}{18})" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>Now we almost have the full functioning HH model, but there are just a couple of minor tweaks left. Because Hodgkin and Huxley fitted their model to experimental data, they observed two interesting tidbits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>the model fit better when the variable <em>n</em> was raised to the power of 4 and when <em>m</em> was raised to the power of 3. At the time, they didn&#8217;t know <em>why</em> that was the case, but in the meantime, we&#8217;ve found out that the K+ ion channel is made up of 4 subunits, each of which needs to be activated for the channel to allow the passage of K+. In that case, you can think of <em>n</em> as the proportion of channels where subunit 1 is activated (or the probability for this subunit to be activated). The proportion of channels where 2 subunits are activated is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ccdot+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;cdot n" class="latex" />, and so on. Similarly, Na+ channels have 3 activation domains that need to be opened for Na+ to pass through the channel;</li>



<li>when the membrane voltage was held constant at a high value, K+ kept flowing out of the cell until the voltage was allowed to return to normal. But for Na+, Hodgkin and Huxley observed a different behavior: Na+ flowed into the cell at first, then it stopped. The Na+ current sharply decreased and regardless of how long the voltage was kept high, the Na+ current didn&#8217;t increase anymore. To model this behavior, they introduced a second variable for Na+, called <em>h</em>, which they used to model the proportion of inactivated Na+ channels. This needed the same <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_h" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta_h" class="latex" /> functions, with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_h%28V_m%29+%3D+0.07+%5Ccdot+exp%28-%5Cfrac%7BV%7D%7B20%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_h(V_m) = 0.07 &#92;cdot exp(-&#92;frac{V}{20})" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_h%28V_m%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bexp%28%5Cfrac%7B30+-+V%7D%7B10%7D%29+%2B+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta_h(V_m) = &#92;frac{1}{exp(&#92;frac{30 - V}{10}) + 1}" class="latex" />. Again, nowadays, we know that Na+ has an inactivation domain that rapidly blocks Na+ channels at high voltages and only unlocks them when the voltage goes down again. That&#8217;s also why action potentials cannot spread backwards from where they came from.</li>
</ol>



<p>And that&#8217;s it, we now have a full HH model. Put all together, it looks like this:<br><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_m%5Cfrac%7BdV_m%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+-g_%7BNa%7D%5E%7Bmax%7D+%5Ccdot+m%5E3+%5Ccdot+h+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_%7BNa%7D%29+-+g_K%5E%7Bmax%7D+%5Ccdot+n%5E4+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_K%29+-+g_l+%5Ccdot+%28V_m+-+V_l%29+%2B+I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_m&#92;frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_{Na}^{max} &#92;cdot m^3 &#92;cdot h &#92;cdot (V_m - V_{Na}) - g_K^{max} &#92;cdot n^4 &#92;cdot (V_m - V_K) - g_l &#92;cdot (V_m - V_l) + I_{ext}" class="latex" />,<br><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdn%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Calpha_n%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+%281-n%29+-+%5Cbeta_n%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dn}{dt} = &#92;alpha_n(V_m) &#92;cdot (1-n) - &#92;beta_n(V_m) &#92;cdot n" class="latex" />,<br><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdm%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Calpha_m%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+%281-m%29+-+%5Cbeta_m%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dm}{dt} = &#92;alpha_m(V_m) &#92;cdot (1-m) - &#92;beta_m(V_m) &#92;cdot m" class="latex" />,<br><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdh%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Calpha_h%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+%281-h%29+-+%5Cbeta_h%28V_m%29+%5Ccdot+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{dh}{dt} = &#92;alpha_h(V_m) &#92;cdot (1-h) - &#92;beta_h(V_m) &#92;cdot n" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>Importantly, by itself, the model doesn&#8217;t really do anything. If the external input is zero and we start the model from an initial membrane voltage below a certain threshold (in this case, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_m%28t+%3D+0%29+%3D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_m(t = 0) =" class="latex" /> -60 mV), it quickly decays back to the resting state potential (which you can calculate yourself using the formula given above and the maximum conductances and ionic equilibrium potentials given in the code <a href="https://codeberg.org/neuronerd/VirtualNeuron/src/branch/main/Part2/hh_model_full.py">here</a>.)</p>

<p>To get more than one spike, we need to drive it with external input current. So far, we&#8217;ve used constant current, and we&#8217;ll stick with that for today (in the next part, we&#8217;ll also try out time-varying currents). For a high enough current, we see that the model fires one action potential after the next. You can try it out for yourself to see what happens for different values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Bext%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{ext}" class="latex" />, and next time we&#8217;ll try a more systematic analysis as well.</p>

<p>Finally, we can inspect our gating variables <em>m, h</em>, and <em>n</em>, to see how they evolve over time. In the plot below, you see that the Na+ channel activation variable <em>m</em> (in blue), goes up really quickly &#8211; Na+ channels open fast; but it goes down just as quickly &#8211; they also close fast.

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m tired. The good news is that now we have a functional HH model. Also good news is that we can do a lot of things with it, but unfortunately, that requires additional explanations, and I think we could all use a break. So I&#8217;ll see you for the next part. Until then, feel free to toy with the model parameters.</p>

<p><em>Note: We&#8217;ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/29/ethics-committee-ai-llm-reddit-changemyview-university-zurich/">published a new story</a> with the University of Zurich&#8217;s response, as well as comments from Reddit&#8217;s chief legal officer.</em></p>



<p>An experiment deploying AI-generated messages on a Reddit subforum has drawn criticism for, among other critiques, a lack of informed consent from unknowing participants in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university overseeing the research is standing by its approval of the study, but has indicated the principal investigator has received a warning for the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The subreddit, r/ChangeMyView (CMV), invites people to post a viewpoint or opinion to invite conversation from different perspectives. Its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_a">extensive rules</a> are intended to keep discussions civil.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131744"></span>



<p>Early Saturday morning, CMV moderators posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">a long message about the experiment</a>, designed to study whether large language models, or LLMs, could be used to change views. It began:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users. This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers, who requested anonymity form the subreddit moderators, provided this description of the research:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Over the past few months, we used multiple accounts to posts published on CMV. Our experiment assessed LLM&#8217;s persuasiveness in an ethical scenario, where people ask for arguments against views they hold. In commenting, we did not disclose that an AI was used to write comments, as this would have rendered the study unfeasible. While we did not write any comments ourselves, we manually reviewed each comment posted to ensure they were not harmful.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers’ note continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We recognize that our experiment broke the community rules against AI-generated comments and apologize. We believe, however, that given the high societal importance of this topic, it was crucial to conduct a study of this kind, even if it meant disobeying the rules.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>User accounts created to post AI-generated content posed as a victim of rape, a trauma counselor specializing in abuse, a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter, among other personas, according to the moderators’ post. All user accounts linked to the experiment and listed in the post have been suspended. The Zurich group has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ExtendedAbstract-Zurich-AI-Reddit.pdf">shared a preliminary writeup</a> of its findings.</p>



<p>“This is one of the worst violations of research ethics I&#8217;ve ever seen,” Casey Fiesler, an information scientist at the University of Colorado, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cfiesler.bsky.social/post/3lnqrpz3qas2r">wrote on Bluesky</a>. “Manipulating people in online communities using deception, without consent, is not ‘low risk’ and, as evidenced by the discourse in this Reddit post, resulted in harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sara Gilbert, research director of the Citizens and Technology Lab at Cornell University, claimed the study has harmed CMV itself. The subreddit has been “an important public sphere for people to engage in debate, learn new things, have their assumptions challenged, and maybe even their minds changed,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sarahagilbert.bsky.social/post/3lnqqhyd6fc2c">wrote on Bluesky</a>. “Are people going to trust that they aren’t engaging with bots? And if they don’t, can the community serve its mission?”</p>



<p>Trust is a theme in some of the 1,500-odd comments on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">original r/ChangeMyView post</a>. <a href="https://www.404media.co/researchers-secretly-ran-a-massive-unauthorized-ai-persuasion-experiment-on-reddit-users/">Other</a> <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/unauthorized-experiment-on-cmv/">outlets</a> have weighed in on the project as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to follow-up questions, CMV moderator u/DuhChappers said the experiment violated Reddit’s rule to not impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading manner. “I think it would be a stretch to say that these accounts did not impersonate individuals in a deceptive manner. The bots literally said things like ‘I am a black man and ‘I am a sexual assault survivor’ when those are manifestly untrue,” the moderator wrote in a message to us.</p>



<p>OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, <a href="https://redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-oai-partner">has an agreement with Reddit</a> to use its content to train its models. Earlier this year, OpenAI used content from r/ChangeMyView to test the persuasiveness of its AI models, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-used-this-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion/">TechCrunch reported</a>. This research used “a downloaded copy of r/changemyview data on AI persuasiveness without experimenting on non-consenting human subjects,” the CMV moderators noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A message sent to the Zurich researchers’ anonymous email account referred us to the University of Zurich media relations office, which did not immediately respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The moderators stated they have filed a complaint with the University of Zurich’s institutional review board. A response from the university’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission&nbsp; indicated the matter had been investigated and the principal investigator had been issued a formal warning, according to the moderators.</p>



<p>The moderators had also asked the University of Zurich to block the research from being published. The response from the university noted that is outside their purview. A university response quoted in the post stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;This project yields important insights, and the risks (e.g. trauma etc.) are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up message, the u/DuhChappers pointed to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ideasforcmv/comments/1ibwcns/post_sticky_with_research/m9wdil6/">a list of studies</a> the subreddit has participated in. “We are very happy to provide data and aid to researchers, especially when they approach us beforehand and let us know what they are planning,” the moderator wrote. “The difference in this study is both that the researchers did not ask us before, and that they were actively manipulating members of the subreddit rather than simply observing data. That is a line we cannot accept being crossed.”</p>



<p><em>Update, April 30: The public access to the Google Drive version of the researchers&#8217; preliminary findings has been revoked, so the link has been changed to a copy we downloaded.</em></p>

How might MS affect pregnancy - and how might pregnancy affect MS? With growing research and evolving clinical guidance, we now know more than ever about this complex relationship. Neave Smith explores what the science says, offering clarity on key considerations before, during, and after pregnancy.

<p>The Canadian National Breast Screening Study conducted in the 1980s and led by researchers at the University of Toronto evaluated the efficacy of breast cancer screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Because the research was supposedly a “gold standard” randomized controlled trial, its results, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336543/">published</a> in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336544/">academic</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g366">journals</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/breast-cancer-death-rates-in-canada-didn-t-improve-with-mammograms-1.2532730">reported in the media</a>, have influenced public perceptions and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9230883/">informed</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11233866/">policy</a> on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23074501/">mammography screening</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8105098/">in several countrie</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8105098/">s</a>.</p>



<p>However, over the past decades, flaws in this study have come to light. My colleagues and I learned of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">failures in randomization</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234686/">we</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7842421/">other</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012720/">researchers</a> have found other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jbi/article/4/2/135/6555326">serious problems</a>. We think these flaws strongly suggest the publications of CNBSS results should be retracted. Despite being informed of the flaws in this study in 2021, the University of Toronto has not adequately or appropriately addressed these issues.</p>



<p>The CNBSS was configured as two separate randomized clinical trials, one for women in their 40s at entry and the other for women in their 50s. In CNBSS1, 50,000 women ages 40-49 were supposedly randomly assigned to the intervention arm, in which they would receive up to five annual screens with two view film mammography plus clinical breast examination by a nurse, or to the control arm, where they received a single clinical examination at entry and usual care (essentially, no screening) afterwards. In CNBSS2 for 40,000 women, the randomization was between the intervention of mammography plus a clinical breast exam versus clinical exam only.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131733"></span>



<p>When the results of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1423087/">CNBSS1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336544/">CNBSS2</a> were first published in 1992, the investigators reported no difference in mortality from breast cancer between the arms in either trial. This finding contrasted with positive results in several other studies. In fact, the investigators initially, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/84.11.832">falsely</a>, claimed screening was leading to excess deaths from breast cancer in the younger women. That claim was eventually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/84/11/832/929878?redirectedFrom=fulltext">retracted</a>. As well, results from CNBSS were later used by one of its principal investigators to produce <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.06.033">unrealistically high estimates of overdiagnosis</a> attributed to mammography screening.</p>



<p>I and other colleagues have <a href="https://ajronline.org/doi/abs/10.2214/ajr.161.4.8372752">criticized</a> the CNBSS over the years for, among other serious problems, strong indications of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234686/">bias in randomization</a>. These concerns led to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012720/">forensic review</a> in 1995 of the randomization of the trial, but, for reasons not entirely clear, the mandate of the review did not include interviewing the staff crucial to the randomization process. The review proved inconclusive and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012723/">left the key question of subversion of randomization open</a>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, my colleagues and I became aware <a href="https://borealisdata.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=211354&amp;version=2.0">of eyewitness evidence</a> staff members had steered some participants with symptoms of breast cancer into the mammography arm of the study. At all but one trial site, all women received a clinical breast examination before getting their study arm allocation. The staff registering the women into the study were aware of the exam results. Entering a woman with significant findings to the intervention arm would assure her of an immediate mammogram.</p>



<p>According to eyewitness testimony, well-meaning staff members could, and did, steer such individuals into the screening arm with the intention of providing a symptomatic woman with an immediate mammogram, without appreciating the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34812692/">consequences for randomization</a> this entailed. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">As we have explained</a>, moving even a few women from their intended random allocation in the control arm to the intervention arm after discovery of palpable abnormalities could shift the trial findings from demonstrating a mortality benefit from screening to suggesting a mortality detriment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of this new evidence, later in 2021 we contacted the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS), whose subsidiary, The National Cancer Institute of Canada, had sponsored the CNBSS. The CCS then approached the University of Toronto, via the Dean of Medicine, informing them of this evidence and requesting a review. In the meantime, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">we published</a> an article describing the evidence for subversion of randomization.</p>



<p>After several months with no response from the university, we followed with a letter to the university’s Research Ethics Board. Eventually we were informed that the matter had been referred to the Office of Research Integrity, which is the responsibility of the Vice President of Research and Innovation of the University of Toronto. Finally, in December of 2021 we were told that our concerns would be investigated and an external three-member panel would be appointed to do this. This was not consistent with the university’s established framework for investigations of research ethical issues.</p>



<p>After another long gap, we learned on June 14, 2022, the panel members had been selected by Lorraine Ferris, the associate vice president of research and innovation at the University of Toronto. Two of the members of this committee, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24519765/">Mette Kalager</a> and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1401875">Peter Jüni</a>, had previously been on record supporting the results of the CNBSS and in one case, had co-published on issues around screening with one of the trial’s principal investigators. If CNBSS were to be invalidated, both of these individuals would have to reverse pointed statements they had made publicly. We were surprised the university&nbsp; would appoint either of these individuals to the committee, given their clear conflicts of interest (for the same reason, that these panel members did not immediately recuse themselves also was surprising).</p>



<p>We immediately raised these concerns to Prof. Ferris. In her response, she stated the investigation would go forward with this panel. She said it was challenging to find suitably qualified panel members for such a review. We explained our concerns regarding subversion of a randomized control trial do not require people with specific expertise in breast cancer screening studies to resolve them; it is largely a matter of consideration of proper conduct of any such study.</p>



<p>In a follow-up letter, we indicated we would continue to protest the process the university had chosen to investigate our concerns and to push for a more appropriately constituted panel. At the same time, we agreed to be interviewed by whatever review panel was appointed by the university. We did not want, by refusing to cooperate, to provide an excuse for the university to back away from its responsibility to conduct an investigation. On Aug. 2, 2022, we received a response from Prof. Ferris that she was unwilling to reconsider the composition of the panel.</p>



<p>The panel did interviews by Zoom in the Fall of 2022, including one with me. But the witness list was not made available to those of us who had raised the initial concerns, nor have the statements made by the various witnesses been shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, we were informed by Professor Ferris that she expected the review to be completed by March of 2024. However, that date passed without event. We requested a meeting with the current Provost, Trevor Young, and that was arranged for March 28 of last year. Professors Ferris and Leah Cohen, vice president of research and innovation, and strategic initiatives, were also scheduled to attend. The meeting was abruptly cancelled by the Provost on the afternoon of March 26. We have heard nothing since.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a></a>This is not the first time the University of Toronto has delayed or failed in fulfilling its responsibilities to safeguard the ethical conduct of medical research.&nbsp; Notably, in the late 1990s, Nancy Olivieri, a hematologist clinician researcher conducting a study with an industrial collaborator to evaluate a new drug for treating thalassemia, observed adverse effects on patients. When she attempted to discontinue the study and voice her concerns, she was faced with intense harassment by the pharmaceutical manufacturer and by some of her academic colleagues. Her request for intervention from the university –- which was in the midst of negotiating a $20 million building donation from the manufacturer &#8212; did not receive an adequate response. Ultimately the matter had to go to an <a href="https://www.caut.ca/docs/af-reports-indepedent-committees-of-inquiry/the-olivieri-report.pdf">external review</a>, which vindicated her.</p>



<p>At this point, almost four years have elapsed since we brought our concerns to the attention of the University of Toronto and, as far as we can see, nothing has happened. Perhaps the long delay in the review suggests that, in light of overwhelming evidence, the university is no longer able to credibly support the conduct or the results of the CNBSS. Or perhaps it means that by delaying its review, the university hopes the problem will go away.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>The CNBSS has influenced policy and opinions of primary healthcare providers and women, discouraged opportunities for earlier detection of cancer, and, in turn, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11696453/">resulted in delays in cancer detection</a>. The publications of results from CNBSS must be retracted.</p>

                <p>It is fascinating how much data quality can vary between different calcium imaging data sets. In this blog post, I will discuss a metric to quantify and compare data quality and in particular shot noise between calcium imaging datasets.</p>



<p>This variation of data quality depends on potential artifacts due to movement or instrument noise, the frame rate of the microscope, and the flux of fluorescence photons. The photon flux determines the shot noise level for each neuron and therefore whether calcium transients due to action potentials can be detected from the recording. Photon flux depends on factors such as neuron size (in pixels), indicator expression levels, and baseline brightness. As a result, it varies not only between recordings but also across neurons within the same session.</p>

Normalization by the square root of the frame rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f_r" class="latex" /> makes the metric comparable across datasets with different frame rates. (I have discussed the application of this metric to various datasets in an <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/10/04/large-scale-calcium-imaging-noise-levels/">earlier blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>However, this metric is to some degree biased, as it assumes the ideal scenario of zero neuron activity. In the presence of neuronal activity, however, the ups and downs of calcium transients will increase the apparent noise level systematically. Recently, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mnLnd6cAAAAJ">David Hildebrand</a> brought up this issue, and I decided to look into it more carefully.</p>



<p>I used ground-truth spike patterns from electrophysiological recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons (mouse visual cortex, see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641129v2.full">Fig.2 Suppl.1</a>), convolved them with a linear calcium kernel, and added Gaussian noise of known magnitude. Then, I quantified how precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> was able to recover the true noise value.</p>



<p><em>First</em>, the metric generally overestimated the true noise level by about 20%. This overestimation was largely independent of the noise level but slightly increased for lower noise level. This makes sense: the relative effect of the same amount of a fixed level of neuronal activity is greater when the baseline noise is zero. However, the overall effect was relatively small &#8211; 20% is not dramatic for such a coarse metric:</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, for low frame rates, the overestimation became more substantial, reaching up to 50% on average for a frame rate of 1-2 Hz. This is a significant bias that should be kept in mind. If you use the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> to quantitatively compare between recordings of different frame rates. it may be good to correct for this bias. In most other cases, this effect is likely negligible:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="832" height="728" data-attachment-id="8020" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/04/25/accuaretly-computing-noise-levels-for-calcium-imaging-data/overview_b/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_b.png" data-orig-size="832,728" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Overview_B" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_b.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_b.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_b.png?w=832" alt="" class="wp-image-8020" style="width:293px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p><em>Finally</em>, the overestimation also depended on the true spike rate of the respective recording. In the plot below, each point represents the quantification derived from the ground truth recording of an individual neuron with a its specific spike rate. As one would expect, the overestimation of noise levels is minimial for neurons that are almost silent, and grows almost linearly with the true spike rate:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="942" height="710" data-attachment-id="8023" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/04/25/accuaretly-computing-noise-levels-for-calcium-imaging-data/overview_c/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_c.png" data-orig-size="942,710" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Overview_C" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_c.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_c.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/overview_c.png?w=942" alt="" class="wp-image-8023" style="aspect-ratio:1.3267737244345432;width:322px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Altogether, I still believe that the standardized noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> is a very useful (and probably under-used) metric to compare data quality across recordings. The above analyses provide context that should ideally be considered for quantitative comparisons &#8211; by quantifying how much the metric is affected by noise level, frame rate and individual spike rate.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;Understanding structure-function mapping in small spiking neural networks.&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We know that the precise timing of spikes represents information in spiking neuronal
networks. However, the information processing in spiking networks is not yet fully
understood. One way to understand the working mechanism of a spiking network is to
associate the structural connectivity of the network with the corresponding functional
behaviour. In this journal club, I will begin with an introduction to different spiking
neuron models and their properties. Then I’ll talk about the evolution of small spiking
neural networks for temporal pattern recognition tasks. In the second half, we will
discuss the structure-function mapping in spiking neural networks evolved or created to
perform a computational task.</p>

                Evolutionarily newer regions sport mitochondria with a higher capacity for energy production than older regions, according to the first detailed map of the organelles in a tissue slice, adding to mounting evidence that the brain features a metabolic gradient.

<p>An expert in AI at Google has admitted he used the technology to help write a preprint manuscript that commenters on PubPeer found to contain a slew of AI-generated phrases like “squared blunder” and “info picture.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11218v1">Leveraging GANs For Active Appearance Models Optimized Model Fitting</a>,” appeared on arXiv.org in January but was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11218">withdrawn</a> April 7. The author, <a href="https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Anurag-Awasthi-Engineering-Lead-AI-AInfrastructure-Google/acb5115b-1224-4a94-a97c-d9e0aa35cdd0">Anurag Awasthi</a>, is an engineering lead in AI infrastructure at Google. In a PubPeer comment, he described the paper as a “personal learning exercise.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2025, sleuth Guillaume Cabanac, creator of the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, pointed out in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F19A87982B29CB5C819040BFD7E8EA">PubPeer comment</a> the paper included several tortured phrases. These phrases indicate AI use and occur when large language models try to find synonyms for common phrases. In Awasthi’s paper, “linear regression” became “straight relapse,” and “error rate” became “blunder rate,” among others.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131717"></span>



<p>Awasthi replied to the comment saying “phrasing issues were unintentional artifacts from an earlier revision where automated tools were used to rephrase for variety.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another PubPeer comment pointed out similarities between Awasthi’s preprint and a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-016-0916-3">2016 paper</a> by different authors. Aside from containing similar structure, Awasthi’s paper uses much of the same language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awasthi again replied on PubPeer reiterating the overlap was an “unintended artifact.” His comment reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This preprint was intended to explore a new idea—to the best of my knowledge—and I shared it early to test its relevance. The project initially began as a personal learning exercise but sensing a possible novelty, turned into a publication attempt. The layout and literature review, drafted with the help of AI-assisted tools, ended up too close in phrasing to earlier work—particularly the one you&#8217;ve highlighted.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After receiving further criticism about the undisclosed AI use, Awasthi replied that he “clearly underestimated the seriousness of preprints.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He responded to our request for comment by directing us to the Google press office, which did not respond.&nbsp;</p>
