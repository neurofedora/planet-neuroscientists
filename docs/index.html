                Neuroscience in other countries will strengthen—at the United States’ expense—as rising visa restrictions and rejections block many international students from enrolling at U.S. institutions and dissuade others from applying.

                Are rising diagnoses a sign of progress  or a medical misstep? In The Age of Diagnosis, neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan explores the surge in conditions like autism and ADHD, but her clinical lens raises urgent questions about language, inclusion, and whose voices are truly being heard. This article examines the impact of outdated terminology and the importance of respecting the neurodivergent communities at the heart of the conversation.

<p>The University of Toronto has quietly published the results of an inquiry into the Canadian National Breast Screening Study that began in 2022 and, it seems, concluded in March 2024.</p>



<p>The panel, tasked with evaluating new allegations about the trial’s randomization, found the evidence it reviewed did not affect the results of the trials, which called into question the value of mammography in women ages 40-59.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imaging scientist Martin Yaffe of the University of Toronto has long been a critic of the CNBSS, a pair of randomized clinical trials of mammography conducted in the 1980s. In April, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/guest-post-university-of-toronto-canadian-national-breast-screening-study/">we published a guest post</a> in which Yaffe detailed the history of the trial and his critiques of it, as well as new evidence that clinical staff may have unwittingly influenced randomization. He reported this to the Canadian Cancer Society in 2021, and to the university.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132412"></span>



<p>According to Yaffe’s timeline, the university convened an external panel in June 2022 to review this evidence. After being interviewed by the panel, Yaffe was told the review would be complete in March 2024. But the university did not release a report at that time, and “We have heard nothing since,” Yaffe wrote in the April 2025 post.</p>



<p>Last week, the university published <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/media/1336/download?inline">the March 2024 report</a>, written by panel chair Mette Kalager of the University of Oslo. It details the group’s process and findings, and redacts names of several of the witnesses and omits interview transcripts. The 275-page report has a single-sentence conclusion: “The new information does not have a credible scientific impact on the reliability of the CNBSS.”</p>



<p>The other two committee members did not sign on to that report. “We are unable to endorse it in its current form,” Isabelle Boutron of the Université Paris Cité and Peter Jüni of the University of Oxford wrote in <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/media/1337/download?inline">a separate statement</a> dated June 20, 2025. But the panel members came to a similar conclusion as Kalager, stating the evidence put forth in the complaint “could have had only a trivial effect on the study findings.”</p>



<p>The report and statement appeared last week on an undated page on the university’s website. In response to questions on why the University of Toronto didn’t release the report in March 2024, and when the reports were actually made public, a spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/expert-panel-review-canadian-national-breast-screening-study-cnbss">posted the materials</a> from the expert review panel on July 17, 2025, once we received the full reporting of the panel, and informed participants who were interviewed. The university appreciates the thoughtful process used by the panel to report its outcome. The members of the panel reached similar conclusions.</p>



<p>The final materials of the expert review panel are now public, and the panel’s service has concluded. Peer-reviewed journals provide an important scholarly forum that is available for discussion of cancer screening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kalager, Boutron and Jüni did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Yaffe said he plans to write a rebuttal to the review. “The sense I get in reading it is that [it] is more of an attempt to defend this trial than to impartially review the two main concerns: subversion of randomization and inclusion of women with already known symptoms in the trial,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>

<p>An early-career researcher who discovered a nearly identical version of her manuscript published by the researcher who reviewed — and recommended rejecting — the work for another journal is still awaiting a resolution 10 months after reporting her concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shafaq Aftab, now a lecturer at the University of Central Punjab in Pakistan, learned of the published study last fall in an alert from ResearchGate. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sres.3076">The paper</a>, published in <em>Systems Research and Behavioural Science </em>(<em>SRBS</em>) in September 2024<em>, </em>was not only similar to research she completed during her Ph.D. coursework, it was the exact work she had submitted to another journal in late 2023, Aftab told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email exchange she had with the editor of that journal, <em>Information Development</em> (<em>IDV</em>), confirmed the author of the published study was a reviewer of Aftab’s manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132400"></span>



<p>Social scientist Davood Ghorbanzadeh of Islamic Azad University of Tehran North Branch in Iran denies he plagiarized any portion of Aftab’s work and said his study was based on independent research of “the highest ethical standards.”</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh had two papers retracted in December and January for significant overlap with other researchers’ work.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>SRBS</em>, confirmed the publisher is still investigating the claims, which Aftab raised to the journal in September 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery of the <em>SRBS</em> study was “deeply upsetting, both personally and professionally,” Aftab said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In November 2023, Aftab submitted a manuscript to <em>IDV</em>. The paper came from work she did as part of her doctoral research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two rounds of revisions, the article was rejected on Aug. 24, 2024, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh’s paper was submitted to <em>SRBS </em>on Jan. 26, 2024, and published on Sept. 18, 2024. A comparison of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ghorbanzadeh_study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the published study</a> with a copy of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aftab_Manuscript_to_IDV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the manuscript</a> Aftab provided to us reveals several similarities. The article’s data structure, analysis, and text are markedly similar to Aftab’s original work, including frequent verbatim paragraphs. For example, the text and citations in the introductions of both papers are identical. </p>



<p>The data do differ, however. The <em>SRBS</em> study, for instance, states the primary data were collected “from 340 employees from firms located in the industrial hub of a developing economy using a simple random technique” and “analysed using Smart-PLS 3 from the manufacturing sector.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftab collected data “from 260 employees from firms located in the industrial hub of a developing economy using a simple random technique” and analyzed them “using Smart-PLS 4 from the manufacturing sector.”</p>



<p>The text of Ghorbanzadeh’s study conclusion is identical to that of Aftab’s conclusion.</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh told us by email, “I categorically deny these allegations.” He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I did not review Ms. Aftab’s manuscript for the Journal of Information Development (IDV), nor did I suggest its rejection, as has been claimed. These accusations are entirely unfounded and appear to be an attempt to discredit my work. My study is the result of original research conducted with academic integrity, and I have not accessed or utilized any part of Ms. Aftab’s manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf">a </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sept. 22, 2024 email</a> Aftab shared with us, Stephen Parker, then-editor of <em>IDV</em>, told her Ghorbanzadeh was a reviewer of both versions of Aftab’s manuscript for <em>IDV</em>, and the same reviewer who recommended it be rejected.</p>



<p>“We cannot be held accountable for this behavior from reviewers,” Parker wrote in the email. “However, we can provide proof that Ghorbanzadeh reviewed this manuscript for us. It seems to us that Wiley should start an investigation with these authors and they might consider sending a complaint to these authors&#8217; institutions.”</p>



<p>Juan D. Machin-Mastromatteo, who took over as editor of <em>IDV </em>in January, declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley confirmed the editorial office at <em>SRBS</em>, as well as Wiley’s research integrity team, are aware of the concerns. Wiley initiated an investigation in September 2024, soon after receiving the complaint, the spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors of the article, including Davood Ghorbanzadeh, have been contacted as part of our investigation,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We have also been in contact with the other publisher involved. We expect a final outcome soon, which we will then share directly with the involved parties.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wiley_Email_Reponse_to_Aftab.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Oct. 16, 2024 email</a> to Aftab and shared with us, Max Owen Williams, associate research integrity auditor for Wiley, wrote that an inquiry by the company had confirmed “there is indeed a large degree of overlap between the text and the figures presented in the two manuscripts.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ghorbanzadeh told us “any perceived similarities” between the two works “would be purely coincidental and not indicative of plagiarism.” He has been “fully cooperating” with Wiley’s investigation and has provided all relevant documentation, data, drafts, and correspondence, to support the originality of his work. He said he trusts Wiley will “thoroughly examine the matter and reach a fair conclusion.”</p>

<p>Ghorbanzadeh has had two studies retracted for plagiarism in recent months. A 2024 study in Emerald’s <em>Journal of Health Organization and Management</em>, titled “Empirical nexus of corporate social responsibility, service quality, corporate reputation and brand preference: evidence from Iranian healthcare industry,” was retracted in January because “a large portion of this article is taken, without attribution from an earlier, unpublished original work” by other coauthors, according to the <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhom-10-2024-0409/full/html">retraction notice</a>. The notice also states all coauthors besides Ghorbanzadeh “would like it to be noted that they were not aware of this situation.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the December <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-07223-7">retraction notice</a> for a paper in <em>Current Psychology</em> stated the article “significantly overlaps with a previously published article with a largely different authorship,” with one of the authors stating “they were unaware of the submission of this article.”<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh’s coauthors of the <em>SRBS </em>study did not return our messages seeking comment.<br><br>Aftab said she reached out to all the authors of the <em>SRBS</em> study, and that she heard back from coauthor Juan Felipe Espinosa Cristia. Espinosa Cristia indicated he had no knowledge of any unethical actions or related to the study, and said he was not privy to the initial data collection.<br><br>Aftab said she hopes her experience leads to changes and creates more awareness for early-career researchers about protecting their work.</p>



<p>“It raises serious concerns about the peer review system,” she said. “If such actions go unaddressed, it sets a precedent that anyone in a review position can misuse their access to original work without consequence.”</p>

<p>Fifteen years after publishing an explosive but long-criticized paper claiming to describe a microbe that could substitute arsenic for phosphate in its chemical makeup, <em>Science</em> is retracting the article, citing “expanded” criteria for retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors stand by their findings and disagree with the retraction, and contend the decision doesn’t reflect best practices for publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many scientists, including David Sanders, a biologist at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind. who has previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/07/09/despite-refutation-science-arsenic-life-paper-deserves-retraction-scientist-argues/">argued</a> for the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/21/why-one-biologist-says-its-not-too-late-to-retract-the-arsenic-life-paper/">paper’s retraction</a> in posts for Retraction Watch, believe the paper’s results were simply the result of contamination of the authors’ materials. He told us he was “glad” to see the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132377"></span>



<p>“The problem was not that later research undermined the conclusions,” Sanders said. “The problem was that the evidence presented in the article was not supportive of the conclusions from the start and that all the results were based on the fact that the arsenate was contaminated with phosphate.”</p>



<p>While the retraction notice does not explicitly state the contamination concern as a reason for the retraction, a blog post by the journal’s editors does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction has been in the works since at least last October, after a reporter for <em>The New York Times</em> contacted the journal for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/science/arseniclife-felisa-wolfe-simon-retraction.html">story</a> about Felisa Wolfe-Simon, the lead author of the study who withdrew from science after becoming the target of intense online criticism.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1197258">article</a> appeared in December 2010, and immediately attracted scrutiny for its methodology, as well as complaints about how <a href="https://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/science-gets-it-wrong-again-my-take-on-the-nasa-astrobiology-paper/"><em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/did-nasa-follow-its-own-code-of-conduct-in-announcing-the-arsenic-bacteria-study-hint-no/">NASA</a>, where some of the authors worked, handled publicity for the work. NASA announced a press conference “to discuss an astrobiology finding that will impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life.” Meanwhile, <em>Science</em> refused to lift its embargo on the paper despite feverish online speculation NASA scientists had discovered aliens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper has been cited 326 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Those citations include eight “technical comments,” the authors’ <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1202098">response</a>, and an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1208877">editors’ note</a> that appeared six months after initial publication. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1218455">Two</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1219861">papers</a> from 2012 describe unsuccessful attempts to replicate the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite publishing so many formal critiques, the journal did not retract the paper in 2012, “because at that time, Retractions were reserved for the Editor-in-Chief to alert readers about data manipulation or for authors to provide information about postpublication issues,” according to the retraction <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu5488?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D45734322912831479932541545157333250458%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753283613">notice</a>, signed by editor in chief Holden Thorp. The editors believed, then and now, “there was no deliberate fraud or misconduct on the part of the authors,” wrote Thorp, who was not the editor of the journal when it published the article.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thorp_holden.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="570" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thorp_holden.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131059" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thorp_holden.jpg 700w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thorp_holden-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Holden Thorp</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But now, the journal’s “standards for retracting papers have expanded,” Thorp wrote. “If the editors determine that a paper’s reported experiments do not support its key conclusions, even if no fraud or manipulation occurred, a Retraction is considered appropriate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders said a retraction of the paper “was always warranted” if “a fundamental error undermines a substantial part of an article or a major conclusion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice acknowledged receiving “media inquiries” about the article, “highlighting the extent to which the paper is still part of scientific discussions.” Based on the previously published critiques, the journal editors decided the article “meets the criteria for retraction by today’s standards,” Thorp wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/last-step-long-process-arsenic-life?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D45734322912831479932541545157333250458%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753296484">blog post</a> published along with the retraction, Thorp and Valda Vinson, executive editor of <em>Science</em>, went into further detail:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201482">One of the Technical Comments</a> had pointed out that the nucleic acids that were analyzed were not sufficiently purified before the acquisition of spectra that suggested the presence of arsenic. Given the evidence that the results were based on contamination, <em>Science</em> believes that the key conclusion of the paper is based on flawed data.</p>



<p>The journal’s peer review process and editorial decisions “led to the publication of a paper with seriously flawed content,” Vinson and Thorp wrote. “With this retraction—and with all retractions and corrections—we acknowledge and take responsibility for the role that we played in the paper’s publication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Most of the authors signed a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu5488?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D45734322912831479932541545157333250458%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753283694#elettersSection">letter</a> objecting to the retraction, which <em>Science</em> also published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While our work could have been written and discussed more carefully, we stand by the data as reported,” they wrote. “These data were peer-reviewed, openly debated in the literature, and stimulated productive research.”</p>



<p>The authors charged <em>Science</em> had overstepped <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">guidelines</a> from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) on retractions, as “no misconduct or error is alleged.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Disputes about the conclusions of papers, including how well they are supported by the available evidence, are a normal part of the process of science,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COPE’s guidelines advise editors to consider retracting a paper if “they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable,” either as a result of “major error” or research misconduct. The guidelines “have for some time allowed for editorial retraction due to honest error or naïve mistakes,” Vinson and Thorp wrote in their blog post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coauthor <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/703187">Ariel Anbar</a>, president’s professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University in Tempe, told us <em>Science</em> had “made this all needlessly confusing (and grossly violated COPE guidelines)” by mentioning the concern about contamination in the editors’ blog post rather than the retraction notice itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal had not shared the blog post with the authors for them to respond to, and had not specified the contamination concern in any draft of the notice the authors had seen, Anbar said. The authors only received a copy of the blog post when a reporter shared it with them, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors and the journal had begun negotiating the text of the retraction notice in January, Anbar said, with mediation from COPE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Science</em> was never able or willing to give us a clear statement of ‘error,’” Anbar said. Initially, the journal invoked the 2012 papers that did not reproduce the finding. But after the authors explained “material ways” the studies did not “faithfully” reproduce their experimental conditions, they did not hear from the journal for months, Anbar said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next version of the notice <em>Science</em> sent was similar to the published version, he said, “claiming ‘expanded standards’ but with no specificity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the technical comments published in 2011 had raised the possibility of contamination, Anbar said, and the authors addressed it in their response at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In short, this ‘contamination’ argument is recycled from 14 years ago,” he said. “It was raised and soundly dealt with then. That is our position.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What we have here is a situation in which data that were honestly and correctly obtained can be interpreted in multiple ways,” Anbar said. “One of those interpretations runs up against well-established principles widely accepted in the chemistry community. The legitimate dispute, then, is about how one interprets the data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Debates about interpreting data shouldn’t be grounds for retraction, he said, “or we’d end up having to retract half the published literature since science proceeds through trial, error, and revision of interpretations as understanding advances.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The editors mentioned the contamination issue in the blog post but not the retraction notice because “that’s more detail than we would usually put in a retraction notice,” Thorp told us. “This point has been around since the beginning of this story, so we don&#8217;t think it is anything new,” he said, referencing the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201482">2011 technical comment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Thorp if <em>Science</em> intends to review all papers with published technical notes or matters arising for potential retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have no plans to do that,” he responded. In responding to questions the journal receives about its papers, he continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We need two things: (a) a serious challenge that is sufficiently technical and detailed that we can consider it (i.e., not “everyone knows this paper is wrong, why haven’t you done anything about it?”) and (b) a situation where we can access data without involving the institution or the authors if they decline to participate.&nbsp; (b) usually obtains when we can do analysis of the images or in this case when we had the replication studies we could look at.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Science</em> has <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dScience">retracted 20 papers since 2019</a>, many for errors that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/science-journal-retractions/">weren’t necessarily misconduct</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bruce Alberts, who was editor in chief of <em>Science</em> at the time the paper and other responses were published, told us he supports “any change in standards that encourages journals to retract papers that are clearly incorrect,” even without fraud. “In fact, I would like to see this tool used much more frequently, inasmuch as it prevents wasted efforts by other scientists who can otherwise be misled,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The original authors have now had many years to carry out the obvious experiments required to counteract those scientists who have disputed the main conclusions of their 2010 paper,” Alberts added. “If they truly still believe that their publication was correct, why did they not do so?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders, the Purdue biologist, also said the case demonstrates the importance and quality of post publication review: “Timeliness is critical, but it is never too late to take the proper action.”</p>

<p>Authors affiliated with a federal health sciences university have lost three papers this year for image duplication following an investigation by the institution. And another journal has confirmed it will retract a fourth paper by some of the same authors.</p>



<p>The “internal research misconduct investigation” conducted by the Uniformed Services University, or USU, in Bethesda, Md., found “several falsified or inappropriately duplicated images” and “images from previously published articles,” according to two of the retraction notices. USU, an institution focused on military medicine and part of the U.S. Department of Defense, acknowledged our multiple requests for comment about the investigation but did not provide a statement.</p>



<p>In January, Retraction Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request about the investigation. The Department of Defense acknowledged our request on January 7, noting the agency has 4,552 open requests that are processed in the order in which they are received.</p>



<span id="more-132369"></span>



<p>All four studies were funded by the same <a href="https://govtribe.com/award/federal-grant-award/cooperative-agreement-hu00011620006">$36 million award</a>, which USU granted to the Department of Defense Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence in Bethesda. <a href="https://www.inova.org/doctors/george-l-maxwell-md">G. Larry Maxwell</a>, co-principal investigator of the research center, is a common author on all four papers.</p>



<p>The December retraction of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10495-021-01657-1">paper</a> published in <em>Apoptosis </em>in 2021 seems to be the first casualty of USU’s investigation. It has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10495-024-02062-0">retraction notice</a> referenced “image overlaps” between figures in that paper and two previously published papers, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125962">one from <em>PLOS One</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/8/4/74">one from <em>Biomedicines</em></a><em>. </em>Those articles have no common coauthors with the <em>Apoptosis </em>paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice says the journal was “unable to find the current email address of the corresponding author,” Viqar Syed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viqar-syed-51218620/">Syed</a> was an associate professor at USU and is a coauthor on all four papers. Emails to Syed’s USU affiliation bounced back, and messages on LinkedIn went unanswered.</p>



<p>Kevin Patrick, a sleuth who goes by “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” on PubPeer, flagged the <em>Apoptosis</em> paper and others in a string of comments in November 2022. He confirmed he reached out to the journal when he posted the comment.</p>



<p>Melania Ruiz, executive publisher for Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Apoptosis</em>, told us a reader first alerted the journal to concerns raised on PubPeer in 2022, after which the journal “immediately commenced a thorough investigation” separate from USU’s inquiry. (Ruiz did not confirm whether the reader was Patrick.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the papers Patrick flagged was a <a href="https://tcr.amegroups.org/article/view/30866/22189">2019 paper</a> in <a href="https://www.amegroups.com/">AME Publishing</a>’s <em>Translational Cancer Research,</em> which was retracted in May. According to<a href="https://tcr.amegroups.org/article/view/100640/html"> the notice</a>, USU alerted the editors about&nbsp; “several falsified or inappropriately duplicated images” in the work. The paper has been cited nine times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric Chuang, the editor in chief of <em>TCR</em>, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Patrick <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D42EA12FF746E1B5AC5D392B9A4944">commented on PubPeer </a>in November 2022 noting similarities between the <em>TCR </em>paper and four others, one of which was a <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/22745/text/">2017 paper</a> in <em>Oncotarget </em>with Syed as a coauthor<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Patrick told us he contacted the university and journals that published each of the papers, including <em>TCR</em> and <em>Oncotarget,</em> when he discovered issues in the papers in 2022. Although he didn’t flag the 2017 <em>Oncotarget</em> paper in his emails, he flagged two others coauthored by Syed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, USU did not respond to Patrick until he followed up in 2024; the institution redirected him to Toya Randolph, USU’s assistant vice president of research administration. When Patrick followed up again in April of this year, Mitchell Woodberry, deputy research integrity officer at the school, told Patrick “maintaining confidentiality is paramount to ensure a thorough, competent, objective, and fair research proceeding.” Woodberry did not confirm whether the university had initiated an investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elena Kurenova, the scientific integrity editor at <em>Oncotarget</em>, told us the 2017 paper, which now bears an expression of concern, will be retracted. She also noted the journal is investigating another paper by Syed, but did not specify which one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kurenova told us the journal became aware of Patrick’s PubPeer comments in November 2022 and notified Syed that same month. She said Syed responded two weeks later promising to investigate, but the journal hasn’t heard from her since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last July, the journal sent a message to all authors and heard from Maxwell informed them of an ongoing investigation at USU. All other coauthors on the paper support the forthcoming retraction, Kurenova said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kurenova also told us Randolph, USU’s assistant vice president of research administration, contacted the journal to request the article be retracted after an investigation “found several falsified or inappropriately duplicated images.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maxwell directed our request for comment to Randolph, who acknowledged our message but has not responded to follow-up emails. When Patrick reached out to her office last year, they acknowledged his concerns but didn’t provide any additional information.</p>



<p>The most recent retraction came in June on a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/8/4/73">2020 paper</a> from MDPI’s <em>Biomedicines</em>. The notice said an internal investigation “with input from” USU found instances of image duplication. The study has been cited eight times. Lauren Calvert, junior press officer at MDPI, told us “another article connected to this paper” was under review.<br></p>



<p>Aside from the papers retracted or under investigation, Patrick and others have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2428C60AF47927B4CCC0F4AABC782E">raised concerns on PubPeer</a> for Syed’s papers regarding image duplication, “<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/971A60F28D399518A692BA96995676">reuse</a>” and “<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BA7E584B5CE353C91DD52E7041EE3">unexpected” similarities</a>.</p>

<p>A gastroenterologist and microbiome researcher who has promoted hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as COVID treatments has lost a paper after a sleuth reported differences between the article and the registered protocol of the clinical trial it purported to describe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://gutpathogens.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13099-021-00398-5">retracted article</a>, on detecting SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples, was published in <em>Gut Pathogens </em>in January 2021<em>.</em> It marks <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHazan%252c%2bSabine">the fourth retraction</a> for study coauthor Sabine Hazan.</p>



<p>Hazan is founder and CEO of <a href="https://progenabiome.com/our-team">ProgenaBiome</a>, a laboratory in Ventura, Calif., advertising clinical trials exploring the role of the gut microbiome in conditions including autism and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as COVID.

<span id="more-132362"></span>



<p>Hazan has nearly 200,000 followers on X, where she reposts messages from the account “ScienceGuardians” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/wafik-el-deiry-nci-director-candidate-science-guardians-twitter-pubpeer-sleuths/">critical of PubPeer and sleuths</a>. She also recently promoted an <a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2022/10002/s2099_persistent_damage_to_the_gut_microbiome.2099.aspx">abstract</a> she published purporting to find a decrease in a particular type of gut bacteria in four people after they received COVID vaccines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her other retractions include a <a href="http://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1216170">paper</a> that proposed ivermectin worked as a COVID therapeutic <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/26/publisher-investigating-serious-concerns-about-article-on-ivermectin-covid-and-the-microbiome/">via the microbiome</a>, and clinical trials of <a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/17460913.2025.2451540">ivermectin</a> and <a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-025-04554-6">hydroxychloroquine</a>-based drug combinations for the disease.

<p>In a phone call, Hazan acknowledged “mistakes” in the <em>Gut Pathogens</em> paper, but said she believed the article could have been corrected rather than retracted. “We did everything by the book in that paper,” she said. She called the many PubPeer comments on her papers “harassment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>Gut Pathogens</em> paper has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Altmetric, a data service which tracks the online attention research articles receive, <a href="https://bmc.altmetric.com/details/99127158#score">ranks the article</a> in the top 5 percent of all articles it has scored, based on mentions in news articles and on social media platforms such as X, which include criticism of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal editors <a href="https://gutpathogens.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13099-025-00711-6">retracted</a> the paper on May 22. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After publication discrepancies between the registered protocol of the trial and the work reported in the article were noted and the authors were unable to provide documentary evidence of ethical approval for the changes made to the protocol. Concerns were raised regarding the accuracy of the stated study period as samples were collected prior to the registration of the study and collected after the study period had ended. Furthermore, a number of participants did not meet the stated inclusion criteria but were still included in the study. None of the authors have responded to any correspondence from the editor about this retraction.</p>

<p>Sleuth Kevin Patrick first posted on PubPeer about the article in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5C12A3910CFB2BFD127628DE63841A#1">December 2022</a>, using his account named “Actinopolyspora biskrensis.” His post asked the authors to comment on “some apparent discrepancies between the study design described in the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04359836">registered clinical trial </a>and the study reported upon in this paper.” For example, he noted it seemed four of the study’s 14 participants “did not meet the definition for inclusion in the study but were included in the paper&#8217;s results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick added several more comments in January 2023, questioning both the author’s statement they had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5C12A3910CFB2BFD127628DE63841A#2">no competing interests</a> and the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5C12A3910CFB2BFD127628DE63841A#3">ethical approval</a> for the trial. He also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5C12A3910CFB2BFD127628DE63841A#6">pointed out</a> the authors referenced an observational study of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized COVID patients that concluded “the results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine at present,” used to support the authors’ assertion “numerous other studies have also reported the efficacy” of the drug for COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick emailed the publisher, Springer Nature’s BioMed Central, to alert them to the PubPeer posts as he left them, but received no response. This April, more than two years later, he followed up to ask whether the paper had been investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>William Shadbolt, senior publisher at Springer Nature, responded, writing, “We have already been alerted to this paper.” Shadbolt wrote he could not comment on ongoing cases, but said he would share any updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On social media, Hazan has pointed out Patrick has “no medical training or scientific credentials and therefore shouldn’t have any role in post publication peer review,” Patrick told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I argue the opposite: if even I (with no medical training or scientific credentials) can find fatal flaws in research that authors are unable to address to the satisfaction of the editors, the problem isn’t me,” he said.</p>



<p>We reached out to Niyaz Ahmed, editor in chief of <em>Gut Pathogens</em>, and received a statement from Michael Stacey, head of communications for journals at Springer Nature:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We were alerted by a reader to concerns raised about this paper on PubPeer. We take such concerns extremely seriously and immediately commenced a thorough investigation into the matter following an established process and in line with the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) best practice. The investigation was conducted by the journal editors with support from the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Once the investigation was complete, we concluded that the most appropriate action to take was retraction of the paper, as there were significant discrepancies between the registered clinical trial protocol and the protocol as described in the published paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Hazan disputed the notice’s statement that the authors didn’t show they had the necessary ethical approvals. “Bullshit,” she said. “We sent them the papers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She initially offered to share her email exchanges with the journal to demonstrate the authors had replied to all the editors’ comments and were told the situation was “all clear” — but weren’t informed of the retraction decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than two weeks later, she still had not shared the correspondence but sent us an email asserting “<em>Retraction Watch</em> has been publicly implicated in an alleged multi-stage campaign that includes anonymous smear tactics, selective amplification, and close coordination with PubPeer-affiliated actors, including those using false identities and operating allegedly fraudulent accounts,” citing <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1934331058272772585">a Science Guardians post</a> that contained numerous false allegations and vague insinuations. Science Guardians is an anonymous social media account that has rebuffed all requests to be transparent.</p>



<p>As a condition of responding to our inquiry about sharing the emails, she asked Retraction Watch to “clarify” the “editorial safeguards and independence policies” for our coverage of cases involving PubPeer, and the “specific affiliations, funding sources, or professional connections” between us, PubPeer, “and the so-called ‘sleuths’ you routinely cite.” She also asked how we “intend to ensure journalistic fairness and context, particularly when writing about researchers targeted by these coordinated and anonymous campaigns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, we shared links to our published <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/editorial-independence-policy/">editorial independence policy</a> and <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/about-the-center-for-scientific-integrity/#financial">tax returns</a> for the Center for Scientific Integrity, Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit organization, which we have made public every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hazan charged we “did not address the specific points I raised regarding conflicts of interest and editorial safeguards,” particularly regarding our cofounder Ivan Oransky’s volunteer position on the board of the PubPeer Foundation. We disclose that relationship in stories when relevant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hours later, Hazan sent us <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Response-to-Retraction-of-SARS-CoV-2-in-Fecal-Material-Paper.docx-Google-Docs_Redacted.pdf">a document</a> with a formal response to the retraction, including a few emails between the corresponding author of the paper and Shadbolt, of Springer Nature. The emails include the authors’ responses to the questions Patrick raised on PubPeer and Shadbolt’s acknowledgement of receiving them, but no communication about the outcome of the publisher’s investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the phone, Hazan said the attention to her papers on PubPeer and retractions interfered with her research and ability to publish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That was a landmark study,” she said. “It hurts me to my core, to the point I&#8217;m like, ‘Maybe I should stop.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, Hazan told a Retraction Watch reporter to “Go back to your editors and say, &#8216;Dr. Hazan is not interested in being a punching bag.’” She later apologized for taking out her “anger” on the reporter. </p>
