<p>A prominent education researcher in Australia is demanding compensation from a critic whose claims of plagiarism triggered the university to look into his work. Although the resulting examination of work by John Hattie, director of an education research institute at the University of Melbourne, ended without a finding of misconduct, the critic, Stephen Vainker, insists Hattie’s publications are rife with data errors and insufficient attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker came across “strange” citations in a paper by Hattie while studying for his doctorate in education management seven years ago. At first, he found 12 sentences lifted word-for-word, he said, from the original source about workplace management without proper citation. Among them were seven instances in which words such as “people” or &#8220;individuals&#8221; were changed to education-related words, such as “students.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then Vainker looked through Hattie’s most popular and influential text, <em>Visible Learning</em>,<em> </em>and its sequel, as well as his doctoral thesis, finding what he claimed were hundreds of data errors and examples of plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132618"></span>



<p>“I looked up what they wrote that [Hattie] was citing,” Vainker, now a teacher in England, told Retraction Watch. “And then I just realized it was exactly the same, word-for-word.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker compiled his findings into two non-peer reviewed articles, and sent them last summer to the University of Melbourne. According to a report we have seen, the university has decided Vainker&#8217;s findings don’t warrant further investigation, despite finding errors in Hattie’s work they thought should be corrected, and deficiencies in his citation practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since reporting his findings, Vainker has heard from Hattie’s lawyers demanding he apologize, retract his comments and withdraw his complaint to the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hattie maintains that he has never plagiarized another person’s work, according to a letter his lawyers sent us. Hattie also claims Vainker’s “defamatory” allegations constitute “cyber-bullying and trolling.” In May, Hattie commenced formal legal proceedings against Vainker in the Supreme Court of Victoria, in Australia, after Vainker didn’t remove his allegations from online platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When <em>Visible Learning</em> first came out in 2008, its central idea that educators could tangibly increase student learning through interventions — such as self-reported grades, timely feedback and positive teacher-student relationships — influenced schools around the world. Government reports cited the findings and they became part of an education reform movement.</p>



<p>Hattie’s book draws on more than 800 meta-analyses, or a collective total of more than 50,000 smaller studies, ranking interventions using a statistical measure called Cohen&#8217;s d, which describes the size of an effect. Since its release, Hattie has faced criticism about <a href="https://visablelearning.blogspot.com/">studies counted multiple times</a>, <a href="https://www.scup.com/doi/10.18261/ISSN1504-2987-2011-06-06">incomparable populations</a> and other <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284499397_Invisible_Learnings_A_commentary_on_John_Hattie's_book_visible_learning_A_synthesis_of_over_800_metaanalyses_relating_to_achievement">statistical calculations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter sent on behalf of Hattie, his lawyers told us that he “welcomes healthy and respectful academic debate,” and has provided a “robust defence” of his research methods <a href="https://www.visiblelearning.com/content/gold-papers">in an online series called The Gold Papers.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker says he found more serious concerns in Hattie’s publications, alleging that Hattie has plagiarized 537 times in his Ph.D. thesis, <em>Visible Learning</em> and the book’s sequel, with 432 of those being insufficient paraphrasing and the others examples of copying the source material directly. Vainker also raised concerns about data errors in Hattie’s work, claiming that several meta-analyses had been incorrectly included because of issues with dependent and independent variables, as well as duplicated inclusions and papers that weren’t meta-analyses to begin with. He also claimed data had been extracted or presented incorrectly — amounting to more than 200 alleged errors in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker documented the first findings in a May 2024 manuscript titled “<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rzjc9_v1">John Hattie’s failures of academic integrity and the fragility of the education reform movement</a>.” He followed with a second manuscript in March this year, “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390235308_THE_CAREER_OF_JOHN_HATTIE_PLAGIARISM_MISCONDUCT_AND_THE_COARSENING_OF_EDUCATION">The Career of John Hattie: Plagiarism, Misconduct, and the Coarsening of Education</a>.” He also posted about his findings on the social media platform X.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Vainker took his findings to the University of Melbourne. The university conducted a preliminary assessment of whether the meta-analyses data in Hattie’s online database — essentially an online version of the data found in the book — had been falsified, fabricated or misrepresented, and whether Hattie had plagiarized material in the sequel to <em>Visible Learning</em>. Hattie produced both works while at the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, in a letter we have seen<em> </em>that describes the results of the university’s assessment, Kate Smith-Miles, the university’s pro vice-chancellor of research capability, acknowledged to Vainker that the database contained “unintended” errors which “should be corrected,” and that Hattie could improve his citation practices. But she concluded that a formal investigation was not “necessary or appropriate” and that unintentional errors do not typically constitute research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university’s research integrity office did not directly respond to our questions about the investigation, saying the university “addresses all concerns about research integrity under the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, a structured process that prioritises procedural fairness, confidentiality and integrity.” They added that confidentiality “is essential to ensure any investigation process is conducted fairly. This includes protecting the rights of those raising concerns and those subject to review.”</p>



<p>According to Smith-Miles’ letter, the university engaged an independent expert, Michael Hebert of the University of California, Irvine, to look at the data errors. Hebert confirmed mistakes in 11 of the 14 randomly selected examples of data error, and identified 20 more possible errors. He attributed the issues to human error or methodological choices, but not deliberate falsification. The letter describes that Hattie disputed Hebert’s findings, calling the data errors“insignificant” to the database as a whole and “negligible at best.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hebert also recommended Hattie work with a team with broader expertise to improve the reliability of the database. Hattie rejected that suggestion, saying he personally coded the data with assistance from research aids, and that a big team was unnecessary. Hebert has not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university also reviewed 14 of the 181 alleged instances of plagiarism Vainker had submitted. It concluded none amounted to plagiarism, though 10 were potential examples of “questionable citation practices.” In the letter, Hattie defends his citations practices by referring to one of the leading citation style guides in social sciences research – the APA7 — which suggests against over-citing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Melbourne chose not to investigate further, although the report acknowledges that when taken as a whole, the citation errors “may suggest more widespread citation and referencing issues with The Sequel,” according to the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker criticized the university’s approach, saying they “wanted to sound as tough as possible in the report without actually fully investigating it.” He said there was “no possible reason to take a sample” instead of checking all 181 plagiarism allegations. “You could look at that in an hour, and you could check each one out in a week. They’ve taken a year,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker asked the university which of the 14 examples of purported plagiarism it had chosen to review. In the same email, he pointed to 11 examples he said showed word-for-word copying. On July 11, a research integrity officer at the university acknowledged that the additional examples “have given rise to concerns which were not apparent from our initial random sample review.” The officer said the university was seeking additional information from Hattie, whose response would determine whether further action was warranted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Vainker had previously sent Hattie the plagiarism allegations in his first publication from May 2024. That paper alleged that Hattie had taken text directly from goal-setting theorists, replacing workplace terms with educational ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hattie responded August 2024, writing that academics “thrive on critique,” though it has been his policy “not to react to critiques.” He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You claim I have plagiarized, lack academic integrity, introduce false totals, am flippant, etc. These are serious charges. I strongly claim that these claims are unfair and untrue &#8212; the 3.5 pages that you focus on clearly relies on Locke and Latham’s work – as noted in the pages. I have checked with appropriate sources and they see no issues. It is clear I am indeed paraphrasing their work, adopting it into a more educational sphere, and there is NO doubt that this is Locke and Latham&#8217;s work. Further, there is NO evidence of plagiarism. The 7th ed APA Manual of Style clearly states that overciting should be avoided… there is no doubt that the work relies on and is attributed to Locke and Latham.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the email, he invited Vainker to remove the “potentially defamatory” claims about plagiarism and republish the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months after Hattie’s email, just before Christmas, Vainker heard from Hattie’s lawyers. Their letter accused Vainker of defamation over the 2024 paper and 12 posts on X about his findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker’s posts on X accuse Hattie of <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1799200002306081121">plagiarism</a> and <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1796148314695508199">failing to uphold academic standards</a>, and call his database <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1823664584579817628">“total garbage.”</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawyers demanded that he remove the paper and the posts, apologize, pay Hattie’s legal fees and compensation, and withdraw his complaint to the University of Melbourne’s Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-to-Ms-Youmshajekian-re-Prof-Hattie-20.08.2025_Redacted.pdf">statement sent to us from his lawyers</a>, Hattie said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I have never plagiarised another person’s work. I have always welcomed the fair and objective academic critique of my research and of Visible Learning. However, Dr Vainker’s article and his posts about me on X go well beyond this. He has engaged in a deliberate and personal attack on my reputation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Dr Vainker has published a voluminous number of posts and comments about me on X which he has acknowledged are designed to ruin my reputation and thereby bring an end to the education reform movement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In engaging in this vitriolic campaign against me and my work, Dr Vainker has himself failed to act with academic integrity. He has instead acted with malice. …</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Dr Vainker has never sought to discuss his views about my work with me or correspond with me in a respectful way as one would expect of a fellow academic. In those circumstances, his allegations that I have acted dishonestly and without integrity are simply indefensible.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Publishing the article and his posts on X about me are part of a broader campaign Dr Vainker has waged against me, which is nothing short of cyber-bullying and trolling.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lawyers also told us that Hattie was unable to comment on the University of Melbourne’s investigation, citing confidentiality, but maintain that Vainker’s complaint to the university is “unsubstantiated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve done the work, I&#8217;ve checked it, I know I&#8217;m right,” Vainker said of the lawyers’ demands to him. “I think the only possible role it could have would be to scare me off, once you actually start getting into it… he hasn&#8217;t got a case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t think he could write the books that he has without plagiarizing,” Vainker said. “And so I think the plagiarism, I think it&#8217;s not just sloppiness, I think it&#8217;s essential to his work.”&nbsp;</p>

It’s a travesty of American science that Bhattacharya was installed as the Trumpist bureaucrat tasked with the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/senators-press-nih-director-killed-grants-and-proposal-slash-agency-s-funding" target="_blank">destruction of NIH</a>, the world’s premiere funder of biomedical research.<br /><br />Her latest masterwork of demolition compares Bhattacharya to Soviet fraudster (and Stalin favorite) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko" target="_blank">Trofim Lysenko</a>, who denied the genetic transmission of traits, persecuted his enemies, and killed seven million people in a famine of his own doing.<br /><br />I urge you to read Dr. Rasmussen’s entire piece. Some highlights are below.<div><blockquote><br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/bhattacharya-is-the-new-lysenko">Bhattacharya is the New Lysenko</a> </span></b><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Starving the NIH through ineptitude, bitterness, and thirst for revenge<br /></span><p>&nbsp;</p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span><a href="https://substack.com/@rasmussenretorts">DR. ANGELA RASMUSSEN</a><br /><br />…<br /><br />Both [Lysenko and Bhattacharya] have capitalized on population-level disasters to climb out of academic obscurity into powerful positions. Both did so by advancing authoritarian political interests and telling a dictator what he wanted to hear. Both proposed and doubled down on policies that would kill millions of people, even resorting to manipulating or manufacturing data to justify them. Both were so emotionally fragile and unable to tolerate expert criticism that they pursued mortal vendettas against entire scientific fields of study. The only difference is that Lysenko hated genetics, while Bhattacharya hates public health, virology, and vaccines.</blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><b><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><b><span style="font-size: medium;">How much does Bhattacharya hate public health?</span></b><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Bhattacharya first came to prominence with the Santa Clara serology study in April 2020, a widely pilloried preprint that claimed the mortality rate of COVID-19 was much lower than most other estimates. It was later revealed that this study was partly funded by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/stanford-coronavirus-neeleman-ioannidis-whistleblower">the CEO of JetBlue Airlines</a>, who was looking for data to support lifting pandemic-related restrictions on air travel. A few months later, Bhattacharya dropped the <a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/sign-the-bethesda-declaration">Great Barrington Declaration</a>, a pandemic policy proposal calling for “vulnerable” people to isolate forever, while encouraging a COVID free-for-all everywhere else. That would have resulted in mass infection and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000298">another million deaths</a> in the US if it had been implemented.</blockquote><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 18.9px; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; font-width: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 24.5px;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 18.93px;"></span><br /></p><br /><b><span style="font-size: medium;">How much does Bhattacharya hate vaccines?</span></b><br /><br /><blockquote>Bhattacharya started lying about vaccines in 2021. That was when he appeared on a panel hosted by “vaccine safety” fanatic Steve Kirsch and his Great Barrington Declaration co-author Martin Kulldorff, the anti-vax barrow-wight who is currently <a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/meet-the-anti-vax-acip-first-round">chairing ACIP</a>, <a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/will-the-last-expert-to-leave-acip">purging it of expertise</a>, and <a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/tiny-coffins-across-america">trying to cancel the MMRV vaccine</a>. At this panel, Bhattacharya and Kulldorff sat silent, nodding in tacit approval as Kirsch claimed falsely that COVID vaccines killed more than half a million people.</blockquote><p class="p2" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 18.9px; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; font-width: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 24.5px;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 18.93px;"></span><br /></p><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Her inevitable conclusion:</b><br />“Bhattacharya is the American Lysenko and must be removed as NIH Director.”</span><br /><br /><blockquote>We know that Bhattacharya currently has control of American biomedical research, is eagerly gutting research that does not comport with his own mass death-inducing crank beliefs for Trump, and really wants revenge against anyone who ever pointed out that the Great Barrington Declaration would kill millions, the evidence does not show that the pandemic began with a lab leak, or that mRNA vaccine technology is safe, effective, and essential for pandemic preparedness. We know how this story will end. We must have the courage as a scientific community to stand united against it.</blockquote><br /><b><span style="font-size: medium;">What can we do as scientists?

<div><br />Dr. Berg has recently collected some of his missives into a document called <a href="https://jeremymberg.github.io/jeremyberg.github.io/Fifty%20Shades%20of%20Jay.pdf" target="_blank">Fifty Shades of “Jay”</a>, which starts out with helpful suggestions (which are ignored) but quickly reaches the conclusion that “Jay” is willfully ignorant and deceptive.<br /><br /><p></p><blockquote>I&nbsp;have been closely monitoring NIH progress and policies throughout the year. When Director Bhattacharya began making public statements of various sorts that revealed his lack of knowledge about NIH, I started to send emails in good faith to share my knowledge about NIH programs with him to help him perform his important job more effectively.

<p>A journal has retracted a 2025 paper on social media and anxiety after a reader raised questions about the data – and thanks to the mentorship of a sleuth or two.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-025-02810-0">The article</a> appeared in 2023 in <em>BMC Psychology</em>, a Springer Nature title. The sole author was Li Sun, whose affiliation is listed as the School of Marxism at Zhoukou Vocational and Technical College, in China.</p>



<p>According to the abstract of the paper, the research explored “the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on university students&#8217; anxiety, loneliness, and well-being.” Those apps were “Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer” which “offer a range of mindfulness exercises and resources for users to explore.”</p>



<span id="more-132605"></span>



<p>Earlier this year, the article caught the eye of <a href="https://stevencrane.me/">Steven Crane</a>, a behavior researcher at Stanford University, who was doing a “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580325/">scoping review</a>” of the relevant literature on interventions to promote social connection in young adults.</p>



<p>The results in Sun’s study struck Crane as “too good to be true,” with “improbably high” effect sizes for the interventions described in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, Crane observed, the intervention itself was “minimal.” Participants in the study were “just invited to download some mindfulness apps (no measure of whether they did or how much they used them is mentioned).” Although “there&#8217;s some evidence that mindfulness interventions can improve social connectedness a little” the effects are “never this big,” he mused in emails provided to Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the published reviews, neither the journal’s review nor peer reviews raised questions about the intervention or the effect size. The journal seems to have asked about “<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40359-023-01398-7/40359_2023_1398_AuthorComment_V4.pdf">textual overlap</a>” with another paper, a concern the author addressed. Two <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40359-023-01398-7/40359_2023_1398_ReviewerReport_V4_R1.pdf">peer</a> <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40359-023-01398-7/40359_2023_1398_ReviewerReport_V4_R1.pdf">reviewers</a> had no substantive comments, and a third reviewer made suggestions on the title, introduction and implications, and <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40359-023-01398-7/40359_2023_1398_ReviewerReport_V4_R3.pdf">suggested</a> the author focus on “the problematic use of social media.”<br><br>Wondering how to handle the article in the context of his review, Crane reached out to Stuart Buck, executive director of the Good Science Project, for advice. Could Buck point him to people who might be able to do a “deep investigation” into the data?</p>



<p>Buck turned to Nick Brown, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/28/hundreds-hours-work-vindicated-critic-food-researcher-reacts-new-retraction/">psychologist and sleuth</a>, who responded with a run-down of the issues he identified in the work — confirming Crane’s suspicions. He advised Buck to tell Crane to ask Sun for the data:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>… and in case of refusal or non-answer then write to the journal and invoke their data sharing policy&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#availability+of+data+and+materials">https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#availability+of+data+and+materials</a>). If by some chance the data do show up then I&#8217;d be happy to put in some time to reproduce the analyses. (I suspect that there may well be no dataset and that the results were derived proctologically.)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But as Brown told Crane, appealing to help from journal editors can be a losing battle. The response, the sleuth wrote, often is: “‘Oh, well, we have no way to actually force the authors to share their data, sorry about that’. But sometimes you have to be like Tom Hanks in the scene near the end of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, duty-bound to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX5aogTXt78&amp;t=370s">fire your last six bullets</a> at the approaching Tiger tank, in the hope that it just might explode. Occasionally the editor does step up and sends some rocket-firing P-51s.”</p>



<p>Crane took the advice and wrote to the author, who didn’t respond. So in April he reached out to the journal via its contact form, noting the lack of response and the journal’s data policy. The appeal succeeded. The editors decided to retract the paper the following month:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The editor and the publisher have retracted this article. The article was submitted to be part of a guest-edited issue. An investigation by the publisher found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised editorial handling and peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references or not being in scope of the journal or guest-edited issue. Based on the investigation’s findings the editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The author has not responded to correspondence regarding this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sun did not respond to our request for comment, either.<br><br>Meanwhile, Crane said it “feels good to do my tiny part of cleaning up the scientific record.” He said he has learned several important lessons from his brush with sleuthdom – the first being it takes a certain personality to be willing to embark on such an effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m a pretty ‘high agency’ sort of person to go to this length to check something out, and probably wouldn&#8217;t have done it if I weren&#8217;t conducting a formal review that included this paper,” he told us. “All of this — the sleuthing, the open science practices, etc — does take real work and we do need ways to incentivize this beyond a mildly satisfying volunteer endeavor.”<br><br>While he said he was happy with how the journal behaved — “appropriately and on a reasonable timeframe” — the experience “emphasizes the importance to me of all of us adopting higher open science standards of preregistration and data sharing as table stakes for most publications in psychology. But as I&#8217;ve discovered in prior research, most of the top publications over the past decade are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240016">not following these practices</a>, and most for no particularly good reason.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsevier has retracted two papers for image duplication – 13 years after the authors alerted the journal to issues with the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers are the third and fourth retractions for a group of researchers in Ireland. The team had asked Elsevier journals to retract five papers in April 2012 — one of which is still in process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first two papers, published in <em>Cancer Letters</em>, were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/04/26/two-cancer-papers-retracted-because-authors-are-unable-to-guarantee-the-accuracy-of-some-of-the-figures/">retracted in 2013</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then last week, two more articles, published in the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology </em>(<em>EJP</em>), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.04.064">were</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.178044">retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132600"></span>



<p>Why the delay? The publisher said it only recently discovered the unfulfilled request.</p>



<p>“During updates to the retraction platform and tool to clear any possible backlogs, <em>EJP</em> staff received information about a case concerning some <em>EJP </em>articles in the system,” a spokesperson for Elsevier told Retraction Watch. “The authors were contacted for clarification and the publisher submitted retraction requests for the two articles.“</p>



<p>The authors had “concerns that they could no longer guarantee the accuracy of certain figures within the paper,” according to both <em>EJP </em>retraction notices, which cite image duplications among the five papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2007.04.003">remaining article</a>, which appeared in <em>Chemico-Biological Interactions</em>, “has yet to be retracted,” according to the Elsevier spokesperson. “We are in touch with the current EIC [Editor in Chief] on this paper.”</p>



<p>All five papers discuss aspects of apoptosis in human cancer cells.</p>



<p>The <em>Cancer Letters</em> papers retracted in 2013 have a single citation each, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. One of the newly retracted papers in <em>EJP </em>has 65 citations, 50 of which occurred in 2013 or later, after the authors reported the image duplications. The other <em>EJP</em> paper has 39 citations, 23 of which were from 2013 or later. The not-yet-retracted <em>Chemico-Biological Interactions</em> paper has 18 citations, 12 of which occurred in 2013 or later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We strive to correct our records promptly whenever necessary,” the Elsevier spokesperson told us. The retraction notices both state, “the Publisher wishes to apologise to the authors for the delayed retraction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denise Egan is the corresponding author on all five articles. Egan’s affiliation at the time was Institute of Technology Tallaght, now part of Technological University Dublin. We reached out to Egan on August 14, the date the second retraction became available online, and have not received a response.</p>
