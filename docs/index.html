                Most studies of neurological disorders in mice erroneously treat multiple samples from a single animal as independent replicates, according to a new analysis. But scientists and journals can take steps to curb this practice.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Eleonora Bernasconi will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Computational study of the effects of transcranial stimulation on the cerebellum&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising technique that could provide
treatment for patients with cerebellar disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of
the action of TMS on the cerebellum are still unknown. Our goal is to study the effects of
TMS on the cerebellum.
We developed a model of the cerebellum. We stimulated all compartments of all neurons with
a square wave, whose amplitude is solely dependent on the distance between the neuron
compartment and the source of the stimulus. The stimulus was applied as a voltage using the
extracellular mechanism in NEURON. We modelled the stimulus with frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Hz.
The higher the stimulus frequency, the bigger the amplitude of the modulation. For stimulus
frequencies above 50 Hz, the Purkinje cell’s instantaneous firing rate no longer oscillates
in accordance with the stimulus.
We show that stimulus frequency can significantly impact the cell’s behaviour, highlighting the
importance of carefully selecting this parameter in clinical settings. Future work will
employ a more realistic simulation model.</p>

<p>Brown University physician-scientist Wafik El-Deiry has been a longtime critic of the post-publication forum PubPeer, where <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Wafik+S.+El-Deiry">75 of his papers</a> have been flagged. For example, <a href="https://x.com/weldeiry/status/1911926691540226121">in an April post</a> on X, formerly Twitter, he stated, “It is not good that PubPeer has been weaponized and has become tyrannical.” <a href="https://x.com/weldeiry/status/1813549460699398276">In July 2024</a>, he referred to the emails authors receive when someone posts a comment about their papers as being “under attack by PubPeer and their anonymous mob.”</p>



<p>PubPeer, started in 2012, <a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/award-winners-finalists/recipients-2024/pubpeer">won the 2024 Einstein Award</a> For Promoting Quality in Research. (Disclosure: Our co-founder Ivan Oransky is a volunteer member of the board of directors of the PubPeer Foundation.)</p>



<p>In April, a site called <a href="https://scienceguardians.com/">Science Guardians</a>, an “online journal club” with remarkable similarities – but also key differences – to PubPeer, launched what it called an “<a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1910735845063094560">investigation</a>” into PubPeer. Since then the anonymous account has <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1924148782628802857">posted</a> <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1931380280943600095">numerous</a> <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1921230887636623441">posts</a> on X <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1913262710185418935">critiquing</a> PubPeer while promising to reveal the “perpetrators of the PubPeer Network Mob.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132105"></span>



<p>Sleuth <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thatsregrettab1.bsky.social">Kevin Patrick</a> was an early target of Science Guardians, which called him “<a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1910735845063094560">Perpetrator 1</a>.” The posts attributed usernames to Patrick that weren’t his, among other inaccurate statements. “They don’t seem to care too much about the facts,” Patrick said. “They have a point of view that they want to share, whether the facts are real or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>El-Deiry frequently amplifies @SciGuardians’ posts by sharing them on X. ScienceGuardians has 1,600 followers; El-Deiry has 16,700.</p>



<p>El-Deiry <a href="https://cancerletter.com/podcastc/20250521-wafik-el-deiry/">has discussed publicly</a> that he is a candidate for the top job at the National Cancer Institute. He is also a <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/editorial-board/">co-editor-in-chief</a> of the journal <em>Oncotarget</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We extended an invitation to El-Deiry to answer questions on his thoughts on scientific publishing, post-publication review and on if he’s still in the running at NCI.</p>



<p>The questions were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have referred to the commenters on PubPeer as a “mob” since <a href="https://x.com/weldeiry/status/1813549460699398276">at least July 2024</a>, and you’ve stated it has been “weaponized and has become tyrannical.” Can you clarify why you think this is the case?</li>



<li>Does your position on PubPeer extend into post-publication review as a whole?</li>



<li>You stated in November 2024 that <a href="https://x.com/weldeiry/status/1861413297871815003">you joined</a> Science Guardians. Was that as a commenter/participant in the forum, or as a board member, adviser, or something else? </li>



<li>There are no other named members or affiliates of Science Guardians. Why the lack of transparency on who is overseeing discussions on the website and creating the posts on X?</li>



<li>You have <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674(93)90500-P.pdf">published</a> quite <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/38291">prolifically</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0695-570">across</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0492-45">many</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5358.1954">journals</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1714448">some of which</a> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/28/rfk-jr-medical-journals">recently called “corrupt.”</a> What do you think about his proposal to create alternative, government-run journals? </li>



<li>And finally: Any update on your status in the running for NCI director?</li>
</ul>



<p>El-Deiry responded at 5:33 p.m. EDT today, responding partially to only a few of our questions:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for reaching out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To clarify, I am not involved in the operations or leadership of ScienceGuardians. Like many others in the academic community, I registered on their post-publication peer review platform and have occasionally reshared posts I found of interest or relevance. These posts have reached tens of thousands of individuals and have been reposted by hundreds; the opinions expressed within them span a broad spectrum of voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe it is important for post-publication peer review to remain open, respectful, and accountable. Beyond that, I have no further comments at this time.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>El-Deiry posted a screenshot of the <a href="https://x.com/weldeiry/status/1932542734537277721">email and his response on X</a>, also at 5:33 p.m. EDT, with the message: “In the interest of transparency I am sharing this request that appeared in my inbox earlier today. I have no other comment.”</p>



<p>A paper on which El-Deiry was sixth author was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/08/23/retraction-appears-for-harvard-scientist-who-had-two-mega-corrections-last-year/">retracted in 2013</a> because “the presentation issues are beyond the limits of acceptable scientific standards.” In 2021, the last author of that paper, Sam W. Lee, paid <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/13/false-claims-allegations-cost-mass-general-former-harvard-researcher-more-than-1-million/">$215,000 to settle claims</a> that he used fake data in a grant application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A physics journal has informed an embattled rocket scientist that it will retract three of his papers, citing concerns raised by the retraction of another of his papers last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All three articles appear in <em>Physics of Fluids</em>, published by AIP Publishing, and describe a phenomenon called “Sanal flow choking.” As we reported last year, some scientists have denounced the concept as “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/24/controversial-rocket-scientist-in-india-threatens-legal-action-after-journals-pull-papers/">absolute nonsense</a>.” The researcher who coined the phrase is the lead author on all papers, V.R. Sanal Kumar, a professor of aerospace engineering at Amity University in New Delhi. </p>



<p>The papers are:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132099"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0040440">The theoretical prediction of the boundary-layer-blockage and external flow choking at moving aircraft in ground effects</a>,” published in March 2021 and cited 24 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </li>



<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0086638">Universal benchmark data of the three-dimensional boundary layer blockage and average friction coefficient for in silico code verification</a>,” published in April 2022 and cited 12 times. </li>



<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0105407">In vitro prediction of the lower/upper-critical biofluid flow choking index and in vivo demonstration of flow choking in the stenosis artery of the animal with air embolism</a>,” published in October 2022 and cited 11 times. </li>
</ul>



<p><em>AIP Advances,</em> which is owned by the same publisher, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0236054">retracted a paper by Kumar</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, the editorial office of <em>Physics of Fluids</em> referenced the October retraction, telling Kumar “concerns were raised related to the content of the manuscripts due to previous work retracted by <em>AIP Advances</em>.”</p>



<p>Although the papers aren’t yet marked as retracted, the journal’s editorial office told Kumar in a May 16 email they planned to retract his work due to “significant issues affecting the reliability of the findings and conclusions of these three articles.” The decision followed a post-publication review, which found a theoretical framework that “fundamentally violates the second law of thermodynamics.” In addition, three of the citations in one paper were to retracted studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the initial peer reviews for each article, which Kumar provided to us, at least one reviewer stated they did not recommend publication of the manuscript without substantial revision. Kumar also provided his responses to the editor and reviewer comments purportedly addressing the issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email dated Jan. 6, 2021, one referee’s comments about one of the manuscripts stated “it is difficult to draw the conclusion from them as to why this study has been carried out,” and “I cannot support publication unless the authors undertake all the above actions in full.” Kumar provided us his responses to the reviewer comments, as well as a Feb. 3, 2021 email from the journal that the revision had been accepted and another email dated February 6 that the journal had chosen it as a highlighted “Editor’s Pick.”</p>



<p>In addition to retracting the three published papers, the journal told Kumar it was placing five of his submitted/accepted manuscripts on production hold “pending the results of our investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar responded to the journal’s email to “formally and unequivocally reject” the decision given the “life saving relevance” of the papers. He called the claim about the paper violating a rule of thermodynamics a “misinterpretation” and said the retractions for cited studies are “under formal investigation.” Notably, Kumar was lead author on all three.</p>



<p>Kumar told us in an email the retractions are a “coordinated, international campaign to sabotage a breakthrough scientific theory with immediate applications across aerospace, biomedical, and national defense sectors.” He also told us he has formally complained to the Committee on Publication Ethics and “notified the relevant government authorities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked if they still planned to retract the articles, the journal said they couldn’t “yet comment publicly on the outcome of the investigation.”</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132076" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-1024x538.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-300x158.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-768x403.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A study on how conversations can change minds grabbed headlines when it was published — and again five months later when retracted.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Gay Advocates Can Shift Same-Sex Marriage Views,” read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/health/gay-marriage-canvassing-study-science.html?_r=0">the <em>New York Times</em> headline</a>. “Doorstep visits change attitudes on gay marriage,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-gay-canvassing-20141211-story.html">declared the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>. “Cure Homophobia With This One Weird Trick!” <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/12/homophobes-support-marriage-equality-when-gay-people-talk-to-them.html"><em>Slate</em> spouted</a>.</p>



<p>Driving those headlines was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1256151">a December 2014 study</a> in <em>Science, </em>by Michael J. LaCour, then a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Donald Green, a professor at Columbia University.</p>



<p>Researchers praised the “buzzy new study,” as <em>Slate </em>called it at the time, for its robust effects and impressive results. The key finding: A brief conversation with a gay door-to-door canvasser could change the mind of someone opposed to same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time the study was published, David Broockman, then a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, had already seen LaCour’s results and was keen to pursue his own version of it. He and fellow graduate student Joshua Kalla had collaborated before and wanted to look more closely at the impact canvassing could have on elections. But as the pair deconstructed LaCour’s study to figure out how to replicate it, they hit several curious stumbling blocks. And when they got a hold of LaCour’s dataset, or replication package, they quickly realized the results weren’t adding up.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132075"></span>



<p>The two graduate students found themselves in somewhat uncharted territory for how to share their critique. They wrote up their findings, recruiting help from Yale statistician P. Aronow. They shared the report with Green, the senior author on the paper, who confronted LaCour with the critique.</p>



<p>Then, the trio posted the report with its unassuming title, “<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/qy2se_v1">Irregularities in LaCour</a>,” online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was “like our personal Cuban Missile Crisis,” Broockman said in an interview with Retraction Watch last month. “There was basically this period between when our little PDF report went online and our little world exploded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their revelations about “statistical irregularities” and false statements triggered the paper’s downward spiral, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">cataloged in nearly real time</a> on Retraction Watch and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121876/door-door-deception">widely</a> <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html">reported</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/science-retracts-gay-marriage-paper-without-agreement-lead-author-lacour">elsewhere</a>, culminating in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac6638">the paper’s official retraction</a> 10 years ago this week.</p>



<p>A decade later, Broockman, Kalla and Green continue to study persuasion in politics, among other topics. Their involvement in one of the most widely publicized retractions had some lasting effects on how they approach research. And the intervening years have also brought some welcome changes to research and data practices in their field.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘There’s no rule book for this’</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After Broockman and Kalla’s report went public, their peers were unsure how to react. “A lot of the fears we had felt like they were starting to come true,” said <a href="https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/david-edward-broockman">Broockman</a>, now an associate professor at Berkeley. “People were like, ‘is this the right thing to do? Was this the right procedure?’” he said. “We were like, ‘there’s no rule book for this.’”</p>



<p>The same is true today. Post-publication peer review has gained more prominence since 2014, thanks to data sleuths, PubPeer and other efforts to police the literature. This week, a team of sleuths <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/04/cosig-sleuths-publish-toolkit-post-publication-review/">published a series of 25 guides</a> on how to spot integrity issues. But a post on PubPeer is unlikely to draw attention beyond certain circles, and formal investigations trigger processes that move at an academic pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think there&#8217;s still a cultural problem in academia — and there was at the time — there&#8217;s just a lot of costs associated with criticizing existing research,” Broockman said. “The stories that you&#8217;re worried people are going to tell about you, I think that remains a big deterrent for people to come forward with whatever issues they have. I think academia has made a little bit of progress on that and could make more.”</p>

<p>When Broockman and Kalla spoke with us, news had just broken that <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-163876634">MIT called for the withdrawal</a> of an AI study done by an economics graduate student. Kalla hadn’t been familiar with the research — which had not yet been published but was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866">posted as a preprint</a> — or the university’s announcement. But he had read <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-163876634">Stuart Buck’s May 18 newsletter</a> recounting his critique of the study — and the backlash Buck faced for asking questions about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He got pushback for not following proper etiquette, for not being kind and understanding and kind of wrong to be questioning the research paper,” said <a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/joshua-kalla">Kalla</a>, now an associate professor at Yale University. “I don&#8217;t know if the norms have changed over the last 10 years, but Stuart is raising some of those same concerns that we had 10 years ago.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, no matter which option a person chooses, there’s pushback, Broockman said.</p>



<p>“I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many people&#8217;s first instinct in these circumstances is to criticize the person raising the issue,” he said. “That&#8217;s really problematic. I think Stuart&#8217;s post shows that this remains a problem.”</p>



<p>Kalla said he encourages early-career researchers to take a direct, respectful approach when critiquing anyone’s work. “The key advice I give to graduate students is to have that kind of respect and curiosity, since oftentimes there aren&#8217;t the smoking guns that David and I had 10 years ago,” he said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘The hero here is open data’</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2014, publishing datasets, code and documentation with research papers was relatively uncommon. But that’s ultimately what led Broockman and Kalla to realize the “irregularities” they had found with LaCour’s study execution were something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The hero here is open data. That&#8217;s what led us to do this,” Broockman said. “This is one example – it&#8217;s an extreme example – of why open data is important.”</p>



<p>“Ten years ago, the idea of pre-analysis plans, the idea of open data, the idea that you need to have reasonable sample sizes and studies, that was much more like a fringe, vanguard thing,” Broockman said. “My sense is that in the three main social science quantitative fields of psychology, political science and economics, I think we won that war. I think that’s pretty universal now.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kalla_josh.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="480" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kalla_josh.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132079" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kalla_josh.jpg 400w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kalla_josh-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joshua Kalla</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Kalla was somewhat less certain. “I&#8217;m not sure if I would say the war is totally over. I think there&#8217;s definitely still lots of pushback, especially around both pre-analysis plans and statistical power,” he said. “There’s a perception that our job is to publish and to keep our jobs, and not necessarily to do the best research possible. And sometimes these scientific best practices come at odds with those competing goals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kalla and Broockman are meticulous researchers by nature, but their involvement in the <em>Science </em>retraction amplified that trait. “I think given the prominence of this retraction, I always feared people are going to double check my work,” Kalla said. “So I think that that made me always be careful, to try extra hard to make sure everything is buttoned down, everything is double and triple checked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green acknowledged he didn’t do his due diligence as a coauthor, telling us <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">at the time</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Convinced that the results were robust, I helped Michael LaCour write up the findings, especially the parts that had to do with the statistical interpretation of the experimental design. Given that I did not have IRB approval for the study from my home institution, I took care not to analyze any primary data — the datafiles that I analyzed were the same replication datasets that Michael LaCour posted to his website.&nbsp; Looking back, the failure to verify the original Qualtrics data was a serious mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study and its fallout prompted him to make changes in his collaborations. “My data-related collaborations now involve teams of people (rather than single individuals) working on data collection and data analysis,” Green said last month by email. “Research materials are shared and date-stamped.&nbsp; Replication materials work from basic inputs to final outputs.” And, he added, he no longer supervises doctoral students from other schools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trust but verify</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A year after the LaCour retraction, Broockman and Kalla <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad9713?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D47784030037439004724201340512953342440%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749223486">published a study</a> finding that 10-minute, in-person conversations between door-to-door canvassers and voters in South Florida could “substantially reduce transphobia” and that the gender identity of the canvasser didn’t matter. (The irony of the finding’s similarity to LaCour’s, and its publication in <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/no-wait-short-conversations-really-can-reduce-prejudice/477105/">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/political-sciences-whistleblowers-rebunk-gay-canvassing-study/">lost on</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/real-time-talking-people-about-gay-and-transgender-issues-can-change-their-prejudices">the media</a> either.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve conducted “at least nine or 10 replications in various forms related to different issues,” from work on transphobia to immigration rights, Kalla said. “This style of non judgmentally exchanging narratives through door-to-door canvassing can durably reduce people&#8217;s prejudicial views towards these various out groups.”</p>



<p>Most recently, they <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/7xbza_v1">posted a preprint</a> of a study on how endorsements and special interest groups affect voter behavior in primaries and general elections. By surveying 31,000 respondents during 2024 elections in 27 congressional districts, they found “primary voters actually struggle to identify which candidates match their views. So they rely on other cues—especially from interest groups who might help drive polarization,” Broockman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dbroockman.bsky.social/post/3lq5uelcvqs2v">posted on Bluesky</a>.</p>



<p>Just as they’ve stayed on theme with their research, so too have their opinions on the infrastructure for research. Shortly after the LaCour retraction, Broockman and Kalla <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9009927/lacour-gay-homophobia-study">wrote an editorial</a> in <em>Vox </em>reacting to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/science/retractions-scientific-studies.html">coverage</a> citing “a growing number” of retractions. They cautioned retractions were a sign that the system is strong, not weak. They wrote at the time:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The fact that we are especially likely to see and hear about the errors scientists make does not suggest scientists are especially prone to making mistakes. Rather, it shows that scientific errors are increasingly likely to be detected and corrected instead of being swept under the rug.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Has that view changed? “When scandals like this MIT thing this week come out, those should make people more confident in academic research, because they show there is an ecosystem to catch this stuff,” Broockman said in our recent interview. “I think we should be wary of proposals to over-regulate academic research, to solve for these rare events.”</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;But if we&#8217;re going to not over-regulate the doing of the research, that means we need the fire alarm — and that&#8217;s what you guys [Retraction Watch] are — and we need the researchers doing the research knowing that there&#8217;s a reasonable chance they will get caught.&#8221;</p>



<p>He likened blatant fraud cases like LaCour’s to “the airplane crashes of academic research” — they get a lot of attention, but in terms of what&nbsp; affects more people, “they attract far disproportionate attention,” he said. “If I were making a top five list of ways academia is not producing research that is as truthful as it could be, I don’t think fraud would be in my top five.” Issues like p-hacking, selectively including data, and deviating from research plans are all smaller infractions that are bigger issues, he said.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="410" height="498" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132080" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg 410w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped-247x300.jpg 247w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Green</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Carelessness has a large effect in the literature, too. “For me, the biggest takeaway is, sure, fraud happens,” Kalla said. “I think the bigger concern in research is sloppiness.” He and Broockman are systematic in their collaborations, carefully checking each other’s code and work. “And I think that extends to collaborations with other people as well. The trust-but-verify mentality,” Kalla said, “and definitely not in a skeptical, hostile, fraud based way. It&#8217;s very easy to make mistakes.”</p>



<p><a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green">Green</a> also continues to study U.S. public opinion and political behavior, branching out to study the influence of mass media in low- and middle-income countries. “Several of my field experiments since then have focused on how narrative entertainment shapes beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions,” he said. Those include studies on how a Tanzanian radio drama <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140221139385">influenced attitudes on early and forced marriage</a>, and the influence of a media campaign on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414020912275">violence against women in Uganda</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Coda</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ten years on, Green, Broockman and Kalla say the study and its demise still come up periodically, but far less often than it did in the year or two immediately after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My sense is that this episode is discussed fairly widely when scholars and instructors assess the replication crisis in social science, in part because the case illustrates both why research might fail to replicate (in this instance, due to fraud) as well as the norms and institutions that have emerged to expose replication failures (such as the availability of replication data that in this case exposed how fabricated data were grafted onto an existing dataset),” Green said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He talks about it indirectly in his undergraduate textbook, but “students seem to be less and less familiar with the episode as time passes,” he said. “I suppose that a senior now would have been in elementary school when it happened.”</p>



<p>Every once in a while a student will ask Kalla about the case, he said, and Broockman said it mostly comes up when he’s talking to researchers in other disciplines, but not so much anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Broockman, the story has an added personal note: Eight years ago, it came up on a first date — with the man he’s now engaged to. “He had listened to the ‘<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/584/transcript">This American Life’ episode</a> about all of this,” he said. “So maybe that served me well.”</p>

<p><em>PLOS One</em> has retracted a 2011 paper first flagged for image issues 11 years ago. The retraction marks the fourth for the paper’s lead author, Gabriella Marfè of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli,” in Caserta, Italy. </p>



<p>“<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027313">Involvement of FOXO Transcription Factors, TRAIL-FasL/Fas, and Sirtuin Proteins Family in Canine Coronavirus Type II-Induced Apoptosis</a>,” has been cited 41 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/966107DE4652202AFB4D18055459F8">flagged the article on PubPeer</a> in 2014 for apparent image manipulation and duplication in six figures. In a 2019 email to PLOS staff, pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis drew attention to Bik’s findings. The journal retracted the paper on May 6 of this year.</p>



<span id="more-132053"></span>



<p>In response to questions on why the retraction took so long, David Knutson, PLOS’s head of communications, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our Publication Ethics team became aware of this case in 2019; We initially contacted the authors in 2019 to request their input on the concerns, but due to resourcing issues and competing priorities the case was then inactive until November 2024. <br><br>Based on information we received from an external source, PLOS may have discussed the case with the authors several years prior, but if so that correspondence was purged, lost, or archived prior to 2018 when our Publication Ethics team formed and centralized all ethics case records.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice called out issues with eight figures that include “discontinuities” and “similarities” in multiple images, as well as one figure “that appears similar” to work <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/107/9/3683/133494/Growth-inhibition-and-apoptosis-in-human">reported in <em>Blood</em></a> in 2006 by a different group of authors. “The authors’ responses did not resolve the concerns with this article,” the notice stated, and the authors did not respond to the decision to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marfè was a coauthor on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.16390">a 2010 paper</a> retracted in October for “several instances of duplications of western blot bands” and “splicing and deletion of bands.” That paper, in the journal <em>Cancer Science</em>, had also been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A2445FE509AA3D92C6EC3ED2B1D980#">flagged on Pubpeer</a> in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two additional retractions — a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.24572">2009 <em>International Journal of Cancer</em> paper</a> retracted in 2019, and <a href="https://bmcphysiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6793-10-7">a 2010 article in <em>BMC Physiology</em></a><em> </em>retracted in 2014 — included some of the same authors as the article in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/01/14/out-of-the-running-dodgy-blots-prompt-retraction-of-paper-on-marathoning-and-cell-death/">We wrote about the latter retraction</a> at the time.</p>



<p>Marfè did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
