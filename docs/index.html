              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-airglow-complex-physics">STEVE and other aurora-like glows perplex scientists with their complex physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the pristine dark of his backyard in rural Alberta, Canada, Alan Dyer has taken stunning photos of a rare sky glow called STEVE. To capture this ribbon of mauve, he and other citizen scientists typically let their cameras collect light for seconds at a time. Long exposures smear out STEVE’s finer details in favor of making its color pop. But when a STEVE stretched over his house one August night in 2022, Dyer tried a different approach.</p>



<p>He zoomed in on the sky glow with his camera and took a video of STEVE’s nitty-gritty details at a rate of 24 snapshots per second. Instead of the largely smooth drift of purple seen in past images, Dyer’s footage exposed STEVE as a frenetically flickering torrent of purplish-white fuzz.</p>





<p>“It didn’t look that beautiful,” Dyer says, but on the off chance it might be scientifically useful, he sent the video to Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I said, ‘Oh my God, no one has ever seen this before,’” says Nishimura, who was eager to analyze such a high-resolution view of STEVE. But upon inspection, STEVE’s fine details didn’t jibe with scientists’ tentative understanding of the atmospheric chemistry behind the airglow. “This fine-scale structure gave us a huge headache, actually,” Nishimura says.</p>



<p>That confusion is par for the course when it comes to the science of STEVE — short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. Ever since citizen scientists first showed researchers their images of STEVE a few years ago, they&#8217;ve raised more questions than they answered.</p>



<p>“Every time we find something new [about STEVE], the number of physics questions that it opens up is triple what we expected,” says Bea Gallardo-Lacourt, a space physicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, on December 14, Nishimura’s team presented the <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1353477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new high-res view of STEVE</a>. Other researchers described similarly perplexing observations that <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1430434" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1430434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another non-aurora sky glow can morph into STEVE</a>. But there was a glimmer of clarity too: a computer model shared by still other sky detectives may explain <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1402618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what causes the “picket fence”</a> of green stripes that sometimes appears below STEVE.</p>



<p>“STEVE and the picket fence are arguably the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2023.1087974/full%23B27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest mystery in space physics</a> right now,” says space physicist Claire Gasque of the University of California, Berkeley. And because satellite signals can be affected by the conditions in Earth’s atmosphere where STEVE appears, explaining this airglow could have uses beyond understanding a pretty light show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">STEVE’s mysteries are multiplying</h4>



<p>When aurora chasers in Canada first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-aurora-makes-its-debut-mauve">introduced STEVE to the scientific community</a> in 2016, researchers knew it was no aurora (<em>SN: 3/15/18</em>). Auroras form when charged particles from the magnetic bubble, or magnetosphere, around Earth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve">rain down into the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>). Those particles crash into oxygen and nitrogen near Earth’s poles, painting the sky with brushes of red, green and blue. But STEVE was purple. And it appeared closer to the equator than the northern and southern lights do.</p>



<p>“For us here in southern western Canada,” Dyer says, “the aurora is typically to the north.” STEVE, meanwhile, can come right overhead.</p>



<p>STEVE was later <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-causes-aurora-glow-known-steve">linked to a river of charged particles</a> surging through the atmosphere (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). That plasma stream, moving at several kilometers per second, is thought to energize the air around 200 kilometers off the ground to the point of glowing purple — but what molecules give STEVE its signature color remain unclear, especially in light of Dyer’s new footage.</p>





<p>Dyer’s video captured details of STEVE down to about 90 meters across — fairly small for an airglow that can span thousands of kilometers. The footage showed a clumpy, speckled stream of purple rushing westward at about 9 kilometers per second, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JA032008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sporting variations in brightness as small as a few kilometers across</a>, some of which popped in and out of view within seconds, Nishimura and colleagues reported in the December <em>JGR Space Physics</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This high-res video of STEVE taken in August 2022 reveals smaller structures in the purple glow than researchers could see before in long-exposure photos.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“The leading theory of the STEVE emission is that there’s nitric oxide that is excited by the fast plasma stream,” Nishimura says. That nitric oxide is thought to give off the purple light. But excited nitric oxide can glow for an hour, Nishimura notes. That’s about how long STEVE lasts overall; the granular bursts of brightness that last mere seconds add a wrinkle to that idea.</p>



<p>Firing a sensor-strapped rocket through STEVE could identify the molecules responsible, Nishimura says. “But the challenge is that we need to know when and where STEVE is going to happen, and that’s extremely difficult.”</p>



<p>STEVE can appear just after the peaks of substorms, which are disturbances in the magnetosphere that can stir up spectacular auroras. “STEVE generally appears after the main aurora show has kind of faded,” Dyer says. But not every substorm comes with a STEVE encore, and research presented by Gallardo-Lacourt and her colleagues at AGU suggests <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1399930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not all STEVEs need a substorm to appear</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that might help researchers refine their STEVE predictions, Nishimura says, is better understanding the light show’s relationship to another non-auroral airglow called a stable auroral red (SAR) arc — which citizen science photos now suggest can morph into STEVE.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How STEVE and SAR arcs interact</h4>



<p>In March 2015, citizen scientist Ian Griffin set out to photograph a particularly dazzling auroral display near Dunedin, New Zealand. But just north of the southern lights, he spotted something strange — a wide, red sky glow that morphed into the mauve strand of STEVE. Griffin’s footage offered researchers their <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first glimpse of a STEVE blooming out of a SAR arc</a>. Space physicist Carlos Martinis of Boston University and colleagues reported it in June 2022 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists have studied SAR arcs for decades. Like STEVE, these airglows stretch east-to-west across the sky closer to the equator than the northern and southern lights. But unlike STEVE’s roughly hour-long set, SAR arcs can stain the sky for hours to days at a time — visible with cameras, though usually too dim to see with the naked eye.</p>



<p>SAR arcs form when disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere cause charged particles thousands of kilometers out in space to collide, creating heat that seeps down into the ionosphere — the layer of the atmosphere home to STEVE. That heat energizes electrons to excite oxygen atoms to shed red light that’s normally about one-tenth as bright as auroras. But the SAR arc that Griffin saw was radiant enough to rival red southern lights.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In March 2015, citizen scientist Ian Griffin captured this footage of a red SAR arc mutating into a purple STEVE streak.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was just stunning,” says Megan Gillies, who studies auroras at the University of Calgary in Canada. Griffin’s footage inspired her to search for <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cases of STEVE emerging from SAR arcs</a>. Her team found one spotted by the Transition Region Explorer, or TREx, Spectrograph at Lucky Lake, Saskatchewan in April 2022. The group reported it in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> in March. STEVE’s bright purple streak emerged from a SAR arc’s red glow, hung around for about half an hour, then gave way to more red.</p>





<p>“It’s like watching a fire smoldering, and then you throw more wood on it and then it blazes up … Whoosh, there it goes! And then it kind of dies back down,” says Gillies, whose group described the SAR arc–STEVE connection at the AGU meeting. “There’s something that happens that triggers a STEVE,” she says, but because not all SAR arcs mutate into STEVEs, it’s not clear what causes this transition.</p>



<p>It might have something to do with the plasma torrent that powers STEVE. SAR arcs have similarly been linked to westward plasma flows in the atmosphere — though not as fast as the plasma flows that power STEVEs, Martinis notes. As the SAR arc seen in 2015 evolved into STEVE, satellite data did show a wide stream of plasma in the atmosphere narrow and quicken into the kind of intense filament typical of STEVE. But what triggered this switch remains an open question, Martinis says. Further complicating matters: citizen scientists have also spotted STEVEs and SAR arcs <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL092169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing alongside but seemingly independent of each other</a>.</p>



<p>With researchers left scratching their heads over these observations, “this is where modeling comes in,” Gillies says. Theorists can use computers to test whether the physics they think is happening produces light patterns resembling STEVE, she explains. Computer models are already helping piece together another STEVE-related puzzle: the source of the picket fence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The picket fence may be built right in Earth’s backyard</h4>



<p>At first, researchers thought STEVE’s sometimes sidekick of green stripes was a plain old aurora. After all, the picket fence’s bright green glow is a similar hue as some normal northern lights. But the specific wavelengths of light emanating from the picket fence hint that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-light-sky-glow-atmosphere-different-typical-aurora">might not be an aurora</a>, after all (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>).</p>

<p>Showers of charged particles from way out in the magnetosphere light up normal auroras. “When they collide with the atmosphere, they’re going to create a pretty wide spectrum of colors,” Gasque says. That includes green from oxygen and red and blue from nitrogen. “That blue is kind of the smoking gun that we didn’t see with the picket fence,” Gasque says. Its absence hints that the picket fence’s green spires don’t arise from the same process as auroras.</p>



<p>An alternative explanation for the picket fence might be electric fields embedded within Earth’s atmosphere that run parallel to the planet’s magnetic field, Gasque says. Those fields could energize local electrons to excite oxygen into glowing green and coax nitrogen to give off a bit of red but not blue. Gasque and colleagues ran a computer model of Earth’s atmosphere with electrons energized by electric fields. The team compared the light produced inside their simulated atmosphere with light from a picket fence seen by the TREx Spectrograph at Lucky Lake in April 2018.</p>



<p>The model did indeed reproduce the ratio of red to green light seen in the real-life picket fence without a tinge of blue — bolstering the idea that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL106073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atmospheric electric fields could construct the picket fence</a>, the researchers reported November 16 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> and at the AGU meeting. But scientists need to confirm that such electric fields actually exist at the altitudes where picket fences appear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The plan now is to try and fly a rocket through one of these structures,” says Gallardo-Lacourt. Gasque and her colleagues have just proposed such a mission to NASA. The rocket wouldn’t fly through the picket fence — which, like STEVE, is too hard to predict. Instead, it would target phenomena with similar coloring that are far more common: enhanced auroras.</p>

<p>“With enhanced aurorae, you have kind of these sharp, bright layers within the aurora,” Gasque says. The sharpness of those variations in auroral light and their picket fence–like color scheme hints that they might be powered by electric fields as well. If a future rocket mission detects electric fields threaded through enhanced auroras, that would help confirm that similar fields build the picket fence.</p>



<p>NASA’s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/resources/stdts/geospace-dynamics-constellation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geospace Dynamics Constellation</a> mission will also launch a fleet of spacecraft as early as 2027 to probe Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere — which might yield more data that help explain aspects of STEVE, Gallardo-Lacourt notes. In the meantime, STEVE’s dedicated paparazzi of citizen scientists will continue snapping photos of the phenomenon from the ground.</p>



<p>“We’re out specifically looking for STEVE and knowing that there’s scientific interest in it,” Dyer says. “Prior to the era of STEVE … you might have thought, well, there’s nothing amateurs can contribute now to aurora research, it’s all done with rockets and satellites and the like. But nope! There’s a lot we can contribute” — even if those contributions are often new puzzles for scientists to solve.</p>

<p>Prior research has shown that smartphone use among adolescents has increased in recent years, and that this usage may be associated with higher risk of adverse health&mdash;such as psychiatric disorders, sleep issues, eye-related problems, and musculoskeletal disorders. However, growing evidence suggests that at least some daily internet usage may be associated with better physical and mental health for adolescents.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>To deepen understanding of the relationship between adolescents&rsquo; use of smartphones and health, Jin-Hwa Moon and Jong Ho Cha of Hanyang University Medical Center, Korea, and colleagues analyzed data on more than 50,000 adolescent participants in the ongoing Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey collected in 2017 and in 2020. The data included the approximate number of daily hours each participant spent on a smartphone as well as various health measures. The statistical analysis employed propensity score matching to help account for other factors that could be linked to health outcomes, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status.</p>



<p><strong>Findings and Insights</strong></p>



<p>The researchers found that in 2020, the percentage of adolescents in the study who used a smartphone more than 2 hours per day was 85.7 percent&mdash;up from 64.3 percent in 2017. Adolescents who used a smartphone for more than 4 hours per day had higher rates of stress, thoughts of suicide, and substance use than those with usage below 4 hours per day. However, adolescents that used a smartphone 1-2 hours per day encountered fewer problems than adolescents who did not use a smartphone at all.</p>



<p>The authors note that this study does not confirm a causal relationship between smartphone use and adverse health outcomes. Nonetheless, the findings could help inform usage guidelines for adolescents&mdash;especially if daily usage continues to rise.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;This research shows the impact of using smart devices for more than 4 hours a day on adolescent health.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-creature-research-discovery-2023">These are our favorite animal stories of 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>From birds repurposing antiavian architecture to jellyfish that can learn, here are dispatches from the animal kingdom that we went wild for in 2023.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Intelligent jellies</h4>



<p>No brain? No problem. The fingernail-sized Caribbean box jellyfish (<em>Tripedalia cystophora</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brainless-jellyfish-eyes-nerves-learn">uses its clusters of eyes and nerve cells to learn</a> to avoid bumping into things, experiments in an aquatic obstacle course suggest (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). In the box jelly’s natural habitat, where the creature must swerve to dodge mangrove roots in murky water, it pays to be a good pupil.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prehistoric pout</h4>



<p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>’s menacing grin may have been less toothy than previously thought. Artistic renderings commonly depict the ravenous reptile as lipless, constantly baring its pearly whites. But <em>T</em>. <em>rex</em> may actually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trex-lips-modern-lizards-dinosaur">have had a pout</a> that kept rows of pointy teeth covered, similar to Komodo dragons, an analysis of the skulls and teeth of dinosaurs and modern reptile suggests (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 6</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="382" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-1_trex.jpg?resize=680%2C382&#038;ssl=1" alt="illustration of a Tyrannosaurus rex eating another dinosaur" class="wp-image-3134235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-1_trex.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-1_trex.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134235"><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> may have had lips that hid its pointy teeth, as depicted here.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revenge of the birds</h4>



<p>City life can be hostile for birds. Municipalities across the world have put up spikes to prevent birds from roosting — and pooping — on streetlights, buildings and other structures. But some Eurasian magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and carrion crows (<em>Corvus corone</em>) in parts of Europe found a way to stick it to humans. The birds rip up antibird spikes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-use-antibird-spikes-build-nests">build nests with them</a> (<em>SN: 9/9/23, p. 4</em>). Magpies may even use the spikes as humans do, to ward off avian pests.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Swashbuckling spiders</h4>



<p>Pirates on the high seas would be proud of their landlubbing arachnid counterparts. A species of cannibalistic pirate spider in Costa Rica tricks prey into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannibal-pirate-spiders-web-arachnid">walking the plank, right into its clutches</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 11</em>). <em>Gelanor siquirres</em> casts a silk thread to intercept that of an unsuspecting orb weaver trying to build a web. When the eight-legged victim scuttles across its own silk thread to secure the other end, the orb weaver finds impending doom rather than harmless vegetation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="A Gelanor siquirres spider" class="wp-image-3134237" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134237">The spider&nbsp;<em>Gelanor siquirres</em> has a seemingly unique way of hunting other arachnids, tricking them into walking right into a trap.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134237">G.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Desperate flies, desperate measures</h4>



<p>Snow flies (<em>Chinoea </em>spp.) have a macabre method to survive the frigid mountains and forests they call home. Dozens of flies that researchers subjected to below-zero temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trick-snow-flies-survive-self-amputation">self-amputated their limbs</a>, but only when the limbs began to freeze (<em>SN: 7/15/23, p. 14</em>). The flies probably shed the appendages to keep ice crystals from reaching the rest of the body.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Self-aware fish</h4>



<p>When it comes to brainpower, this fish is no small fry. Not only can the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (<em>Labroides dimidiatus</em>) recognize itself in a mirror, the fish can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware">identify a picture of itself out of a lineup</a> (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 13</em>). The finding suggests the wrasse forms a mental image of itself — similar to what humans do — and that self-awareness may be more common in the animal kingdom than once thought.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="a Bluestreak cleaner wrasse" class="wp-image-3134238" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134238">Bluestreak cleaner wrasse can recognize photos of themselves, a possible sign that the fish have self-awareness.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134238">marrio31/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tight-gilled sharks</h4>



<p>Regulating body temperature in chilly water is a challenge even for scalloped hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>). To stay warm while hunting in the deep ocean, the sharks use a method normally seen in diving mammals: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-gills-thermoregulate">They hold their breath</a> (<em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 10</em>). Keeping gills closed holds in body heat, preventing the predators from becoming fish ice pops.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big-mouthed snake</h4>



<p>This African egg-eating snake redefines what it means to open wide. The Gans’ egg-eater (<em>Dasypeltis gansi</em>) can open its mouth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakes-big-gulp-gans-egg-eater">wider than any other snake</a> relative to its size, lab experiments suggest (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 36</em>). An egg-eater with a 1-centimeter-wide head could fit a cylinder 5 centimeters across in its mouth. The reptile edges out the previous record holder: the Burmese python (<em>Python molurus bivittatus</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster dogs</h4>



<p>The irradiated zone around Ukraine’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant might be off-limits for humans, but other animals didn’t get the memo. Packs of feral dogs that for years have roamed the area abandoned since 1986 are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-chernobyl-dogs-revealed">genetically distinct</a> from canines of similar breeds that live outside the zone (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 15</em>). The differences probably aren’t due to radiation, researchers say. Whether Chernobyl’s radioactivity has had any effect on the dogs remains to be seen, but knowing their genetic makeup will help scientists spot potential radiation damage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Landscaping ants</h4>



<p>Many ants are expert navigators who use local landmarks to find their way around. But what’s an ant to do when the world around them is almost completely flat and featureless? Desert ants (<em>Cataglyphis&nbsp;fortis</em>) in Tunisia’s salt pans take matters into their own mandibles. Workers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-build-tall-nest-hills-landmarks">build tall mounds over their colonies’ nests</a> so wayward foragers can find their way home (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 16</em>).</p>

                <p>To the moon, asteroids and beyond, robotic explorers racked up the mileage in 2023. Here’s the latest status of space missions that made headlines this year.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer</h4>



<p><strong>April 14:</strong> The European Space Agency launched the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juice mission</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> There’s not much progress to report yet; it will take about eight years for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, to reach its destination. But once there, the spacecraft will fly by the Jovian moons Callisto, Europe and Ganymede numerous times before settling into orbit around Ganymede. Closely scrutinizing these moons will help verify whether they host liquid oceans beneath their icy outer shells and gauge whether these underground seas could host life.&nbsp;</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Euclid space telescope</h4>



<p><strong>July 1:</strong> The ESA launched the Euclid space telescope.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euclid’s aim is to create a 3-D map of the universe</a> to help astronomers better understand dark matter, the mysterious substance that accounts for most matter in the universe, and dark energy, the unknown force that’s accelerating the universe’s expansion. In November, the telescope showed off what it’s capable of when it sent back its first full-color images, dazzling beauty shots of far-off galaxies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chandrayaan-3 </h4>



<p><strong>August 23:</strong> India became only the fourth country to successfully land on the moon when the Chandrayaan-3 mission’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-chandrayaan-moon-landing">Vikram lander touched down near the lunar south pole</a>, the first spacecraft to do so (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> High on the mission’s to-do list was testing the capabilities of the lander and its rover, named Pragyan, to prep for future lunar missions. The duo also collected measurements, such as the temperature and chemical makeup of the surface. The data could prove useful to space agencies like NASA that intend to send astronauts to the south pole, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">a tantalizing region that appears to harbor water ice</a> in shadowed craters (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 14</em>). The mission ended in early September when Vikram and Pragyan entered sleep mode.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">OSIRIS-REx</h4>



<p><strong>September 24:</strong> After collecting rock from the asteroid Bennu in October 2020, NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew by Earth</a> to drop off its precious cargo (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> About 250 grams of Bennu safely parachuted to Earth in a protective capsule. So far, scientists have analyzed some bonus material that stuck to the outside of OSIRIS-REx’s sample canister before the outer capsule closed. These bits of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">Bennu mostly consist of water-bearing clay minerals</a> — perhaps the same kind of minerals that made Earth a watery world (<em>SN: 11/4/23, p. 6</em>). As of early December, investigations of the bulk of the sample hadn’t begun; NASA workers have been unable to remove two of the fasteners that sealed the canister shut. Meanwhile, the mission continues under a new name, OSIRIS-APEX, as the spacecraft travels to the asteroid Apophis with an arrival date of 2029.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Psyche</h4>



<p><strong>October 13:</strong> NASA’s Psyche mission took off.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> The spacecraft has a long way to go before arriving at asteroid 16 Psyche in 2029. It’s worth the wait, though, because the mostly metal space rock may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-nasa-mars-asteroids-spacecraft">be the exposed core of an early planet</a> that lost its outer layers (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 34</em>). Studying 16 Psyche could be the closest scientists get to directly examining a planet’s normally inaccessible heart.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lucy</h4>



<p><strong>November 1:</strong> After two years in space, NASA’s Lucy spacecraft flew by its first asteroid.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Lucy’s goal was to have close encounters with 10 asteroids over a roughly 10-year period. But it turns out that its first target, called Dinkinesh, is actually two asteroids — a large one with a smaller one in orbit around it. Dinkinesh and its tagalong reside in the main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter. But most of Lucy’s targets are Trojan asteroids, which share a path around the sun with Jupiter. Studying those space rocks could offer new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">clues to the origins of the giant planets in our solar system</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/21</em>).</p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may know that the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, which has oversight of misconduct investigations of work funded by the National Institutes of Health, has proposed changes to its regulations. It’s the first such proposal since 2005, and has </em><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/should-government-disclose-university-misconduct-findings-academics-are-split"><em>generated discussion</em></a><em> in </em><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/08/research-misconduct/"><em>various quarters</em></a><em>. We’re pleased to present this guest post by James Kennedy, a longtime observer of these issues.</em></p>



<p>One of the most controversial points about the federal policies for research misconduct is the extent to which a laboratory director, principal investigator, or lead author is held responsible for misconduct by others on their research team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is surprisingly common in cases of extensive research fraud that the person who committed the offense cannot be identified. Data management in such cases is usually uncontrolled, with no tracking of changes to the data or preservation of the original data. The principal investigator is often at the center of the pattern of misconduct, but should they also be held accountable for it when the only provable fact is that they allowed a work environment that was vulnerable to bad behavior?</p>



<p>The regulations for handling misconduct in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service are currently being modified, and the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), which implements the rules, is asking for public comment. This opportunity to influence the handling of misconduct is all the more important given that the regulations are often used as a model for misconduct policies at universities and research institutions. The comment period was recently extended until <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/ori-extends-nprm-comment-deadline">Jan. 4, 2024</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Are you responsible for misconduct by others?</strong></p>



<span id="more-128440"></span>



<p>As a scientist who <a href="http://jeksite.org/psi/jp17.pdf">once helped expose fraud</a> and has experience developing regulations, I have already submitted <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0051">detailed comments</a> on the proposed regulatory changes. My perspective is that the current legal precedent regarding the responsibility of PIs in misconduct cases is problematic. This precedent, which was established in 2018 <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2018/alj-cr5109/index.html">in a case involving the ORI</a>, holds that principal investigators and lead authors on papers will be held accountable for any fraudulent results they report. Their accountability extends to data provided by collaborators that were not under the management of the principal investigator or lead author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge apparently expects researchers to delve deeply into the possibility of fraud at all collaborating laboratories, without realizing that such an effort can take months and would make scientific collaboration impractical.</p>



<p>This assignment of responsibility for principal investigators and lead authors is established precedent for ORI but is not addressed in the proposed regulations. I believe it should be, and the new rules should be more realistic than the current precedent. In my view, laboratory directors and principal investigators are responsible for ensuring persons they directly manage follow good research practices, but not for collaborators who are not under their direct management. My comments to the regulator include a more complete description of my proposal (see point 2).</p>



<p>Another controversial topic is whether the final report of a university investigation of research misconduct should be made public for open discussion and evaluation like any other evidence and claims in science. The fact that allegations of misconduct have been made does not turn off the principles of open, transparent science. The justification and rationale for this point are described in point 4 of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0051">my comments</a>.</p>



<p>Those who support, oppose, or would qualify the ideas discussed here should also consider submitting comments to ORI.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Making regulatory comments effective</strong></p>



<p>Submitting comments about proposed regulations will be more effective if the following practices are followed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Multiple comments making the same point bring more attention to the point. The number of positive and negative comments will be considered. It is useful to be redundant even though a similar point has been made by others.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Provide information about your credentials and experience. It is fine for a person with no direct experience in research to express an opinion. That lets an agency such as ORI know the public perception. Opinions by those who have direct experience in research are also needed. The agency needs to be able to distinguish between these two cases.</li>



<li>Providing evidence to support your view is valuable. A personal experience that pertains to the need for or effect of a regulation can significantly influence a regulatory decision. References to relevant research findings are also useful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The comments can be short and focused, or more extensive. My comments are more extensive because I have experience developing regulations and want to address the full thought process of the agency. This includes describing a problem, proposing a solution, and providing a legal rationale. Most comments focus on describing a problem, and may or may not suggest a possible solution. Presenting a legal rationale is not needed for most comments.</li>
</ul>



<p>When regulations are proposed or adopted, they are posted in the Federal Register. In general, the preamble to the regulations in the Federal Register must be read to obtain a good understanding of the intended meaning and rationale for the regulations.</p>



<p>Read the proposed rules for misconduct <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-10-06/pdf/2023-21746.pdf">here</a>, see instructions for submitting comments <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/submitting-comment-regulationsgov">here</a>, and read comments posted so far <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0001/comment">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-water-navigate-light-find-land">Here’s how spiders that go overboard use light to find land</a></h4>

              
                <p>Biologist Brian Gall was flinging stowaway spiders out of his kayak when he noticed an interesting pattern: After landing on the water’s surface, the arachnids quickly darted to the nearest shoreline, no matter how far he paddled from dry land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The passengers, elongate stilt spiders (<em>Tetragnatha elongata)</em>, spin their webs on the edges of ponds to catch prey. When the spiders tumble into the water, which happens often, they rely on surface tension to evade predators and skitter to shore. But just how the stilt spiders navigate the water’s surface has been unclear — until now. The arachnids appear to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944200623000648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use light reflected off the water to pinpoint the less-reflective shoreline</a>, Gall and his team at Hanover College in Indiana report in the December <em>Zoology</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists have studied the navigation skills of only a handful of the approximately 51,000 known species of arachnids. Spiders have been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ogre-faced-spider-hearing-catch-insects-prey-air-sound-sight">rely on sound</a>, vibrations, chemical signals and, of course, their eight eyes (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>). Some species can see and use polarized light, which can occur naturally when light waves flatten as they reflect off a surface such as water.</p>



<p>“Spider vision is completely different than ours,” says Sidney Goedeker, who worked with Gall as an undergraduate and is currently a research technologist at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. “And it’s not something that we can perceive because we don’t have what they have.”</p>



<p>Perhaps, Gall thought, the stowaways could offer a way to study the elongate stilt spider’s homing senses. His team built test arenas in an outdoor tank and a natural pond in Gall’s backyard, using a film suspended over the water to polarize incoming sunlight before it hit the surface, creating areas without glare that mimicked what land might look like to a spider. Then, the researchers dropped 68 spiders into the arenas and recorded their movements.</p>



<p>Spiders in the tank overwhelmingly raced to covered areas. In the pond, spiders dropped between the shore and the covered areas chose both options with equal frequency, making circular passes until they found land. In both arenas, spiders that chose covered areas would often circle in and out of the film’s shadow, searching for the promised shoreline.</p>



<p>In previous pond experiments without the film, elongate stilt spiders unerringly zipped toward land, Gall says.&nbsp;Taken together with the new findings, the species probably perceives polarized light and uses it as a “not-land” landmark, the team says.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to overstate how crazy these results are,” Gall says. “I have dropped probably one thousand spiders onto the water’s surface, and I’ve almost never seen them make the wrong choice.”</p>



<p>There is still much to learn about the navigation skills of other similar spiders, says Eileen Hebets, an arachnologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, who was not involved in the study. “An orb-weaving spider with evidence of using visual cues opens up lots of new questions about other groups,” she says. “We tend not to think of vision as being very important for web-building spiders.”</p>



<p>Gall is delighted that a day spent lobbing spiders from his kayak led to this discovery. “It just highlights how watching and asking really basic questions can lead to really cool stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/speed-bumps-thwaites-glacier">Speed bumps under Thwaites Glacier could help slow its flow to the sea</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> — Most of the news regarding the Thwaites Glacier, a Florida-sized slab of ice that is melting and currently contributing about 4 percent of global sea level rise, is bad. But a bit of good news may have emerged.</p>



<p>A seismic survey of the bed beneath an upstream section of Thwaites has revealed <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1336054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rough high-rises of earth under the Antarctic glacier</a>, which are comparable in height to the Manhattan skyline, glaciologist Coen Hofstede reported December 12 at a news conference during the American Geophysical Union fall meeting. These rugged rises may be snagging the glacier’s underbelly, slowing its flow toward the ocean and mitigating global sea level rise.</p>





<p>Glaciers flow somewhat like rivers, but much slower. Where Thwaites outlets into the ocean, it connects to a floating shelf of ice that braces and partially restrains the glacier. That ice shelf was once pinned upon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">an underwater mountain</a>, which helped stabilize it (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). But now the shelf is so deteriorated that it’s basically unhitched, Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, said at the news event.</p>



<p>Fortunately, though, the glacier “is not going to suddenly flow off land,” thanks partly to what’s been discovered upstream, said Pettit, who was not involved in the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 70 kilometers inland from Thwaites’ ice shelf, Hofstede and his colleagues conducted a seismic survey to probe the glacier’s underbelly. The team attached a 1.5-kilometer-long daisy-chain of seismometers to a vehicle equipped with a vibrating plate. Then they drove a roughly 200-kilometer-long stretch of the glacier, using the plate to generate seismic waves and the seismometers to record the waves’ reflectance off layers of ice and earth below. “It’s almost like radar,” said Hofstede, of the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.</p>

<p>The seismic waves revealed rises under Thwaites that are 10 to 20 kilometers long and toothed with blocks of sediment. These blocks stood up to 100 meters tall above the rises and stretched for up to several kilometers horizontally.</p>



<p>The data showed that the upstream faces of these blocks appear to be under greater pressure than their downstream sides, and that there might be layers of deformed ice within the glacier above the rises. Hofstede hypothesizes that the rises and blocks are slowing Thwaites’ flow as its ice presses against them.</p>



<p>Using computers to simulate the flow of Thwaites glacier shows that “it gets hung up on tall features,” said glaciologist Ben Smith of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>The rises are probably related to a rift system, an area where tectonic forces have pulled the ground apart, Hofstede said. Under Thwaites, these rifts run roughly perpendicular to the glacier’s ice flow, sort of like speed bumps on a street.</p>



<p>The findings will allow for more nuanced simulations of the glacier’s evolution, Hofstede said, which are crucial for understanding rates of sea level rise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-history-stories-2023">History buffs will dig these 5 science stories from 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science occasionally gives us clearer views of the distant past. This year, researchers opened windows into the life and times of ancient Romans, impressionist painters and other towering historical figures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Huygens’ hazy telescopes </h4>



<p>Christiaan Huygens, the 17th-century Dutch astronomer best known for his studies of Saturn’s moons and rings, may have needed glasses. That would explain why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-christiaan-huygens-flawed-telescopes-solved">the telescopes he designed</a> weren’t as sharp as those of his peers, a researcher argues (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 5</em>). A closer look at Huygens’ telescope lenses suggests the scientist was nearsighted. The lenses probably overmagnified his view of the cosmos, making distant objects appear clear to him but fuzzy to others.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Vintage essence</h4>



<p>What did the ancient Romans smell like? Chemical analyses of a 2,000-year-old perfume bottle from an elite woman’s grave suggest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-roman-perfume-smell-patchouli">a familiar earthy scent: patchouli</a> (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 14</em>). Patchouli oil permeates modern fragrances, but its use in ancient Rome had been unknown. Perfume extracts that are this old typically dissipate and become lost to history. But the quartz flask was found intact with a bitumen seal that adsorbed some of the perfume molecules, preserving them for millennia.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Forgery fighter</h4>



<p>Infrared and X-ray scans of more than 600 paper bills made by Benjamin Franklin’s prolific printing press revealed<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/benjamin-franklin-money-counterfeiter"> colorful threads and shiny mineral residues</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 5</em>). The additives, used to stymie counterfeiters and boost the bills’ durability, helped set the standard for paper currency in colonial America, researchers say.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Decoding Beethoven’s coda</h4>



<p>Ludwig van <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beethoven-hair-dna-composer-death">Beethoven’s DNA</a> supports what many historians have suspected: The composer likely died of liver failure (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 16</em>). Until now, the theory largely rested on reports that Beethoven had been drinking a lot of alcohol shortly before his death in 1827. While reconstructing Beethoven’s genome from samples of his hair, researchers discovered he also had a genetic risk for liver disease. The composer also suffered from a hepatitis B infection, the team determined, further compounding his susceptibility to liver damage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Shrouded in smoke</h4>



<p>The Industrial Revolution may have shaped impressionist art — literally. An analysis of more than 100 paintings by artists such as Claude Monet and Joseph Mallord William Turner found that changes in contrast, color and visibility track over time with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-impressionist-monet-painters">rising air pollution</a> in London and Paris (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 4</em>). Particles in smog absorb and scatter light, reducing contrast and making colors whiter. As air pollution worsened throughout the 19th century, impressionist paintings grew paler and hazier just as artists’ views of their subjects did.</p>

<p>Over the past year, amid announcements of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">thousands of retractions</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">journal closures</a> and a major index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisting several titles</a>, executives at the troubled publisher Hindawi have at various times mentioned a “<a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/04/guest-post-addressing-paper-mills-and-a-way-forward-for-journal-security/">new retraction process</a>” for investigating and pulling papers “at scale.”&nbsp; The publisher has declined to provide details – until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far in 2023, Hindawi has retracted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">over 8,000 articles</a> – more than we’ve ever seen in a single year from all publishers combined. And Hindawi is not done cleaning up from paper mills’ infiltration of its special issues, according to a new report from its parent company, Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reckoning with Hindawi’s paper mill problem has cost Wiley, which bought the open-access publisher in 2021, an estimated $35-40 million in lost revenue in the current fiscal year, Matthew Kissner, Wiley’s interim president and CEO, said on the company’s most recent earnings call. Wiley will <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">stop using the “Hindawi” name</a> next year, Kissner told investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher has  issued a whitepaper, “<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/hindawi-publication-manipulation-whitepaper">Tackling publication manipulation at scale: Hindawi’s journey and lessons for academic publishing</a>,” which explains “what happened at Hindawi” and the process the company developed to investigate and retract thousands of articles from special issues.  </p>



<span id="more-128430"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to the whitepaper, Hindawi’s research integrity staff identified “suspicious patterns” in multiple special issues around the same time as “independent researchers with an interest in research integrity, also began noticing indicators of large-scale systematic manipulation.” </p>



<p>In September 2022, the publisher announced an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">initial batch of 500 retractions</a>. Then, the whitepaper states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These initial investigations coupled with the findings of independent researchers pointed to the infiltration of Hindawi [special issues] SIs at an even greater scale than first anticipated, making it clear that thousands of manuscripts would need to be investigated.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">halted publication of special issues</a> for a few months beginning in October 2022, and reassessed all special issue manuscripts with “a comprehensive checklist of specific hallmarks of papermill papers.” Hindawi also “carried out a thorough review and strengthening of our existing checks on editors, authors and reviewers,” according to the whitepaper. To investigate thousands of already-published papers, it developed “a new protocol aimed at detecting manipulation patterns and retracting papers rapidly and at scale.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hindawi essentially created a checklist of criteria for scoring articles, and all that met a certain threshold were retracted. The whitepaper lists several “indicators of manipulation” Hindawi has been using as evidence to retract articles:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Discrepancies in scope.</li>



<li>Discrepancies in the description of the research reported.</li>



<li>Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described.</li>



<li>Inappropriate citations.</li>



<li>Incoherent, meaningless, and/or irrelevant content included in the article.</li>



<li>Compromised or manipulated peer-review.</li>
</ol>



<p>The publisher explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The decision to retract, given this evidence, is based on the rationale that the publication process has been undermined and we can no longer vouch for the integrity of the article. We have intentionally limited the specific details of what is under investigation in the retraction notice, in part because it is essential that the intelligence shared with bad actors is restricted. Moreover, to proceed expeditiously and communicate with thousands of authors, standardized wording of retraction notices was essential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hindawi outsourced the work of assessing individual papers to outside vendors. At least two people, trained by the publisher’s staff, evaluated each paper according to Hindawi’s criteria and filled out a questionnaire in a “bespoke software application.” In addition:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>computational tools were used to provide additional supporting evidence about fabricated content, plagiarized peer-review reports, and suspect peer review turn-around times. We also built on the valuable work done by independent research integrity sleuths, by collecting, evaluating, and categorizing comments provided on PubPeer as part of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL5rMrZoUcp3rn1mP7B_X9QE08VPGXehhK-dlkFN_Iw/edit#gid=0">Smut Clyde’s list</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides retracting thousands of papers, Hindawi has used the results of its investigation to ban “several hundred” guest editors of special issues from future editorial roles and publishing articles. The publisher has also instituted “much more stringent checks” on proposals for special issues and guest editors, as well as “much greater scrutiny of peer review.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as continuing retractions, Hindawi plans to issue expressions of concern for entire special issues “to alert readers that they should take additional care interpreting all papers” when the publisher suspects more articles in a particular issue “are likely to be problematic” but has not yet investigated or found proof of issues. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Multiple sleuths Retraction Watch asked to comment on the whitepaper complimented Hindawi for taking action and sharing information, but also questioned whether the publisher had really learned its lesson, and pointed out further work to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it’s a good thing they’re documenting what they’re doing and putting out information about it,” Adam Day, developer of the <a href="https://clear-skies.co.uk/">Papermill Alarm</a>, said. “I hope it’s something other publishers take a lead from and feel encouraged to deal with their own problems openly as well, because this is affecting a huge number of publishers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Day noted that he had still seen papermill articles in Hindawi journals as of this spring, after the publisher resumed special issues. “I think they’ve definitely made a big impact on the problem, but I don’t know that they’ve completely solved it yet,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/19/turned-cancer-researcher-literature-watchdog/">Jennifer Byrne</a>, leader of the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/publication-and-research-integrity-in-medical-research-primer.html">Publication and Research Integrity in Medical Research</a> group at the University of Sydney in Australia, said that Hindawi’s practice of intentionally limiting the information in retraction notices should be balanced with the need for transparency. “It would be helpful for future retraction research scholars if at least some specific information about the reasons for retraction were disclosed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne also said verifying the identities of guest editors for special issues is not enough to ensure quality, as “many guest editors could have superficially convincing credentials, ‘supported’ by publications from paper mills.” The difficulty will grow “as publications from paper mills become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect,” she predicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, the topics submitted with proposals for special issues “deserve more stringent scrutiny,” she said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Catch-all, duplicative special issue topics invite paper mill submissions, particularly in fields where genuine research remains very difficult, expensive and/or slow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">Cyril Labbé</a>, who with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/09/how-thousands-of-invisible-citations-sneak-into-papers-and-make-for-fake-metrics/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/16/whats-in-a-name-made-up-authors-are-penning-dozens-of-papers/">Alexander Magazinov</a> developed the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, praised the whitepaper’s acknowledgement of sleuths who “are working daily, most often pro-bono, to fix the work that has not been done properly by publisher.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac added to the whitepaper’s list of recommendations for other publishers: “fund sleuths and credit them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/scientific-publishing/retraction-she-wrote-dorothy-bishops-life-after-research/">Dorothy Bishop</a>, who has examined paper mill activity in Hindawi special issues <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6mbgv">in depth</a>, said she was “very pleased to see the publisher has at last grappled with the need for retractions ‘at scale.’” Banning editors and authors associated with paper mills is “a great step in the right direction, especially if they can share information about banned individuals with other publishers,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Bishop critiqued the framing of the document:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The report presents Hindawi as a victim of an &#8220;academic culture of ‘publish or perish’, which has incentivized unethical behaviour&#8221;. What it omits is the influence of the commercial publisher culture of greed, which aims for massive growth in the number of published papers, with associated growth in profits.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By her calculations, Hindawi would have brought in millions of dollars from article processing charges for now-retracted papers: “The authors of these articles don&#8217;t get their money back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-tails-mucus-marine-snow">Invisible comet tails of mucus slow sinking flakes of ‘marine snow’</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Tiny, sinking flakes of detritus in the ocean fall more slowly thanks to the goop that surrounds each flake, new observations reveal.</p>



<p>The invisible mucus makes “comet tails” that surround each flake, physicist Rahul Chajwa of Stanford University reported November 19 at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting. Those mucus tails slow the speed at which the flakes fall. That could affect the rate at which carbon gets sequestered deep in the oceans, making the physics of this sticky goo important for understanding Earth’s climate.</p>





<p>Although scientists knew the goo was a component of the “marine snow” that falls in the ocean, they hadn’t previously measured its impact on sinking speed.</p>



<p>Marine snow is made of dead and living phytoplankton, decaying organic matter, feces, bacteria and other aquatic sundries, all wrapped up in mucus that&#8217;s produced by the organisms. Like the gunk known for clogging airways during respiratory virus season, the mucus is what’s called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-feather-sperm-flock-together">viscoelastic fluid</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/16</em>). That’s something that flows like a liquid but exhibits elastic behavior as well, springing back after being stretched.</p>



<p>This underwater blizzard is not easy to study. When observed in the ocean, the particles sink swiftly out of view. In the laboratory, the particles can be viewed for longer periods, but the trek ashore degrades the delicate marine snow and kills the living organisms within it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Marine snow TK | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pz52ysYeX58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tiny particles (white dots) within a seawater-filled chamber were used to measure the rate at which fluid flows around this flake of marine snow as it falls. The chamber is designed to keep the sinking snowflake in view of the camera.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So Chajwa and colleagues built a physics lab at sea. Aboard a research vessel in the Gulf of Maine, the team collected marine snow particles in traps 80 meters below the water’s surface. Then they loaded their catch into a device onboard, designed to observe the particles falling.</p>



<p>Nicknamed “the gravity machine,” it’s a fluid-filled wheel that rotates in order to keep an individual flake in view of a camera. It’s a bit like a hamster wheel for falling debris. As the flake sinks, the wheel turns so as to move the snow in the opposite direction, allowing the snowfall to be observed indefinitely. The gravity machine was itself mounted on a gimbal designed to stave off sloshing from the rocking of the ship.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a very nice compromise between the real marine snow that you get in the ocean versus what you can do practically in the lab,” says biophysicist Anupam Sengupta of the University of Luxembourg, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>To observe how the fluid flowed around the particles, the researchers added tiny beads within the fluid in the gravity machine. That revealed the rate of fluid flow around the particles. The speed of fluid flow was slowed in a comet tail–shaped region around the particle, revealing the invisible mucus that sinks along with the particle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134330" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121123_ec_marine-snow_inline1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="525" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134338" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121123_ec_marine-snow_inline2-1.jpg?resize=680%2C525&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="525" class="image-compare__image-after" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><figcaption>Marine snow particles (one shown) are surrounded with invisible mucus.

Slower speeds (yellow) reveal mucus that trails the flake in a comet tail–shape (red dotted line). <span class="credit">Left: Rahul Chajwa and Manu Prakash/PrakashLab/Stanford University</span><span class="credit">Right: Rahul Chajwa and Manu Prakash/PrakashLab/Stanford University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The particles sank at speeds up to 200 meters per day. The mucus played a big role in sinking speed. “The more the mucus, the slower the particles sink,” Chajwa says. On average, the mucus causes the marine snow particles to linger twice as long in the upper 100 meters of the ocean as they otherwise would, Chajwa and colleagues determined.</p>



<p>If it falls deep enough, marine snow can sequester carbon away from the atmosphere. That’s because living phytoplankton, like plants, take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. When phytoplankton form marine snow, they take that carbon along with them as they sink. If a flake reaches the ocean floor, it can settle into a scum at the bottom that caches that carbon over long time periods. The faster the particles sink, the more likely they are to make it to the abyss before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-squid-fossil-ancestor-cephalopod-fierce-hunter">being eaten by critters</a> (<em>SN: 6/23/22</em>).</p>





<p>Knowing how fast the particles sink is important for calculating the ocean’s impact on Earth’s climate, and how that might change as the climate warms, the researchers say. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-human-carbon-dioxide-emissions-sink-climate">The oceans are major players</a> in the planet’s carbon cycle (<em>SN: 12/2/21</em>), and scientists estimate that oceans have taken up roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide released by humans since industrialization. Chajwa and colleagues hope that their results can be used to refine climate models, which currently do not take the mucus into account.</p>



<p>So this mucus is nothing to sneeze at. “We’re talking about microscopic physics,” says Stanford physicist Manu Prakash, a coauthor of the work, which is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also reported in a paper</a> submitted October 3 at arXiv.org. “But multiply that by the volume of the ocean &#8230; that’s what gives you the scale of the problem.”</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University who <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resigned</a> earlier this year after an <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">institutional research misconduct investigation</a>, has retracted a paper from <em>Nature</em>. The journal’s editorial office marked another of Tessier-Lavigne’s articles with an expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two <em>Nature</em> papers – which have together been cited more than 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – were among five the university investigation examined on which Tessier-Lavigne was the principal author. The other three have been retracted – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">two from <em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/former-stanford-president-retracts-1999-cell-paper/">one from <em>Cell</em></a>. In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/issues-five-papers-and-planned-actions">statement</a> posted to his lab website July 19, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to correct the two papers in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07767">APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases</a>,” appeared in 2009. It has been cited 816 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06943-3">retraction notice</a> stated: </p>



<span id="more-128437"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have retracted this article. Our subsequent work confirmed aspects of the article, notably that DR6 and APP interact and function in a genetic pathway involving caspases to control axon pruning and neuron death. However, our later research also showed that certain conclusions reached in the article were incorrect, notably the role of caspase-3, the necessity for beta-secretase enzyme activity for APP-DR6 binding, and the model for the APP-DR6 interaction.</p>



<p>More recently, the following anomalies were identified:</p>



<p>Figure 1d: the NGF-deprived +IgG panel appears to be identical to the NGF-deprived, 24h + Control IgG panel of Figure 5e.</p>



<p>Supplementary information Figure 9c: the NGF-deprived + Bax inhibitor control panel appears to be identical to the + anti-NGF control panel of Supplementary information Figure 17c.</p>



<p>Supplementary information Figure 6d: the fourth beta-Actin blot for Casp-3 siRNA appears to be identical to the first beta-Actin blot for Casp-6 siRNA.</p>



<p>Certain biostatistical calculations underlying some figures contained errors.</p>



<p>We believe that these additional anomalies do not affect the conclusions presented in the affected figures. However, given the lack of original data for several of these figures due to the age of the paper, and since our subsequent research showed that certain specific claims in the original article were not correct and we reported a correction for those claims elsewhere, we consider that the appropriate course of action is to retract the article. All the authors agree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The listed “anomalies” refer to images <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B6410F2AF1398E6F379B244E7520A1#2">PubPeer users raised concerns</a> about in February and March of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not immediately respond to our request for comment. In his statement from July, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Importantly, the Panel found that allegations of fraud regarding this paper are “not accurate.”</p>



<p>That said, while most aspects of this paper have withstood the test of time, a number of its key findings required revision, which we addressed through subsequent publications. In addition, multiple anomalies in the paper have come to light in the past several months, and the investigation has uncovered certain inconsistent experimental results prior to publication. It is important to emphasize that I informed the Panel that I was unaware of these new issues prior to publication, and the Panel found no evidence to suggest otherwise. The Panel also found that the approach of publishing follow-on papers was “within the boundaries of normal scientific practice,” but that it was “suboptimal” not to additionally retract or directly correct the paper.</p>



<p>I agree with the Panel that it is important to issue a robust correction in Nature both to address the recently discovered anomalies and to explicitly spell out the revisions to certain key findings in the paper that we presented in subsequent papers but that would not necessarily be apparent to all readers of the Nature paper. I intend to issue such a correction as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article that now bears an expression of concern, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03080">The netrin receptor UNC5B mediates guidance events controlling morphogenesis of the vascular system</a>,” appeared in 2004. It has been cited 402 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice stated that <em>Nature</em> was publishing the expression of concern:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>to alert the readership that image integrity issues have been raised with some of the data. A report to the Stanford University board concluded that this article reflects evidence of manipulation of research data. We have considered the issues and find that the far-left lanes of the top and bottom panels of Supplementary Figure 2E appear to be duplicated. Given the age of the article there is insufficient information to conclusively assess how the duplication occurred. However, the authors have provided contemporaneous replicates that confirm the validity of the data presented in Supplementary Figure 2E.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne agreed to the journal’s decision, according to the notice. In his July statement, he’d written:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Issues with several figures in this paper were raised last December, which is when I first learned of them. The Panel found no evidence that I knew nor should reasonably have known of these issues. Two of the figures that have been questioned were generated in my laboratory. At least one of them shows evidence of manipulation of research data. Although one of my coauthors located primary data that confirms the result presented in the figure, it nevertheless requires a thorough correction. I am already in touch with the journal about this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December 2022, a user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/467FA67858F959040F2EABE876A7B3#1">posted concerns</a> about the figure called out in the expression of concern.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-first-discovery-research-2023">Here are some astounding scientific firsts of 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science experienced many first-of-a-kind feats this year. These are the groundbreaking achievements that grabbed our attention.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cosmic web shake-up </h4>



<p>Glowing threads of gas, galaxies and dark matter provided the first tangible evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">shock waves permeate the cosmic web</a>, the large-scale structure of the universe (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). Simulations had predicted that colliding threads generate shock waves, which catapult charged particles into the web’s magnetic fields and create a faint glow. That aura appeared in data from radio telescopes, confirming the shock waves exist. The glow also provides the first (if indirect) peek at the cosmic web’s magnetic fields.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hats off</h4>



<p>After more than 50 years of searching, mathematicians finally found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">an einstein tile</a> (<em>ein Stein</em> is German for “one stone”). The shape, dubbed “the hat,” fits with its mirror image to create an infinite pattern that never repeats (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 7</em>). Soon after, researchers discovered a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-einstein-tile-math">“vampire” einstein</a>, a shape that doesn’t require its mirror image to create an infinite nonrepeating pattern (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 9</em>). Einstein tiles and their unique balance between order and disorder could spur new discoveries in materials science.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fleeting debut</h4>



<p>The first appearance of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-28-instability-surprise-physics">oxygen-28</a>, a superheavy form of the element that physicists created in a particle accelerator, was much briefer than researchers had expected (S<em>N: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 4</em>). The isotope decayed almost immediately after forming, despite its atomic nucleus having full outer shells of protons and neutrons — a property that is typically linked with extra stability. Oxygen-28’s instability hints that something may be wrong with our understanding of the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">RNA retrieval</h4>



<p>Scientists isolated and decoded RNA from an extinct creature for the first time. The fragile molecules, which help ensure that cells follow their DNA instruction manuals, were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-decode-rna-extinct-animal-tasmanian">extracted from a preserved Tasmanian tiger</a> held in a museum (<em>SN: 11/4/23, p. 10</em>). Researchers hope that the feat will aid efforts to bring back the wolflike marsupial, which is named after its homeland and died out in 1936.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Surviving a deep freeze</h4>



<p>Adult corals can be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adult-coral-frozen-survive-climate-change">safely flash-frozen and revived</a>, researchers demonstrated, raising hopes that cryopreservation could be useful in coral conservation (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 11</em>). The key to preventing ice crystals from forming and damaging tissues is to bathe corals in a rigid metal container filled with a dehydrating solution before plunging them in liquid nitrogen. Whatever water remains in the tissues solidifies so quickly that it cannot crystallize and expand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1440%2C810&#038;ssl=1" alt="Two yellowish branches of a finger coral from the species Porites compressa are pictured." class="wp-image-3130783" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1030%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1380%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130783"><em>Porites compressa</em>, a finger coral, gets its name for its blunt branches.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Neutrino cartography</h4>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-new-view-milky-way-space">map of the Milky Way</a> is the first made without using light. Instead, cosmic cartographers used data from a detector in Antarctica and AI to chart nearly massless particles called neutrinos onto the galaxy’s plane. The resulting image (third image below; optical and gamma-ray versions shown for comparison) offered a rough idea of where the first known high-energy neutrinos to originate in the Milky Way were born (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 13</em>). With some refinement, the approach could pinpoint their birthplace and those of other amped-up ghostly particles.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Every letter counts</h4>



<p>This year marked the completion of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity">the pangenome</a>, an effort to catalog every single letter, or building block, in humankind’s genetic instruction manual (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 6</em>). The undertaking involved compiling and comparing nearly all the DNA of 47 people to get the most comprehensive snapshot yet of human genetic diversity. A few months later, researchers added the final piece: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dna-telomere-chromosomes-pangenome">the Y chromosome</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 7</em>). The pangenome could shed light on the molecular foundations of fertility, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and more.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Star eats planet</h4>



<p>Astronomers have long suspected that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-astrophysicists-star-eating-planet">stars swallow up planets</a>, but no one had ever caught a star in the act until this year (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 8</em>). About 10,000 light-years from Earth, the sunlike star engulfed an orbiting planet that was about 10 times as massive as Jupiter. Over several days, the star grew noticeably brighter and burped a bunch of gas, suggesting it engulfed a companion star. But the relatively small amount of energy released tipped off researchers that the star had actually eaten a planet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-antarctic-glaciers-rapid-loss-climate-change">3 Antarctic glaciers show rapidly accelerated ice loss from ocean warming</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> — Several Antarctic glaciers are undergoing dramatic acceleration and ice loss. Hektoria Glacier, the worst affected, has quadrupled its sliding speed and lost 25 kilometers of ice off its front in just 16 months, scientists say.</p>



<p>The rapid retreat “is really unheard of,” says Mathieu Morlighem, a glaciologist at Dartmouth College who was not part of the team reporting these findings.</p>



<p>The collapse was triggered by unusually warm ocean temperatures, which caused sea ice to retreat. This allowed a series of large waves to hit a section of coastline that is normally shielded from them. “What we’re seeing here is an indication of what could happen elsewhere” in Antarctica, says Naomi Ochwat, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who presented the findings December 11 at the American Geophysical Union meeting.</p>





<p>Hektoria Glacier, Green Glacier, and Crane Glacier sit near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which reaches up toward South America. The crescent moon–shaped bay, called the Larsen B Embayment, once seemed stable. As these glaciers oozed off the coastline, their ice used to merge into a floating slab around 200 meters thick. This slab, called the Larsen B Ice Shelf, was about the size of Rhode Island and filled the entire bay.</p>



<p>Having existed for over 10,000 years, this ice shelf buttressed and stabilized the glaciers flowing into it. But during a warm summer in 2002, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-cracked-heat-major-hunk-antarctic-ice-shelf-shatters-and-drifts-away">it suddenly fragmented</a> into thousands of skinny icebergs (<em>SN: 3/27/02</em>).</p>



<p>Hektoria, Green, and Crane glaciers — no longer contained by the ice shelf — &nbsp;began to flow into the ocean several times faster than they had before, shedding billions of tons of ice over the next decade.</p>



<p>Then starting in 2011, the hemorrhaging slowed down. The thin veneer of sea ice that forms over the bay each winter began to persist year round, preserved by a series of cold summers. This “landfast ice,” attached firmly to the coastline, grew five to 10 meters thick, stabilizing the glaciers. Their floating tongues gradually advanced back into the bay. But things changed abruptly in early 2022. On January 19 and 20, the landfast ice disintegrated into fragments, which drifted away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134274" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121423_df_glacier-retreat_jan16_inline.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="537" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134273" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121423_df_glacier-retreat_jan26_inline.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="537" class="image-compare__image-after" /></div><figcaption>Satellite images taken just 10 days apart reveal the dramatic breakup of sea ice in Antarctica&#8217;s Larsen B Embayment.

<p>Using data from ocean buoys farther north, Ochwat and colleagues determined that a series of powerful waves, higher than 1.5 meters, had swept in from the northeast — cracking apart the landfast ice. Those waves were highly unusual for this area.</p>



<p>The Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica, holds some of the world’s roughest waters. The Antarctic Peninsula extends up into this turbulent region, but its east side, where the Larsen B Embayment sits, rarely feels the waves. It is normally protected by several hundred kilometers of pack ice — floes of sea ice, pressed together by ocean currents — that dampen the waves, leaving the waters near Larsen as flat as a mirror.</p>



<p>In 2022, water temperatures near the surface of the Southern Ocean rose several tenths of a degree Celsius <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00961-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher than normal</a>, causing pack ice to shrink and peel away from the peninsula. This exposed the area to waves, which then broke up the landfast sea ice.</p>



<p>The glaciers accelerated as their floating tongues, no longer held in place, fragmented into bergs. Crane Glacier lost 11 kilometers of ice, nearly erasing its floating tongue; Green Glacier lost 18 kilometers, encompassing all of its floating ice.</p>



<p>Hektoria lost all 15 kilometers of its floating ice — followed by another 10 kilometers of ice that is normally more stable, because it rests on the seafloor. That “is faster than any tidewater glacier retreat that we know of,” Ochwat says.</p>





<p>The previous standout, Alaska’s Columbia Glacier, had lost 20 kilometers of ice in 30 years, records show. But Hektoria lost its 10 kilometers of nonfloating ice in just five months — including 2.5 kilometers that crumbled in a 3-day period.</p>



<p>All of this suggests that people trying to predict sea level rise need to consider sea ice, Morlighem says. Up until now, “its role in [glacier] dynamics has been completely ignored.”</p>



<p>Ochwat is waiting to see what will happen as the current Antarctic summer heats up between December and March. Hektoria and the other glaciers have been retreating only during summer months, when sea ice is absent; they pause during winter, when the surface of the bay freezes for a few months.</p>



<p>If Antarctic sea ice continues to shrink, as it has since 2022, it could spell trouble, says study coauthor Ted Scambos, a glaciologist also at UC Boulder. “You’re going to have a longer section of coastline where wave action can act on the front of ice shelves and glaciers,” potentially accelerating glacial retreat.</p>

<p>A psychologist in Australia has earned a pair of retractions after publishing several papers with international coauthors suspected of authorship fraud, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.drkellyallen.com/">Kelly-Ann Allen</a>, an associate professor at Monash University, in Clayton, and editor-in-chief of two <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=rdvp20">psychology</a> <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/jbhc/jbhc-overview.xml?language=en">journals</a>, declined to comment for this article.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1339783/full">retraction</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1285087/full">notices</a>, both in Frontiers journals, cite an investigation by the publisher confirming “a serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics.”</p>



<span id="more-128425"></span>



<p>Frontiers pulled “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.894316/full">Intolerance of uncertainty scale-12: psychometric properties of this construct among Iranian undergraduate students</a>” on November 27 and “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.866816/full">Psychometric assessment of the Persian translation of the interpersonal mindfulness scale with undergraduate students</a>” on September 4. The latter was one of more than three dozen papers the publisher has linked to “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">the unethical practice of buying or selling authorship</a>,” as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles have been cited 21 times.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a scientific sleuth, told Retraction Watch he had reported the former paper to Frontiers in October 2022 “due to suspicions about authorship.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The cause of my suspicion was the diversity of nations and disciplines amongst the authors, and the presence of repeat offenders for buying authorship in Wanich Suksatan, Indrajit Patra and Supat Chupradit,” Wise said.</p>



<p>All three individuals have had papers pulled in the past over concerns about authorship, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">Retraction Watch database</a>. Those retractions happened after the two papers published by Frontiers were submitted.</p>



<p>Suksatan and Chupradit have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/articles/c1vn0yqvgq1o">suspected of buying authorship</a> of research papers to boost their resumés, as have <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/19/the-incredible-collaborations-of-renaissance-men-and-women/">others of Allen’s coauthors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wise even found a Facebook post <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3280679479CFC3AB3E59F6C3DCD2E2#4">advertising authorship for sale</a> for a paper that looked very similar to the article that was pulled on September 4. The ad was posted by Salim Kallel, about whom we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/13/after-a-sleuth-reveals-a-paper-with-authorships-advertised-for-sale-its-retracted/">written before</a> and whose <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069291131516">Facebook profile</a> includes frequent “calls for coauthorship.”</p>



<p>“Wonderful opportunity to publish a paper in Scopus or Web of Science in collaboration with the authors from all over the world,” Kallel promised in one post on December 5.</p>



<p>Abbas Abdollahi of Alzahra University in Tehran, Iran, who is a corresponding author on the two retracted papers, did not respond to an email asking for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Allen has published multiple papers with Abdollahi. Starting in 2022, however, academics from several other countries – including Thailand, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia – started appearing as coauthors on Abdollahi and Allen’s papers, Wise said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He listed four such publications, in addition to those now retracted:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-022-00641-2">Courage: A Potential Mediator of the Relationship Between Personality and Social Anxiety</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-022-00776-x">The compassionate love for humanity scale (CLS-H-SF): psychometric properties of the Persian version</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306624X221110811">Psychometric Properties of the Reflective Function Questionnaire in Iranian Prisoners</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04470-5">Self-care behaviors mediates the relationship between resilience and quality of life in breast cancer patients</a>.”</li>
</ul>



<p>“I contacted Kelly-Ann Allen in January 2023 because I was surprised to see her name on a paper with Wanich Suksatan, Supat Chupradit and Indrajit Patra, given their history of being authors of works where authorship has been advertised for sale on Facebook,” Wise said. “She said that she’d done a lot of work for the paper and trusted Abbas Abdollahi whom she had worked with before.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Anastasia Long, head of communications at Frontiers, told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction decision was a result of a thorough investigation by the Frontiers’ Research Integrity team. The concerns over ‘authorship for sale’ were flagged post-publication both directly to us by concerned readers, as well as via Pubpeer, a valuable source of community feedback, of the adverts for several of the publications in question. Subsequently, our Research Integrity and Auditing teams investigated dozens more papers spanning 24 journals, and looked at patterns in behavior, editorial assignment, peer review and citations. </p>



<p>For the two articles you mention, several authors were added post-acceptance with claims of their significant contribution to the research. The presence of adverts selling authorship, the lack of expertise of some authors with regards to the subject matter of the articles, and broad geographical diversity of the contributors – with lack of prior collaboration, were key points of the investigation. One author also contacted us to claim that their name had been added to the article without their consent. Taken together, the evidence confirmed a breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics, resulting in retractions. </p>



<p>Frontiers&#8217; priority is to protect the scientific record, while upholding the highest ethical standards and rigor, and we are confident in our decision. Moreover, to help prevent cases of “authorship-for-sale” among its research publications, Frontiers published <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics#changes-in-authorship">a new author policy</a> and you can learn more about it in our <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/09/04/frontiers-implements-new-policy-to-counter-authorship-for-sale/">blog post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">reported earlier</a>, the new policy states the publisher will deny authorship changes requested after acceptance as a rule.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-mystery-illness-kennel-cough">Here are 5 questions about the mystery dog illness making news</a></h4>

              
                <p>In recent weeks, claims about a mysterious respiratory illness sickening dogs across the country have spooked pet owners.</p>



<p>Dogs with what veterinarians have dubbed “atypical kennel cough” show more persistent and severe symptoms than those caused by run-of-the-mill kennel cough: a coldlike condition caused by a grab bag of viruses and bacteria. Many ill dogs have failed or been slow to respond to existing treatments. Some have even died.</p>



<p>Efforts to pin down a culprit have so far yielded more questions than answers. That’s fed fears of a new contagion. When Michelle Hiskey’s dog Sheba fell ill, for instance, her friends and family members blew up her phone with texts, concerned about what some on social media branded “COVID for dogs.” Hiskey, a freelance writer in Decatur, Ga., is “not generally a worrier,” but the horror stories she heard did startle her, she says.</p>





<p>Experts, including those who had previously sounded alarm bells, now say there’s most likely a simple explanation behind the cases. Here’s what we know and what still remains unknown.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s different about this mystery dog illness?</h4>



<p>It’s not unusual for dogs to occasionally catch kennel cough, a chest infection that manifests most clearly in a honking cough, runny nose and sneezing. But beginning in late 2022 and surging the summer of 2023, more and more dogs seemed to be showing up to clinics, sicker than usual.</p>



<p>Cases of kennel cough are typically mild and resolve within a week or two. Dogs with atypical kennel cough can be feverish and fatigued on top of their other symptoms, and their symptoms can linger for several weeks. Taking antibiotics does not often lead to much improvement.</p>



<p>In some suspected cases, dogs have gone on to develop pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that in rare occasions can be deadly, says Mike Stepien, a spokesperson from the United States Department of Agricultural Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is aiding state laboratories with diagnostic testing.</p>



<p>For Sheba, who first began hacking and wheezing at the start of November, two rounds of the antibiotic doxycycline and temaril-p, an anti-inflammatory drug, have significantly reduced but not eliminated her symptoms. She needs to be symptom-free for seven days to be declared healthy, but she still hasn’t gone a full week without coughing. “I just keep starting the clock again,” Hiskey says.</p>



<p>It can be normal for dogs to respond poorly to treatment, says Colin Parrish, a virologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. No antiviral drugs exist to combat kennel cough, and antibiotics sometimes have middling efficacy.</p>



<p>The standard prescription from veterinarians is rest and time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How many cases are there?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure. No national program tracks diseases in dogs, making the count unclear, but so far, several hundred cases have been reported in over 16 states, from Rhode Island to California.</p>





<p>Oregon’s Department of Agriculture has launched a formal investigation into suspected cases of atypical kennel cough, counting more than 200 since August. In most states, however, reports remain anecdotal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s causing dogs to get sick?</h4>



<p>Scientists and public health officials do not yet know what is causing atypical kennel cough, but many doubt the cases all have one cause.</p>



<p>The small number of cases and the sporadic transmission patterns point away from a singular, highly contagious pathogen, says Jane Sykes, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.</p>



<p>A mixture of pathogens could instead be to blame, experts now say. A new bacterium or virus could be among them, but it’s unlikely to be the only or main contributor.</p>



<p>Tests for known pathogens such as canine parainfluenza virus or <em>Bordetella bronchiseptica</em> have come up negative, but by the time the dogs make it to a clinic, they are likely to have stopped shedding the pathogen (or pathogens) responsible for their illness. The uptick in severe kennel cough may be due to a “perfect storm” of factors, Sykes and several others argue.</p>



<p>Dog ownership has increased recently. The fraction of American households with at least one dog grew from <a href="https://www.avma.org/news/pet-ownership-rate-stabilizes-spending-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 to 45 percent between 2016 and 2022</a>, largely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, more than 65 million families now have dogs. At the same time, rates of vaccination have dropped for a variety of reasons, experts suspect, making pets more susceptible to disease.</p>



<p>Now, as employees return to the office and families travel for the holidays, pet dogs may increasingly end up spending stints in kennels and doggy day cares. Pathogens of all kinds can spread easily in those group settings, creating a nasty soup that poorly timed or poorly executed swabs may miss. Hiskey suspects her dog caught a bug at the dog park.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are scientists doing to solve the mystery of this illness?</h4>



<p>Veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Oregon, New Hampshire and Colorado are currently examining swabs collected from dogs with atypical kennel cough, but they have not reached definitive conclusions.</p>





<p>Researchers from the University of New Hampshire in Durham have <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a previously unknown bacterium</a> in a majority of 70 samples collected from dogs stricken ill in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But they have yet to grow the bacterium in the lab, or to <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test the idea that it’s a driver of disease</a>, a notice on the lab’s website says.</p>



<p>The UNH researchers could not detect the organism in tissue samples collected from dogs in 2018, long before the outbreak, but such a finding does not clarify the role the mystery bacterium plays — or does not play — in disease. The organism could be innocuous, or could worsen preexisting illness, rather than cause it.</p>



<p>The researchers are now examining more recent samples collected from Oregon, Colorado and other Midwestern states to see if they contain the bacterium, too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can dog owners do to protect their pets?</h4>



<p>Keeping pets up-to-date on their vaccinations can reduce the risk of kennel cough.</p>



<p>Limiting interactions with other dogs, particularly those that may be ill, can help as well. Outbreaks tend to cluster in dog kennels, day cares and parks — places where animals crowd together. There’s no reason to panic, experts say, or to dramatically alter plans. Small precautions should suffice.</p>



<p>If your dog does exhibit symptoms, particularly those that do not improve with time, it’s best to call your veterinarian.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/IMG_0880_Faroe_Islands-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>Genetic population isolate </strong></p>
<p>Archaeological research suggests that the Faroe Islands were founded in two pre-Viking phases around 300-500 AD and 500-700 AD, before the Viking settlements in the 9th century.</p>
<p>This population is well-suited for genetic research because it was geographically isolated. Indeed, the current population of about 50,000 people is believed to descend from a low number of settlers, who thus had few opportunities to find a partner. This is called a bottleneck effect, which often leads to inbreeding from mating between close relatives.</p>
<p>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are mutations of single DNA-bases, A, C, G, or T, at specific positions in the DNA sequence as compared with a reference genome. Each person has over 3 million SNPs, and these are of great interest in genetic research.</p>
<p>People have two copies of chromosomes, one from each parent. Therefore, we inherit two identical or two different copies of each SNP. The two copies, denoted genotypes, are called homozygotes if the copies are identical and heterozygotes if the copies are different.</p>
<p>SNP heterozygosity <em>H </em>is a measure of genetic diversity. It is the number of heterozygous genotypes divided by the total number of genotypes. High and low <em>H </em>means, respectively, a high and low genetic diversity. It is desirable to have high <em>H </em>because a low genetic diversity and inbreeding can increase the risk of genetic diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic diversity and inbreeding </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09763-x">In this paper</a>, the whole genomes of a small sample of the population are analysed using bioinformatic methods. The results show that <em>H </em>is relatively high for individual samples because individuals have many private SNPs, likely of recent origin. On the contrary, <em>H </em>is low for the SNPs that are shared by the population and therefore are likely of older origin.</p>
<p>Long sequences of SNPs that mainly contain homozygous genotypes are called <em>ROHs </em>(runs of homozygosity). In the paper, <em>ROHs </em>are used to estimate the inbreeding in the Faroese population as compared to both modern and ancient European populations. The inbreeding of the Faroese population is high compared to European populations and population isolates. Thus, it has inbreeding which is more similar to ancient Europeans.</p>

<p><strong>Two methods to estimate relatedness </strong></p>
<p>To estimate the relatedness between individuals, two methods based on whole genomes were investigated. One of the methods (KING kinship) cannot distinguish between ancient and recent relatedness. Therefore, all the supposedly unrelated participants seemed very closely related as siblings or parent-offspring relationships. However, using a method based on <em>ROHs</em>, the author is able to show that the high relatedness is of ancient origin.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The bottleneck effect from the founding event </strong></p>
<p>Then a search for the bottleneck effect was carried out. An older genetic study of the Faroese population was unable to find such an effect. In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p>
<p>The higher limit of this estimate agrees with the oldest archaeological findings from the Faroe Islands, while the lower limit suggests that the founding event may have occurred about 2-3 centuries earlier than previously believed based on archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>After the founding event, the bottleneck effect increased from about 300 AD to 600 AD, where it was the highest. Thereafter, the bottleneck effect slowly decreased, most likely from an increase in the population size from the arrival of new settlers.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with the 1000 Genome Project </strong></p>
<p>Other results in this study were about ancestry and clustering (Multidimensional Scaling) as compared with the international <a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/">1000 Genome Project,</a> where whole genomes from several different populations were studied.</p>
<p>The Faroese results about ancestry showed that the study participants descended from founders of mainly European ancestry (&gt;99% probability) and possibly some admixed American ancestry (&lt;1% probability).</p>
<p>The study participants that cluster closest together are genetically most similar. The Faroese participants clustered all close together and distinctively away from the other populations but closest to the European and British populations of the 1000 Genome Project. Finally, the study showed that the Faroese people have many rare SNP variants. Such mutations are of great interest for genetic research.</p>

                <p><em>Following the launch of </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a><em> earlier this year, we sat down with Editor-in-Chief Hocine Cherifi to learn more about his vision for the journal and developments in the field</em> <em>he&rsquo;s keeping an eye on.</em> <br><br></p>

          <p><strong>What is your vision for </strong><strong><em>PLOS Complex Systems?</em></strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My vision for this journal is to create the richest community possible around emerging tools and techniques that will shape the future of our world. Complexity as a discipline exists with different meanings around the world and different overarching philosophies. With <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> I hope that we can facilitate these important conversations on what makes something &lsquo;complex&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; across traditional disciplines and the network community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p></p>



<p><strong>The journal has a broad, transdisciplinary scope, why is this important?</strong></p>



<p>Complexity is a field that transcends traditional boundaries&ndash;it is not uncommon to see a researcher study economic, social, or natural complex systems at once. As such, the journal must be able to accommodate the broad range of interests many researchers in this space have. When we bring that all together, we can learn from each other. We want <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> to be a space where researchers can connect and share approaches that they might not have discovered otherwise.</p>



<p>It is also a field that is growing rapidly, and this means more and more scientists are starting to use complex systems analysis tools. The journal must be accessible to people who consider themselves a biologist or sociologist, and encourage the diversity of perspectives and expertise that they bring to the community.</p>



<p>In this, I would like to highlight our commitment to constructive peer review. Building the journal&rsquo;s editorial board was an intensive and intentional process, and I am very grateful for the time they have lent us so far, and will continue to invest in the journal. Their expertise is invaluable, and I am thrilled we can count on them to set the standard for the quality of research and discourse seen in <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em><em><sub>.</sub></em></p>



<p><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you currently?</strong></p>



<p>The thing that excites me most is the growth of dedicated coursework and degree programs for complex systems and networks. This is recognition of the importance of complexity science by academia as a whole and I am excited to see how students in these programs think, as well as the problems they want to address. My hope is that these programs will embrace the need for collaboration and subject expertise as well as inspire curious students.</p>



<p><strong>How will Open Science play a key role in the journal achieving its vision and advancing the field?</strong></p>



<p>Open Science is inclusive, transparent, and flexible, making it the optimal way to communicate complex networks research from across a range of disciplines to all its possible audiences. Open Science also increases visibility and reusability, not just of the research article, but the underlying methods and data of the research itself, which creates an opportunity for a wider community to further test and build from these components<br><br>This is particularly vital to ensuring that the datasets and methodologies that researchers create and leverage are properly vetted. With the prevalence of machine learning models, we must be conscientious of the data we use and the risk of perpetuating inequalities that may be hidden in these tools.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cop28-fossil-fuels-climate-change">COP28 nations agreed to ‘transition’ from fossil fuels. That’s too slow, experts say</a></h4>

              
                <p>Days of contentious wrangling in Dubai at the United Nations’ 28th annual climate summit ended December 13 with a historic agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels and accelerate climate action over the next decade. The organization touted the agreement as a moment of global solidarity, marking “the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era.</p>



<p>But the final agreement reached at COP28, signed by nearly 200 nations, did not include language that explicitly mandated phasing out fossil fuel energy, deeply frustrating many nations as well as climate scientists and activists.</p>





<p>The agreement is considered <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world’s first “global stocktake</a>,” an inventory of climate actions and progress made since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">2015 Paris Agreement</a> to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>It acknowledges the conclusions of scientific research that greenhouse gas emissions will need to be cut by 43 percent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. It then calls on nations to speed up climate actions before 2030 so as to reach global net zero by 2050 — in which greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced by their removal from the atmosphere. Among the actions called for are increasing global renewable energy generation, phasing down coal power and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.</p>



<p>But among many scientists gathered in San Francisco at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting to discuss climate change’s impacts to Earth’s atmosphere, polar regions, oceans and biosphere, the reaction to the language in the agreement was more frustrated than celebratory.</p>



<p>“The beginning of the end? I wish it was the middle of the end,” says climate scientist Luke Parsons of the Nature Conservancy, who is based in Durham, N.C. “But you have to start somewhere, I guess.”</p>



<p>It is a step forward, says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Saying it out loud, that we are aiming to phase out fossil fuels, is huge.”</p>



<p>It’s not a moment too soon: The globe is already experiencing many climate change–linked extreme weather events, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">the hottest 12 months ever recorded</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/23</em>). Still, Scambos says, “it’s a tribute to the science and the negotiators that we can take this step now, before the disastrous global impacts truly get underway.” But, he added, “I fear that the pace [of future climate action] will … still be driven by impacts arriving at our collective doors.”</p>



<p>Other researchers had a grimmer take.</p>



<p>“It was weak sauce,” says climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania. “What we really need is a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, on a very specific timeline: We’re going to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent this decade, bring them down to zero mid-century. Instead, they agreed to transition away from fossil fuels — the analogy that I use is, you’re diagnosed with diabetes, and you tell your doctor you’re going to transition away from doughnuts. That’s not going to cut it. It didn’t meet the moment.”</p>



<p>Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, called the agreement “deeply disappointing and misleading,” noting that it didn’t include any language specifically calling for phasing out fossil fuels. Furthermore, he says, “COP28 keeps entertaining the idea that 1.5 degrees Celsius may be achievable, but everyone is offtrack to meet that goal. [And] for ice sheets and glaciers, even 1.5 degrees is not sustainable.” &nbsp;There already are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">fears, for instance, that the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet can’t be stopped</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Even if the world stays close to that average temperature, “the ice sheets are going to be retreating,” says Rob DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “But you start getting out toward the end of the century, and all hell is going to break loose if we go much above 1.5. You’re talking about actually exceeding the limits of adaptation around so much of our coastlines.” &nbsp;</p>





<p>On December 12, the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service noted that the world has, in effect, <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/weve-lost-19-years-battle-against-global-warming-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“lost” 19 years by delaying action to reduce fossil fuel emissions</a>. Back in 2015, climate projections suggested that Earth’s average temperature would reach the 1.5 degrees C threshold by the year 2045 — then 30 years away. Now, projections show that the planet may reach that benchmark by 2034, just 11 years in the future.</p>



<p>“We’ve got a shrinking window of opportunity,” Mann says. “And that window of opportunity will close if we don’t make dramatic and immediate reductions to our carbon emissions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2023-big-if-true">Here are some big-if-true scientific claims that made headlines in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>From ancient cannibalism to stars made of dark matter, 2023 delivered several scientific claims that could shake up their fields — if they shape up to be true.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Spark of life</h4>



<p>Early life on Earth may have gotten a boost from giant volcanic eruptions. A new look at debris from 10 eruptions millions of years ago suggests they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruption-nitrogen-lightning-life">contained a lot of nitrate that formed in the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 7</em>). The eruptions could have triggered fierce lightning that ripped apart molecular nitrogen, freeing nitrogen atoms to bond with other elements and form molecules useful to life — including nitrate. The same process may have happened billions of years ago, some scientists say, producing ingredients for early life. Scientists will need to account for the different chemical makeup of primordial Earth’s atmosphere to bolster that claim.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Butchered bone</h4>



<p>Purported tool marks on a 1.45-million-year-old fossilized leg offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-hominids-stone-age-cannibalism">the oldest evidence of cannibalism among humans’ ancient relatives</a>, researchers contend (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 10</em>). The marks on the bone, found in Kenya, could have been made by some unidentified hominid using a stone tool to carve muscle away from the shin of another hominid. But a few bone nicks do not cannibal table scraps make, some paleoanthropologists say.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overgrown galaxies</h4>



<p>A handful of galaxies from the very early universe are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">up to 100 times as massive as expected</a>, data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope suggest (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). The hefty galaxies not only challenge the idea that matter clumped together slowly over the universe’s lifetime, but also hint at some unknown way to fast-track galaxy formation. But the galaxies’ weights and distances must be confirmed with more detailed analyses of their light before astronomers rewrite cosmic history.</p>

<p>The thymus may not be inconsequential for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">adult health after all</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 7</em>). This immune system organ between the lungs is most active in childhood and withers with age, so it is often considered expendable in adulthood. In a study of more than 2,000 adults who had chest surgery, however, researchers reported that removing the thymus gland was associated with higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years. Why thymus removal might be harmful remains unclear.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dead and buried?</h4>



<p>Honoring the dead may not be unique to big-brained hominids like <em>Homo sapiens</em> and Neandertals. <em>Homo naledi</em>, which lived around the same time as early <em>H. sapiens</em> but had an orange-sized brain, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-dug-cave-graves-carved-marks">intentionally buried bodies</a> in an underground South African cave, a group of researchers claims (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 6</em>). Other experts remain unconvinced, though. The supposedly buried bodies, which predate the earliest evidence of <em>H</em>. <em>sapiens</em> and Neandertal burials by 160,000 years, could have fallen through cave shafts or been washed by water into natural depressions in cave floors, skeptics say.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rocked to the core</h4>



<p>Separate studies both based on earthquake data are shaking up geologists’ concept of Earth’s heart. The solid inner core not only rotates but also appears to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">switch the direction of rotation</a> relative to the mantle and crust every few decades (<em>SN: 2/25/23, p. 7</em>). The inner core may also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">a secret chamber</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 17</em>). Other data, however, hint that the inner core reverses every few years or does not rotate at all. And the supposed discovery of the innermost core hinges on a type of seismic wave that bounces around Earth’s interior, becoming weaker and more difficult to detect with every bounce. Thankfully, whatever is going on down there does not seem to endanger life on the surface.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dark matter stars</h4>



<p>The James Webb Space Telescope may have spotted stars made of dark matter — the unidentified stuff that makes up most matter in the cosmos (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 8</em>). So-called dark stars are so far hypothetical, but JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-stars-dark-matter">observed three objects</a> giving off the kind of light expected from such stars. If they exist, dark stars could shed new light on star formation and the nature of dark matter. However, the pinpricks of light in JWST’s field of view could also come from normal stars, so astronomers will need more detailed data to tease out the objects’ true nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retractions are the stuff of nightmares for most academics. But they aren’t necessarily a career obstacle, and sometimes may be the only way forward, according to <a href="https://www.andersonevolve.com/people">Andrew P. Anderson</a>, a postdoctoral researcher in the biology department of Reed College, in Portland, Ore. Last month, the journal <em>Evolution</em> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evolut/qpad182/7440094">pulled and replaced</a> a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/76/6/1331/6882231">study</a> Anderson had conducted as a PhD student under <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/people/faculty/adamjones">Adam G. Jones</a> at the University of Idaho, in Moscow. The study’s findings suggested sexual selection shaped the responsiveness of the human genome to male sex hormones. Below is a lightly edited Q&amp;A we did with Anderson about his experience.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch (RW):</strong> In the summer of 2022, shortly after your paper was first published, you realized it contained a significant error. What happened?</p>



<span id="more-128414"></span>



<p><strong>Andrew Anderson (AA): </strong>Another research team was trying to follow up on our study using a wider group of animals and wasn’t seeing the same pattern for one of the traits we tested. They went back and tried using just our data in their calculations and got a conflicting result. So they went through our analysis and found the error in our calculations. They emailed me all the details of what they did and sent me the one line they thought I left out that would rectify the issue. They also assured me they could see how I missed it and that I probably wouldn’t be the last person to make that error. </p>



<p>I was obviously not happy with the situation, I felt like a fraud and I let down my advisor. I was initially hopeful that maybe they missed something or that the other traits they didn’t verify would be okay. I emailed my co-author/adviser and began looking at their analysis to confirm my results were incorrect and theirs were correct. At that point, all I could do was thank the researcher who had emailed me for taking an interest in my work and for pointing out the error; then I asked them to give me some time to sort out my next steps.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How did your adviser react when you told him?</p>



<p><strong>AA: </strong>He is always supportive and straightforward. No blame or admonitions, just focusing on how we move forward. He asked if I confirmed the issue, then said we need to write a new table with the new values and write a paragraph about the changes. Then we went back and forth on those edits and a letter to <em>Evolution</em> explaining what happened and asking if we could submit our new table and explanation as a corrigendum.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How did the journal respond?</p>



<p><strong>AA: </strong>They thanked us for the documentation and told us the editorial team for the journal and corrections team for the publisher would discuss and get back to us with a decision. They took a few weeks to decide (sending us updates in between – including a notice that they were putting up an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/77/10/2340/7254508">expression of concern</a> that they had us approve), but came to the conclusion we needed to retract and resubmit. They provided us information of what we needed to do to the manuscript and told us to submit through the journal’s portal like any other manuscript.</p>



<p>It felt like other communications I’ve had with journal editors, and certainly once the resubmission started it was like any other paper. As with my advisor, the only thing that really mattered for the journal was making sure the information was correct. I think the focus on getting it right and providing me the opportunity to correct the record put me at ease with the process.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>How do you feel about the retraction?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> A range of feelings really. I’m happy that I got to correct the record, I know some people were reading it and using it for their research and I want them to have the right information. I’m embarrassed that I made a mistake and it’s permanently there for everyone to see. I’ve lived enough to know it’s a blip on the radar, but the timing (looking for an academic job) had me terrified. That feeling has abated more as I have gotten a lot of positive comments from other scientists.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>Has the retraction had any negative consequences for your career?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> I honestly don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m looking for jobs right now and no one has indicated if this made a difference. I can say I have gotten interviews after the statement of concern by the journal and after the full retract/resubmit process was completed. I don&#8217;t know the results of those interviews yet, but I would guess if the retraction was a problem I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the interviews in the first place.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> What were the biggest challenges for you during this experience?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> Not getting in my own head about what was happening. When I have heard about retractions, it’s usually about possibly unethical behavior by the scientist. I was worried that my retraction might be perceived that way. No one ever suggested malfeasance on my part. And every part of that paper is from open-source data and all my code was available since publication. My advisor always had me put the code up for others to see, and this was a great lesson that doing so not only benefits other researchers in reproducibility but also allows me to “show my work” so nothing is hidden and shows I’m doing my analysis in good faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People make mistakes and I’m certainly no different. There are people and procedures in place for correcting a paper. While not common, errors and retract/resubmit seem to happen more than I realized as I was looking for how to communicate with the journal about my situation. I got through it by just telling myself this is how science is supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do you have any advice for others who find themselves in a similar situation?</p>



<p><strong>AA:</strong> Take a breath, admit you made the mistake and reach out to the journal. They have policies and procedures in place to resolve the issue. It’s like trouble-shooting in the other parts of our work as scientists. If you made a mistake or something went wrong in the lab, you can’t ignore it, you have to fix it; the same is true with your papers. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-heat-waves-below-surface-common">Ocean heat waves often lurk out of sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heat waves don’t just strike on land — they can also occur in the ocean. And roughly a third of marine heat waves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01325-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t detectable at the ocean’s surface</a>, a new study reports. The findings, published in the December <em>Nature Geoscience</em>, suggest that far more of these potentially harmful events might be occurring than previously believed.</p>



<p>Ocean heat waves can have a slew of adverse effects on marine ecosystems because many forms of life cannot rapidly adapt to changes in temperature. For instance, cod populations were devastated from 2013 to 2015 when a marine heat wave lingered off the West Coast of North America. Given the interconnectedness of marine food webs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/massive-marine-heat-wave-blob-unprecedented-seabird-die-off">seabirds suffered, too</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/20</em>).</p>





<p>Marine heat waves are often identified with satellite observations that measure the temperature of the ocean surface. But these data leave the ocean depths unmonitored.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To literally take a deeper look, statistician Furong Li and colleagues turned to computer simulations of the ocean’s temperature, salinity and currents, among other parameters, created from both satellite and subsurface data stretching back to the early 1990s. Such simulations are a powerful way of studying the ocean on a global scale, says Li, of the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.</p>



<p>The researchers pinpointed ocean heat waves in the simulations by looking for layers of water that remained unusually warm — up to a few degrees Celsius above surrounding levels — for at least five days. Such events can be caused by changes in atmospheric circulation, for instance, or shifts in ocean currents.</p>



<p>Li and her collaborators spotted several hundred marine heat waves per year. But the real surprise was finding that about 1 in 3 of those events consistently lurked out of view and were never visible in the uppermost 10 meters of the water. “We discovered a great number of marine heat waves hidden below the sea surface,” Li says.</p>



<p>Researchers might accordingly be missing a lot of these events, says Mike Jacox, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Monterey, Calif., not involved in the research. “Just looking at the surface temperature might not be enough.”</p>



<p>Marine life might therefore be contending with significantly more ocean heat waves than previously thought. And that means additional stress on marine ecosystems. In 2020, Jacox and his colleagues showed that animals seeking to escape marine heat waves would have to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">swim hundreds of kilometers on average</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). And when creatures are unable to move, marine heat waves often prove deadly. Warming in the Great Barrier Reef, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">has been linked to coral bleaching</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/20</em>).</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/APHA-logo-2023-12-14-09_33_53-Annual-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h3><strong>APHA 2023: Creating the Healthiest Nation</strong></h3>
<p>As the Editor <em>of BMC Public Health, </em>I had the opportunity to attend  the <a href="https://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association’s</a> (APHA’s) 151st Annual Meeting and Exposition held in Atlanta, Georgia, one of the birthplaces of the civil rights movements.</p>
<p>The theme of the meeting, “Creating the Healthiest Nation: Overcoming Social and Ethical Challenges,” emphasized the importance of investigating the social and ethical challenges we are facing in our society to ensure a healthy and equitable environment, taking actions to apply what we learned from science.</p>
<p>Among all the amazing sessions, I would like to share with you some sessions which stood out as being particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s meeting addressed different topics, including Artificial Intelligence in Public Health, Public Health issues affecting people with disabilities and Anti-Racism research.</p>
<h3><strong>Public Health and Artificial Intelligence: friends, enemies, or frenemies? </strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The APHA meeting was full of exciting sessions, and it was very difficult to decide which ones to attend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joshua M. Sharfstein, Vice Dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, held a fascinating talk discussing the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for public health practice.</p>
<p>AI techniques have been widely applied to infection-disease surveillance, making possible early outbreak detection and prediction of disease trends, allowing timely public-health response modeling and assessment. In this way, AI can identify previously invisible data, providing &#8220;new solutions to old problems.&#8221;  However, AI models can be biased by the sources of data, increasing inequality in the society, for instance in terms of access to equitable care. Using AI brings with it the risks of eliminating the key role for human engagement, violation of personal privacy and lack of transparency, as AI systems make decisions in ways that humans are not always able to understand easily.</p>
<p>Within the field of Public Health, AI offers opportunities as well as risks. The key to success for good use of AI is a people-centered approach controlled by humans, which takes into account ethics issues, personal data protection and transparency of the models.</p>
<h3><strong>Inclusivity Scorecard: improving accessibility for people living with disabilities</strong></h3>
<p>People with disabilities, especially intellectual and developmental disabilities, face every day with many barriers, which are more than just physical obstacles. Disability is surrounded by stereotype, stigma and discrimination. People often assume that those with disabilities have a poor quality of life, are unable to care for themselves and are in general unhealthy. Supporting people with disabilities is a social responsibility and should be aimed to create an environment within our society where people with disabilities can have an independent life.</p>

<p>Within the session dedicated to emerging Public Health issues affecting people with disabilities, M. Alysia Mastrangelo, Professor of Physical Therapy at the Stockton University, described the development of the Inclusivity Scorecard. This tool is designed to be used by site managers of public spaces and owners of business and recreational areas. The Inclusivity Scorecard considers five priority areas, including accessible entrance, access to services, goods and supports, access to restrooms, approachability of the staff and website accessibility. The aim of the scorecard is to increase accessibility, providing equitable access and promoting social inclusion. The development of an Inclusivity Scorecard could help to evaluate a public space and provide important accessibility information in advance, providing support for individuals living with disabilities and their caregivers.</p>
<h3><strong>“Together we can move mountains”: Antiracism research, health equity and social justice</strong></h3>
<p>The second-to-last day of the meeting started with an interesting session held by leaders of anti-racist research. This kind of research tries to identify the reasons for racism and aims to unlearn internalized belief systems dictated by white supremacy, with the final scope to redistribute power and resources, uplift Black and Indigenous leadership in Public Health and more broadly address social injustices in society.</p>
<p>There is a need to develop anti-racist policies and practice interventions to address the issue of racism in communities and to educate, advocate and speak for health equity.</p>
<p>Wendy Barrington, Associate Professor in the departments of Health Systems and Population Health and Epidemiology within the University of Washington School of Public Health, talked about the Center for Anti-Racism and Community Health (ARCH). Dr Barrington was named Director of the ARCH in the fall of 2021. The ARCH Center provides a space within the university to nurture and develop Black and Indigenous scholars and anti-racist researchers, by serving as a resource for the implementation of anti-racist strategies at community level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Editor I have treasured this amazing experience where I learned more about new promising programs to improve the health of our society. I really hope that <em><a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcpublichealth/">BMC Public Health</a> </em>can continue to disseminate inspiring Public Health insights and can’t wait to explore more at APHA 2024 in Minneapolis next year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-fetch-play">When do cats play fetch? When they feel like it </a></h4>

              
                <p>In news that probably won’t surprise cat owners, cats that play fetch do it on their own terms.</p>



<p>Fetching felines tend to dictate when a fetching session begins and when it ends, a survey of over 900 cat owners suggests. The vast majority of the participants’ cats&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47409-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to pick up the behavior on their own</a>, with no explicit training from their humans, animal behavior scientist Jemma Forman and colleagues report December 14 in&nbsp;<em>Scientific Reports.</em></p>



<p>“Ultimately, I think the cats are in control,” says Forman, of the University of Sussex in Brighton, England.<em>&nbsp;</em>The study adds a new facet to scientists’ understanding of cat behavior, which has been less studied than that of dogs.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Previous studies have reported that cats can fetch, but there’s not much research on why or how the animals do it, or whether the behavior requires training. The inspiration for the new study came in the form of a sleek Sphynx named Bear. “He surprised me one day by bringing a toy to me,” says Elizabeth Renner, a psychologist at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a cat play fetch | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/495eLofNkEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bear, a Sphynx cat, purrs while retrieving a crinkly foil ball tossed by his owner, study coauthor Elizabeth Renner. “He really loves fetch,” she says.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So she teamed up with Forman and University of Sussex psychologist David Leavens to create an online survey to learn more about fetching cats. The team recruited survey respondents via social media and targeted people who have (or had) cats that played fetch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers were interested in the animals’ agency: Whose idea was it to play fetch in the first place? More often than not, the answer was the cat, the team found. Of the 1,154 cats tallied in the survey, owners reported that more than 94 percent hadn’t been trained to fetch. The survey also revealed other kitty tidbits, like favorite things to fetch (toys, crumpled paper and hair ties, among other items) and the purebred that fetched most frequently (Siamese).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that owners were training their cats without realizing it, says Dennis Turner, a cat behavior expert who founded&nbsp;the Institute of Applied Ethology and Animal Psychology near Zurich and was&nbsp;not involved with the work. Even just tossing a toy left at your feet rewards your cat with time and attention. That reinforces the fetching behavior, he says. “Cats learn very quickly — if they want to.”</p>



<p>Cats may also be training their humans, he says. One cat owner in the study figured out that her pet would fetch only pom-poms of a certain size. “I bought a larger pom-pom, and she rejected it,” the owner said. In human-cat relationships, Turner says, “there’s a lot of learning going on back and forth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings offer plenty for researchers to sink their claws into. One question is what percentage of cats play fetch, Renner says. Another is whether fetching is a type of social interaction between humans and cats. The researchers are now recruiting cat owners for a new study that may help answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not every cat will fetch like Fido, so Forman emphasizes that it’s important for owners to pay attention to their animals’ needs. “Cats are individuals, and they have very distinct personalities.” Cats may want to eat, play or do something else entirely — like walk on your keyboard. Or sleep on your face. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-advances-vaccines-drugs-2023">Here are some of the biggest medical advances in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023(opens in a new tab)">Weight-loss drugs</a> stole much of the spotlight in 2023, but these medical advances treating other conditions are also worthy of attention (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Green light for CRISPR gene editing</h4>



<p>On December 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-crispr-therapy-sickle-cell-fda">the world’s first CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing therapy</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/23</em>). The treatment, called Casgevy, targets sickle cell disease by helping patients produce healthy hemoglobin. In people with the disease, hemoglobin is abnormal, causing red blood cells to become hard and crescent shaped, which can block blood flow. By March 2024, the FDA will decide whether the same therapy can be used to treat beta-thalassemia, a disorder that reduces hemoglobin production.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Slowing down Alzheimer’s</h4>



<p>The Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) won full FDA approval in July. Like the drug aducanumab approved in 2021, lecanemab removes the amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The drug doesn’t stop the disease, but in a clinical trial, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-market-brain">lecanemab slowed cognitive decline</a> by about 30 percent over 18 months compared with a placebo (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 9</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A gene therapy for muscular dystrophy</h4>



<p>In June, the FDA approved the first gene therapy for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Due to a faulty gene, people with this muscle-wasting disease don’t make the protein dystrophin, which helps keep muscle cells intact. The therapy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">helps the body produce a version of the missing protein</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Guarding against RSV</h4>



<p>Several ways to protect against respiratory syncytial virus arrived this year. In May, the FDA approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-vaccine-rsv">the first RSV vaccine, called Arexvy, in the United States</a>, for adults age 60 and older (<em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 8</em>), and then in August, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-rsv-vaccine-pregnancy">a vaccine for pregnant people</a>, called Abrysvo (<em>SN: 8/25/23</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">A monoclonal antibody</a> — a lab-made antibody that mimics immune system proteins — won approval in July to protect children 2 and younger from the virus, which sends as many as 80,000 young children to U.S. hospitals each year (S<em>N: 4/27/23</em>). But in October, limited supplies of the therapy led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend reserving it for babies at highest risk for complications from RSV.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A pill for postpartum depression</h4>



<p>Until August, the only medication in the United States specifically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brexanolone-postpartum-depression">targeting postpartum depression</a> required a 60-hour intravenous infusion in a hospital (<em>SN: 3/22/19</em>). With FDA approval of zuranolone (brand name Zurzuvae), those afflicted with postpartum depression can take an oral medication at home and experience <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/postpartum-depression-pill-zurzuvae-zuranolone#:~:text=The%20medication%2C%20zuranolone%20(brand%20name,be%20available%20in%20late%20fall." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement in as little as three days</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Birth control, no prescription required</h4>



<p>In July, the FDA ruled that the oral contraceptive norgestrel, first approved in 1973, be available without a prescription. It’s the first OTC daily birth control pill in the United States. Some public health experts argue that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/counter-birth-control-pill-reproductive">reducing barriers to contraception</a> is especially important to reproductive autonomy now that state bans have limited access to abortion (<em>SN: 5/19/23</em>).</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A shot against chikungunya</h4>



<p>The chikungunya virus can cause fever and severe joint pain, and be fatal to newborns. In November, the FDA approved the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> first vaccine against the virus</a>, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus is most prevalent in tropical regions, but the FDA warns that it’s spreading to new parts of the globe.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Narcan over the counter</h4>



<p>The nasal spray Narcan, aka naloxone, can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose within minutes. In March, the FDA ruled <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this life-saving drug can be sold over the counter</a>. Officials hope that easier access to Narcan can help fight the opioid epidemic, which claimed the lives of nearly 645,000 people from 1999 to 2021 due to overdoses.</p>

<p>Just four months after an allegedly stolen dinosaur fossil was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01969-z">returned from Germany to Brazil</a>, a prominent European paleontologist published a paper bound to spark renewed controversy in an <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/chicken-size-dino-furlike-mane-stirs-ethics-debate">already-divided</a> research community.</p>



<p>And so it did: Less than a month after the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GC1464_geocurator_11_7_pp480-495-RETRACTED.pdf">article</a>, which criticized the online repatriation campaign, was published on October 2 in <em>The Geological Curator</em>, it vanished again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This flawed corporatist rant, loaded with racist undertones, has been retracted,” <a href="https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=1785324">Juan Carlos Cisneros</a> of Universidade Federal do Piauí, in Teresina, Brazil, <a href="https://twitter.com/PaleoCisneros/status/1728500510880145596">wrote on the social media platform X</a>.</p>



<p>The reasons for the retraction are not entirely clear, but the journal may have faced external pressure, according to the paper’s author.</p>



<span id="more-128408"></span>



<p>In the article, Jeff Liston, president of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists, accused Cisneros and another researcher in Brazil of using “Trumpian dog whistles” in a campaign on social media that preceded the repatriation of the chicken-sized reptile, dubbed <em>Ubirajara </em>jubatus. During the campaign, the German museum housing the fossil became the target of hate speech on social media and reportedly <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/institutions-global-north-hoard-fossils-brazil-study-says">received bomb and arson threats</a>.</p>



<p>“This is a public science museum with school classes coming in,” Liston told Retraction Watch. “What I found most disappointing was there was no attempt by the people who were running the campaign to take responsibility for the more extreme aspects of it and disavow or disown them.”</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re seeing parallels with what Trump did on January 6,” Liston added. “I believe the buzzword used these days is ‘stochastic terrorism.’ And there&#8217;s that whole process where people are incited more and more to rage and anger.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Liston also argued in the now-withdrawn paper against using the term “scientific colonialism,” frequently invoked by Cisneros and others, to describe the <em>Ubirajara</em> case.</p>



<p>Cisneros, who was singled out in Liston’s paper along with <a href="https://en.dinolab.com.br/team">Aline Ghilardi</a> of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, also in Brazil, said he and his colleagues were “overthrowing a paradigm.”</p>



<p>“The old generations … think they can work like Indiana Jones, because Indiana Jones never gets a permit to work in another country,” Cisneros told us. “He just goes there and takes very valuable stuff and puts it in a museum in the Global North.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We found our voice on social media,” Cisneros said. “The fact is that we never had a voice. Each time we try to stop them stealing our fossils we are met with silence.”</p>



<p>“The case of the <em>Ubirajara</em> fossil is dividing our field because for the first time, we were able to say what these people have been doing for decades,” Cisneros said. “We <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898">published a study</a> that shows that hundreds of fossils have been acquired without legal justification by European institutions, especially in Germany.”</p>



<p>Cisneros said the now-retracted paper felt “very personal” and included several claims that weren’t referenced and so couldn’t be vetted. He did not complain to the journal about the article himself, he said, but knew others who had, including a professional society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I never read anything like that in my field,” Cisneros said, adding that he believed Liston was trying to push him and Ghilardi “out of academia.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghilardi did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/chicken-size-dino-furlike-mane-stirs-ethics-debate">Controversy</a> has trailed the 110-million-year-old dinosaur since it was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667120303736">first named and described</a> in 2020 by a team that did not include any researchers from Brazil. Many paleontologists – among them Cisneros and Ghilardi – argued the fossil was exported illegally, whereas the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, in Germany, which housed the specimen after purchasing it years earlier, claimed in a Facebook post that the German state of Baden-Württemberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naturkundemuseumkarlsruhe/posts/statement-zu-ubirajarain-den-letzten-stunden-haben-uns-viele-kommentare-zum-foss/4885874288106641/">was its “rightful owner.”</a></p>



<p>The legal and ethical questions swirling around the fossil eventually <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-second-extinction-retraction-deepens-legal-and-ethical-battle-over-rare-dinosaur">triggered a retraction</a> of the 2020 paper, as <em>Science</em> reported in 2021, leaving the species <a href="https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5254.3.10">without a valid scientific name</a>.</p>



<p>Why Liston’s paper, “Crying Ubirajara: Bad faith actors &amp; weaponizing outrage in post-Trump palaeontology,” was also retracted is not entirely clear. According to <a href="https://www.geocurator.org/fulltext/files/GC1464_geocurator_11_7_pp480-495.pdf">the retraction notice</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following a review by the Geological Curators Group Committee, this article was withdrawn online on 27th October 2023, prior to publication in print. The peer review process used in the preparation of this article was found to be in contradiction of the journal&#8217;s policies and guidelines. The author has been invited to resubmit on this topic to a future issue of Geological Curator.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s editor, Duncan Murdock of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, in the UK, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the COPE retraction guidelines (https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines) the article is “retracted” only as the most suitable status for what is actually a short-term situation. The author has been invited to resubmit a version of the article for a future issue of the journal, which is due for publication in the spring (Geological Curator, Volume 11, Number 9).</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Murdock did not answer an email asking what specifically had led to the retraction. However, Liston, who was a guest editor of the special ethics issue in which his paper appeared, said he began receiving emails from the journal about his paper only a few weeks after it was published. The emails had “a note of panic,” according to Liston, and inquired about the identity of the reviewers.</p>



<p>“At that point, I thought, yeah, this feels like it&#8217;s a retraction in search of a pretext,” Liston said. “There seemed to be an external pressure on the organization to retract it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Liston, he selected the two reviewers of his paper himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think [the journal] wanted to say that the process of me suggesting the names of the reviewers and sending it to the reviewers was problematic, although both the chair [of the Geological Curators Group Committee] and the editor had been fully aware that that&#8217;s what was going on in the months leading up to the publication coming back.”</p>



<p>He added: “It only became an issue later on when there was a problem.”</p>



<p>Liston said he believed that although the journal asked him to resubmit his paper, “fundamentally, they&#8217;re not comfortable in publishing it.” He has had interest from other journals, he said, and “if nothing else, I could put it on a preprint server.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was always aware that no matter how far along this might go, at some point it might get pulled,” Liston said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-bar-young-metal-stars">A bar of stars at the center of the Milky Way looks surprisingly young</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biography of our home galaxy may be due for some revisions. That’s because a bar-shaped collection of stars at the center of the Milky Way appears to be much younger than expected.</p>



<p>The bar is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">a prominent feature of our galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 6/25/21</em>). It spans thousands of light-years and links the galaxy’s spiraling arms of stars, making them resemble streams of water coming from a spinning lawn sprinkler. In computer simulations of the Milky Way’s evolution, the bar tends to form early in the galaxy’s roughly 13-billion-year lifetime. But the ages and locations of metal-rich stars suggest <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16993" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bar finished forming just a few billion years ago</a>, researchers report. The study, submitted November 28 to arXiv.org, is in press at <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Letters</em>.</p>





<p>“These metal-rich stars are basically like fossil records of ancient stars that are telling the story of our home galaxy,” says Samir Nepal, an astrophysicist at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany.</p>



<p>Stars with large proportions of metal elements are built from the remnants of stars that have since exploded, ejecting the metals they forged from lighter elements. Those spewed metals enrich the materials in the core of galaxies like the Milky Way, which is why a new generation of metal-rich stars can form only deep inside galaxies. The spinning bar at the center of the Milky Way then scattered some of those stars throughout our galaxy.</p>



<p>Using data from the European Space Agency’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-delivers-trove-data-revealing-secrets-milky-way">Gaia space telescope</a>, Nepal and colleagues reconstructed the development of the Milky Way bar through its influence on the distribution of metal-rich stars (<em>SN: 5/9/18</em>). They inferred the bar’s history, just as you might deduce where the batters stand in a baseball game by looking at the flight of the balls they hit, even if you can’t see home plate.</p>



<p>In tracking the ages of the metal-rich stars, the researchers identified a burst of star formation in the central part of the galaxy that petered out about 3 billion years ago. The downturn seems to mark the end of the Milky Way bar’s developmental phase, the researchers report. After that burst, they say, the inflow of new material into the bar probably dropped off substantially. That suggests the bar we see today is a stable feature that’s about 10 billion years younger than the galaxy as a whole.</p>



<p>The new insights about the metal-rich stars “are like the tip of the iceberg” of data coming from the Gaia telescope, says astrophysicist Cristina Chiappini, also with the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Assuming the revised age estimate of the bar is confirmed, future models of the galaxy’s evolution will have to account for why the bar developed so late.</p>



<p>The study has broader implications than correcting the history of our galaxy, says Ortwin Gerhard, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, who was not involved in the research. “The possibility of detailed observations of the motions and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way, particularly based on [data] from the Gaia satellite,” he says, means we can “expect to learn about the evolution of bars [in other galaxies] generally by studying the bar in the Milky Way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hedgehog-species-short-spikes">A new species of hedgehog stands out for its short spikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Initially mistaken for one of its close relatives, a group of small, spiky mammals in eastern China has now been identified as a new species: the eastern forest hedgehog.</p>



<p>Researchers first scooped up one of these dark spike balls in the province of Anhui in 2018. It looked like a Hugh’s hedgehog (<em>Mesechinus hughi</em>), a species typically found some 1,000 kilometers west. But the rogue hedgehog’s DNA didn’t quite match that of its westward relatives. So scientists collected six more individuals from scrublands and forests around Anhui and the neighboring province of Zhejiang for a closer look.</p>





<p>Comparing the physical appearance and DNA of these hedgehogs with the four known species in the <em>Mesechinus</em> genus confirmed <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/111615/element/8/87441/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the newly found hedgehogs are unique</a>, the team reports November 28 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. Officially named <em>Mesechinus orientalis</em>, the eastern forest hedgehog brings the total number of known hedgehog species to 19.</p>



<p>Kevin Campbell, a biologist at the University of Manitoba in Canada not involved in the work, was not surprised by the debut of a new hedgehog species in China. “It’s a very large landscape, it’s a very varied landscape,” he says. “In the last 10 years or so, there’s been a huge increase in the number of species recognized from that area.”</p>



<p>About as long as a pencil and weighing roughly as much as a can of soda, <em>M. orientalis</em> rivals <em>M. hughi</em> for puniest <em>Mesechinus</em> hedgehog. But <em>M. orientalis</em> is distinguishable from <em>M. hughi</em> by the shapes of a couple of its teeth and its skull near the temple. Eastern forest hedgehogs also boast the shortest spines of any species in the genus. Their black-tipped spines are a mere 1.8 to 2 centimeters long, about a half-centimeter shorter than <em>M. hughi</em>’s spines.</p>



<p>“The mammals of China, especially small mammals, have not been well studied,” says study coauthor Kai He, a mammologist at Guangzhou University in China. </p>



<p>For a long time, <em>Mesechinus</em> hedgehogs were thought to roam only northern China and nearby Mongolia and Russia. That changed in 2018, when scientists realized that a recently discovered group of hedgehogs living on Mount Gaoligong — thousands of kilometers southwest of other species’ stomping grounds — was a new species, <em>M. wangi</em>. </p>



<p>Finding a new <em>Mesechinus</em> species in eastern China has once again greatly expanded the known range of this genus. And taking a census of what small mammals live where, He says, is key to guiding wildlife conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">Why weight-loss drugs became more popular than ever this year</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, celebrity gossip, a national shortage and eyebrow-raising clinical trials made household names of weight-loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.</p>



<p>The buzzy drugs belong to a class of powerful medications that can manage blood sugar levels and drastically reduce body weight — a hot property that kicked them into the mainstream. This spring, even WeightWatchers got on board, acquiring a virtual clinic that offers prescriptions for the popular drugs.</p>



<p>The medications’ ever-expanding reach might explain why many people in the United States are having trouble filling prescriptions. From 2020 to 2022, the number of prescriptions for these drugs quadrupled — up to roughly 9 million in the final months of 2022, according to one analysis. In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration included both Ozempic and Wegovy on its drug shortages list.</p>





<p>And demand may continue to rocket up. Data from clinical trials and other studies suggest these drugs can improve cardiovascular health and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wegovy-ozempic-treat-addiction">perhaps even help treat addiction</a> (<em>SN: 8/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>The FDA approved Ozempic for type 2 diabetes in 2017, and now new, potentially more potent and easier-to-produce versions are in the pipeline, says Susan Yanovski, a physician and nutrition specialist at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Md. “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years now, and I have not seen this degree of excitement.”</p>



<p>It’s the first time doctors have had obesity drugs that work so well, she says, approaching weight-loss levels previously seen only with bariatric surgery. But, Yanovski cautions, “it’s still early days.”</p>



<p>Amid the hubbub, a fresh influx of clinical trial data has opened a Pandora’s box of questions. How exactly do the drugs work? Who should take them? For how long? What’s the full range of side effects? “We’ve got a lot of research to do,” Yanovski says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide belongs to a powerful class of drugs</h4>



<p>Ozempic is the brand name for the drug semaglutide; Wegovy, also semaglutide, has a higher maximum dose and is approved for weight loss. Semaglutide mimics a gut hormone, GLP-1, that’s secreted after people eat. When given a high dose weekly, people without diabetes can <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lose about 15 percent of their body weight</a>, on average, after nearly 16 months. Scientists think the drug acts on the body and the brain, making people feel full and muffling food cravings.</p>



<p>Yet semaglutide may have an even more dramatic action — saving lives, scientists suggested November 11 in Philadelphia at the American Heart Association meeting. Weekly injections of the drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-semaglutide-wegovy-heart-attack-stroke">lowered the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death due to cardiovascular disease</a> in some adults, Cleveland Clinic cardiologist A. Michael Lincoff reported (<em>SN: 11/15/23</em>). The trial targeted people who are overweight or obese who have high cardiovascular risk but not diabetes.</p>



<p>That’s important because it wasn’t clear until now that these patients would see heart benefits, says Tiffany Powell-Wiley, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda. The find “really opens up the number of patients that we can treat with semaglutide,” she says. Powell-Wiley notes, though, that no single drug — even a powerful one — can fix the many factors that lead to the development of obesity.</p>



<p>Still, pharmaceutical companies are racing to investigate new, improved relatives of semaglutide. Some of these drugs mimic multiple gut hormones rather than just one. One such molecule, tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro), mimics both GLP-1 and the gut hormone GIP. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes last year and for treating obesity in November, under the brand name Zepbound. The drug <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36857477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seems to cause even more weight loss than semaglutide</a>, Yanovski says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In demand</h3>



<p>Over the last few years, prescriptions for diabetes and weight-loss drugs  have skyrocketed in the United States. Semaglutide and a drug called liraglutide (approved in 2014) both mimic the gut hormone GLP-1. Semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) was approved to treat type 2 diabetes in December 2017 and for obesity (sold as Wegovy) in June 2021. Tirzepatide, which mimics GLP-1 plus the gut hormone GIP, was approved to treat type 2 diabetes (under the name Mounjaro) in May 2022.</p>

</div>





<p>Another drug in development could one-up even tirzepatide. Retatrutide simulates three gut hormones: GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. People treated with a high dose <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost an average of 24 percent of their body weight</a> after nearly a year of treatment, a small clinical trial reported this year.</p>



<p>The full roster of these drugs, what they do and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/12/new-weight-loss-drug-tracker-novo-nordisk-eli-lilly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where they stand in the approval process</a> makes for a dizzying array of information. But an assortment of options may pay off, Yanovski says. “We really need a variety of drugs … so that we can match the right treatment to the right patient.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">For some people, the benefits of weight-loss drugs outweigh the risks</h4>



<p>But like any medication, Yanovski cautions, these drugs come with side effects. Semaglutide can cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomachache and constipation, among other ailments. Large amounts of rapid weight loss can also spur gallbladder disease, a complication sometimes seen after bariatric surgery. And these medications aren’t melting away only fat. When people rapidly lose lots of weight, they can also lose muscle mass, a particular concern for older patients, Yanovski says.</p>



<p>As these drugs roll out into larger populations of people, rare side effects not seen in clinical trials will also emerge. One recent study found that people using semaglutide or a related drug for weight loss had <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2810542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal conditions</a>, including inflammation of the pancreas and bowel blockages, compared with people using a different type of weight-loss drug.</p>



<p>And patients will probably need to take these medications long term or risk gaining the weight back. “This is not a flaw in the medications; this is how medications work,” Yanovski says. If you stop taking cholesterol-lowering meds, for instance, your cholesterol may shoot up.</p>



<p>But the drugs’ high cost (Wegovy’s list price is about $1,350 per month and insurance coverage varies) puts even short-term use out of reach for many people. The cost can exacerbate health disparities and drive people to hunt for altered versions on the internet. Though these drugs may be cheaper, Yanovski says, they’re not FDA-approved and could be counterfeit.</p>



<p>She hopes to see people with obesity, particularly those with medical complications, gain better access to the approved drugs and in settings where they can be monitored by their doctors to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>



<p>Those without a true need for the drugs probably should avoid them, Yanovski says. They’re “serious medications for a serious disease,” she says. “I think the buzz that these are some kind of miracle cure for obesity, or that you should take these medications just because you want to lose that stubborn 10 pounds, is overhyped.”</p>
