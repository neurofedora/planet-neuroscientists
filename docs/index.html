<p>A microbiologist formerly of Osaka University has lost four papers, with at least one more retraction pending, after an institutional investigation found fabrication and falsification of data in his published research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation found evidence of manipulated results in seven of the papers examined. The university <a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/topics/2025/02/07001">published the notice</a> of its completed inquiry, along with a full report in Japanese, on February 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report did not name the scientists or cite the articles investigated, but it did include a figure or table with altered data from each paper. Three papers retracted in February mentioned an investigation by Osaka University in the notices; Yukihiro Hiramatsu was the first author on all three. Comparing the figures in the report with ones in Hiramatsu’s publications, we identified the seven articles. (<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Osaka-investigation-papers-identified-by-Retraction-Watch-6-Feb-2025.pdf">See the list here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131412"></span>



<p>Three articles have not yet been retracted or corrected, as the university recommended. In response to our request for comment, a representative of Osaka University told us “the authors are currently taking steps to retract or correct” those three papers. A spokesperson for the publisher of the papers told us one retraction was pending and it was still investigating the others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted articles listed Hiramatsu having been working in Osaka’s Research Institute for Microbial Diseases; our email to his university address was not returned and we were unable to find a current affiliation or email for him. The senior author of the articles, <a href="https://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/researchers/detail/4">Yasuhiko Horiguchi</a>, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation report refers to the first and corresponding author of most of the papers, Hiramatsu, as “Dr. A.” According to a machine translation of the report, he admitted to most of the research misconduct the investigation identified. “Dr. A” also acknowledged in interviews he was aware his actions constituted misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. A” told the investigators he committed research misconduct because he wanted to produce favorable data to help him publish papers in higher-quality journals to aid in seeking his next position, according to the report. The report also stated “Dr. A.” said he wanted to spend his time on other, more interesting experiments than those required for publications, and had limited opportunity to do so due to writing papers and grant applications. </p>



<p>Horiguchi, called “Dr. B” in the report, did not ask to see “Dr. A’s” raw data or notebooks, and “Dr. A” did not think such records were always necessary, according to the report. </p>



<p>If the laboratory had a system for checking raw data and notebooks, the misconduct could have been caught sooner, the report concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Hiramatsu’s first <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv4615">retraction</a> came on January 1, for a paper in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8971"><em>Science Advances</em></a> originally published in 2022. It has been cited five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice did not mention Osaka University’s investigation. It stated “an author discovered” eight figures in the article plus three supplementary figures “did not have adequate supporting data.” The authors requested the retraction and all agreed to it, according to the notice.</p>



<p><em>mBio</em> and <em>mSphere</em>, titles of the American Society for Microbiology, published similar <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.01072-24">retraction</a> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.03921-24">notices</a> for two of Hiramatsu’s papers on February 5. The senior and corresponding author’s laboratory conducted an investigation and found data shown in the articles’ figures “are the results of fabricated experiments or extensive falsification,” the notices stated. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<p>An official investigation is ongoing at Osaka University, and certain results will require further verification by re-experimentation. Therefore, we are retracting the article and regret any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>



<p>The m<em>Sphere</em> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00819-21">article</a> appeared in October 2021 and has been cited eight times. The <em>mBio</em> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03197-21">paper</a> appeared in March 2022 and has been cited 12 times, 10 of which were after a <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01446-22">May 2022 correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth retracted <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308260120">paper</a> appeared in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> in September 2023 and has been cited twice. The retraction <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501149122">notice</a>, dated February 11 and signed by all authors except Hiramatsu, stated they were retracting the article because an investigation by Osaka University “has concluded that the majority of this article’s reported results are unreliable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remaining three articles in which the university found manipulated results were all published in <em>Microbiology and Immunology</em>, a Wiley title, and have yet to be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher had decided to retract <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12791">one of the papers</a>, published in March 2020 and cited six times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley’s investigation into the other <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12742">two</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12799">papers</a> continues, according to a spokesperson. While the report called for withdrawing the other papers, it recommended correcting these two articles, which have been cited two and three times, respectively.</p>

                A study of nearly 38,000 adults shows that the number of kids correlates with coordination of brain regions’ activities — regardless of parents’ sex.

<p>To paraphrase one of my former college professors, this post should&#8217;ve been called &#8220;differential equations&#8221;, but then none of you would&#8217;ve clicked on it. I do hope that I didn&#8217;t mention that term too early though and scared you all away. After all, you made the effort of opening this page, so why not read on for 30 more seconds?</p>



<p>I know, scary stuff. But I promise this won&#8217;t be one of those super-abstract, incomprehensible tutorials that assumes you already know the stuff that you&#8217;re here to learn. We&#8217;re going to start from some very basic notions and from truly simple examples. If you&#8217;re a physicist or a mathematician or basically anyone who has a formal education in this topic, you might wanna skip towards the end though. Otherwise you might find yourself screaming at the computer: &#8220;NO! NO! Absolutely not! It&#8217;s not a squiggly math formula, it&#8217;s an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives! <strong><em>Everybody</em></strong> knows that!&#8221; I do get your frustration, but some people need to start from somewhere else to get to where you already are.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a differential equation? Well, it&#8217;s a squiggly math formula that lets us describe a whole lot of things. Today we care about things changing over time. In the case of our virtual neuron, that would be the evolution of its membrane potential over time. But simulating that requires us to understand some basics, so we&#8217;ll start with something simpler. Much simpler.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re watching a cat that&#8217;s moving around. And because we have literally nothing better to do in this imaginary world, we want to describe the distance that the cat is covering over a period of 30 seconds. At the beginning of this silly &#8220;experiment&#8221;, that is, at time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" />, the distance covered is 0 centimeters, because the cat is just chilling for now.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">But as it notices that we&#8217;re staring, it presumably gets a bit creeped out, so it starts to slowly inch away from us. That&#8217;s great news, because now we can proceed with our observations: we see that after one second (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 1" class="latex" />), the cat has moved 1 centimeter (we will denote that as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 1" class="latex" />), after 2 seconds &#8211; 2 centimeters, and so on, until, after 30 seconds, it went 30 centimeters away from us. We can visualize that below.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In formal math, we would write that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+1%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;begin{aligned} &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 1&#92;end{aligned}" class="latex" />. Why? It&#8217;s because for every unit of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> (for every second in this case), there is an increase in the distance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> of 1 (centimeter). In other words, the change in distance (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3Ddx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="=dx" class="latex" />) per unit change in time (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3Ddt&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="=dt" class="latex" />) is always 1. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt}" class="latex" /> is also called the <em>rate of change of x</em>.</p>



<p>While we wrapped our heads around that, the cat got even more weirded out and now it&#8217;s actively trying to outrun us, so it&#8217;s actually picking up speed the longer we look at it. Since, like I mentioned, we&#8217;re really bored, this is even more interesting, so we begin a new observation period. This time, the cat starts again at 0, but after 1 second, it&#8217;s 1 centimeter away, after 2 seconds &#8211; 4 centimeters, after 3 seconds &#8211; 9 centimeters, and so on, until, at the end of our standard 30 seconds, it&#8217;s a full 900 centimeters away!</p>

<p>Again, in math, the pattern we observed above could be written as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+t%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = t^2" class="latex" />, and the corresponding differential equation would be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+2t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 2t" class="latex" />. Now, maybe you&#8217;re wondering how you&#8217;re supposed to guess what the differential equations of functions are. Well, for now, you aren&#8217;t. For the more basic functions, you can find tables online. You can also use WolframAlpha in a lot of cases. And with time, you might pick up other tricks.</p>

<p>Coming back to the cat, the poor thing seems to have realized there&#8217;s no escape from this imaginary hell, so now it&#8217;s just pacing up and down the room, in a sort of oscillating pattern.</p>

<p>In this case, we&#8217;re no longer looking at the distance covered within a given timeframe, but at the position of the cat in the room (which we&#8217;re still calling <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />). Watching this GIF is quite cute, no? Well, brace yourself, because I&#8217;m about to hit you with the math-speak describing this: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cmu+%5Ccdot+%281+-+x%28t%29%5E2%29+%5Ccdot+x%28t%29+-+%5Comega+%5Ccdot+x%28t%29+%2B+A+%5Ccdot+sin%28%5Cnu+t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = &#92;mu &#92;cdot (1 - x(t)^2) &#92;cdot x(t) - &#92;omega &#92;cdot x(t) + A &#92;cdot sin(&#92;nu t)" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>At this point, I assume that you might be asking yourself some of the same questions I did when I first started learning these things, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

BUT WHO IS <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />??</li>



<li>I just want to get my computer to show me this graph, how am I supposed to go from elvish to code?</li>
</ul>



<p>I get it. Honestly, just breathe. If you wanna shed a few tears or snap a pen, that&#8217;s also ok. After that, bear with me. We will answer all of these one by one, so we will need to dwell in uncertainty for a bit longer. Let&#8217;s start with the easiest part: where did the equation come from? Well… from the internet. And no, you don&#8217;t need to come up with them yourself (at least not yet). As you learn more about the topic, you will see that there are established models for neurons, brain areas, even the whole brain. Of course, if you wanna be hardcore, you might eventually come up with your own model or at least tweak an existing one. But we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p>



<p>Alright, but who are the Greek letters? And for some reason <em>A</em>? I know you&#8217;re going to dislike this, but they are pretty much whomever we want them to be. &#8220;But how do we choose???&#8221;, you&#8217;re probably wondering, crushed under the weight of responsibility. Well, I already picked out some values that look nice, but truth be told, if that weren&#8217;t the case, you&#8217;d have absolutely no idea what would be good values. So you&#8217;d just have to try out a bunch of them, until you found something appropriate. In fact, I encourage you to do so anyway. It&#8217;s at this point that I&#8217;ll share a secret with you: all the Python code for generating the figures in this article can be found <a href="https://codeberg.org/neuronerd/VirtualNeuron">here</a>. And it&#8217;s written in a beginner-friendly way, so hopefully everyone can follow along.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note here that in your journey towards building virtual neurons, brains, or what-have-you, you will often come across such <em>parameters</em>. In some cases, you will know what values to assign to them based on experimental measures or on other people&#8217;s work or on intuition. More commonly, you will have to resort to good ol&#8217; guessing (there are ways to do so automatically and systematically, without having to change each value manually, look at a plot, try another one etc, but that&#8217;s a story for another time).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="solving-equations-alright-the-spiciest-problem-remains-how-do-begin-to-solve-this-beast-how-do-we-go-from-the-mathy-stuff-to-the-pretty-stuff-i-have-to-mention-here-that-some-differential-equations-have-what-s-called-analytical-solutions-that-means-that-you-grab-a-pen-and-a-piece-of-paper-and-you-somehow-solve-the-equation-basically-as-if-you-were-solving-latex-x-2-4-s-1-for-instance-the-first-two-examples-above-can-be-easily-solved-analytically-but-as-equations-become-more-complex-analytical-solutions-are-more-difficult-or-even-impossible-to-obtain-in-that-case-we-need-to-employ-what-s-called-numerical-solutions-here-s-how"><strong>Practical solution to the cat equation</strong></h2>



<p>Alright, the spiciest problem remains: how do begin to solve this beast? How do we go from the mathy stuff to the pretty stuff? I have to mention here that some differential equations have what&#8217;s called analytical solutions &#8211; that means that you grab a pen and a piece of paper and you (somehow) solve the equation, basically as if you were solving <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+2+%3D+4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + 2 = 4" class="latex" />. For instance, the first two examples above can be easily solved analytically. But as equations become more complex, analytical solutions are more difficult, or even impossible to obtain. In that case, we need to employ what&#8217;s called <em>numerical</em> solutions. Here&#8217;s how.</p>



<p>First of all, let&#8217;s be clear on what our objective is: we want to find the values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> for a range of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />. As you saw above, in our &#8220;experiments&#8221;, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> starts from 0. In order to be able to numerically solve our equation, we need to know what value <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> has at time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" /> (this is our <em>initial starting condition</em>). How do we know? Again, we guess. Here as well, we can play around with this. You&#8217;ll notice that, depending on the equation, different guesses might lead to different results. There is a mathematical reason for that, which is a topic in itself, but just to give you a bit of intuition: imagine a hill surrounded by a valley on the right and a lake on the left. If you place a ball on top of the hill (your initial starting condition), one of three things will happen: it will stay there if you place it exactly in the centre, roll towards the valley if you place it slightly towards the right, and roll towards the lake if you place it towards the left. The places where the ball stops moving are called <em>fixed points</em> and their number can be different from 3 depending on the system we&#8217;re studying.</p>



<p>But coming back to our numerical solution. We now have a value for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(0)" class="latex" />. In our latest cat example, let&#8217;s say we set <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29+%3D+0.5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0) = 0.5" class="latex" />. To find all other values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />, we use an iterative approach. Because we know <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />, we can now calculate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dx%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="dx(0)" class="latex" /> by simply plugging its value, 0.5, into the differential equation from above (of course, together with the values we set for our parameters <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;omega" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />, and A): <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dx%280%29+%3D+3+%5Ccdot+%281+-+0.5%5E2%29+%5Ccdot+0.5+-+0.2+%5Ccdot+0.5+%2B+1.5+%5Ccdot+sin%282+%5Ccdot0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="dx(0) = 3 &#92;cdot (1 - 0.5^2) &#92;cdot 0.5 - 0.2 &#92;cdot 0.5 + 1.5 &#92;cdot sin(2 &#92;cdot0)" class="latex" />, which is approximately 1.03.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a step back. We said in the very beginning that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt}" class="latex" /> is the rate of change, how much <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> changes from one time point to another. If we know that the cat was at position 25 at time point <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 5" class="latex" /> and at position 16 at time point <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 4" class="latex" />, then the rate of change is how much the cat changed position (25 &#8211; 16) divided by the amount of time in which it changed its position (in this case, 5 &#8211; 4) or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%284%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%285%29+-+x%284%29%7D%7Bt+%3D+5+-+t+%3D+4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(4)}{dt} = &#92;frac{x(5) - x(4)}{t = 5 - t = 4}" class="latex" />. Because we are always increasing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> by the same amount of time, we can call that amount of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" />. In a more general form, we can then rewrite the equation from before as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t+%2B+%5CDelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29%7D%7Bt+%2B+%5CDelta+t+-+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = &#92;frac{x(t + &#92;Delta t) - x(t)}{t + &#92;Delta t - t}" class="latex" />. And from there, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t+%2B+%5CDelta+t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t + &#92;Delta t)" class="latex" /> becomes <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%28t%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(t) + &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} &#92;cdot &#92;Delta t" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>With this is hand, we just need to pick a <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" /> and then we can find <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> for any value of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />, assuming we know (or guess) <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />. As a rule of thumb, we want to pick <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" /> as small as possible (you can imagine that if we were to look at the cat now and then 10 minutes later, it would probably be very far away from where it started, but if we looked after only 0.1 milliseconds, there would hardly be any change). For the example above, we set <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t+%3D+0.001&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t = 0.001" class="latex" />. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%281%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(1)" class="latex" /> is then equal to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%280%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%280%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+t+%3D+0.5+%2B+1.03+%5Ccdot+0.001+%3D+0.50103&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(0) + &#92;frac{dx(0)}{dt} &#92;cdot &#92;Delta t = 0.5 + 1.03 &#92;cdot 0.001 = 0.50103" class="latex" />. Hardly any change, right? But repeating the same process for many steps (10.000 steps, to be more exact) gives us the graph above. In practice, how many steps you want to simulate depends both on what you&#8217;re interested in observing and on what your computer can handle.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="606" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station-1024x606.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131396" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station-300x178.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station-768x454.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station-1536x909.jpg 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/05-station.jpg 1947w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A prisoner and guard in the Stanford Prison Experiment. |<em> PrisonExp.org</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Philip G. Zimbardo passed away in October 2024 at age 91. He enjoyed an illustrious career at Stanford University, where he taught for 50 years. He accrued a long list of accolades, but his singular and enduring contribution to scholarship was the Stanford Prison Experiment, a simulation carried out in the university’s psychology department in August 1971. The research project became the best-known psychological analysis of institutionalization at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study has always been treated with skepticism by penologists and psychologists, and recent scholarship by social scientist Thibault Le Texier has raised fundamental questions about the scientific validity of the investigation, the originality of the research design, the unethical treatment of the subjects, and the credibility of the reported results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many consider Zimbardo&#8217;s SPE to be one of the classic studies of experimental psychology in the post-war period. It continues to be reported as a landmark achievement in many psychological textbooks today, despite drawing decades of criticism both in and out of the scientific literature. But considering Le Texier&#8217;s findings, should Zimbardo&#8217;s work be retracted?</p>



<span id="more-131390"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">For the prison simulation, Zimbardo recruited 24 college-aged men and randomly assigned half to the role of guards and half to the role of inmates. “Inmates” were housed in mock &#8220;cells&#8221; in the basement of the psychology department, and “guards” worked three at a time over three eight-hour shifts. Everyone was paid $15 per day. A camera was installed surreptitiously in the main hallway of the &#8220;prison&#8221; to film the interactions.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/09-advertisement-crop.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="792" height="886" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/09-advertisement-crop.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131402" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/09-advertisement-crop.jpg 792w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/09-advertisement-crop-268x300.jpg 268w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/09-advertisement-crop-768x859.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Advertisement for the experiment |<em> PrisonExp.org</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The inmates were picked up at their homes by a member of the Palo Alto Police, &#8220;charged&#8221; with a serious felony and driven blindfolded to the mock prison, where they traded their clothing for a prison gown that included an identification number on the chest and back. The inmates wore nylon stockings on their heads to symbolize being shaved. Zimbardo played the role of prison director, a senior undergraduate student played the role of warden, and two doctoral students were cast as psychological counselors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants began to exhibit pathological behaviors almost immediately. According to the videotapes, the guards showed signs of dominance and brutality, and the inmates exhibited signs of depression and defiance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This interpretation was based on the proposition that the primary determinants of social behavior are situational: Personal autonomy was assumed to be overshadowed by situational roles. What started as mocking antagonism — play-acting — degenerated into degradation and abuse on the one side, and depression and rebellion on the other. According to the conventional interpretation, an experimental simulation increasingly came to approximate the real thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2014 Le Texier started researching the SPE, initially planning to make a documentary film for French media. He delved into the archives of the experiment, including the documents, videos, and interviews Zimbardo had cataloged and archived in the Stanford Library.&nbsp; Le Texier later interviewed about half of the original participants by phone to reconstruct what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He realized how flawed the conventional interpretation was, and ended up writing a book on it, originally published in French in 2018 and translated into English in 2024. &#8220;My enthusiasm gave way to skepticism, then my skepticism to indignation, as I discovered the underside of the experiment and the evidence of its manipulation,&#8221; Le Texier wrote in the introduction of <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-49292-1"><em>Investigating the Stanford Prison Experiment: History of a Lie</em></a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Four main themes come to light in Le Texier’s book that undermine the credibility of the SPE.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. The scientific credentials of the study</h3>



<p>As Le Texier points out, Zimbardo had no expertise in criminology. His doctoral training was behavioristic and his subjects were lab rats. His interests at Stanford changed to questions of deindividuation of people in mass society. Consequently, the SPE began as a kind of observational study, not of a real prison but a drama enacted by subjects pretending to be guards and inmates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Saturday before the experiment started, the guards were briefed about how they were expected to behave. The message: essentially to make the lives of the inmates miserable. Zimbardo equipped them with riot batons borrowed from the Palo Alto police department, without training the recruits to use the weapons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the following days, several guards were reprimanded by the experimenter&#8217;s assistant for not displaying sufficient dominance to make the situation realistic. The apparent spontaneity of the pathological behavior captured on film was due in part to coaching. On Monday, their first full day together, the inmates planned a prison break to defy authority. This action suggests the subjects also drew from their own background knowledge of prison experience portrayed in popular media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Le Texier argues the SPE was not a scientific experiment at all, but a demonstration created to depict the evils of incarceration based on the supposition that institutions can make normal people act in pathological ways. Although Zimbardo&#8217;s results were not reported in peer-reviewed journals until 1973, he communicated his &#8220;findings&#8221; by press release <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/kn089qv2813">at the end of Monday</a>, the first full day of the experiment. The experiment started to attract press coverage by the following Thursday.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="606" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines-1024x606.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131399" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines-300x178.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines-768x454.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines-1536x909.jpg 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/70-headlines.jpg 1947w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prison breaks following the SPE |<em> PrisonExp.org</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A bloody attempted prison break at San Quentin State Prison the day after the experiment ended was followed within weeks by a major prison riot at Attica Correctional Facility. In the shadow of these events, Zimbardo&#8217;s findings skyrocketed to national prominence as the SPE was invoked as context to this violence. Within a month, Zimbardo found himself speaking as an expert to a congressional subcommittee on criminal justice policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SPE became a <em>cause célèbre</em> before it underwent peer review. Interest in the findings revived in 2004 following reports of inmate abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison. According to Le Texier, despite the publicity it attracted, the SPE was never a credible scientific experiment. The research lacked a defined theory and a priori hypotheses, did not use any validated sociometric instruments to measure behavioral differences, had no tests of significance, and did not include a control group.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The originality of the SPE design&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The official history of the SPE is recorded in <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe/feature/slideshow">a large slideshow</a>, which Le Texier employed as one of the main sources for his research. Zimbardo also produced a <a href="https://archive.org/details/cst_000035">19-minute video</a> for circulation.</p>



<p>One of the items Le Texier discovered in the archive was <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/cj735mr4214">a term paper by David Jaffe</a>, a senior undergraduate in a seminar Zimbardo offered in the spring of 1971 – several months before the launch of the SPE. Jaffe and two classmates had created a prison simulation in their dormitory at Toyon Hall as a course assignment. They scripted a typical daily schedule for the inmates as well as a list of prison rules. The objective of the simulation was to mimic the effects of real prison by trying to create feelings in the &#8220;prisoners&#8221; of the loss of freedom, total dependency on the guards and feelings of worthlessness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his various reports Zimbardo insists the routines and rules in the SPE were improvised spontaneously by the guards. However, when Le Texier compared the rules and schedules in Jaffe&#8217;s term paper with those allegedly concocted by the SPE guards, he found them to be&nbsp; virtually identical. Jaffe was also employed in the SPE as the &#8220;head guard.&#8221; However, his role in designing Zimbardo&#8217;s experiment is rarely credited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead of acknowledging the foundational importance of the Toyon Hall experiment, Zimbardo completely obscured it for 40 years,” Le Texier wrote. “He does not mention it in the slideshow he used for 20 years to present the experiment, nor in the documentary <em>Quiet Rage</em> that succeeded it in 1992.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Ethical Issues in the treatment of subjects&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In the protocol submitted to the Stanford Human Subjects Research Review Committee, Zimbardo indicated subjects would only be released prematurely for &#8220;emergency reasons&#8221; and would be &#8220;discouraged from quitting.&#8221; However, the committee appears to have mandated that if anyone wanted to quit, &#8220;they would be released; no explanation needed.&#8221; In fact, the experimenters did <em>not</em> release inmates when several individuals expressed a desire to quit. They were told voluntary departure was not an option and they would have to apply to the parole board. Consequently, the loss of freedom was not simulated.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="606" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_-1024x606.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131403" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_-300x178.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_-768x454.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_-1536x909.jpg 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/62-bags.over_.heads_.jpg 1947w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prisoners await a parole hearing with bags over their heads |<em> PrisonExp.org</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The loss of privacy was not simulated either. The prison gown was worn without underwear, so when the guards forced inmates to play &#8220;leapfrog&#8221; their genitals were exposed. The inmates were denied access to showers and deprived of access to the toilets at night and had to use a bucket as a commode in their cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Questionable treatment raises ethical issues as well. Guards interrupted inmates’ sleep with blasting whistles, and called the inmates out of their rooms for meaningless head counts in the middle of the night. They handcuffed and blindfolded inmates to march them to the toilets. When a guard assaulted rebellious inmates by spraying them with a fire extinguisher, or struck them with a riot baton, neither act was simulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the search for verisimilitude in a role-playing environment, Zimbardo exposed his subjects to a series of ethically dubious conditions and was reckless in his gamble that no one would get seriously offended, injured or sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. The credibility of the results&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The six days of interaction between the inmates, the guards and the experimenters created emotionally provocative moments even if the participants knew, at least initially, the &#8220;prison&#8221; was a pretense, everyone was more or less acting, and they were being paid as subjects in an experiment. As Le Texier reported: &#8220;His experiment had effects on all of its participants, inducing stress, tension, aggression, indifference, resignation, or even apathy.&#8221; By analogy, audiences sometimes weep at the theater even when they know the play is fiction. But to what extent were the significant changes observed by Zimbardo cases of deliberate play acting?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zimbardo reported five inmates experienced &#8220;nervous breakdowns&#8221; over six days and were released. However, post hoc debriefings suggest at least one of these subjects said he faked emotional trauma by screaming, crying, threatening suicide and acting out physically to trigger a &#8220;medical emergency&#8221; &#8212; after being told he could not leave. According to Le Texier, what that suggests is that &#8220;Zimbardo strongly encouraged the prisoners who wanted to leave the experiment to simulate a nervous breakdown.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the guards&#8217; side, one of the subjects who adopted a tough guard persona and was most aggressive toward the inmates adopted a fake Texas accent and admitted his facade was an act played for the camera. In fact, he was a drama major.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Should the SPE be retracted?</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">At some point, when the credibility of a classic study has received so much critique, official retraction, while desirable, becomes redundant. What Le Texier added to the record is not only the dubious value of Zimbardo&#8217;s findings but his virtually unacknowledged appropriation of the ideas of his students and his exploitation of mass media to promote his ideas in advance of peer review. If we&nbsp;were&nbsp;seriously talking about retracting the SPE, what exactly would be retracted?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first refereed paper, “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-32677-001">Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison</a>,” appeared in the <em>International Journal of Criminology and Penology</em> in 1973. By that time, the popular press had papered the walls with the news of the study<em>.</em> Le Texier identified a dozen newspaper reports in the weeks following its termination including <em>Life,</em> <em>The Daily Mail </em>and <em>The Washington Post</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SPE provided context in news reports of the lethal breakout at San Quentin the day after the experiment ended and the bloodbath following the riot at Attica three weeks later. Another wave of newspaper stories in October and November covered Zimbardo&#8217;s congressional testimony. In 1972 Zimbardo submitted a short report to <em>Society, </em>a popular sociology magazine, called “Pathology of imprisonment.” And recounted the experiment in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> in April 1973 in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/08/archives/a-pirandellian-prison-the-mind-is-a-formidable-jailer.html">The mind is a formidable jailer: a Pirandellian prison</a>.”</p>



<p>By the time the study was reported in the <em>International Journal of Criminology and Penology, </em>it was common knowledge. The <em>IJCP</em> ended publication in 1978. It was superseded by the <em>International Journal of the Sociology of Law</em> (1979-2007) which was itself superseded by <em>the International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice</em>. Consequently, a retraction in the <em>IJCP</em> is not even possible. If Le Texier&#8217;s findings are credible, arguably the best outcome we can expect is more responsible reporting in contemporary textbooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agitating snakes isn’t something most of us would do on purpose, but for a group of researchers, it was central to their research. The authors of a May 2024 paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> achieved that by “softly” stepping on the head, tail and mid-body of newborn, juvenile and adult pit vipers to see how often they would bite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the technique wasn’t quite what the authors’ ethics committee had in mind when approving the study. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88686-x">journal retracted the paper</a> last month, noting the ethics approval the authors received “did not include newborn snakes or the use of the ‘soft stepping’ method.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lead author <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7733-4349">João Miguel Alves-Nunes</a> blamed the retraction on a “communication error” by the ethics committee. The researchers believed they had approval both to step on snakes and to include newborn snakes, Alves-Nunes, a former researcher at the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, said in an email to Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131374"></span>



<p>Two methods were initially approved by the ethics committee, Alves-Nunes said. One “involved touching and pressing the snake’s body against the ground using a metal herpetological hook.” The second consisted of researchers approaching the snakes with a booted foot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers “noticed that the metal hook could injure the snakes’ mouths,” so rather than using the hook to press down on the snake, they lightly stepped on the animals instead, Alves-Nunes said. The boot had a foam reinforcement to protect the snakes, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alves-Nunes said the researchers “did not even consider that this modification required an additional approval request, as this method was essentially a combination of the two already approved methods.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/researcher-steps-deadly-vipers-40-000-times-better-predict-snakebites">Q&amp;A with Alves-Nunes</a> in <em>Science,</em> he stepped on 116 snakes 30 times each, totaling over 40,000 steps. In tests with a different type of snake, the bite pierced his boot. That’s when he learned he is allergic to snake venom and antivenom.</p>



<p>Mid-study, the researchers began questioning how hatchlings would react to this method. They submitted a second request to the ethics committee asking permission to include these newborn snakes in the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee first rejected this proposal because of Alves-Nunes’ allergy to the snake venom caused by “a history of ophidic accidents,” or snake bites, according to the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/REQUISICAO-CEUAIB-Retrataction.pdf">rebuttal of the retraction</a>, provided to Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Once researchers replaced Alves-Nunes with coauthor Adriano Fellone as the “executor” of the experiment, the “Ethics Committee of the Butantan Institute responded with a single word: ‘APPROVED,’” Alves-Nunes said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the retraction, the researchers realized the approval response applied only to Alves-Nunes’ removal from the study, not the use of hatchlings, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Butantan Institute told us the animal ethics committee was unavailable for comment because of a national holiday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers raised ethical concerns about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59416-6">the study</a> shortly after its publication<em>,</em> Rafal Marszalek, the journal’s chief editor, told us. The paper has been cited six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All authors disagreed with the retraction, the notice states. Alves-Nunes called the decision to retract “disproportionate. The mistake made was bureaucratic, not scientific fraud, plagiarism, or experimental error.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ response to the retraction, signed by senior author Otavio Marques of the Ecology and Evolution Laboratory at the Butantan Institute, noted the researchers “emphasize that ethical conduct regarding live animal experimentation—avoiding excessive suffering and minimizing discomfort and the number of specimens used—was upheld.”</p>



<p>After our story published, we heard from the communications office at the Butantan Institute, who told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Institute does not believe that the violation of the methods approved by CEUAIB [the Butantan Institute Animal Use Ethics Committee] was intentional and clarifies that, at this time, there is no ongoing institutional process aimed at penalizing those involved.</p>
</blockquote>
