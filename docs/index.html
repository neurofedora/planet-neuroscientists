<p>An international computing society has begun retracting conference papers for “citation falsification” only months after the sleuth who flagged the suspect articles was convicted for defamation in a lawsuit filed by one of the offending authors.</p>



<p>So far, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has pulled at least 27 of the papers, but dozens more remain, according to Solal Pirelli, a software engineer in Lausanne, Switzerland, who raised concerns about the articles more than two years ago. Some of the proceedings allegedly include <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LSaWNpyHz7rTy-St5qn0fJ5ioBPZbpuckpcgdotm6sc/edit?gid=0#gid=0">plagiarized works</a>, while<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zui-mmVs_7NbDS-yTe1dtorQCAZ7YNjPaOoZ25q7BwE/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> others are plagued by citation stuffing</a>.</p>



<p>The retraction notices from September 10 state:</p>



<span id="more-133347"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors have violated the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification by engaging in citation falsification by co-authoring works containing an extremely large percentage of unnecessary self-citations, including citations that were not used as references in the work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“It&#8217;s good that ACM is beginning to clean up their scientific library,” Pirelli told us. “However, they have more work to do, especially if they ever plan on aligning with the industry standard” guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“As it stands, it takes ACM more time to deal with problematic proceedings than it does for someone to organize a yearly edition of a conference with them, which is obviously not sustainable,” he added.</p>



<p>The society would not answer specific questions about the dubious conference proceedings. But Scott Delman, ACM’s director of publications, agreed “investigations take far too long to conduct” and said it was a “high priority” for the group to devote more resources to investigations.</p>



<p>Pirelli first<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/30E8D340A91FA7A4AAEDF0AF4EF3B2#0"> reported</a> the plagiarized conference papers to ACM in October 2022. He later flagged several more conference proceedings that contained exorbitant numbers of citations to the benefit of one or two of the conference chairs. Pirelli wrote about his findings in<a href="https://solalpirelli.github.io/2023/01/25/troubling-acm-venues.html"> a blog post</a> in January 2023 after ACM failed to respond to his concerns.</p>



<p>Half a year later, one of the conference chairs, <a href="https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/default.aspx?email=saaljawarneh">Shadi Aljawarneh</a>, a computer scientist at the Jordan University of Science and Technology in Irbid,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/29/professor-in-jordan-sues-sleuth-who-exposed-citation-anomalies/"> sued Pirelli for defamation</a>, as we reported in November 2023.</p>



<p>“This guy is suing me because … I uncovered his whole … scam association that was organizing a bunch of conferences that may or may not have even happened,” Pirelli told us at the time. “One of them was supposedly in Kazakhstan in a time when Kazakhstan was closed due to COVID.”</p>



<p>In June of this year, <a href="https://www.24heures.ch/lausanne-ancien-doctorant-de-lepfl-condamne-pour-diffamation-547478088416">the court found</a> for Aljawarneh. Pirelli is appealing the verdict and declined to comment on the case, but said the retractions confirm he “was right to report these papers.”</p>



<p>The reference lists of most of<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zui-mmVs_7NbDS-yTe1dtorQCAZ7YNjPaOoZ25q7BwE/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> the suspect papers</a> are dominated by works by Aljawarneh, who was among the chairs of all of the conferences, and his frequent coauthor<a href="https://vnrvjiet.irins.org/profile/93237"> Vangipuram Radhakrishna</a>, a computer scientist at Vallurupalli Nageswara Rao Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology in Hyderabad, India. Radhakrishna chaired one of the conferences along with Aljawarneh and others.</p>



<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3330431.3330458">One of the retracted papers</a>, for instance, lists 31 articles by Aljawarneh and 51 by Radhakrishna, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/57BB3F8859A0F5BE6FBC4DB70F2E8E">none of which are cited in the paper itself</a>. Neither researcher replied to requests for comment.</p>



<p>”While we have seen a steady rise in cases over the years &#8230; the good news is that the total number and percentage of published papers that have been compromised by bad actors remains relatively small,” Delman said. “Most misconduct is identified prior to the publication stage, so in general the system is working as intended.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the questionable papers Pirelli identified have yet to be retracted, including one containing<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/150E1C56DA17AD1E79059FCD903510"> a user manual</a> for a university IT system. The same is true of the allegedly plagiarized<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/2980258"> proceedings</a> that Pirelli reported to ACM in 2022, although they received an expression of concern.</p>



<p>Delman would not comment on “any additional penalties that may be imposed on specific bad actors” but referred us to the group’s<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations"> policies</a> for such punishment, which include temporary publishing bans.</p>



<p>”Some of the public criticism we have received on sites like PubPeer is fair and some of it is not,” Delman said. “I do agree that investigations take far too long to conduct, and it is a high priority for ACM to address this by devoting more resources to investigations and the decision-making and appeals processes over the coming months to reduce the time it takes to post Expressions of Concern and Retraction Notices to warn the community of integrity issues related to published articles. We are also considering updates to some of our policies and procedures to accelerate and streamline decision-making, while ensuring due process for respondents to allegations.”</p>

                Training in computational neuroscience, data science and statistics will need to expand, say many of the scientists we surveyed. But that must be balanced with a more traditional grounding in the scientific method and critical thinking. Researchers noted that funding concerns will also affect training, especially for people from underrepresented groups.

                Funding for neuroscience-related projects more than doubled in 16 years, rising from $4.2 billion in 2008 to $10.5 billion in 2024, according to an analysis by <em>The Transmitter</em>. That money went largely to private universities in coastal states.

                Interactions between academic neuroscience and industry will grow, and the neurotech sector will expand, most survey respondents predict. The current funding upheaval in the United States may accelerate this trend as the field searches for new funding models.

Research data also shows study subjects' "mystical experience" scores – measured via self-reporting – increased significantly in a group of 20 individuals within the seven-day event.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OK then. Well... My take is different. I suggest some of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence,&nbsp;based on procedural and analytic flaws that occur throughout the manuscript and supplementary materials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Claim 1. Enhanced Neuroplasticity (greater neurite outgrowth)</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“Participants’ anecdotal reports consistently emphasize radical psychological breakthroughs, and previous meditation studies have reported increased BDNF levels consistent with enhanced neuroplasticity. To investigate whether the intervention affected circulating plasma factors conducive to neuroplasticity, we treated cultured glutamatergic PC12 neuroendocrine cells with NGF (nerve growth factor) and 1% pre- and post-intervention plasma and quantiﬁed neurite outgrowth length.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Result 1. PC12 cells treated with plasma from all 20 participants</b></p><p>PC12 cells are <i>not</i> primarily glutaminergic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC12_cell_line" target="_blank">PC12</a> is a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma (tumor) of the rat adrenal gland. The cells <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.1016559/full">synthesize, store, and release catecholamines</a>. PC12 cells can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells. When treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor" target="_blank">NGF</a>, they extend neurite-like processes. Subsequent treatment with a variety of agents can elucidate specific cellular mechanisms.</p><p>Here, a problematic choice was that plasma from all 20 participants was combined into one soup, which eliminated individual variation and prevented mechanistic insights. Further, p<span lang="EN">lasma samples from novice and advanced meditators (who showed different molecular
profiles in other analyses) were pooled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p><b>Claim 2. Metabolic Reprogramming (shift toward glycolytic metabolism)</b><p></p><blockquote>“Previous studies have characterized meditation as a hypometabolic state and reported enhanced glycolysis in Tibetan Buddhist monks. To test the intervention’s effect on real-time metabolism, we treated BE(2)M17 human neuroblastoma cells with 1% plasma from all participants for 60 min and performed Seahorse XF assays.”</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>Result 2A. Pooled Plasma (loss of individual metabolic signatures)</b><p>Once again, the&nbsp;<span lang="EN">claim of&nbsp;</span>“<span lang="EN">significant</span>”<span lang="EN">&nbsp;changes
in glycolysis is based on comparing two pooled samples (basically n=1 vs. n=1). We can't determine
which plasma components (or which individual participants) drove the metabolic changes.</span></p><b>Result 2B. Preselected Proteins (Fig. 4E, glycolysis proteomics heat map)</b><p>The authors didn't explain their criteria for choosing&nbsp;19 proteins involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (out of hundreds). Was the selection biased in some way? Were important proteins missing?</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Claim 3. Modulation of Functional Cell Signaling Pathways&nbsp;</b><b>(proteomics</b><b>)</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“To investigate the intervention’s effects on the plasma proteome, 7596 proteins were quantified with the SomaScan Assay v4.1.&nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; Volcano plot analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed 21 significantly altered proteins.&nbsp;Coﬁlin-2 (COF2) and Enoyl-CoA hydratase were significantly upregulated, which suggests enhanced cellular processes related to cytoskeletal regulation and fatty acid metabolism.”</blockquote>&nbsp;<p></p><p><b>Result 3A. Only 21 out of 7596 proteins were significantly altered (far <i>less</i> than chance)</b></p><p>How did that happen?? The proteomic and metabolomic analyses were exploratory and hypothesis-free, but... with 7,596 proteins tested at p &lt; .05, the expected number of false positives is ~380 proteins (5% of 7,596). <b><span style="color: #cc0000;">Statistical correction for multiple comparisons was inconsistently applied across measures</span><span style="color: red;">.</span></b> Even within the Proteomics category, Table 5 says p&lt;.05 but the Methods (p. 14) indicate that FDR correction was applied (false discovery rate).<br /><b><br />Result 3B. Tiny Effect Size (Fig. 5A, linear fold change of 0.25 in either direction)</b>&nbsp;</p><p>This means there was only a 25% increase or decrease in these proteins after the retreat, which may be within technical or biological noise levels. Most studies require at least 1.5 fold changes for biological relevance. Elsewhere, for the protein-protein interaction networks in Fig. 5B, they used either p&lt;.05 OR fold change &gt;.5, which is still problematic. Use more stringent criteria instead (FDR &lt; 0.05 AND fold change &gt; 1.5).</p><p><b style="color: #cc0000;">Across the entire study, the chance of false positive results is high.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Claim 4. Upregulation of Anti-Inflammatory <i>and</i> Inflammatory Markers (dynamic process of immune modulation)</b><br /></p><blockquote>“To assess whether the intervention elicited inﬂammatory or anti-inﬂammatory cascades, we examined a panel of 23 inﬂammatory and 21 anti-inﬂammatory proteins (Fig. 5E). We found significant upregulation of inﬂammatory markers ... Interestingly, we also observed a significantly upregulated anti-inﬂammatory markers index...  Concurrent activation of both pathways suggests a dynamic process of immune modulation, possibly reﬂecting enhanced cellular turnover or repair mechanisms.”</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 4A. Upregulation of Inflammatory Markers is Bad (negative effects of&nbsp;</b><b>the retreat?)</b></p><p>This result is certainly the opposite of what would be expected. Some studies suggest that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4940234/" target="_blank">meditation can&nbsp;<i>reduce</i> inflammatory markers</a> (lower IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, etc.).&nbsp;For an intervention that ostensibly promotes well-being and neuroplasticity, increased inflammation is counterintuitive and potentially harmful.

Significant Results Caused by Head Motion? (difference between rest and meditation)</b></p><p>During the 5 minute resting state scan, participants were told to “not move, keep eyes open, stay awake, and think about whatever you want, but do not meditate.”&nbsp; During the 15 minute meditation scan, participants were instructed to “not move, listen to the guided meditation soundtrack, and meditate as suggested by the audio while keeping your eyes open.”</p><p>A few things:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The guided meditation has a <a href="https://drjoedispenza.com/product-details/Blessings%20From%20the%20Brain%20%E2%80%93%20Blessing%20of%20the%20Energy%20Centers%20XI" target="_blank">bombastic audio soundtrack</a>, while the resting state is silent&nbsp;</li><li>It would have been beneficial to compare auditory cortex activity for meditation vs. rest</li><li>Breathing exercises during meditation can increase head movement</li></ul><p>The authors admit this show-stopping confound of greater head motion during the meditation scan.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“<b><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Participants moved more during meditation than rest, a potential confound</span></b> revealed by the significant effect of task (meditation, rest) on mean framewise displacement on a two-way (task × time) repeated measures ANOVA (n = 19, F(1,18) = 25.1, p = 0.00009, η²p = 0.58).”</blockquote><p><b><span style="color: #cc0000;">Thus, the functional connectivity differences between meditation and rest could explained by head motion, not by changes in brain activity.</span></b>&nbsp;Even tiny movements (0.5 mm) create spurious correlations between regions. The effect size above indicates that 58% of variance in movement was explained by meditation vs. rest. The whopping p-value above was reported in the abstract, but in a different context:</p><p></p><blockquote>“Meditation decreases&nbsp;functional integration in the default mode (p = 0.00009) and salience networks (p = 0.000003).”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 5C. Errors in the Framewise Displacement Spreadsheet (supplementary material)</b></p><p>Framewise displacement (FD) is a quality control metric that considers changes in six head motion parameters from one frame to the next. The authors said their results&nbsp;“were robust to excluding BOLD&nbsp;runs with mean framewise displacement &gt; 0.3 mm, indicating they were not due to higher meditation-associated head motion.” I wasn't sure what they meant by "run" (an entire 5 min block? how many blocks tossed? why wasn't a more stringent cutoff used?).&nbsp;</p><p>At any rate, the Supplementary Material lists a temporal string of FD values for all subjects and conditions.

Machine Learning Models Discriminated Pre- and Post-Meditation States with High Accuracy</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“We applied machine learning to identify the most biologically relevant features across time point (pre/post) and experience level (novice/advanced) datasets. Each dataset was preprocessed (log-transformed and auto-centered) and missing data was imputed to ensure feature scaling, normalization consistency, and data integrity and comparability across modalities. Post-preprocessing, ELISA, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets were concatenated into a single feature matrix used as input for an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data.  ...    both models achieved strong discrimination between pre- and post-meditation states (XGBoost AUC = 0.86; Random Forest AUC = 0.90).”</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 6. Extreme Overfitting (with no way to validate in an independent sample)</b></p><p></p><p><i><b>Unless I'm mistaken</b></i>, they dumped ALL the data, including ~36,500 fMRI features, into one giant classifier. This guarantees overfitting. With 100,000 features and 20 samples, the model can memorize the training data. In contrast, <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-machine-learning-what-is-a-good-ratio-between-features-and-samples" target="_blank">1 feature per 10 samples</a> is often recommended as the minimum for stable ML. There was no validation set, because you can't split 20 samples into training and testing sets. There was no independent cohort, so you can't see if the findings will generalize to another population. The impossibly high AUCs of 0.86-0.90 are meaningless: you could basically use random numbers and get these values.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there were exploratory correlations between self-report scores on the <a href="https://psychology-tools.com/test/meq-30" target="_blank">Mystical Experience Questionnaire</a> (MEQ) and the top 14 features per model, which I'll skip for now. <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[The MEQ is typically used to rate psychedelic experiences, not meditative experiences.

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oral-oncology-reports-elsevier.gif"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="200" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oral-oncology-reports-elsevier.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-133336"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Elsevier is investigating a case report of a person with aggressive cancer, written by three plant researchers working far afield of their specialty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three authors of the study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772906024003923?via%3Dihub">published June 2024</a> in <em>Oral Oncology Reports,</em> purport to diagnose a 63-year-old man with a rare, aggressive form of oral cancer. The journal is a companion title to Elsevier’s <em>Oral Oncology</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/oral-oncology-reports">according to the homepage</a>, but is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://www.psgcas.ac.in/departments/pages/faculty-profile.php?id=S0868">Velmani Sankaravel</a> told Retraction Watch he and his colleagues found the case report from an “online open-access source” and then used it “to support our research on plant-based diagnostics for oral cancer.” However, the paper lists CT scans, biopsies, and other routine diagnostic tests and makes no mention of plant-based diagnostic tools.</p>



<span id="more-133335"></span>



<p>Sankaravel also told us the article was originally conceived as a “comprehensive review article,” but the authors “later adapted it into a short communication due to our limited research experience.” Sankaravel and coauthor <a href="https://www.psgcas.ac.in/departments/pages/faculty-profile.php?id=S0514">Arumugam Arunprasath</a> are assistant professors in the botany department at PSG College of Arts and Science in Tamil Nadu, India. The third author, Sudhir Sreeram, was a postdoctoral researcher at PSG at the time the article was published, according to his <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8969-0527">ORCID profile</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebecca Clear, a communications director at Elsevier, told us the journal has “received reports from readers” and is actively investigating the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clear also said Elsevier is looking into a discrepancy between the “Highlights” section of the paper, which <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/146_40QAq85W8UnJJEFDj3cgMgKJNi8jL/view?usp=sharing">lists the subject</a> as a 60-year-old female, and the paper, which describes a 63-year-old male.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That discrepancy, Sankaravel told us, was due to a “typographical error.”  He says the authors have reached out to the journal to correct the Highlights section. </p>



<p>Sankaravel is also an author on another article on <a href="https://www.orientjchem.org/vol41no2/orai1-gene-and-calcium-deficiency-in-oral-cancer-an-overview/">oral cancer</a>, published earlier this year in the <em>Oriental Journal of Chemistry</em>, whose coauthors include biotechnologists and biochemists.</p>

                Astrocytes are brain cells that are often completely overlooked and dismissed or, in the opposite extreme, presented as mysterious devices that somehow solve all problems of computational neuroscience. The truth is somewhere in the middle, but it is not clear yet where exactly. First of all, we still do not understand even the basic mechanistic rules by which individual astrocytes operate. For neurons, we have precise, often even mathematical ideas how they receive input via synapses, how they depolarize, and how depolarizations propagate to the soma and elicit action potentials. For astrocytes, this mechanistic book of rules is still missing - and this gap limits our ability to interpret experiments or build coherent theories. <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/11/14/interesting-papers-on-astrocyte-ultrastructure-and-function/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/11/plos-launches-two-journals-to-address-critical-real-world-challenges/">PLOS launches two journals to address critical real-world challenges</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on Wednesday, November 12.<br><br>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced the launch of two journals, <em>PLOS Aging and</em> <em>Health </em>and <em>PLOS Ecosystems</em>. Both journals are grounded in our commitment to rigor and research integrity of the highest standard and our open science principles, which facilitates greater reproducibility, faster scientific progress, and broader access to knowledge. In addition, both journals are underpinned by our <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/flat-fee/">Flat Fee</a> model that is designed to shift the cost from researchers to an institutional annual fee, which enables institutions to provide unlimited publishing opportunities for their researchers across participating journals.</p>



<p><a>The new journals, including their scope, include:</a></p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/agingandhealth"><em>PLOS Aging and Heath</em></a><em>:</em> an open access journal that will publish boundary breaking work from&nbsp;researchers, clinicians, public health scientists, social scientists, and policymakers across the spectrum of aging research. The scope includes research that advances our understanding of aging, integrating biological, developmental, clinical, neurological, and functional dimensions. The journal will highlight factors such as disease processes, cognitive and mental health changes, geriatric care, lifestyle interventions, advances in technology, healthcare systems, social determinants, and policy approaches to understand and optimize health across the human lifespan. It will also address the societal, policy, and healthcare system transformations required to support healthy aging and quality of life on an individual level and across diverse and evolving populations.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As researchers, we tend to individually study relatively narrow areas, in terms of scope. Bringing together multidisciplinary, global researchers can help advance understanding of the implications of research findings, generating new ideas and innovations that stand to impact a greater number of people worldwide,&rdquo; said <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9244-9267">Jennifer A. Schrack</a>, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Aging and Health</em>. &ldquo;We are stronger together than independently, and our research needs to reflect that. The field of aging research is limited by journals that are siloed in terms of scope, for example, biology, clinical, cognitive, or policy-related only<em>. PLOS Aging and Health</em> presents the exciting opportunity to publish research across these boundaries to increase visibility of research findings and methods.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to be working alongside Jennifer, and the entire PLOS team, as we focus on studies from a human perspective where the translational aspects on biological mechanisms and clinical usefulness will be emphasized,&rdquo; said <a href="https://ki.se/en/people/sara-hagg">Sara H&auml;gg</a>, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Aging and Heath. &ldquo;</em>The aging field is still emerging and attracting many new researchers, and by imbedding open science principles in the research we publish, we hope to accelerate the findings in the aging research field and support the highest standard possible in research ethics.&rdquo;</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ecosystems"><em>PLOS Ecosystems</em></a>: a multidisciplinary, open access journal that brings together research relevant to addressing the challenges facing our terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems and nature&rsquo;s contributions to people.&nbsp;This selective, community-driven journal is a venue for the breadth of impactful and societally relevant research on the conservation, management, restoration, sustainability and use of ecosystems across scales. The scope of topics is therefore wide, including disciplines from both natural and social sciences, but also interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research involving policymakers, resource managers and practitioners. By connecting scientists from a wide breadth of disciplines, but also practitioners, and decision-makers, it will foster the exchange of knowledge, promote innovation, and strengthen the links between science, policy, and society to drive solutions for the biodiversity and environmental crises of our time.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am excited to lead this journal at this inflection point for our planet,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.idiv.de/staff/henrique-miguel-pereira/">Henrique Miguel Pereira</a>, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Ecosystems</em>. &ldquo;As ecosystems are transformed and biodiversity declines at an alarming pace, we are not only losing the results of millions of years of evolution but also missing vital opportunities to address interconnected global challenges &mdash; from climate change to sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and the creation of healthier and more livable cities.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Both of these titles give researchers a forum to directly address critical challenges facing our society today,&rdquo; said Lauren Coligan, Publisher, PLOS. &ldquo;We believe that by extending our suite of open science journals we can influence open science norms in these research communities in considered and appropriate ways while providing rapid access to research which can directly change the future.&rdquo;</p>
