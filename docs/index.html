<p>Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor who sued a journal and a critic for $10 million before dropping the case, has lost an appeal he filed in 2022 to avoid paying defendants more than $500,000 in legal fees.</p>



<p>As we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/09/stanford-prof-ordered-to-pay-legal-fees-after-dropping-10-million-defamation-case-against-another-scientist/">previously reported</a>, Jacobson:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…who studies renewable energy at Stanford, sued in September 2017 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for defamation over a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722.full">2017 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> (PNAS) that critiqued a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060.abstract">2015 article</a> he had written in the same journal. He sued PNAS and the first author of the paper, <a href="https://www.vibrantcleanenergy.com/about-us/">Christopher Clack</a>, an executive at a firm that analyzes renewable energy.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-128763"></span>



<p>The fees, based on an anti-SLAPP statute, are “<a href="https://www.medialaw.org/topics-page/anti-slapp">designed to provide for early dismissal of meritless lawsuits filed against people for the exercise of First Amendment rights</a>.” Jacobson tried to argue that, by dropping the suit, he was no longer liable for legal fees because the statute requires that defendants “prevail.”</p>



<p>But the three judges in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disagreed. Justice Joshua Deahl, <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Jacobson%20v.%20Clack%2022-CV-523.pdf">writing on behalf of himself and colleagues</a>, held:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>under Jacobson’s preferred approach, a plaintiff could engage in harassing and meritless litigation up until the point at which they sense the court might dismiss the case, and then voluntarily dismiss the suit themselves, all the while keeping the threat of refiling hanging over the defendants’ heads and running up their legal bills.</p>



<p>The specter of repeat litigation by Jacobson is not farfetched.&nbsp; In his briefing to this court, Jacobson continues to take issue with “the refusal of Dr. Clack and NAS to correct the false facts to this day, in reckless disregard for the truth.”&nbsp; Much of his brief rehashes his claims that NAS and Clack defamed him and he persists in condemning Clack’s article.&nbsp; In arguing that NAS and Clack have not “prevailed,” Jacobson repeatedly asserts that he retains the ability to refile his defamation suit, “keeping the defendant[s] at risk.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Indeed, Jacobson told us in a statement – available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jacobson-comments-1.pdf">here</a> – he is “evaluating whether to appeal the DC decision to the full DC Appellate court”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It appears the court decided to set a precedent, ensuring that future voluntary dismissals before a ruling in similar-type cases would be subject to the risk of a fee award.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the judges’ description of his brief as rehashing the original claims, he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>With this decision, the court is basically saying that a scientist can falsify or publish with reckless disregard for the truth false definitions or data or even lie in a scientific article with the purpose of harming or defaming another individual or group of individuals, but such actions do not fall under D.C. defamation law because the statement is published in a scientific paper rather than in a newspaper or other public forum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2022, Jacobson prevailed on the California Labor Commissioner to order Stanford to pay his own attorneys’ fees because, he argued, bringing the suit was “necessary for my job,” particularly defending his reputation. Stanford’s appeal of that decision, and arguments against paying for the fee awards in the District of Columbia, will be heard at a trial in May.</p>



<p>Commenting more generally on the suit, the judges wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What animates Jacobson’s $10 million defamation suit is nothing more than his indignation at an article critical of his work. Such criticism comes with the territory of academic debate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Such lawsuits can, of course, be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">expensive</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-sample-weight-bennu-asteroid">NASA’s OSIRIS-Rex nabbed over 120 grams of space rocks from asteroid Bennu</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: NASA’s OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft snagged 121.6 grams of pristine space rocks when it bopped the asteroid Bennu four years ago, more than double the mission&#8217;s official science goal, <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2024/02/15/nasa-announces-osiris-rex-bulk-sample-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the agency confirmed</a> February 15.</p>



<p>Launched in 2016, OSIRIS-Rex is NASA’s first mission to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth so scientists can study our solar system’s origins. After performing its grab-and-go procedure from the diamond-shaped Bennu, the spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">dropped its canister</a> into our atmosphere last year (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). Engineers swiftly shuttled it off to a specially designed sample curation center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it was placed in a hermetic glove box to prevent contamination by terrestrial material.</p>

<p>While researchers have been able to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">analyze some rocks and dust already</a>, weighing the full sample has been delayed by a couple stuck screws that prevented anyone from accessing the entire contents of the capsule (<em>SN: 10/11/</em>23). Some clever workarounds <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-osiris-rex-curation-team-reveals-remaining-asteroid-sample/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally unlocked the full sample</a> on January 10, and it will now be distributed to scientists around the world for study.</p>



<p>To learn how engineers got the canister open, as well as what kinds of science the sample will teach us, <em>Science News</em> spoke with Harold Connolly, a geologist at Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., who oversees analysis of the material from Bennu. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Shortly after retrieving the OSIRIS-Rex canister, you were able to collect some sample, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> There was lots of dust on the outside of the canister. That was the first material we got, approximately 1 to 1.1 grams or so of fine dust particles.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> What kinds of problems did you face before you could fully open the main sample container?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly: </strong>There&#8217;s a bunch of fasteners or screws holding the container closed, approximately 32 of them. And two of them we couldn&#8217;t loosen enough with the equipment we had. But there&#8217;s a mylar flap that moves, which trapped the sample in a container. The curation team at the Johnson Space Center figured out it could just push down the flap. Without removing the plate that was stuck, the team could get sample out from inside the TAGSAM [Touch-and-Go-Sample-Acquisition-Mechanism] head by literally pushing down the mylar flap and scooping it out very gently. We got 70 grams of sample — a lot.</p>



<p>But to access the rest of the sample, they had to create a new kind of ratchet wrench screwdriver. The previous screwdriver was starting to flex a little bit, so you might be breaking the screwdriver.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Can you tell me anything about what you’ve found from the sample you have so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> It&#8217;s a serpentinite. It&#8217;s an altered rock where the original rocky material has interacted with water, and that original rocky material must have been rich in olivine and pyroxene and some other common rock-forming minerals on Earth, but changed and altered in a beautiful way. That is a geologic puzzle to figure out.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> What have we suspected about the history of Bennu that the sample is helping to confirm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> Oh, there&#8217;s a lot.</p>



<p>Bennu itself is in a configuration that is not what it originally was. Once upon a time, the pieces that became Bennu were in a much different object, probably a heck of a lot bigger. We&#8217;re talking soon after the solar system formed, 4.5 billion years ago.</p>



<p>When that object formed, material came together, brought ices with it — and not just water ice, but carbon monoxide and ammonia ice — which means it had to accrete somewhere out past what we call the snow line, out past Mars in the outer solar system. At that distance from the sun, temperatures are low enough for those ices to form.</p>



<p>Eventually, the interior of the larger, original object started to heat up because of radioactivity that&#8217;s naturally in the material, and that began to melt the ice and become fluid. Fluid began to interact with the parent body to form new minerals — like serpentinite — from the material that accreted.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be teasing out how much of it was altered, how much is relic from the pre-accretion stage, how much is actually from stars that died and injected dust into our solar system.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>It sounds like a dynamic and complicated history.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> We&#8217;re interested in what happened: How did that original parent body change? Was it impacted by another body and smashed apart to create the larger boulders that eventually came together to form Bennu? And how long has Bennu been in this current configuration? How much had it experienced interaction with the sun or with cosmic rays? All these kinds of processes we can tease out by analyzing teeny tiny little bits of sample.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Do we have any answers to any of these questions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly: </strong>Stay tuned.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mixing-root-microbes-boost-tea-flavor">Mixing up root microbes can boost tea’s flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers may have gotten to the root of tea’s soothing effect.</p>



<p>The quality of a cup of chai can be enriched by <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00079-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modifying the microbial community</a> that populates the plant’s roots, researchers report February 15 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The secret is to inoculate roots with bacteria that boost the synthesis of the amino acid theanine.</p>



<p>There’s something in tea that helps us wind down, says Zhenbiao Yang, a plant cell biologist at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in China. Some <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.874254/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies suggest</a> that the “chemical that helps you sleep is theanine,” he says. What’s more, theanine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24633359/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infuses tea with umami</a>, a taste often described a savoriness, he says.</p>



<p>Yang and colleagues analyzed the microbial communities inhabiting the roots of two oolong tea plant varieties: a sweet, low-theanine cultivar called maoxie and a cinnamony, high-theanine variety called rougui. On the rougui roots, they found more microbes that metabolize nitrogen, a nutrient tea plants convert into theanine.</p>



<p>The researchers then isolated 21 bacterial strains from rougui roots to concoct an experimental microbial medley, which they called SynCom. They disinfected the roots of seedlings of several tea plant varieties, grew them in sterilized vermiculite soil for a few weeks, and then inoculated soils with live or dead SynCom. They also added a nutrient solution that was either low or high in nitrogen.</p>



<p>After 20 days, Yang’s team found that the addition of live SynCom boosted theanine levels in each of the varieties. The effect was especially pronounced under the lower nitrogen conditions — leaves of maoxie plants inoculated with living SynCom contained almost 0.007 milligrams per gram of theanine, 0.005 mg/g higher than maoxie inoculated with dead SynCom.</p>



<p>The next step will be to refine SynCom to facilitate its production and distribution, Yang says. “If we have only like one or two [strains], it will be really easy.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. The is the first in our 5-part series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Flavio Azevedo, <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/flavio.azevedo/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assistant Professor&nbsp;of Social Psychology</a>,&nbsp;University of Groningen and his FORTT team (bios below).</p>



<p>Scientific research stands as a beacon of progress and innovation, yet its credibility has been threatened by repeated failure to replicate what had been widely believed. So, how can we ensure the reliability of scientific discoveries? This question lies at the heart of an ambitious project seeking to transform the landscape of scientific research, education, and policy.</p>



<p><strong>The Challenge of Replication in Science</strong></p>



<p>At the core of the scientific endeavor is the ability to accumulate knowledge via replication of studies&mdash;a fundamental yet often overlooked aspect. Replication involves repeating a study and testing a hypothesis under a variety of similar and different conditions to verify its results are reliable. It&rsquo;s a litmus test for the robustness of scientific findings. Despite its importance, replication studies struggle with recognition, are less cited, not yet incentivized, and thus underutilized, leading to a skewed understanding of scientific literature. This has led to situations where studies are widely relied on before later replications show that the proposed effect was not real, or at least not generalizable</p>



<p><strong>A Pioneering Solution: The FORRT Replication Database (FReD) Project</strong></p>



<p>To address these issues, the <a href="https://forrt.org/">Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Teaching</a> (FORRT) has launched an ambitious project aiming to create a comprehensive, dynamic database cataloging scientific claims and subsequent replication attempts across various disciplines of social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences. This living, crowd-sourced collection not only includes replicated studies but also those that failed to replicate, providing a more complete picture of scientific inquiry.</p>



<p><strong>Empowering Researchers and Educators</strong></p>



<p>FORRT&rsquo;s initiative extends beyond mere data collection. It involves developing user-friendly tools like Shiny apps, enabling researchers and educators to explore, visualize, and engage with replication data effectively. These tools will foster critical thinking about the planning, access, and integration of replication efforts in research and education.</p>



<p><strong>Making Science Accessible and Credible</strong></p>



<p>The project is set to revolutionize how we view, evaluate, and utilize scientific data. By making replication studies more accessible and understandable, FReD will empower educators and other stakeholders to incorporate these findings into their teaching and work, promoting discussions on the robustness of published research and reducing reliance on outdated evidence. Researchers will gain a valuable resource for generating new knowledge, and the public will access credible, reliable scientific evidence. The database is open to all and aligns with FORRT&rsquo;s mission to democratize knowledge and higher education resources &ndash; in short, opening up science for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>A Step Towards Transparent, Robust Science</strong></p>



<p>The implications of FORRT&rsquo;s work are profound. By bringing to light the successes and failures of past research, they lay the groundwork for a more transparent, robust, and reproducible scientific process. This is not just about data; it&rsquo;s about building a culture of accountability, transparency, and integrity in scientific research.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the FReD project promises to enhance our pursuit of reliable knowledge. It&rsquo;s a reminder that in science, as in life, understanding our past failures and successes paves the way for a brighter, more informed future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/immune-cells-remember-allergies">Newfound immune cells are responsible for long-lasting allergies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Allergy sufferers may one day be able to erase the source of their congestion, itchy skin and swollen lips and throat thanks to two studies that have uncovered elusive immune cells that maintain allergies over the long haul, often for a lifetime.</p>



<p>A specialized type of immune cell called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi0673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type 2 memory B cells</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi0944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MBC2s</a> hold the memory of proteins that cause allergies, two independent groups of researchers report February 7 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Memory B cells are important for long-lasting protection against infectious diseases, but this subset is primed to make the type of antibodies that lead to allergies.</p>



<p>Unmasking the cells’ identity might lead to new ways to diagnose, treat or even cure allergies.</p>



<p>In the United States, about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm#:~:text=Nearly%201%20in%203%20U.S.,National%20Center%20for%20Health%20Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third of adults and a quarter of children</a> have allergies, with symptoms ranging from seasonal sniffles to life-threatening reactions to food or insect stings. Allergies happen when the immune system unleashes a type of antibody called IgE on innocuous proteins. Usually, those antibodies are reserved for fighting parasitic worms, but in people with allergies, the antibodies target harmless things such as pollen, peanuts and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-allergies-asthma-therapy-allergy-shots">pet dander</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>While some allergies disappear over time or with therapy, others last a lifetime. For decades, scientists have been searching for the source of the long-lived allergies.</p>



<p>Recently, researchers found that cells that help the immune system remember vaccinations and natural infections may be involved. These memory B cells produce a different class of antibodies known as IgG, which ward off viral and bacterial infections and neutralize toxins. But no one had identified exactly which of those cells were recalling allergens or how they switched to making the IgE antibodies responsible for allergies.</p>



<p>To uncover the mysterious cells, two research teams took a deep dive into the immune cells of people with allergies and some without.</p>



<p>Immunologist Joshua Koenig and colleagues examined more than 90,000 memory B cells from six people with birch allergies, four people allergic to dust mites and five people with no allergies. Using a technique called RNA sequencing to find out what individual cells were making, the team identified specific memory B cells, that it dubbed MBC2s, that make antibodies and proteins associated with the immune response that fights parasitic worms and causes allergies.</p>



<p>In another experiment, Koenig and colleagues used a peanut protein to go fishing for memory B cells from people with peanut allergies. The team pulled out the same type of cells found in people with birch and dust mite allergies. In people with peanut allergies, those cells increased in number and produced IgE antibodies — the ones responsible for allergies — as the people started <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oral-drops-could-one-day-protect-people-peanut-allergies">therapy to desensitize them to peanut allergens</a> (<em>SN: 9/4/19</em>).</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s a smoking gun observation,” says Koenig, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “You find the cells present in the allergic people. It&#8217;s not present in the nonallergic people.… These cells are the ones that are making these antibodies, and that&#8217;s how this memory is being held.”</p>



<p>Another group led by Maria Curotto de Lafaille, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, also found that similar cells — which her group calls type 2 memory B cells — were more abundant in 58 children allergic to peanuts than in 13 kids without allergies.</p>



<p>It’s clear that both groups have found the same cells, says Cecilia Berin, an allergist and immunologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. There are “very consistent findings between the two groups,” she says.</p>



<p>Lafaille’s team found that the cells are poised to switch from making protective IgG antibodies to allergy-causing IgE antibodies. Even before the switch, the cells were making RNA for IgE but didn’t produce the protein. Making that RNA enables the cells to switch the type of antibodies they make when they encounter the allergen. “They are one step ahead of other cells to respond and to switch,” she says.</p>



<p>The signal to switch partially depends on a protein called JAK, her group discovered. Stopping JAK from sending the signal could help prevent the memory cells from switching to IgE production, Lafaille says. Other researchers at Mount Sinai are testing a JAK inhibitor drug called abrocitinib in people with food allergies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lafaille also predicts that allergists may be able examine aspects of these memory cells to forecast whether a patient’s allergy is likely to last or disappear with time or treatment.</p>



<p>Knowing which population of cells enshrines allergies in long-term memory may eventually help scientists identify other ways to starve or kill the allergy cells, Berin says. “You could potentially get rid of not only your peanut allergy but also all of your allergies.”</p>

Let your stressed-out partner know you’re for real by choosing a spot to
 eat. This is a love language that every single person desires, but 
almost no one can express. Looks like it’s frozen pizza again.</p><p><b>Talking About Your Commute</b><br />
There is an extremely high concentration of individuals with this love 
language in New York and LA. Going on and on about trains, or highways, 
or traffic, or “I think it took me 25 minutes last time, but this time 
it took 35 — weird” is the only way this group can show their sweetie 
they care.</p><p><b>Explaining How You Feel About Facebook</b><br />
Some people can only express their love by unpromptedly exclaiming that 
they’re going to delete their Facebook, and for real this time. Studies 
show this can be hard to discern as a love language because it is 
insufferable.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>...and my personal favorite:<br /></p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>Replying to But Not Liking Tweets</b><br />
This is a dark and horrific way to express affection, but we must begrudgingly acknowledge it.</blockquote><br /><p></p><p><b>Love Languages on a Likert Scale</b></p><p>As any decent social psychologist will tell you, The Love Language® Quiz has <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-030-39903-0_480" target="_blank">poor psychometric properties</a>, meaning that the validity and reliability of the measurement instrument is very low. A remarkable number of studies have investigated the concept of love languages, and there is no empirical support for the idea, as recently reviewed by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214231217663" target="_blank">Impett, Park, and Muise (2023)</a>. A major issue is the way that Chapman frames his questions (as forced choices between two options). Instead, rating each item on continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert-type scales</a> reveals no correlation between scores on the quiz and scores on the continuous measure.  <span style="font-size: 85%;"><span class="serif-fonts" style="font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', FreeSerif, 'DejaVu Math TeX', 'URW Bookman L', serif;">“</span></span>These findings discount the notion that each person has a primary love 
language and illustrate that people value all five love languages but 
perhaps in different contexts,<span style="font-size: 85%;"><span class="serif-fonts" style="font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', FreeSerif, 'DejaVu Math TeX', 'URW Bookman L', serif;">”</span></span>  said <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214231217663" target="_blank">Impett and colleagues</a>.<br /></p><p></p><br />So why <b><i>are</i></b> Love Languages <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24067506/5-love-languages-gary-chapman" target="_blank">so popular?</a><br /><blockquote>“If I had to pick one reason why I think many couples find Chapman’s book to be helpful,” says [<i>co-author Haeyoung Gideon</i>] Park, “it is not because they learned their own or their partner’s love language but because it gets people to identify any currently unmet needs in their relationship and opens up lines of communication to address those needs.”</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>Footnotes</b></p><p><sup><b><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></b></sup> I'm not saying which one.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-american-patagonia-cave-paintings-surprisingly-old">These South American cave paintings reveal a surprisingly old tradition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Near the southernmost tip of South America, people may have started cave painting nearly 8,200 years ago, several millennia earlier than previously suggested by ancient rock art in that area.</p>



<p>Dating of comblike depictions in a cave in Argentina indicates that these designs belonged to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rock art tradition that lasted more than 3,000 years, ending around 5,100 years ago</a>, researchers report February 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Ancient South Americans painted a variety of designs on the cave’s internal wall and part of its ceiling over roughly 130 generations, probably to preserve cultural knowledge shared by regional hunter-gatherer groups, archaeologist Guadalupe Romero Villanueva and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Prior studies suggested that extremely dry conditions kept South America sparsely populated during this period. &nbsp;Small, dispersed groups would have needed a central spot to preserve visually their ecological and ritual know-how, the investigators say.</p>



<p>Paint pigments used in the Argentinian cave designs provided the oldest direct dates for rock art in the Americas, Romero Villanueva says. For comparison, indirect measures of mineral growths that formed over and underneath an Indonesian cave depiction suggest it’s the oldest known rock art anywhere, dating to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-cave-painting-art-pig-found-indonesia">at least 45,500 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>The Argentinian cave, known as Cueva Huenul 1, lies about 1,000 meters above sea level in a desert region of northwestern Patagonia. Its internal wall and part of its ceiling display 895 painted designs, including geometric shapes, cross-shaped lines and figures of humans and llama relatives known as guanacos.</p>



<p>Romero Villanueva, of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Buenos Aires, and colleagues radiocarbon-dated minuscule chips from four cave paintings of similar, comblike designs. Three paintings yielded reliable age estimates.</p>



<p>Dating of material excavated inside the cave, including guanaco bones bearing butchery marks, indicate that people first reached the site as early as around 11,700 years ago. The scientists say that no signs of hunting or other daily activities appear in the cave when rock art was produced there, underscoring the cave’s transition from a general-purpose site to a special place for keeping cultural knowledge alive via painted images.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/could-rice-meat-hybrid-be-dinner">Could a rice-meat hybrid be what’s for dinner?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Foodies of the future may be dining on beefed-up rice.</p>



<p>A new lab-grown meat product <a href="https://cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(24)00016-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merges rice grains with cow cells</a>, scientists report February 14 in <em>Matter</em>. The rice acts as a scaffold that supports the growth of fat or muscle cells. Together, the ingredients form a rice-meat hybrid that steams up to a pinkish-brown mash.</p>



<p>It tasted delicious, “nutty and a little sweet,” says Sohyeon Park, a chemical engineer at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Lab-made beefy rice isn’t ready for the dinner table yet, she says, but it could one day offer a more sustainable way to eat meat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current methods for producing meat include farming cattle, which requires vast expanses of pastureland and emits more than 100 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year. Finding ways to eschew the moo may be better for the environment, scientists suggest. Some potential alternatives include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">cricket farming</a> and swapping meat for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-microbial-protein-climate-change-deforestation-fungi-algae">fermented fungal spores</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/19; SN: 5/5/22)</em>.</p>



<p>Lab-grown meat is another way to cut the cow (mostly) out of the equation. In the lab, Park and colleagues coated rice grains with fish gelatin and enzymes and then added cow cells to each grain. The fishy coating helped the cells stick to and grow inside the grains. And rice offers a 3-D structure for cells to cling to, like vines climbing a trellis. That structure gives the cultured cells a more meatlike heft, Park says. On their own, the cells grow in thin, flat layers.</p>



<p>Nutritionally, the hybrid rice is more sizzle than steak, with just 8 percent more protein than conventional rice. But Park hopes to boost that number by packing more cow cells into each grain. Rice wasn’t originally on her radar; but the grains worked surprisingly well, she says. What’s more, they’re inexpensive, nutritious and already popular — a grade-A ingredient.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/preparing-for-your-viva">Preparing for Your Viva</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Is your viva looming? Here, Emily Beswick, who completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh, shares her viva experience and offers you some valuable advice whilst preparing for yours! How can you attempt to predict discussion topics, how should you work back through your thesis, and do you know <em>why</em> you did what you did during your PhD?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_afaa15ba17414183b6c55d6da0fddef6~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_899,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p><strong><em>  </em>   1.</strong><a href="http://1.Read" target="_blank" >,,<strong> Read</strong></a><strong>, read and read it again</strong></p>

<p>Take the time to read your thesis with ‘fresh’ eyes. For me, this meant printing a physical copy with text on one side so I could make notes on the opposite page, but this can look different for everyone. Opening the document in a new software, changing the font face, or printing it out enables you to really read what is on the page and distil the key points into your own notes. Everyone approaches this in different ways, many people choosing to read a new chapter each day, or in my friend’s case doing a ‘café crawl’ and reading a chapter in each new location. </p>

<p>   <strong>   2. Know your audience</strong></p>

<p>Find out as much as you can about your examiners. What are their research interests, and how do they align with your thesis? You cannot predict their questions, but you can predict the areas that they may be particularly interested in and might want to discuss in more detail. Reading about their current work, looking over past publications, talking to colleagues and considering their social media presence can go a long way to helping you understand the types of discussions that you might have. </p>

<p>     <strong>3. Prepare your elevator pitch</strong></p>

<p>Be prepared to summarise your entire thesis in a two-minute elevator-pitch style, ensuring it is engaging and accessible to another researcher (who may be in a slightly different field to you). Focus on what your work adds to scientific knowledge and why this gap is important to address. This is an opportunity to take a breath, break the ice and highlight what you think is key for the examiners to know; this will likely be one of the first parts of the viva discussion. </p>

<p>  <strong>   4. Redo literature reviews</strong></p>

<p>If you have any systematic reviews as a part of your thesis, or aspects of your introduction that particularly focus on cutting-edge aspects of your research area, re-run the literature searches. Check if there is any new published literature, or preprints, that might be relevant and could potentially come up in discussion. You can never read every paper that there ever was, or ever will be, but reading at least the abstract of the most recent contributions to the field can help you feel more prepared for a discussion. Focus on what you did differently to these researchers, and how this new knowledge links to your own work. </p>

<p>   <strong>  5. Background questions</strong></p>

<p>A large portion of the viva is discussing your thesis in context, considering what your findings add and why you did what you did. I found these questions from Twitter (or X!) to be helpful for considering what my thesis added. Preparing short responses beforehand to questions like these can make you think more deeply about the ‘why’. </p>

<p>Considering the impact of your science is important and be prepared to have a discussion about the context of the research; what came beforehand and why is the research question worth answering?</p>
<ul>
  <li>What motivated you to carry out this research?</li>
  <li>What issue in society does your research address?</li>
  <li>What are the three most important papers that relate to your thesis?</li>
  <li>What published work is closest to yours and why is yours different?</li>
  <li>What are the most recent developments in your area?</li>
  <li>Why did you use your research methodology?</li>
  <li>To what extent do your contributions generalise?</li>
  <li>How does your thesis contribute to knowledge?</li>
  <li>What are the strongest and weakest parts of your work?</li>
</ul>
<p>    <strong> 6. Acknowledge, but accept, your studies’ limitations</strong></p>

<p>A crucial part of the viva is thinking about the methods you used and considering why you used them. One way to do this is by focusing on the limitations sections that you have written for each chapter. It is important to consider what you would have done differently at the time, if you had the understanding you have now. With the beauty of hindsight, there might be decisions that you would change, or alternative methods that you would have used. However, instead of focusing entirely on what you would have done differently, consider why it was the right decision with the information you had at the time. Remember that these were written at the chronological end of each study. Be confident in your judgement and acknowledge that the decision was made at that time for a reason.</p>

<p>    <strong> 7. Revise the techniques that you used</strong></p>

<p>For lab-based PhDs, this will likely mean reviewing the methods that you used, ensuring that you are comfortable explaining them, particularly those which are more unusual and novel. If any techniques were performed by other people, or outsourced off-site, ensure that you are confident talking about the methods and how they contribute to the findings. These may be more likely to be discussed within the viva, to consider why they were used over more standard protocols, and how the findings can be interpreted. In other PhDs, this may be particularly focused around the statistical analysis techniques that you used to analyse your data. Focus on being able to summarise and justify these techniques succinctly, and in context with your work. For PhDs similar to mine that use standardised clinical rating scales, an understanding of the scales themselves can be helpful to revise and refresh. The number of items, concepts evaluated, and why this scale was chosen, over those with similar aims, are also important topics to keep in mind. </p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_dcb709e85e2146f7ac0b23379111349e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>   <strong>  8. Enjoy yourself!</strong></p>

<p>But most crucially of all, enjoy it! Many people imparted this advice before my viva and I thought that they were completely missing the mark, but I really did end up enjoying it. You will have worked so hard to write the thesis, revise, and edit endless drafts, and it can be quite isolating at times to get through the final push. The viva is a unique chance to justify all of your hard work, and to demonstrate your passion, with people who genuinely share your enthusiasm about your niche topic.  </p>

<p>Trust me when I say - it will be a fulfilling finale to your years of hard work.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/overdose-prevention-opioid-safe-injection-harm-reduction">U.S. opioid deaths are out of control. Can safe injection sites help?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">It’s June 2023 and Victor has been spending most of his days at what he calls his “second home,” on East 126th Street, between Park and Lexington avenues, in East Harlem. A dozen or so men congregate outside, some sifting through belongings in a plastic bag or texting on their phone, others sitting on folding chairs or stools, playing cards, smoking, talking or just watching passersby. As an unhoused person in New York City, Victor says OnPoint NYC, a nonprofit organization that opened two overdose prevention centers in November&nbsp;2021, provides him a “sense of community” he can’t get elsewhere.</p>



<p>Inside, Victor, who provided only his first name when I talked to him last June, will go through reception and into a back room. He’ll fill out a form that provides the information OnPoint needs to make sure he doesn’t die. The form asks for his name and time of arrival, what drug he’ll be consuming and how he’ll consume it. From a list that includes meth, marijuana, cocaine, crack, benzos, fentanyl, speedball and many more, he checks heroin, which he’ll inject. At the bottom, the form asks: “If you weren’t using here now, where would you have gone to use?” Options include the street, sidewalk, between cars, under a bridge, a park, a public restroom, a subway station, your own place (Victor doesn’t have one), a friend’s place or “other.” And it asks if he’d be using alone.</p>



<p>“Yes” is a common answer to that last question. That’s why OnPoint NYC exists. Its two locations, the one in East Harlem and one in the Washington Heights neighborhood, are the only officially sanctioned overdose prevention centers, or OPCs, operating in the United States. People bring drugs they’ve obtained elsewhere and use them under the supervision of trained staff who can provide sterile supplies for drug use and can respond to overdoses.</p>

They are the only officially sanctioned OPCs in the United States.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135751">ONPOINT NYC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The approach remains highly controversial in the United States, with critics pointing out that the sites are sanctioning, if not encouraging, illegal drug use. What’s more, critics are concerned that OPCs increase crime, local drug use and public nuisance in the area. This opposition is just one of the challenges alongside many legal, social, financial and logistical barriers for an OPC trying to open and remain open.</p>



<p>“I understand what it sounds like, right? You’re gonna allow people to use drugs on your site,” says Sam Rivera, executive director of OnPoint NYC. “When people question whether it’s good or it gets people well, showing them is what gives them the answer. The answer is yes, of course it does.”</p>



<p>The United States had more than <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=Overall%2C%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20rose,overdose%20deaths%20reported%20in%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">106,000 drug overdose deaths in 2021</a>, the most recent year for which complete data are available. That’s more per capita than other high-income countries with available data. The vast majority of those deaths involve opioids, including prescription opioid medications and heroin, but predominantly synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Annual deaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled since 2015.</p>



<p>“We obviously need to figure out what alternative interventions we can provide to people to prevent them from dying,” says <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/directors-page/biography-dr-nora-volkow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nora Volkow</a>, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md. “It’s crucial.”</p>

<p>After Congress directed that institute along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH-RTC-Overdose-Prevention-Centers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to conduct a report in 2021</a> on the potential public health impact of OPCs, the agencies’ findings noted “the consistent observation that initial objections to OPCs from local stakeholders tend to disappear following their implementation.”</p>



<p>OPCs have existed around the world for decades. Research has shown that they meet many of their primary goals: reducing overdose deaths, health care costs, the use of emergency services, emergency room visits, hospital stays, public drug use, infectious disease from nonsterile needles, and drug-related litter, such as used syringes. The sites also let people test their drugs to find out what they actually include. Many sites provide additional services aimed at improving overall health — infectious disease screening or testing, wound care, substance use treatment referrals and other programs that meet health care or social needs.</p>



<p>There’s been growing interest in the United States as well. A 2017 study estimated that <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0153-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an OPC in Baltimore</a> that would cost $1.8 million a year to run would save the city $7.8&nbsp;million a year in health care costs, but Maryland’s legislature has yet to authorize one. A center operated in San Francisco for nearly 11&nbsp;months in 2022 before shutting down due to political backlash. Last year, the state of Minnesota and the city council of Somerville, Mass., each set aside money for OPCs. Additional sites have been proposed or are under consideration in Seattle, Denver, Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="#addictionhelp">More information: Where to find help for drug addiction</a></h5>
</div>



<p>OnPoint has become a model for proposed sites across the United States. Researchers are analyzing its data, alongside data from other countries, to assess how OPCs might fare in a country without universal access to health care, with limited social safety nets, and with more drug use and overdose deaths.</p>



<p>In April 2023, the National Institutes of Health awarded the first portion of a grant, expected to total more than $5 million over four years, to researchers who will assess the effectiveness and costs of OPCs based on data from OnPoint and another site approved by the Rhode Island legislature and slated to open this year. That data could help shape how future centers operate and what services they offer, as well as how the nation approaches drug use more generally.</p>



<p>For Victor, the benefits of OnPoint go far beyond the immediate services provided. “It’s them treating you and looking at you as a person, because most people, most places you go, once you tell them you’re doing drugs, they have an idea of who you are already, a stigma,” he says.</p>



<p>Fostering community can be key to recovery, Volkow says: “That building of trust and a sense of acceptance and belonging is really the first step that can make a person want to go to treatment.”</p>



<p>For Rivera, the experience at the center is, “for lack of a better term, a lovefest.” Though he says his staff never initiates conversations about detox, treatment, rehab or recovery, they nevertheless have those conversations every day with people who come to the center.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is harm reduction?</h2>



<p>The first OPC opened in Bern, Switzerland, in 1986, and today <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0153-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are more than 140 legally-sanctioned OPCs</a> in more than a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and across Europe. Since Canada opened North America’s first OPC, Insite, in Vancouver in 2003, it’s <a href="https://health.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/opioids/responding-canada-opioid-crisis/map.html#wb-auto-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added dozens more sites</a> around the country, plus more “pop-up” mobile spots run out of tents or campers. OPCs are also known by other names, such as supervised injection sites, drug consumption facilities and safe consumption sites. But regardless of what you call them, the philosophy is the same: harm reduction.</p>



<p>Harm reduction “focuses on improving the health and reducing the negative health outcomes for individuals,” says Elizabeth Samuels, an emergency&nbsp;and addiction medicine physician at UCLA. “At its most basic level, it’s treating people with respect, dignity and autonomy,” and giving them info and tools “to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.” Laws requiring seat belt use in cars are harm reduction tactics. So are adding filters on cigarettes and distributing condoms to prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections.</p>



<p>Samuels says there’s plenty of evidence that harm reduction strategies work to reduce drug-related problems. Yet in the United States, such interventions — providing safe, sterile drug consumption equipment, for example — are often stigmatized or criminalized. The current approach of punishing people who use drugs is a carry-over from the failed “war on drugs,” she says, “but it remains pervasive in the American psyche and in some portions of the general population.” We know addiction is a disease, not a moral issue, she says. “Pushing people underground and making them feel shame,” she adds, increases risky drug-related behaviors, such as sharing needles, which can transmit bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.</p>



<p>Barriers to OPCs in the United States are financial (for example, who is going to fund them?), logistical (where will they be located?) and social (will communities accept them?). But the biggest hurdle has been legal. In a <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title21-section856&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section often called the “crack house statute,”</a> the <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/149074NCJRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986</a> makes it a felony to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance.” Crack, a form of cocaine that is nearly always smoked, has come with harsher penalties than other forms of the drug. Cocaine in crack form has historically been perceived as more prevalent in Black communities, which has contributed to racial injustices.</p>



<p>A nonprofit called Safehouse tested this law in 2019, attempting to open an OPC in Philadelphia. The effort kicked off a court battle, and in 2021, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the proposed OPC would violate the statute. Safehouse continues to explore its legal options.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, harm reduction advocates in New York were growing desperate as people died from overdoses — more than 2,000 in New&nbsp;York City during 2020 alone. New York Harm Reduction Educators in East Harlem and the Washington Heights Corner Project, both harm reduction social services organizations, had been running syringe exchange programs and offering related services in the city since the early 1990s. Representatives from these groups had done the logistical groundwork to open an OPC and had the support of city hall. A 2018 feasibility study conducted by the city’s health department and funded by the New York City Council suggested that opening four OPCs in New York City could prevent up to 130 deaths a year and save $7&nbsp;million annually in public health care costs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="Drug consumption booth with a brown wall, chair and light." class="wp-image-3135758" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3135758">Overdose prevention centers have drug consumption booths where people can take drugs they bring with supervision from medical professionals.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135758">YUKI IWAMURA/AFP GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the early days of 2021, the New York groups had a choice to make. The Safehouse ruling, from a different federal appellate court than the one overseeing New York, showed the potential legal risks of opening an OPC. But after President Joe Biden took office and listed “enhancing evidence-based harm reduction efforts” as a drug policy priority, the groups decided to move forward, merged into OnPoint NYC and opened two new sites.</p>



<p>“Our people are dying, and we know we have the medicine, the apparatus, everything we need to keep people alive, and they don’t have to die,” says Rivera, who was named as <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2023/6270018/sam-rivera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of <em>Time</em> magazine’s most influential people</a> of 2023.</p>



<p>While most of OnPoint’s extra services receive funding through city and federal grants, the overdose prevention and drug supplies services are funded through private dollars, a mixture of individuals, nonprofit organizations and foundations.</p>



<p>So far, OnPoint hasn’t been challenged in court, but the Anti-Drug Abuse Act statute remains a major deterrent to building more centers, Samuels says. Lack of public funding and community resistance are also barriers. The vast number of people dying has changed the climate somewhat, she says. More people are seeking all the “evidence-based tools in our toolbox to prevent any further loss of life.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does existing OPC research show?</h2>



<p>Along the top of the back wall in the safe consumption area at OnPoint in East Harlem, where Victor uses his heroin, blue painted letters announce: “THIS SITE SAVES LIVES.” And below it in Spanish, “ESTE SITIO SALVA VIDAS.” Below are two defibrillators, each with plushies on top, including a Pokémon Psyduck, a gray puppy and even one shaped like a grinning bottle of naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. Two crash carts are ready to go if the staff notice someone slumped over, becoming discolored or otherwise showing potential signs of an overdose, which happens about three to five times a week, says Alsane Mezon, a harm reduction specialist at OnPoint.</p>



<p>Existing research on OPCs, which comes primarily from Insite in Vancouver and the Uniting Medically Supervised Injection Centre in Sydney, suggests the sites do save lives. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871614018754?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major systematic review</a>, published in 2014 in <em>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</em>, included a study looking at overdose deaths in Vancouver before and after Insite opened in September 2003. Nearly 90&nbsp;overdose deaths occurred within 500&nbsp;meters of the site in the period from January&nbsp;1, 2001 to December&nbsp;31, 2005, with the fatal overdose rate declining by 35&nbsp;percent after the opening. That’s compared with a 9&nbsp;percent reduction over the same time period in the rest of Vancouver.</p>



<p>In a study of the area around the OPC in Sydney, the average monthly number of ambulance calls for opioid-related overdoses in the hours the center was open, which numbered in the hundreds, decreased by 80 percent after its opening. The decrease was more dramatic than what was seen in the rest of the state of New South Wales. None of the studies included in the 2014 review or <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(21)00275-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more recent one from 2021</a> documented any death from overdose inside an OPC.</p>



<p>Despite concerns from critics, the reviews also found no increase in crime, drug trafficking or drug use–related public nuisance associated with the OPCs but did document reductions in syringe litter and public drug use. And when it comes to concerns about the sites encouraging drug use, one study from the Vancouver site showed no increase in relapse rates or the overall number of people in the area who used drugs, nor a drop in those starting methadone therapy.</p>



<p>Neither review linked OPCs to a decline in the number of people who injected drugs, but four studies of the Vancouver site and one of the Sydney site suggested an association between visiting OPCs and the likelihood of being referred to addiction treatment or entering a detox program. The 2021 review, published in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>, found frequent use of OPCs increased the rate of accessing treatment by 1.4 to 1.7 times compared with those who used drugs but visited OPCs less frequently or not at all.</p>



<p>A study of the Vancouver site calculated that, after accounting for the cost of running the site, it saved 14 million Canadian dollars in medical costs over a decade, including prevention of 1,191 new HIV and 54 new hepatitis C infections.</p>



<p>Early results from OnPoint appear consistent with previous findings. OnPoint staff and NYC health department employees reported in <em>JAMA Network Open</em> that during <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnPoint’s first two months of operation</a>, 613 people used services a total of nearly 6,000&nbsp;times across both sites, most often for injecting heroin or fentanyl. As seen in Vancouver and Sydney, most visitors were male, and just over a third were unhoused. Center staff responded 125&nbsp;times to an overdose or near-overdose, with EMS being called five times and three people transported to the emergency department. OnPoint has <a href="https://onpointnyc.org/onpoint-nyc-releases-its-2023-baseline-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not recorded any overdose deaths</a> within its walls since it opened.</p>



<p>Three-quarters of people who went to OnPoint said they would have used drugs in a public place. About half of those who went accessed other services there: picking up naloxone to have on hand, going to counseling, receiving medical care or a holistic service such as acupuncture.</p>



<p>Until OnPoint opened, the only peer-reviewed research on OPCs in the United States came from an underground site that opened in 2014 in an unnamed location. In a research letter reported in 2020 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Alex Kral, a behavioral health epidemiologist based in the San Francisco Bay Area with the nonprofit research institute RTI International, and colleagues evaluated <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2015435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the site’s first five years of operation</a>. Out of 10,514 drug injections, 33 opioid-related overdoses occurred on-site and all were reversed with naloxone, with no deaths or transfers to medical facilities.</p>



<p>A separate study by Kral and colleagues, reported in <em>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</em> in 2021, looked at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871621000168?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reports of incidents</a> in the area around the underground site and at two comparison sites without OPCs for five years before and five years after the site’s opening. Drug incidents had been declining around the OPC before opening and continued to decline afterward, suggesting the site had no negative impact. The analysis also found a decrease, rather than an increase, in crime around the OPC site.</p>



<p>Kral, who is not aware of other underground sites in the United States, also studied the OPC that opened in San Francisco in January 2022 and remained open through December of that year. In addition to safe consumption booths, the site offered on-site buprenorphine treatment (to treat opioid use disorder), legal services and even recreational activities such as karaoke competitions. That site reversed 333 opioid overdoses, about one per day it was open. Kral’s team analyzed data on general nuisance and drug-related nuisance within a 500-meter radius around the OPC and around a similar comparison area elsewhere in San Francisco. The analysis suggested, contrary to claims often made by critics, a reduction in nuisance overall, and no increase in drug-related nuisance or homelessness.</p>



<p>Similarly, a separate group of researchers, unaffiliated with OnPoint NYC, recently reported data showing <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2811766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no significant change in violent or property crimes</a>, 911 calls for crime or medical incidents or 311 calls related to drug use in the immediate six-block areas around the OnPoint OPCs.</p>



<p>The small amount of U.S. research has already started to inform policy, Kral says, pointing to the Rhode Island and Minnesota legislatures’ decisions to authorize the opening of OPCs. “We are seeing politicians take what can be a political risk to do this, and I think our data is part of the reason for that,” he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What will the new U.S. study test?</h2>



<p>Still, the existing research isn’t without limitations. All of the studies are observational, meaning they can show correlations but cannot attribute benefits directly to the OPCs. Many other factors might play a role in local crime rates, medical service utilization, homelessness, infectious disease spread and so on.</p>



<p>OPCs are also far from homogenous. Though the systematic reviews found that OPCs reduce overdose deaths locally and do not come with increases in local drug use or crime, the 2021 review noted that not much research exists in “resource-poor and politically diverse settings.” Drug use and structural factors, such as law enforcement practices and stigma around drug use, differ across different regions. Assessments of the value of the OPC-linked social services, which themselves vary widely, are also limited.</p>



<p>All this leaves a big question open: Can OPCs dramatically reduce harm in the United States, a country with a lot of drug use and among the highest overdose mortality rates in the world?</p>



<p>The new study funded by the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute on Drug Abuse could <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/GnKjAqspAUe5MJeTcJj7vg/project-details/10629749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help answer that question by studying two OPCs over five years</a>. Researchers from New York University will look at both OnPoint sites, and Brown University researchers will focus on the OPC that is set to open in Providence later this year.</p>



<p>That Providence site, in the process of hiring a medical director and finalizing the location, will be funded by $3.25 million allocated from lawsuit settlements between the state and opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies, as well as with money from private foundations and donors, says Annajane Yolken, director of strategy at Project Weber/RENEW, a nonprofit that is helping establish the site. None of the NIH research money will go toward the center’s operating expenses.</p>



<p>The study, part of the <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2022/12/nih-launches-harm-reduction-research-network-to-prevent-overdose-fatalities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH harm reduction research network</a>, will look at four outcome types: the impact on people who use the facilities, based on surveys and health records; effects on neighborhoods, including crime, public attitudes and economics; qualitative findings from interviews with OPC staff and clients; and the costs, of running the site versus health care savings, for example.</p>



<p>“We are first and foremost scientists — we’re not advocates — so our task is to bring the highest level of scientific rigor to these questions, and we’re hoping that the science can inform policy,” says Magdalena Cerda, the NYU epidemiologist leading the OnPoint portion of the study.</p>



<p>“There are some unique aspects of the U.S. context that justify the need for this kind of study,” says Brandon Marshall, the Brown University epidemiologist leading the Providence portion. Most countries with OPCs have universal health care, and OPCs are funded through that system. The United States doesn’t have that structure, which often means Americans engage with health care differently than people in other countries. “Here, health care provided at an OPC might be the first time someone is experiencing compassionate, low-threshold and free health care,” Marshall says.</p>



<p>Barriers to health care, particularly for chronic pain or mental health conditions, are likely one reason drug use is worse in the United States than in other countries, Kral says. Volkow also points to the “tremendous social disparities” in the United States.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“Health care provided at an OPC might be the first time someone is experiencing compassionate, low-threshold and free health care.&#8221;</p><cite>Brandon Marshall</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Social inequities and the lack of a social safety net in the United States may influence how big a difference OPCs can make in reducing overdose deaths, Samuels adds. There’s also the punitive treatment of drug use, including its criminalization, and an aversion to harm reduction strategies compared with other countries with OPCs, Marshall says. He adds that addressing these issues is additionally challenging because of the racist roots of many U.S. drug policies.</p>



<p>What works in Canada and Australia may turn out not to work in the United States, and success may vary across U.S. locations too. One key strength of the two-site study is how much New&nbsp;York City and Providence differ from each other.</p>



<p>“One of the real values of our study is the fact that it leverages two very different contexts, a very urban, dense context of New York City and then the less urban, more suburban Providence,” Cerda says. “Being able to compare those contexts will hopefully give us some more generalizable insights.”</p>



<p>Another big difference will be the services provided. “If you’re going to open an overdose prevention center, then you have to think about all of these wraparound services,” Rivera says. Once people are there, they can have a decent meal, take a nap, meet with a case manager and more.</p>



<p>Cerda refers to OnPoint as the “Cadillac” of OPCs, because it offers so many wraparound services. The plan for the Providence site does not include as many of those services, but the site will be located alongside a treatment program. That could be a benefit for access to treatment, or it might make people more uncomfortable going there.</p>



<p>“We know that the more people use an OPC, the more likely they are to enter into some kind of addiction treatment program broadly,” Marshall says, “but we don’t really know at a more granular level what that looks like.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A need to pair data with stories</h2>



<p>When I met Rivera at his office at OnPoint in June, he was wearing torn gray jeans and a plain gray T-shirt that said in bold white letters: “HEALTH JUSTICE FOR ALL.” He’s a physically large presence, and with his thick, tattooed arms and hands adorned with silver and turquoise jewelry, he might seem intimidating if not for his kind eyes and inviting demeanor.</p>

prevention centers. According to a recent report, in their first year of operation, the sites were used more than 48,000 times by more than 2,800 people, with OnPoint staff intervening 636 times to prevent overdoses from becoming fatal.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135759">T. HAELLE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hanging on the wall behind the desk in his office, cluttered with knickknacks both practical and decorative, is a plastic plaque commemorating the documentary<a href="https://creativetime.org/projects/clean-needles-save-lives-drug-users-doing-it-for-ourselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>Clean Needles Save Lives</em></a>. The 1991 film tells the story of the illegal needle exchange program, run by the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, that was established in response to the AIDS epidemic.</p>



<p>Rivera defines “health justice for all” as access to health care without barriers — “an opportunity for someone who’s actively using drugs to use safely and have supplies that are clean and healthy. That’s health care,” he says. “Quite frankly, many drug users don’t have access to health care in the way they need it and deserve it.”</p>



<p>No one expects OPCs to solve the entire drug problem in the United States. For example, sites typically do not allow pregnant individuals or those under 18 to use their services, and women may not feel as welcome at many sites given that the people using OPCs are predominantly male, many with a history of incarceration.</p>



<p>Even for those who do visit the sites, there are barriers. Some people have difficulty injecting themselves, but most sites do not allow someone to help another person inject. Another potential barrier is a lack of smoke rooms — OnPoint has these but many OPCs do not — which is an equity issue because it excludes people who use drugs in this way.</p>



<p>Despite the limitations, Samuels says, OPCs have shown they help people and they save lives. “That’s meaningful in itself,” she says, “and part of a comprehensive, multimodal strategy to address the overdose crisis.”</p>



<p>Jonathan Giftos, an addiction medicine physician and the former assistant commissioner of the NYC Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treatment, similarly regards OPCs as one piece of a bigger picture. While the city does not provide funding for OnPoint’s OPC services, the bureau where Giftos worked serves as the city’s liaison with the center, which does receive city funds for some of its extra services.</p>



<p>“No one service solves all problems, and they don’t necessarily replace or supplant other important things, like prevention or treatment or recovery spaces,” says Giftos, now chief of ambulatory care at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull. “As we evaluate their impact, it’s important that we interpret the results through that lens and not think that because they didn’t solve every single problem facing a community, that they’re not effective.”</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualitative research from the underground site</a>, Kral regularly heard that people using the site didn’t have friends and felt disconnected from the community. OPCs allow vulnerable people who have been stigmatized by society and burdened by shame to “actually be themselves for a moment” and to develop relationships that encourage them to make decisions “about the kinds of things they want to change in their life,” he says. These centers offer possibilities that can’t be measured in overdose or infectious disease rates.</p>

<p>“The way I have been able to really help people is with empathy, respect and love,” says Mezon, the OnPoint harm reduction specialist. She is a medical assistant, but she says her personal interactions with people at the center are just as important as her clinical tasks. “When I come in, I tell them, ‘First you’re human. We’re going to show you respect,’ and that really changes the narrative.” Mezon says people come to the OPC from as far away as Long Island, Rochester, N.Y., and New&nbsp;Jersey not only because they can get a shower and test their drugs for fentanyl and other substances, but also because they know they will be treated with compassion.</p>



<p>She speaks about her work as a calling. “I have to walk this dark forest every day to find these beautiful flowers that get lost,” she says. “I’m just really grateful to have all walks of life here. This situation does not discriminate, so I’m here to help…. All the things that they’re not getting out there, we’re trying to give them in here.”</p>



<p>Marshall says a lot of work needs to be done to destigmatize addiction and emphasize the humanity of people affected by the overdose crisis. He believes that data and scientific research need to be paired “with the human perspective.”</p>



<p>Edward Krumpotich agrees. A drug policy consultant based in Grand Rapids, Minn., Krumpotich spent a lifetime battling addiction himself and lost his brother to a heroin overdose. He has also helped write half a dozen harm reduction bills in three states, including the 2023 legislation in Minnesota that authorized funding for an OPC.</p>



<p>“Many times, we get stuck in certain statistics. That doesn’t tell the whole tale of how this crisis is happening,” he says. “I think what it’s going to take is when community members realize that their next-door neighbor or their family member is somebody who suffers with this disease. I think when people realize that people like myself, who have been to 30-plus treatments, now write nation-leading law, it can happen to anybody.”</p>



<p>Marshall says personal narratives can change people’s hearts and minds. “Some of the strongest voices are people with lived experience who can really humanize this issue and explain how the crisis has personally affected them,” he says, “and how things like harm reduction enabled them to live happy, healthy lives.”</p>

<p>Following a complaint from a reader, editors at the U.S.-based publisher Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) determined the researchers behind two decade-old papers had committed “self-plagiarism,” charges the authors deny, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>However, IEEE passed the buck on to Elsevier, which published one of the articles a month after IEEE had published the other. Elsevier, in turn, said it is wrapping up its investigation and will make the conclusions public “once final.” And one of the authors said a corrigendum is in the works.</p>



<p>The studies share three authors, including last author Li-Qun Zhang, a professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science at University of Maryland School of Medicine, and both focused on movement of the knee as it relates to people with osteoarthritis.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128755"></span>



<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6665072">Real-Time Knee Adduction Moment Feedback Training Using an Elliptical Trainer</a> was published online November 14, 2013, in <em>IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</em>, whereas <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027013004184">Real-time tracking of knee adduction moment in patients with knee osteoarthritis</a> appeared online December 19 of that same year in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Neuroscience Methods</em>. Only the latter title states when it first received the manuscript, which was on June 10, 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2023, someone who identified himself to Retraction Watch as a friend of someone who has worked with Zhang in the past raised concerns about “self-plagiarism” to Daniel Ferris, the former editor-in-chief of<em> IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,</em> after noticing &#8220;substantial overlapped contents, contexts, and conclusions&#8221; between the two articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The friend told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The overlaps are significant, so I did not elaborate the details one by one. Before reporting, we posted those two papers on a public website (ResearchGate) to see how people thought about them. Most of them said like the authors merely changed the title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December 2023, Ferris responded to the friend, stating that an independent committee of associate editors reviewed the complaint and the authors had been informed. After examining the evidence, &#8220;the committee came to the conclusion that self-plagiarism had been committed as some data had been re-used and there was considerable overlap in the papers,&#8221; Ferris told the friend.</p>



<p>Ferris also stated the journal would take an &#8220;appropriate action&#8221; as a result of the situation. But when Retraction Watch contacted Ferris about what this action might be, he told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal followed IEEE policy as outlined in the IEEE operations manual (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/section-822.html">https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/section-822.html</a>). After following procedures to get a response from the authors and forming a committee to review the allegations, a report was sent to the IEEE Publications office. They determined that because the IEEE TNSRE paper was first, there was no misconduct under the jurisdiction of IEEE.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Giuseppe Di Giovanni, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Neuroscience Methods, </em>told Retraction Watch the &#8220;case is still in progress.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Megan Monachino, Senior Publisher of Life Sciences for Elsevier, added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are in the final stages of our investigation. At this stage, the details of the case are confidential; however, the conclusion will be made part of the publication record once final.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Zhang denies the allegations, but said a corrigendum is in the works. He told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The first paper with IEEE (Kang et al.,2013) was on the methodology development of real-time knee moment determination with experimental corroborations on healthy subjects, while the second JNM paper was on subsequent clinical study of patients with knee osteoarthritis and biomechanical changes with knee OA. The differences can be seen in the Results figures of the two papers. The lists of authors for the two papers were also different. However, the Methods section of the second paper was similar to that of the first (Kang et al.,2013). Since the computations involved in the studies were complex, and to facilitate readers, the key method and procedure were described in a simplified manner in the second JNM paper. To avoid confusion, we did not change the frequently occurring terminologies and symbols in this paper, which also contributed to the overlap (overall 31% similarity between the two papers). Moreover, the first paper (Kang et al.,2013) paper was cited throughout the second paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first paper with IEEE was published electronically in 2013, before the second JNM paper published in 2014. So the self-plagiarism issue is with the second JNM paper. The JNM editor investigated the issue carefully and concluded that there is no case of duplicate publication. However, there is 31% similarity in the text. We have submitted a corrigendum accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 2/15/24, 0300 UTC: </p>



<p>Update: On February 1, two weeks after we requested more details about Elsevier&#8217;s investigation, the publisher issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027024000062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy corrigendum to Zhang et al&#8217;s paper</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/is-this-a-newborn-white-shark">Does this drone image show a newborn white shark? Experts aren’t sure</a></h4>

              
                <p>In late January, the internet went all <em>“Baby shark, doo doo doo.”</em></p>



<p>Video of a purported newborn white shark, taken by a drone off the coast of California, went viral, garnering over a million views and a spate of somewhat breathless news coverage. The shark measured an estimated 1.5 meters long and appeared to be shedding a whitish film, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01512-7" data-type="URL" data-id="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01512-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly from recent birth</a>, Carlos Gauna and Phillip Sternes described January 29 in <em>Environmental Biology of Fishes.</em></p>



<p>If confirmed, it would be the first sighting of such a young white shark (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) possibly just hours after birth. Plus, it could provide clues to where these enigmatic and endangered sharks’ breeding grounds are located.</p>



<p>Gauna, an independent wildlife videographer, spotted the unusual-looking young white shark in July along the coast near Santa Barbara with Sternes, a marine biologist at the University of California, Riverside. While adult white sharks have a grayish upper side and whitish underbelly, this shark appeared to be pure white. Besides its estimated size, other clues to its age became apparent upon reviewing the video, Gauna says: It appeared to be shedding some mucus layer and its fins appeared underdeveloped.</p>



<p>But while tantalizing, it’s too early to go goochie goo over the evidence, shark experts say. “It’s an interesting observation,” says Chris Lowe, an ichthyologist at California State University, Long Beach. But “I do think it&#8217;s a little overblown.” For starters, there’s only a drone shot as potential proof. Testable samples or other similar observations would be needed to confirm if the young shark was, in fact, a newborn.</p>



<p>The researchers themselves are careful to couch their finding with words like “possible” and to provide an alternative explanation for the milky film: It could be a skin condition. And they agree more sightings are needed.</p>



<p>Whether or not the images capture a newborn, the sighting has thrown a new spotlight on these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-great-white-shark-sightings-are-good-news">cryptic creatures</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/14</em>). Here’s what we know about white sharks, and what this new evidence can — and can’t — tell us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where do young white sharks live?</h2>



<p>The aerial video was shot 400 meters off the coast of California. The spot is near one of four coastal sites along southern California where young white sharks are already known to congregate, thanks to fishing records, some going back decades, and increasingly more high-tech surveillance.</p>



<p>“Back in the day, I remember filling up helium balloons with cameras underneath to try to observe what was happening to these sharks,” says Michelle Jewell, a marine biologist at the Michigan State University Museum in East Lansing. Now drones, tagging and satellite tracking are often the tools of choice.</p>



<p>Lowe and his team use drones to spot white sharks. Then the team drives up alongside them in boats to attach tracking tags. Satellite data have shown that young and juvenile sharks frequently visit the four coastal sites, sometimes migrating between them, and stay there for days to months. Juveniles tagged by Lowe’s team have turned up at a fifth site in Baja, Mexico, the data show. “In a year, they have migrated down to Mexico, and back to California,” Lowe says.</p>



<p>Unlike many animals, mother great whites show no <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orca-mom-sons-favoritism-killer-whale">parental care</a> (<em>SN: 02/09/2023</em>). “They drop and run, and the [pups] are on their own,” Lowe says. These coastal sites are nurseries, experts say, a safe haven that provides the young sharks protection from larger predators and also easy access to food sources such as fishes and squids.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where are white sharks born?</h2>



<p>That’s still a mystery.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Personally, I don&#8217;t think that those young ones have to travel very far,” Gauna says. “They have to be born nearby to get to these nurseries.” Pups born farther offshore would have to make a perilous journey through deep, predator-infested water to reach the safer coastal waters, he and Sternes say.</p>



<p>Other experts disagree, saying all the evidence to date doesn’t hold for coastal births. If a female gave birth recently and nearby, some experts say it would be unusual to see just one pup. That’s because white sharks, which have two uteruses running the length of their body, give birth to 10 pups on average at a time, each about 1.5 meters long. That’s 15 meters of white shark pups tucked inside of gravid females.</p>



<p>“California is the most heavily flown-over coastline in the world,” Lowe says. “Between helicopters and fixed-wing planes, if 18-foot big females were coming in and dropping pups along our beaches, somebody would see it.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-make-mapping-hot-spots-ammonia-pollution-easier">Satellite tracking data</a> (<em>SN: 01/04/2019)</em> have also shown that “around every three years, large female white sharks go far from their regular home range, stay there for a while and leave,” Jewell says. That suggests that the reproductive cycle for female great white is three years. But the tracking data alone do not have enough information to say what white sharks do in these far-flung remote places.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Researchers filmed a young great white shark off the California coast near Santa Barbara, that appeared to be sloughing off its skin layer. The sighting might give clues to where white sharks are born.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does a newborn white shark look like?</h2>



<p>That’s a mystery too — because no one has witnessed a white shark giving birth.</p>



<p>But there is a way to visually estimate a young shark’s approximate age: Look at the color and texture of the yolk scar present between its pectoral fins. “It is like a belly button, where the baby shark used to have its yolk sac,” Lowe says. The yolk sac, which nourishes the embryo, gets used up inside the mother’s uterus, leaving a mark where it was once attached to the pup. The scar appears red and raw-looking in the smallest white sharks Lowe’s team has caught. As the white shark grows, the scar turns white and becomes raised, disappearing by about the time the shark is a year and a half old.</p>



<p>Gauna and Sternes couldn’t spot the underbelly yolk scar from a drone shot. But they say there is another visual clue to the shark’s age: Both the dorsal fin and pectoral fins of this shark seemed underdeveloped and rounded.</p>



<p>“Why would the fins be rounded?” Gauna asks. “Well, to exit the [womb of the] mother.” That rounded shape has been documented in embryonic sharks found inside pregnant females that have died. &nbsp;By the time the sharks are a year old, the fins take on a sharper, more defined shape, Sternes says.</p>



<p>But with a drone shot alone, it is hard to gauge the depth of the shark’s location, making it difficult to estimate its true shape and size because water can distort an image, Lowe says.</p>



<p>Another clue to the shark’s age is the white material that seemed to be sloughing off its body in the video, Gauna and Sternes say. It could be a film of substances from the womb that coated the pup during birth and still clung to it. An autopsy of a pregnant shark in 2016 revealed that her uteri contained a lot of “yellowish viscous uterine fluid.” While it’s unknown how long the sharks produce this “uterine milk,” that’s what could be covering the young shark, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>An unknown skin condition is another possible explanation, the team and other experts say. When sharks visit coastal sites, “they are in areas that have a lot of pollution and human runoff,” Jewell says, which could cause a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/epidemic-skin-lesions-reported-reef-fish">skin infection</a> (<em>SN: 08/01/2012)</em>.</p>



<p>While experts agree that the team have spotted something unusual, they say it is too early to jump to conclusions on whether it is a newborn.<br><br>“We need to add a layer of science and go and repeat and try [to] see the same thing over again and collect samples to whatever it is that&#8217;s coming off of that shark,” Jewell says. “What that something is, will then help us answer the rest of it.”</p>

<p><strong>Fossils show man walked 3 million years ago</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/fossils-show-man-walked-3-million-years-ago"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 16, 1974</p>



<p>Anthropologist D. Carl Johanson … has discovered a skull fragment, shin and thigh bones of a 3-million-year-old man in Ethiopia…. The bones belonged to an ape man (hominid) of the genus <em>Australopithecus</em>.… “We have absolute, concrete evidence that our ancestors walked on two legs over 3 million years ago,” the 30-year-old scientist told a news conference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Exactly when upright walking emerged in the evolutionary history of humans remains hotly debated. Fossil analyses suggest that several hominid species ambled around on two legs about 5 million to 7 million years ago. An upper leg bone of the oldest known, 7-million-year-old <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, bears <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">signs of upright walking including an inner projection near the hip joint</a>, scientists reported in 2022 (<em>SN: 9/24/22</em>). But not all paleoanthropologists are convinced those features prove a two-legged gait. And some scientists think the bone belonged to an ape that may have walked upright at times.</p>

<p>In what has become a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">familiar refrain</a>, more than 30 editors and advisors of an economics journal have resigned because they felt the publisher’s need for growth would increase the “risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4md5d3oth3ap3995op7z0/public-statement-resignations-from-the-editorial-board-of-the-journal-of-economic-surveys-final.pdf?rlkey=lk43pcmovjc6yg74gfo1zaex1&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">letter</a> uploaded to Dropbox on February 7, the editors and advisors of the <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em> said: “We no longer believed that the corporate policies and practices of the Journal’s publisher, Wiley, as we perceived them through several statements made by Wiley and the draft of a new editor agreement submitted to the attention of Editors-in-Chief and Managing Editors by Wiley, were coherent with ours.”</p>



<p>Despite involving a lawyer, the now-former editors said:</p>



<span id="more-128749"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The non-negotiable documentation submitted to our analysis appeared to emphasize quantity over quality of the papers submitted and strongly favoured cross pollination among the various Wiley publications also in relation to papers that we would have not considered favourably for the Journal of Economic Surveys increasing–in our perception–risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement through a spokesperson to Retraction Watch, Allyn Molina, Wiley’s vice president of publishing development. said the company was “grateful to the leadership and dedication of the former Editors who created a strong foundation.” The journal offers an open access option, for a fee of more than <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14676419/homepage/fundedaccess.html">$4,000 per article</a>. But Molina said “this journal does not have any open access publishing targets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley proposed increasing publication output by 4% over the prior year as a goal rather than a requirement. In absolute terms, that’s an increase of 2 additional articles per year. This is supported by significant growth in submissions and a trend of emerging topics in the field.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/les.oxley">Les Oxley</a>, one of the two former managing editors in chief of the journal, said he and his colleagues had “have no comment to make” on Wiley’s statement.</p>



<p>The mass resignation joins a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a> of more than two dozen such episodes, as academic researchers battle for-profit journal publishing companies. Quoting public statements by Wiley, the editors wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley’s performance metrics for journals are “growth in submissions” and “growth in published articles”; Wiley also appears ready to affirm that “it’s all driven by volume ultimately”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company, the editors wrote, again quoting public statements, “considers it ‘important to keep authors at the center of journal strategy’” and “has an ‘Open Access (‘pay to publish’)’ business model and a ‘Cascade strategy of finding initially rejected articles another more appropriate home within Wiley’s portfolio.’”</p>



<p>Wiley told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We regularly take steps to ensure our journals are best serving the needs of the academic community. Over time, this means updating our editorial and production processes to improve the author experience, ensuring our workflows meet the needs of authors, librarians and funders, and bolstering processes to safeguard research integrity. Editors are key to making these changes happen, and our goal is always to reach common ground on changes that support the long-term success of the journal. We recognize that not all Editors will embrace these changes, and where compromise cannot be reached, it is sometimes in our mutual interest to part ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher said it “will work with the succeeding editorial team to carry on that legacy.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are currently working with members of the board and wider community to recruit new leadership for the journal. This is a fully transparent process that includes advertising and recruiting within the wider field. In partnership with the new editorial team, we plan to introduce best practice editorial workflows and broaden the journal’s scope to reflect new and emerging fields.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-wall-eurasian-reindeer-hunting-submerged">This Stone Age wall may have led Eurasian reindeer to their doom</a></h4>

              
                <p>If this underwater wall could talk, it might reveal that it once helped Stone Age Europeans hunt reindeer.</p>



<p>Submerged about 20 meters below the surface of the Baltic Sea off the coast of Germany, the wall stretches for almost a kilometer and contains nearly 1,700 stones, making it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312008121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the largest human-made megastructures in Northern Europe</a>, scientists report February 12 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</em>.</p>



<p>The team suspects it was used for hunting large prey, similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-scaled-drawing-desert-kite">ancient hunting traps in the Middle East</a> and North America (<em>SN: 5/17/23</em>). If so, it would be the first known trap of its kind in the southern Baltic region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered the structure, dubbed the Blinkerwall, while mapping seafloor depths with sonar in 2021. The data revealed odd protrusions down below, so the team returned with underwater cameras to get a better look.</p>



<p>“When we found the rocks, I realized it&#8217;s possibly not a natural process that put these rocks together,” says Jacob Geersen, a marine geologist at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde in Rostock, Germany.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that tsunamis, glaciers, ice floes or construction of nearby underwater infrastructure could have positioned the rocks into their flattened S-like shape, Geersen and colleagues say. The rocks seem to be intentionally placed, with the largest boulder (calculated to weigh over 11,000 kg, or the weight of seven mid-size cars) sitting in the middle. Most of the other rocks weigh less than 100 kg — light enough to have been moved by people to connect the larger rocks scattered along the wall’s length.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of sediment cores taken from near the Blinkerwall suggest that a lake bordered the structure around 10,000 years ago, before the Baltic Sea rose 8,500 years ago and submerged the area. The wall probably funneled Eurasian reindeer — which last occupied the area around the time the wall was built — towards the nearby lake, where the trapped prey could have been easily killed. At that time, the only people in the region who could have constructed such a large wall were nomadic hunter-gatherers, says study coauthor Marcel Bradtmöller, a Stone Age archaeologist at Rostock University.</p>



<p>The wall provides insights into how people at that time worked with the land and each other. It likely required a group of at least 10 people to use the structure to hunt, says Bradtmöller.</p>



<p>Humankind has a long history of enhancing natural topography to obtain resources, says archaeologist Geoff Bailey of University of York in England. The team’s interpretation of the findings “sounds, to me, to be very plausible,” he says.</p>



<p>Now there’s more work to do, Geersen says. He and colleagues plan to take more sediment samples from under the rocks and search for artifacts near the wall, which could reveal clues about the people who lived there.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migratory-fish-decline-un-report">Migratory fish species are in drastic decline, a new UN report details</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migratory species don’t travel with a passport, but they cross borders all the time. This makes the animals’ conservation a uniquely challenging, international effort.</p>



<p>That effort needs a lot of work, researchers argue in the <a href="https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-ever “State of the World’s Migratory Species<em>”</em> report</a> published February 12 by the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>



<p>The report is the most comprehensive tally of the over 1,000 species protected under an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals<em>, </em>or CMS. Nearly half of CMS species are experiencing population declines. Of those, fishes are faring the worst: 97 percent, roughly 56 species, are facing extinction. That includes species such as devil rays (<em>Mobula mobular</em>) and scalloped hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s that real decline in fish species that … is keeping me up at night,” said Kelly Malsch of UNEP’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre at a February 8 news conference.</p>



<p>The goal of the report is to guide priorities for CMS COP14, a meeting of global conservation leaders starting February 12 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to create new strategies for the protection of migratory species. This includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. These groups overall are faring better than fishes, but the report still shows that 1 in 5 of all the species covered by the treaty is at risk of extinction. While much of the data in the report is alarming, success stories like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">recovery of humpback whales</a> may provide ideas for protection of other species, including fishes (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Danger zone</h3>



<p>The first-ever global tally of how more than 1,000 migratory species are faring shows fishes are doing much worse than other groups such as land mammals or birds. There are a greater percentage of critically endangered (red) or endangered (orange) species of fish than of any other animal group covered by an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animal. While insects appear to be faring well, the report covers just one species — monarch butterflies (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) — and notes that their story is not so simple: While the species overall is listed as least concern, the ones that migrate are considered endangered.</p>

<p>U.N. researchers reviewed data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and found a 90 percent average decrease in the abundance of CMS-listed fishes since 1970. No other group of animals experienced an average decrease, let alone one this significant. The main culprits include bycatch (the accidental catching of fish), overfishing and pollution, the report notes.</p>



<p>The report goes beyond the species of every group already under the treaty’s protection and identifies almost 400 other species as vulnerable, including more than 200 fish species that are not yet protected — most of which have decreasing populations, like the zebra shark (<em>Stegostoma tigrinum)</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In need of protection</h3>



<p>The international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals covers just about a quarter of all migratory species. Of the remaining 3,339 species not covered by the treaty, 399 are considered either threatened or near threatened. Once again, fishes top that list.</p>

<p>“When you drill down into it, very few fish species are actually protected,” says Richard Caddell, an expert in marine and environmental law and policy at Cardiff University in Wales, who was not a part of this report. Only a few, like those heralded for caviar, are better protected than the rest, mainly for their commercial value. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Protecting migratory species on land across multiple countries is hard enough. But when it comes to animals in water, it’s a whole other beast. Most of the ocean is a mystery, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-data-unknown-oceans-sea-mountains">new environments are still being discovered</a>, making conservation efforts harder <em>(SN: 4/30/23)</em>.</p>



<p>And fish have another problem — they’re not sexy, Caddell says. Fish don’t draw conservation funding and international recognition the way gorillas and elephants and other charismatic megafauna do. “People think of a fish as being something that ends up on their plates,” he says.</p>



<p>This report might help to change that.</p>



<p>It recommends ways to protect migratory fish species from pollution and bycatch, like attaching LED lights to nets to deter certain fish. But it also keeps fishes in the spotlight, weaving the discussion of them throughout the report. By making their decline central to this report, delegates at CMS COP14 may take more notice, Caddell says.</p>



<p>“States not acting might not be [failing to protect fish species] out of malice or negligence, but out of sheer ignorance as to the true conservation status of a number of these animals, which is why a report like this is brilliant,” Caddell says.</p>



<p>More than 100 parties have signed and ratified the CMS since 1979. The United States is not one of those countries, but it has agreed to elements of the treaty focusing on marine mammals and sharks. But even for nations that have ratified the CMS, there’s no real legal penalties if they don’t follow the treaty. Instead, Caddell says reports like this new one remind those involved to do better. </p>



<p>“I think this report is a very, very welcome development,” Caddell says. “There’s an opportunity here to build a little bit of political momentum to try to think about fish in a different way. And to move away from that we&#8217;re just there to eat them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/babies-ai-learn-words-model">How do babies learn words? An AI experiment may hold clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>The AI program was way less cute than a real baby. But like a baby, it learned its first words by seeing objects and hearing words.</p>



<p>After being fed dozens of hours of video of a growing tot exploring his world, an artificial intelligence model could more often than not <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associate words — <em>ball</em>, <em>cat</em> and <em>car</em>, among others — with their images</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 2 <em>Science</em>. This AI feat, the team says, offers a new window into the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/language-heard-never-spoken-young-babies-bestows-hidden-benefit">mysterious ways that humans learn words</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>Some ideas of language learning hold that humans are born with specialized knowledge that allows us to soak up words, says Evan Kidd, a psycholinguist at the Australian National University in Canberra who was not involved in the study. The new work, he says, is “an elegant demonstration of how infants may not necessarily need a lot of in-built specialized cognitive mechanisms to begin the process of word learning.”</p>



<p>The new model keeps things simple, and small — a departure from many of the large language models, or LLMs, that underlie today’s chatbots. Those models learned to talk from enormous pools of data. “These AI systems we have now work remarkably well, but require astronomical amounts of data, sometimes trillions of words to train on,” says computational cognitive scientist Wai Keen Vong, of New York University.</p>



<p>But that’s not how humans learn words. “The input to a child isn’t the entire internet like some of these LLMs. It’s their parents and what’s being provided to them,” Vong says. Vong and his colleagues intentionally built a more realistic model of language learning, one that relies on just a sliver of data. The question is, “Can [the model] learn language from that kind of input?”</p>



<p>To narrow the inputs down from the entirety of the internet, Vong and his colleagues trained an AI program with the actual experiences of a real child, an Australian baby named Sam. A head-mounted video camera recorded what Sam saw, along with the words he heard, as he grew and learned English from 6 months of age to just over 2 years.</p>

Today, Sam is a happy tween.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135773">Courtesy of Sam’s dad</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers’ AI program — a type called a neural network — used about 60 hours of Sam’s recorded experiences, connecting objects in Sam’s videos to the words he heard caregivers speak as he saw them. From this data, which represented only about 1 percent of Sam’s waking hours, the model would then “learn” how closely aligned the images and spoken words were.</p>



<p>As this process happened iteratively, the model was able to pick up some key words. Vong and his team tested their model similar to a lab test used to find out which words babies know. The researchers gave the model a word— <em>crib</em>, for instance. Then the model was asked to find the picture that contained a crib from a group of four pictures. The model landed on the right answer about 62 percent of the time. Random guessing would have yielded correct answers 25 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“What they’ve shown is, if you can make these associations between the language you hear and the context, then you can get off the ground when it comes to word learning,” Kidd says. Of course, the results can’t say whether children learn words in a similar way, he says. “You have to think of [the results] as existence proofs, that this is a possibility of how children might learn language.”</p>



<p>The model made some mistakes. The word <em>hand</em> proved to be tricky. Most of the training images that involved <em>hand</em> happened at the beach, leaving the model confused over <em>hand</em> and <em>sand</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/babies-recognize-common-words-6-months">get tangled up with new words</a>, too (<em>SN: 11/20/17</em>). A common mistake is overgeneralizing, Kidd says, calling all adult men “Daddy,” for instance. “It would be interesting to know if [the model] made the kinds of errors that children make, because then you know it’s on the right track,” he says.</p>



<p>Verbs might also pose problems, particularly for an AI system that doesn’t have a body. The dataset’s visuals for running, for instance, come from Sam running, Vong says. “From the camera’s perspective, it’s just shaking up and down a lot.”</p>



<p>The researchers are now feeding even more audio and video data to their model.&nbsp; “There should be more efforts to understand what makes humans so efficient when it comes to learning language,” Vong says.</p>

<p>Erick Jones, the dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Nevada in Reno, is under fire for publishing a journal filled with what one academic called “<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/">bizarre” and “incoherent” articles</a>.</p>



<p>Jones founded the<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"> </a><a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"><em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em></a> in 2015 and served as the publication’s editor-in-chief until September 2022, when he <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">handed off the reins</a> to a former member of his lab. The journal notes that it requires authors to pay an “honorary” charge of $199 to publish their manuscripts.</p>



<p>Jones’s <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0931-1935">ORCID profile</a> lists 71 articles published in the journal, although an accurate count is difficult because of discrepancies in the journal’s database and the title’s PDF files. The pages of the journal were also filled with articles from his wife, his son, his students and the current editor-in-chief, along with the occasional outside submission.</p>



<p>One of Jones’s papers, published in 2022, is titled “Using Science to Minimize Sleep Deprivation that May Reduce Train Accidents.” In the two-paragraph article, Jones and his coauthors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/UsingSciencetoreducesleepdeprivationintrainworkersIONJones.pdf">note</a> that “both humans and flies sleep during the night and are awake during the day, and both species require a significant amount of sleep.” After a description of an unrelated study on fly lifespans, they conclude:</p>



<span id="more-128736"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is probable that the incorporation the findings of age-related health factors and increased sleep may lead to less train accidents. of these age factors when considering these options supply chain procedure for maintaining will be beneficial.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Jones’s other papers in the journal are also difficult to interpret. One is<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/259/257"> a statistical analysis</a> of the arrival times of planes to Dallas Fort Worth Airport on a single day, September 12, 2022, which finds that planes arrive quickly in the morning and more slowly later in the day. Another tries to link Jones’s expertise in supply chain management and radio frequency identification tags (RFID) to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/192/190">Beauty Sleep</a>.”</p>



<p>The journal is not indexed by SCOPUS or Web of Science, though the articles do appear on Google Scholar. They are also tallied on Jones’s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickcjones/"> LinkedIn profile</a> and in <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">press releases</a> about his record. Several of them have been cited in final reports submitted to the National Science Foundation and other agencies that have funded his research. Jones, a former NSF program director, currently serves on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/edu/advisory_members.jsp">the advisory committee</a> for NSF’s Directorate for STEM Education, and has received more than $700,000 in grant funding from the agency. Jones’s professional bio notes that he has “<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">garnered more than $9 million in grants and contracts</a>.”</p>



<p>Questions about the journal were first raised this week on the blog of statistician<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/"> Andrew Gelman</a>, and the controversy was covered by the student paper, <a href="https://nevadasagebrush.com/2024/02/07/unr-dean-of-engineerings-questionable-research-papers-arise/">The Nevada Sagebrush</a>, and a local news site, <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/02/unr-dean-faculty-member-accused-of-research-misconduct-over-self-published-research-articles/">This is Reno</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not a good look for the university,” says <a href="https://www.unr.edu/business/faculty-and-staff/lembke-ron">Ron Lembk</a>e, a supply chain expert at UNR’s College of Business, who was unaware of the journal’s existence until last week.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Jones did not respond to a request for an interview from <em>Retraction Watch</em>, but he defended the journal in<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851"> an online comment</a>, by stating that he does not list those publications on his resume and that he started the journal only after receiving tenure.</p>



<p>“When I started I did not expect to be an administrator just a faculty member who tried to make a difference and provide access to more applied supply chain engineering technology ideas, projects and research,” he wrote. “I standby [sic] having public access to new thought.”</p>



<p>The current editor-in-chief, Md. Mamun Habib, also failed to respond to a request for an interview but has recently taken down the train accident article and published  <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/critic">a statement</a> about the criticism on the journal’s website, where he took full responsibility for the journal’s shortcomings.</p>



<p>“While you can argue on the merits, quality, or impact of the work it is all original and we vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise,” he wrote. Habib also noted that many authors have only paid just $9.99 or nothing to publish their articles and that authors are required to disclose whether they used Chat-GPT or other artificial intelligence software to help them craft their manuscripts.</p>



<p>The journal is just one piece of Jones’s educational mini empire, which includes&nbsp; a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195">self-published book</a> and <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib">a supply chain certification program</a>.</p>



<p>The university says it is investigating the journal. “We are taking the claim seriously,” says Jessica Lozada, a spokesperson for UNR. “It is standard practice for the university to review and investigate, which we are currently in the process of doing.”</p>



<p>Jones’s son, Erick Jones Jr., who is also a prolific author in the journal and a member of the editorial board, calls the controversy “growing pains.”</p>



<p>“You can criticize the science, you can say this paper is shit, but, you know, a year from now, the papers are going to get better, and, hopefully, we can actually be a legitimate journal,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The elder Jones always had one foot in academics and one foot in business. “He takes risks, and that seems to have worked out well in his life,” says his son.</p>



<p>While working towards his PhD in industrial engineering at the University of Houston in the early 2000s, he supported himself with a job at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm best known for its role in the Enron scandal.</p>



<p>After the firm’s collapse in 2002, Jones entered the real estate business, obtaining a realtor’s license and a mortgage broker’s license, and founding his first company, PWD Groups Inc., which would morph into the publisher of his future journal.</p>



<p>At the same time, he was moving up the ranks in academia.</p>



<p>He obtained his PhD in 2003 and spent eight years as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he worked with NASA to<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080047724"> evaluate the feasibility of using radio frequency identification tags</a> (RFID) to keep track of supplies on the international space station.</p>



<p>In 2011, he joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he founded the<a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/research/centers-and-labs/raid"> RFID, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science (RAID) Laboratories</a>, attracting significant funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Transportation over the next decade.</p>



<p>Five years later, he was named Associate Dean of Graduate Affairs for the College of Engineering.</p>



<p>Then, in July 2022, he<a href="https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/engineering-dean"> accepted the dean’s job</a> at UNR, which came with a <a href="https://www.nevadafacultyalliance.org/resources/Documents/PUBLIC_DOCS/2023_UNR_Budget/UNR%202023%20vs%202022%20salaries%20top%2050%20f.pdf">$330,000</a> salary.</p>



<p>“What is exciting about having Jones as our new dean for the College of Engineering is how he clearly understands the current landscape for what it means to be a Carnegie R1 ‘Very High Research’ institution,” the provost said at the time. “He very clearly understands how we can amplify every aspect of our College of Engineering, so that we can continue to build transcendent programs for engineering education and research.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">By then, Jones had been running the <em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em> for nearly seven years.</p>



<p>Jones <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851">has stated</a> that his reason for starting his own journal was that publishing in top journals took too long and that “many in the field were not able to publish applied papers in this field in a timely fashion.”</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/2">first issue</a>, he was a coauthor on two out of the four articles the journal published. In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/3">second issue</a>, he was the primary author of all three articles.</p>



<p>One of his later articles, which is listed as one of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2028612&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">“main products”</a> of a $199,993 NSF grant, purports to use artificial intelligence to optimize the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines to vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10215577">paper</a> was edited and peer reviewed by three former members of Jones’s laboratory at UTA, and it was accepted two days after submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His work on the pandemic supply chain led the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Jones <a href="https://www.uta.edu/news/news-releases/2021/08/20/erick-jones-fellowship">to select</a> Jones to serve as a Jefferson Science Fellow, advising the chief economist of the U.S. State Department in 2021 and 2022.</p>



<p>After moving to UNR, Jones led a “<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">competitive search</a>” to find a new editor-in-chief for the journal, considering candidates across industry and academics before settling on Mamum Habib, a former visiting scientist in his own lab, according to a press release from the journal. (Jones and Habib also worked together on the <a href="https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/index"><em>International Journal of Supply Chain Management</em></a>,<a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/"> </a>which is published by a company that was listed on <a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/">Beall’s list of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers.</a>)</p>



<p>Jones’s wife, Felicia Jefferson, who recently joined UNR’s Department of Biochemistry and Biology, has also published articles connecting supply chain management to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/256">Deer Season</a>,” “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/30/28">Healthy Hair</a>,” and “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/257">Dragon Fly Research</a>,” which consists of seven sentences about fruit fly sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has recently been awarded <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2341551&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">$299,323</a> from NSF to use artificial intelligence to conduct research on sleep in rural communities, following a theme she has developed&nbsp; in various papers she coauthored with Jones, including those about beauty sleep and train accidents.</p>



<p>“The lab, PI, Dr. Jefferson sees her lab as a smaller more focused version of a NSF scaled ERC center, which focuses on heart disease research through tissue regeneration,” she and Jones write in <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/283/278">another recent article</a>. “Jefferson lab is more focused on AI models in biology that simulate sensor stimulation of brain cells.”</p>



<p>Jefferson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Erick Jones Jr., who was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington just as his father was departing, argues that the journal is a valid avenue to get new ideas out and to help students publish.</p>



<p>“It’s helped me in my career, not for building up my publication record, but just starting conversations,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s undoubtedly a valued part of his father’s business portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal<a href="https://www.iscea.org/journals"> is one of two affiliated with</a> the International Supply Chain Education Alliance, an Ohio corporation which was founded in 2003 and bills itself as “the first organization certifying supply chain professionals around the globe” with thousands of members.</p>



<p>Jones has been involved with the organization for many years and was<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib"> elected</a> president of the company’s standards board in 2020, when the journal first appeared on the company’s website.</p>



<p>Students who<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rfidscp-rfidscm-tickets-139093673923"> spend $1,499</a> for Jones’s three-hour RFID certification course receive a free copy of<a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195"> his book</a>, which is published by the PWD Group.</p>



<p>While working at the University of Texas at Arlington, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lml_4AQ7AFY">he even touted</a> ISCEA certifications to his students.</p>



<p><a href="https://southeast.iu.edu/biographies/index.php?bioID=94">Paul Pittman</a>, a supply chain management expert at Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, says that he has never heard of the ISCEA or the journal. He is the chair-elect of the<a href="https://www.ascm.org/"> Association for Supply Chain Management</a>, which also offers certifications and publishes two journals.</p>



<p>“You can claim anything you want, but the ASCM was established in 1957,” he says.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Edward Wakelam will give a talk entitled &quot;Exploitation of footballer analytics&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There is growing on-going research into how footballer attributes, collected prior to,
during and post-match, may address the demands of clubs, media pundits and gaming
developers. These attributes include static, such as age and height, or dynamic, such as
pass completions and shots on target. Many are objectively measured, such as goals scored
or pass interceptions, but in some cases they are subjectively measured by observers, such
as quality of passing or athleticism. A handful of databases are available to clubs to be
used to assess transfer targets or to assess their current players, however even elite
clubs are failing to exploit this data. Additionally, there is limited application of AI
and Machine Learning methods to exploit the wealth of data available. Critically, very few
of the attributes address character traits, despite their use by the commercial world for
130 years and some well publicised problem player recruitment. I will present an analysis
of the data available collected from available research over the past 25 years,
identifying the mix of static vs dynamic and objective vs subjective data, and draw
attention to the limited character trait content of the data. I will discuss the likely
reason for this and how clubs may develop this dimension of their player analytics.</p>

                <p><br>We&rsquo;re pleased to once again <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our annual </a>reporting from the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a> to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities and operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS has participated in the framework since its pilot phase in 2020 and we&rsquo;ve made all of our reporting transparently available through our blog. As the framework has been largely unchanged from previous years, we aim to keep this update short, but encourage you to look back at our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/">original post</a> for more detail on the categories Plan S provides for allocation, as well as key differences between our journal models.</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency Data 2022</strong></p>



<p>As indicated in the table below, publishers completing the framework are asked to provide the percentage of their Article Processing Charge (APC), per journal associated with eight different categories in order to demonstrate how journals value the allocation of services they provide. The data in the table below reflects the reporting we provided to the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/journal-comparison-service/">Journal Comparison Service</a> at the end of 2023 covering the year 2022 and is based on the publication fee for a Research Article in each journal at that time. You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kbuocrmHRKe_J6gsP1zto-VtZFwSKr4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s changed in 2022?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>New to our reporting this year is the inclusion of <em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Global Public Health, PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water </em>which launched in 2021 but did not begin publishing articles until late that year (in the case of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>) or 2022 for the other titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve highlighted in previous posts, differences in journal editorial structures and services drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated to each category and you&rsquo;ll see that in the breakdown of the new journals. We have also allocated a greater percentage of the APC to &ldquo;Journal Community Development&rdquo; which reflects activities such as editorial board and scope development which are critical to a new journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Not every PLOS author pays an APC</strong><br><strong><br></strong>The numbers above are based on the standard publication fee for each journal, however, it is an important focus for PLOS to expand opportunities for Open Access publishing beyond the dominant APC model. Each of our journals offer institutional partnership models that can significantly reduce or entirely eliminate publication fees for authors. These models each work a little differently to suit the needs of specific journal communities: redistributing the costs of selective publishing more fairly, more equitably accounting for regional economic differences, or simply streamlining APC support. We&rsquo;ve seen consistent growth in partnerships since we launched our first new models in 2020. In 2022 our institutional <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">partnerships nearly doubled </a>to include 181 institutions across 26 countries and we&rsquo;re continuing to invest in growing this support system.</p>



<p>Authors whose funder and institution are based in a Research4Life country are able to publish in PLOS journals for free, or significantly reduced publication fee (details can be found on our <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">website</a>). We also offer publication fee assistance to support authors accepted for publication at one of our journals who demonstrate a lack of funds to pay their publication fees.</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>The price transparency framework provides an objective tool to compare APC breakdowns across publishers. What can get lost in this framework is the detail of those services themselves. As a nonprofit organization, PLOS works alongside researchers and research stakeholders to transform scholarly communication. In each of the broad categories provided by the framework, there are a number of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/">activities</a> and decisions about <em>how </em>we work that drive forward our mission to make scholarly communication more open, equitable, and fair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, our highly regarded publishing ethics team works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by providing career-building resources and educational tools for Open Science. We are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science best-practices</a> across our organization and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">collaborating globally</a> to increase awareness of the benefits of Open Science and co-create pathways that enable more researchers to make their work open. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-sense-temperature-prosthetic-hand-touch">A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new device makes it possible for a person with an amputation to sense temperature with a prosthetic hand. The technology is a step toward prosthetic limbs that restore a full range of senses, improving both their usefulness and acceptance by those who wear them. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A team of researchers in Italy and Switzerland attached the device, called ”MiniTouch,” to the prosthetic hand of a 57-year-old man named Fabrizio, who has an above-the-wrist amputation. In tests, the man could identify cold, cool and hot bottles of liquid with perfect accuracy; tell the difference between plastic, glass and copper significantly better than chance; and <a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(23)00404-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort steel blocks by temperature</a> with around 75 percent accuracy, researchers report February 9 in <em>Med</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s important to incorporate these technologies in a way that prosthesis users can actually use to perform functional tasks,” says neuroengineer Luke Osborn of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who was not involved in the study. “Introducing new sensory feedback modalities could help give users more functionality they weren’t able to achieve before.”</p>



<p>The device also improved Fabrizio’s ability to tell whether he was touching an artificial or human arm. His accuracy was 80 percent with the device turned on, compared with 60 percent with it off. “It’s not quite as good as with the intact hand, probably because we’re not giving [information about] skin textures,” says neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p>



<p>Work to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-prosthetic-leg-senses-touch-reduces-phantom-pain">restore a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs</a> has advanced greatly over the past decade (<em>SN: 9/9/19</em>). But the ability to detect temperature has lagged behind. “Temperature is almost the last modality that needs to be solved in order to then put all the results together and be able to make an artificial limb really feel as the biological one,” says EPFL engineer Jonathan Muheim.</p>



<p>The study builds on work the group published last May, which found that people who have had amputations often have spots on their residual limbs that, when heated or cooled, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf6121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate temperature sensations in their missing hand</a>. It’s caused by stimulating nerves originally destined for the missing hand. The researchers showed they could reliably elicit phantom temperature sensations over time in 63 percent of amputees.</p>



<p>In the new study, Shokur, Muheim and colleagues first mapped Fabrizio’s phantom temperature sensations to match a spot on his arm to the corresponding sensation in the index finger of his missing hand. They then attached a temperature sensor to the fingertip of his prosthetic hand, which was connected via a controller unit to a device on Fabrizio’s arm that delivered appropriate temperature signals.</p>

<p>Currently the device employs only one sensor at the end of the index finger, but the team plans to add sensor-stimulator pairs to create more temperature-sensitive locations on the prosthetic hand. They are also planning to develop a prosthesis that combines the ability to sense touch as well as temperature. “In the coming year or so, hopefully that’s where we’ll be,” says Shokur.</p>



<p>The speed at which the device relays temperature may become an issue when combining multiple senses.

<p>In the immediate term, the new device needs to be tested in larger groups of participants, as well as real world settings, to ensure it isn’t adversely affected by high air temperatures or humidity. “We still need to do those crash tests outside the lab,” says Shokur.</p>



<p>Once it leaves the lab, Fabrizio already knows how he’d put it to use. &#8220;With these new technologies, I can understand better what I am touching,” Fabrizio said in a prerecorded video interview. “Certainly, my priority would be to use it in a kitchen&nbsp;to&nbsp;cook.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-internet-communication-rover-psyche">How to build an internet on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When astronauts land on Mars, a couple of decades from now, perhaps, they’ll need to find a way to communicate — with each other, with equipment on and around the planet, and with mission control back on Earth. Despite living so far from home, they’ll no doubt want to connect with loved ones, keep their playlists up-to-date or stream the latest episodes of their favorite shows.</p>



<p>But setting up a Wi-Fi connection to Earth’s internet won’t be an option. Earth is simply too far away — around 55 million to 400 million kilometers, depending on where the planets are in their orbits. Spacefarers will need another strategy.</p>



<p>Establishing a good communications infrastructure is essential for human missions to Mars, says Claire Parfitt, a systems engineer with the European Space Agency, or ESA, who is based in Noordwijk, Netherlands. “At the moment, we’re in the early stages of working out what that means.”</p>



<p>Researchers are testing ways to upgrade existing networks, along with some far-out alternatives. For example, NASA’s Psyche mission, which lifted off in October with the job of <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploring an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter</a>, will also test interplanetary communication using lasers. Lasers could carry far more data than the radio waves that have been used from the earliest days of space travel.</p>



<p>No known strategies can get rid of the time lag in communications between Earth and Mars; a message moving at the speed of light takes anywhere between four and 24 minutes for a one-way trip. In other words, a quick ping to mission control is out of the question, not to mention a WhatsApp call home.</p>



<p>There’s also the issue of solar conjunction, says Parfitt, when the sun comes between Earth and Mars. This happens for a couple of weeks every two years or so, cutting off communications between the planets. The last one took place in November.</p>



<p>But new approaches could open possibilities that make communications on Mars more akin to what we experience here on Earth. At least one research team has wondered: What if Mars had its own internet?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How Mars communication works today</h4>



<p>Several space agencies have landers, rovers and satellites already at Mars that have to communicate with Earth.</p>



<p>Consider NASA’s Perseverance rover. It sends and receives two kinds of information. One is command and telemetry, where operators on Earth send instructions, receive information and make decisions on what to do next. Percy typically receives over 1,000 commands from Earth every day. The second is the science data — pictures of Martian rocks, for example — that Percy collects. The <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/379/nasas-ingenuity-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helicopter Ingenuity</a>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-ends-mission">ended its mission earlier this year</a>, also regularly pinged the rover, which served as a base station to relay data and commands between Ingenuity and Earth. Orbiters circling the planet, including <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Mars Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>, or MRO, and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars/Trace_Gas_Orbiter_instruments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter, or TGO</a>, similarly send science data back home.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Calling Earth</h3>



<p>Perseverance and other Mars rovers get most commands directly from Earth via X band radio waves. Though Percy can send small amounts of data directly, it often uses ultrahigh-frequency, or UHF, radio waves to transmit data to one of the orbiters in the Mars Relay Network, which have big antennas for sending data to Earth. Percy also served as a base station for communication with the helicopter Ingenuity.</p>

<p>A lot of the communication with Mars is routed through the Mars Relay Network in what NASA describes as “a tightly choreographed dance.” This network of five orbiters around Mars — MRO, TGO, MAVEN, Mars Odyssey and Mars Express — transmits information via antennas pointed toward Earth.</p>



<p>A rover that needs to send its latest observations back to Earth first passes the data along to one of the orbiters using ultrahigh-frequency radio transmissions. If that orbiter doesn’t have a line of sight to Earth, it can hold on to the information until it does. The data are then relayed toward Earth, where powerful radio antennas distributed across the globe are always listening for pings from deep space.</p>



<p>Once a human crew lands on Mars, this system will not be good enough. Vincent Chan, a researcher in fiber-optic and satellite communications at MIT, doesn’t foresee local, on-the-ground communication as a challenge. A Martian crew can interact using radio frequency and existing wireless technologies, he says. Two mini cell towers would be enough when the astronauts are close together, and a relay of some kind could be used when the astronauts are far enough apart that messages have to be sent over the horizon. People living in remote regions of Earth communicate in a similar way all the time. “Those services are already in play,” Chan says, and “very economical.”</p>



<p>A big antenna on the crew’s landing vehicle, pointed toward Earth, would probably be the very first infrastructure Martian explorers would set up, Chan says, but then things could get more challenging. When that ground-based antenna doesn’t have a direct line of sight, astronauts could use orbital relays akin to the Mars Relay Network to communicate with Earth. Several orbiters would have to be available for round-the-clock coverage, and they’d need to be optimized for heavy data transfer.</p>



<p>ESA is currently looking at making today’s relay network more robust. It is in the early stages of considering a concept called the Mars Communication and Navigation Infrastructure, or MARCONI. If it moves forward, the project will develop a set of communication- and navigation-related payloads that could piggyback on any mission headed to Mars.</p>



<p>Once deployed into orbit, these payloads would act as nodes to provide radio communication on and with Mars, Parfitt explains. They could then stick around for use on future missions. “The more mass you land, the more expensive it is, so you wouldn’t necessarily want to land massive communication systems on Mars every time,” she says.</p>



<p>Though traditional radio frequencies would suffice for low data rates, using a laser link could carry 10 to 100 times as much data in the same time frame. Because of the higher frequencies of optical waves, hundreds of thousands of times those of radio waves, much more information can be packed in. Thus, this type of optical signal is just where space communication may be headed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laser communication in space</h4>



<p>The Psyche spacecraft, launched last October, will test the feasibility of long-distance laser communications as it heads toward Psyche, the metal-rich asteroid it’s going to explore. The spacecraft carries NASA’s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission/deep-space-optical-communications-dsoc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Space Optical Communications</a>, or DSOC, technology.</p>



<p>Using lasers for space communication isn’t new, but they have never been tested from distances farther than the moon. In mid-November, Psyche beamed data to Earth <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-deep-space-optical-comm-demo-sends-receives-first-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a distance of 16 million kilometers</a> — 40 times farther than the moon. In December, it <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tech-demo-streams-first-video-from-deep-space-via-laser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a video of a cat named Taters</a> from 31 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>ESA is also exploring long-distance optical communication. One program called ScyLight, short for Secure and Laser Communication Technology and pronounced <em>skylight</em>, is <a href="https://connectivity.esa.int/artes-40-scylight-overview-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting the research and development of optical and quantum technologies</a> for secure and fast data communication from space.</p>



<p>Despite the benefits, optical communication requires ultraprecision in aiming the signal. Unlike radio communications, optical signals are sent in a narrow beam that has to point exactly at the receiver. What’s more, cloud cover and atmospheric effects also interfere with lasers.</p>



<p>Any shift toward optical communications would mean <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-new-experimental-antenna-tracks-deep-space-laser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some upgrades to the existing radio antennas</a> that listen for messages from deep space — called the Deep Space Network — or new infrastructure.</p>



<p>Though it’s closer than Mars, the moon offers learning opportunities for future connectivity. As part of the Artemis program, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">aims to return humans to the moon</a>, NASA has contracted private companies to set up a lunar 4G&nbsp;network for telecommunications. Such networks are based on radio waves and would include installing antennas and base stations that can withstand the harsh lunar landscape.</p>



<p>An ESA program called Moonlight invites private space companies to set up a constellation of communication satellites around the moon, including for regions that don’t have direct visibility to Earth. The first phase of the program includes the launch of the Lunar Pathfinder orbiter, currently planned for 2026.</p>



<p>“Everything that is being done for the moon, it’s got the objective of taking humans and missions to Mars,” says Tomas Navarro, who is based in London and is a future projects engineer with ESA.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An internet on Mars</h4>



<p>Those Martian explorers, not to mention future inhabitants, will no doubt want to do more than send messages back and forth. They’ll want a setup akin to Earth’s internet, which we use for everything from sharing photos to accessing massive databases. In June 2023, Tobias Pfandzelter and David Bermbach of Technische Universität Berlin proposed that a fleet of satellites orbiting Mars could provide the Red Planet with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own offshoot internet</a>.</p>



<p>Most of us here on Earth access the internet through our phones using radio-frequency radiation on either wireless 4G or 5G networks or through Wi-Fi routers. These connections are linked via fiber-optic cables around the world. The proposed Mars network would instead be similar to Starlink, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">a constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit</a> operated by SpaceX. On Earth, broadband internet and mobile phone coverage via satellite is expensive, but on Mars, such a system might be cheaper and easier to build than an expansive and robust network on the ground.</p>



<p>Pfandzelter and Bermbach are both experts in cloud computing — the delivery of computing services over the internet. For their proposed Martian internet, they extrapolated concepts from edge computing, in which information is processed close to where it is collected.</p>



<p>Michael Clegg, a general manager at the technology company Supermicro, based in San Jose, Calif., has explained edge computing <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/7/edge-computing-explained-plain-english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the analogy of a popular pizza restaurant</a> “that opens smaller branches in more neighborhoods, since a pie baked at the main location would get cold on its way to a distant customer.” Edge computing generally relies on base stations on the ground to store and relay the data, but low Earth orbit satellites are now being seen as an alternative.</p>

<p>Pfandzelter and Bermbach concluded that a constellation of 81 low-orbit satellites around Mars would be good enough for planetwide coverage. They would provide a local communications system that would be an extension of Earth’s internet.</p>



<p>Consider an astronaut on Mars trying to catch up on a Netflix show. “If you were to stream it from Earth, you would have to first wait 10, 15 or even 40&nbsp;minutes,” Pfandzelter says, and that’s just to connect. It would be a frustrating stop-and-start affair. And if another astronaut on Mars wanted to watch the same movie, they have to go through the same process all over again.</p>



<p>Instead, a cloud data storage system on Mars could make movies easy to access. “You could just have the same experience that you have on Earth, because all your data is locally copied,” he says. Meanwhile, other uploads and downloads to and from Earth, such as science data, could continue in the background.</p>



<p>Putting internet satellites into orbit around Mars would also be economical because it wouldn’t require landing infrastructure on the surface; landing equipment can make up a big chunk of a mission’s budget. “It would be much cheaper to just send a bunch of networking satellites to Mars, and just keep them in orbit,” says Pfandzelter.</p>



<p>It’s similar to a scaled-up version of the MARCONI concept (and could use radio or optical waves, depending on the state of those technologies).</p>



<p>Even if arrival on Mars is decades away, Parfitt says, it’s not too soon to start planning. Live video-chatting between planets is out of the realm of scientific possibility. Unless there is a major upheaval in the laws of physics, messages won’t ever be able to travel faster than the speed of light. “It’s not a problem to be solved. It’s just a problem.”</p>



<p>But other limitations can be overcome. Tackling those challenges may not only benefit future astronauts on Mars but may also help get them there sooner.</p>



<p>“When you put in an infrastructure like that,” Parfitt says, “you see many, many more missions being proposed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-bites-attack-2023">Here’s how many shark bites there were in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the sensationalized portrayal of sharks in movies like <em>Jaws</em>, the ocean’s apex predators have far more to fear from people than vice versa.</p>



<p>Even though millions of people around the world swim in the ocean each year, just 91 people were bitten by sharks in 2023 and only 10 of those bites were fatal, according to a new report from the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. Out of all bites, 69 were unprovoked while 22 were provoked, defined as a human-initiated interaction such as trying to touch or feed a shark. These numbers — reported by beach safety officers, hospital staff and other emergency responders — are consistent with the five-year global average.</p>



<p>The fact that so few bites occur each year “gives us a pretty strong indication that sharks are trying to avoid us,” says Joe Miguez, a marine ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who compiled data for the report. If sharks thought humans were prey, he says, there might be &#8220;thousands of shark attacks each day.”</p>



<p>In 2023, more than half of unprovoked shark bites happened in the United States, with a total of 36. That’s down from 41 the previous year. Following long-term trends, nearly one-quarter of all unprovoked bites globally occurred in Florida. This is due to the state’s ample coastline, abundant prey fish and year-round human swimmers.</p>



<p>One uptick in 2023 was fatalities, at 10 — double the amount in 2022. But put in historical perspective, shark bite fatalities are actually decreasing, on average, as people respond more quickly and effectively to treat bite wounds, says shark biologist Neil Hammerschlag, founder of <a href="https://atlanticsharkexp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic Shark Expeditions</a> in Boutiliers Point, Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>&#8220;These fatalities usually aren&#8217;t a result of a shark eating someone. It&#8217;s a result of blood loss,” says Hammerschlag, who was not affiliated with the report. Sharks use their teeth much like humans use their hands, he says, as sensory structures to test their environment.</p>



<p>Notably, of the nearly 550 known species of sharks, only three caused fatalities in 2023: great white sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>), bull sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) and tiger sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>).</p>



<p>Four of the 10 fatalities last year were caused by great whites: three in southern Australia and one in California. This is probably because “pockets of white shark populations are growing,” particularly in areas where seals, a main food source for sharks, have rebounded from near extinction, says Gavin Naylor of the University of Florida.</p>



<p>Seal colonies are often found near surf breaks, which also attract surfers. “Going forwards, it&#8217;s likely that these bites from white sharks might be a little bit more commonplace” as more people surf and shark populations continue to grow, says Naylor, a shark population geneticist and program director of the university’s <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Shark Attack File</a>.</p>



<p>The intent of compiling shark bite data is two-fold, Naylor says: to protect people from sharks and to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-we-need-predators">help these keystone predators thrive</a> (<em>SN: 9/17/15</em>). Shark populations have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03173-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plummeted by more than 70 percent</a> globally over the past half century, due mainly to increased fishing pressure that’s depleted their food sources.</p>



<p>“These ancient creatures have been on the planet 100 times longer than humans,” Naylor says, and have “magical tricks” — such as many shark species’ ability to move from saltwater to freshwater — that can teach us a lot about how other creatures survive.</p>



<p>While the odds of being bitten by a shark are incredibly slim, Naylor offers <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/reduce-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple advice for avoiding shark bites</a>: “Don’t swim alone. Don&#8217;t swim too far from shore. Don’t swim at dawn or dusk.”</p>

<p>An Indian paper mill featuring prominently in our <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">recent investigation</a> in <em>Science</em> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">a companion piece</a> on our website shut down its WhatsApp community six days after the stories ran, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The company, called iTrilon, used the messaging platform to hawk authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals.” It claimed to have connections at journals that allowed the mill to guarantee acceptance of most of its papers.</p>



<p>But on January 24, <a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww">Sarath Ranganathan</a>, iTrilon’s scientific director, deactivated the WhatsApp community he had been curating.</p>



<span id="more-128723"></span>



<p>“That’s big,” said Siddhesh Zadey, a PhD student at Columbia University and co-founder of the India-based <a href="https://www.asarforindia.org/">think tank ASAR</a>, who joined the iTrilon community last year and was a key source for our investigation. “I think it took [Ranganathan] about two years to build such a large group on WhatsApp.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/24_JUN_23_SZ_IMG-20230624-WA0018.jpg">an infographic</a> from last May, the Chennai-based company at the time had published “219+ papers” for clients in “21+” countries. The size of its WhatsApp community is not clear, but it likely exceeded 1,024, the maximum number of members in a WhatsApp “group.” In the platform’s terminology, a “community” is a collection of “groups.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company has also taken down <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">its website</a> and LinkedIn profiles.</p>



<p>Ranganathan did not answer calls to his WhatsApp number.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593129722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Moon</a><br><em>Rebecca Boyle</em><br><em>Random House, $28.99</em></p>



<p>Science journalist Rebecca Boyle has an intergenerational connection with the moon. Her grandfather Pfc. John J. Corcoran was involved in the 1943 Battle of Tarawa on the namesake atoll in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. The United States’ narrow victory against Japan came at heavy human cost. One reason: A weak high tide forced American soldiers to wade through the ocean into Japanese gunfire rather than sail their boats to meet their enemies.</p>



<p>Historians blame the moon for the massive casualties — the battle occurred during a time of month when the sun’s and moon’s gravitational tugs partially cancel each other out, contributing to the lower-than-usual high tide.</p>



<p>Boyle, however, recognizes that the moon’s impact on humankind is far more vast and multifaceted. After all, the moon helped shape Earth into the home we know, she writes in her new book, <em>Our Moon</em>. At the outset, Boyle promises to convince readers of the moon’s extensive influences, both biological and spiritual. Over nearly 300 pages, she delivers.</p>



<p>Naturally, the book touches on well-known subjects, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/core-memory-weavers-navajo-apollo-raytheon-computer-nasa">the Apollo missions</a> that brought humans to the lunar surface (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>). Still, the book is guaranteed to surprise, filled with factoid gold that will enthrall geologists, moon nerds and casual readers alike. For instance, Boyle incorporates new research on how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-formed-moon-earth-mantle">moon formed 4.5 billion years ago</a>, pointing to geologic evidence that may still be entombed deep within Earth’s mantle (<em>SN: 11/1/23</em>). And contrary to what Apollo photos suggest, the moon’s surface sparkles with technicolor hues, astronauts reported. “The Moon was not gray, but a landscape flecked with color,” Boyle writes. “Analysis of the Moon rocks has since found volcanic glass in every color of the spectrum.”</p>



<p>And then there are the ways the moon has influenced life on Earth. The tides pulled our ocean-confined ancestors out of the water. Extremes between high and low tides in the distant past kept beaching marine life; those that could breathe in air or developed limbs for walking became the earliest landlubbers. Acting as a mini counterweight to the Earth’s own heft, the moon has kept our planet’s axis from lurching all over the place, thereby preventing extreme climate swings over millennia. The moon also inspired the first religions, and its study spawned the first science.</p>



<p>Boyle packs in an impressive amount of information. But instead of throwing details at the reader, she packages them into imagined experiences of a lunar visitor. The result is a rich travelog that makes the moon’s sensations visceral, down to its acrid smell and the hay fever you’d get from exposure to pesky <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-wears-dusty-cloak">lunar dust</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/13</em>). Early humans brought the distant moon down to Earth through patient observation and art. Now, Boyle brings readers up there.</p>



<p>With much ground to cover, she divides the book into three sections: the moon’s making, its cultural footprint and how modern society recast the moon in a new light. Rather than adhering to a strict chronology, Boyle roams under these three broad umbrellas. Her discussions within each section come in palatable bite sizes and swing between the ancient and modern, culture and science.</p>



<p>That masterful weaving is on display when Boyle recounts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-time-calendar-ancient-human-art">the moon’s role in keeping track of time</a> (<em>SN: 7/9/19</em>). “Time confers power to whoever commands it,” she writes, and it remains “the simplest and most predictable way to seize that command.” Stone Age Scots, Mesopotamians and Native Americans understood the power of the lunar cycles, and they erected monuments to track the moon’s trek across the sky. But around 45 B.C., Julius Caesar designed a calendar that banished the moon from its timekeeping duties. Now, society mostly looks to the sun as our daily metronome.</p>



<p>Today, we’re at another juncture where the moon might further drop from its standing of reverence and communion. Soon, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">astronauts will return there</a>, with the United States, China and other countries scoping out landing sites <em>(SN: 11/16/22</em>). Instead of being endeavors for the benefit of all humankind, these explorations will probably be a nationalistic race for scientific real estate, Boyle warns. Our heavenly neighbor is also being eyed as a mining outpost, a junkyard, a waystation for deep space travel or a settlement destination. The moon, she worries, may fall into the ravenous maw of capitalism.</p>



<p>Still, the moon is more than just another target for humankind’s material ambitions. <em>Our Moon</em> reminds us that our “silvery sister” has given us our habitable climate, sciences and cultures. These gifts are more than enough; they are priceless.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/new-neural-implant-translates-brainwaves-into-words-for-natural-communication">New neural implant translates brainwaves into words for natural communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a future in which individuals can regain the ability to communicate almost naturally through a brain-computer interface. In a new development, a team of Duke University researchers has unveiled a cutting-edge speech prosthetic that holds promise for individuals suffering with speech-impairing neurological disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The prosthetic features 256 brain sensors on a small, flexible piece of medical grade plastic, and aims to convert neural signals from the speech motor cortex into realistic speech using both these high-density sensors and machine learning. The study included four participants, all with some form of pre-existing motor disorders, such as ALS, and were subsequently undergoing brain surgery. The researchers collaborated with surgeons during the surgery, implanting the device in participants' brains as they engaged in a speech repetition task. During this task, participants heard unfamiliar/nonsensical words, such as “Yak”, and were instructed to repeat them. The speech prosthetic recorded activity from the brain as participants coordinated the muscles involved in speech, acting as a tool to capture and decode related brain signals, and translating this intended speech into audible words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the initial trials, the prosthetic demonstrated an impressive 40% accuracy in converting brain signals into ‘spoken words’. The algorithm uses this data to predict the intended speech sounds based on the brain activity recordings. What makes this achievement notable is that the interface achieved this level of accuracy with just 90 seconds of data, a significantly shorter duration compared to the extensive datasets typically required by other existing methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we apply this?</strong></p>

<p>In the future, research on these types of prosthetics could revolutionise current assistive technologies for individuals with speech-impairing neurological disorders. This device promises faster and more natural verbal communication than through neural speech prostheses. With 256 high-density brain sensors on a flexible substrate and machine learning adaptability, it provides a more comprehensive and personalised communication experience than conventional methods. Its future integration with communication aids might enable real-time speech decoding, fostering dynamic conversations and accommodating larger vocabularies. Furthermore, the researchers aim to develop this research further and create a cordless device for speech deciphering.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What challenges need to be overcome?</strong></p>

<p>While this innovative technology represents a significant leap forward from existing communication aids. The main hurdle for future advancements lies in addressing the current decoding speed, which falls behind natural speech and achieves an accuracy level of approximately 40%. However, at present the researchers are optimistic about possibilities of refining the technology to match the rapid pace of natural speech, bringing it closer to mainstream availability, and potentially transforming the lives of those with speech-related challenges.</p>
