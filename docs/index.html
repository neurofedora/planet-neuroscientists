<p>In a move one research ethics expert called “odd,” a university asked one of its professors to attend a remedial integrity course — despite their “significant concerns” the training would have any impact following findings of misconduct.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/19/faked-heart-papers-retracted-following-ohio-state-investigation/">In 2024</a>, Retraction Watch covered the case of <a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/govindasamy-ilangovan-phd">Govindasamy Ilangovan</a>, then an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at The Ohio State University. We reported at that time two of his papers were retracted from <em>Heart and Circulatory Physiology</em> at the request of the university, and that university officials had requested a third retraction. Thanks to a public records request, we now have access to the university’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20231120-Final-Investigation-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">2023 final investigation report</a>, which provides us much more information. </p>



<p>The released material shows a committee of the university’s research integrity officers found Ilangovan responsible for manipulating images in three papers. OSU redacted the total number of images in question, but the investigators deemed it “very concerning.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134246"></span>



<p>Ilangovan “failed to take any responsibility” for issues with the data, the report reads, and the committee requested he attend the PI Program through Washington University in St. Louis within one year. That program teaches researchers “decision-making skills, good lab leadership and management practices, and basic rules-of-the-road for the responsible conduct of research,” <a href="https://integrityprogram.org/">according to its homepage</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/govindasamy-ilangovan.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="85" height="119" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/govindasamy-ilangovan.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134250" style="width:150px"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Govindasamy Ilangovan</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>In 2022, 14 months before the report was finalized, Ilangovan requested the misconduct proceedings be terminated “without an admission,” according to the document. Despite being shown “overwhelming evidence that there were serious issues” with his papers, Ilangovan maintained the validity of his papers’ conclusions.</p>



<p>“The primary concern for a scientist should be the integrity of the published research record and in these circumstances, the voluntary retraction of the questioned publications would be expected,” the research integrity officers wrote. They expressed “significant concerns that additional training will have a meaningful impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>C.K. Gunsalus, an expert on university research misconduct, told us sending someone to remedial training makes sense for “certain kinds of problems that are, in fact, remedial: recordkeeping, some supervision practices, compliance issues, time management, etc.” We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/08/poll-should-researchers-guilty-of-misconduct-go-to-rehab/">reported</a> in 2016 a three-day “researcher rehab” had a “lasting impact” on scientists with shortcomings like these, with the “vast majority” changing how they work in the lab.</p>



<p>Although she called OSU’s research integrity committee &#8220;diligent in the investigation itself,&#8221; Gunsalus said &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty odd that they&#8217;re saying we have concerns about this person&#8217;s commitment to fundamental integrity and so we think he ought to get management and logistics help.”</p>



<p>The committee &#8220;seems to have made some judgments and then flinched at the consequences,” said Gunsalus, Director of the National Center for Principled Leadership &amp; Research Ethics and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Booker, OSU’s director of media and public relations, told us Ilangovan is no longer affiliated with the university and would not comment further on the personnel matter. An email sent to Ilangovan’s OSU email address bounced back, and he did not respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>A representative for Washington University told us they could neither confirm nor deny whether Ilangovan attended the remedial program, because “clients and all information related to study participation is strictly confidential.” Similarly, Booker would not comment on whether Ilangovan attended the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the PI training, the OSU investigation committee recommended a three-person OSU panel review all Ilangovan’s data for grants and papers for three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Ilangovan’s two now-retracted papers had a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_COR">correction</a> in 2021 for a figure that was “inaccurate because of the reuse and relabeling,” as we previously reported. The recently obtained investigation report indicates Ilangovan falsified data in that correction.</p>



<p>The identity of the third paper OSU said should be retracted, as well as details of the investigation pertaining to the article, are redacted from the report. However, footnotes in both the 2022 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20220907-Final-Inquiry-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">preliminary inquiry</a> (which we also obtained through a public records request) and the final 2023 investigation report cite a December 2019 PubPeer comment, and only one of Ilangovan’s papers has drawn a PubPeer comment matching that description: a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/111/1/74/1744883">2016 article</a> appearing in <em>Cardiovascular Research.</em> The <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C0671222DAAB88141BC447719CA6">anonymous commenter</a> pointed out possible “[d]uplicate images representing different experimental groups.” </p>



<p>Booker did not respond when we asked whether the university requested retraction of the <em>Cardiovascular Research</em> paper. Tomasz Guzik, the editor-in-chief of the journal, also did not respond when we asked if he had heard from the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three papers together cite just shy of $1 million in National Institutes of Health grant funding given to Ilangovan. He told the investigating committee the grants were cited in the two retracted papers “just to describe the use of some equipment and other resources of the funded projects as used to carry out the experiments,” according to the 2022 inquiry report.</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-ohio-state-university-decided-go-public-about-misconduct">we reported in <em>Science</em></a> that, following criticisms about transparency failures, OSU proactively released materials about another researcher guilty of misconduct. In that case, the committee recommended the retraction of eight papers.</p>

<p>Racking up <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLouis%252c%2bHitler">35 retractions</a> in just 24 months, chemist Hitler Louis has scored a place on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers at issue, most of them published in Elsevier and Royal Society of Chemistry journals, exhibit a variety of problems, according to the retraction notices: identical plots supposedly representing different chemical systems, self-citations multiplying between manuscript submission and publication, compromised peer review and fundamental errors in chemical analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Louis – who also goes by Louis Hitler Muzong – did not respond to Retraction Watch’s requests for comment. Until recently, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-hitler-50115273">his LinkedIn page</a> named him as a Ph.D. student in computational chemistry at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom, with an expected completion date of October 2027. But retraction notices for two papers say Louis requested his Leeds affiliation be removed. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X24000343">states</a> “the research described in the article is not associated with that institution,” and the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11976393/">other</a> that the affiliation “was given incorrectly.” The University of Leeds did not respond to a request to verify whether he was a student there.</p>



<span id="more-134232"></span>



<p>Since we sent him questions, Louis’ LinkedIn profile appears to have been scrubbed. It no longer includes mention of Leeds, nor does it include previously listed affiliations to the University of Calabar in Nigeria or the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Now, the page identifies him only as working in chemistry in Nigeria. According to his profiles on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=REjDFWYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en#:~:text=Computational%20and%20Bio%2DSimulation%20Research%20Group%2C%20University%20of,9347%E2%80%AC%E2%80%AC%20%2D%20%E2%80%AADensity%20functional%20theory%E2%80%AC%20%2D%20%E2%80%AANanotechnology%E2%80%AC">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Louis-Hitler-Lab#:~:text=About%20the%20lab,Molecular%20Docking%2C%20MD%20Simulation%20etc.">ResearchGate</a>, however, Louis is a researcher in the Computational Chemistry and BioSimulation Research Group at the University of Calabar.</p>

<p>The most frequently named issue in the 35 retraction notices is that the authors use the same plots to represent different chemical systems, with duplications occurring in a single paper or across papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Innocent Benjamin, who appears as a coauthor with Louis on 19 of the retracted papers, graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a master’s in biology and biotechnology in 2025, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/innocent-benjamin-mrsc-mnsm-macs-/">his LinkedIn profile</a>. Benjamin told us editorial concerns about image duplication “were largely centred on figure presentation and interpretation, not on fabrication of computational data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was no intent to misrepresent results,” he wrote. “The issue concerned visual presentation and interpretability rather than generation of artificial data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In at least eight of the retractions, named problems include citation manipulation. By the time one paper went from submission to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12675098/">publication in <em>Heliyon</em></a>, the authors had added 28 citations that were “not relevant to the topic of the paper and benefit authors,” including Louis, according to the retraction notice. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023078908">another <em>Heliyon</em> paper</a>, between submission and publication, self-citations for Louis increased from seven to 38 and from two to nine for Benjamin. And in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023052751">a third Heliyon paper</a>, self-citations jumped from one to 14 for Louis and from two to 11 for Benjamin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices state the authors were asked to explain why these references were added but were unable to give satisfactory answers. Benjamin told us that the references were included to provide context within their stream of research.</p>



<p>Two of the retraction notices also point to compromised peer review. These include <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023052751">one in <em>Heliyon</em></a><em> </em>in which reviewers had asked for redundant references to their own papers, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X24000343">another in <em>Computational and Theoretical Chemistry</em></a><em>, </em>where editors expressed “significant doubts about the objectivity and thoroughness of the reviews conducted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of these journals, said the reviewers had provided “biased and inaccurate reviews,” resulting in “flawed” articles. “It was subsequently determined that the issues identified warranted retraction rather than a corrigendum,” the spokesperson said. Twenty of Louis’ 35 retractions come from Elsevier journals. The spokesperson said they found out about the issues from a whistleblower and that investigation is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021016479">One <em>Heliyon</em> retraction notice</a> identified “substantial” changes in authorship during the editorial process. Between submission and publication, five authors were added and one removed without adequate explanation or proof those added were qualified for authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several more of the retraction notices identify problems with the science. One paper retracted from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667022424000033"><em>Chemical Physics Impact</em></a> included incorrect chemistry, and the authors claimed in the abstract to have analyzed UV spectroscopy data — an analysis which wasn’t included in the paper or the supplementary information. Another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-23572-0">retracted paper</a> from <em>Scientific Reports</em> had basic errors related to the conversion of units and incorrect calculations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retractions that include Benjamin, Louis’ frequent coauthor, date to August 2024, when Benjamin was a student at the University of Portsmouth. A spokesperson for that institution told us, “The retractions you reference relate to publications outside the scope of [Benjamin’s] degree studies,” adding the university only investigates conduct related to work for a specific degree.</p>



<p>Benjamin said he is “cooperating fully” with ongoing investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While retractions are serious matters, they are part of the self-correcting structure of science,” he said. “As a relatively young researcher, I remain committed to research integrity and to maintaining rigorous methodological standards in all ongoing and future research.”</p>

<p>After reading a recent study about GLP-1 treatment in the <em>International Journal of Obesity</em>, David B. Allison immediately became skeptical about the paper’s analysis. The article, published in May 2024, found people who combined a GLP-1 therapy with another weight loss drug lost more weight than patients on a GLP-1 therapy alone.  </p>



<p>“I could not really comprehend exactly what analysis they did,” Allison, chief of nutrition and director of the Children&#8217;s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told Retraction Watch. “And more so, I could not comprehend how the analysis they did would give results that would be informative of the conclusions they drew. So I was scratching my head a little bit.”</p>



<p>The <em>IJO</em> paper was a retrospective cohort study of adults with obesity who had been prescribed a GLP-1 therapy, specifically Saxenda and Ozempic. The study compared patients who received a GLP-1 alone with those receiving the GLP-1 therapy and then had bupropion/naltrexone added to their regimen. <a href="https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2014/takeda-and-orexigen-announce-fda-approval-of-contrave-naltrexone-hci-and-bupropion-hci-extended-release-tablets-for-chronic-weight-management/">The Food and Drug Administration</a> approved bupropion/naltrexone in 2014 for chronic weight management in obese adults. </p>



<span id="more-134222"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01526-2">The study found</a> the combination regimen resulted in a small but significant extra weight loss for patients, resulting in roughly 4% additional total body weight loss over six and 12 months.</p>

<p>Allison, who has worked for a decade on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/530027a">correcting statistical errors</a> in the nutrition literature, asked some of his mentees to see if they “could make sense” of the paper’s analysis, he said. But the group also had trouble understanding it, he said.&nbsp; With the authors’ cooperation, Allison’s team reviewed the raw data associated with the findings, ultimately concluding the results were not fully reproducible, said Allison, who serves as a statistical editor for the journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After looking into Allison’s findings, <em>IJO</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-025-02006-x">retracted the article</a> in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer confirmed it launched an investigation into the article after “a member of the journal’s editorial board raised concerns about the validity of its conclusions,” Maria Hodges, publishing director for biomedicine at Springer, said by email.</p>



<p>“This involved an assessment of the article’s original data by one of the journal’s statistical editors and members of their research team, in addition to consultation with the article’s authors, independent experts, the journal’s Editors<strong>&#8211;</strong>in<strong>&#8211;</strong>Chief, and the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group,” Hodges told us. “Following this, the Editors-in-Chief concluded that the main finding of this article is not substantiated and that retraction was the appropriate editorial action to take.”</p>



<p>All authors disagreed with the retraction, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-025-02006-x">retraction notice states</a>.</p>



<p>Nadia Khan,&nbsp; a clinician scientist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the principal investigator on the study, told us she and her colleagues&nbsp; “felt they couldn’t accept a retraction unless they had more information on what the specific issues were, and whether the issues constituted enough of a departure to warrant a retraction.” Khan and two other authors also practice at <a href="https://www.revolutionmedicalclinic.com/ourteam">Revolution Medical Clinic</a>, a Vancouver clinic that provides obesity and metabolic disease treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khan said the authors were “forthcoming with immediately supplying all raw data and all statistical codes to the journal,” when asked. She declined to answer further questions, but said authors are preparing a reply letter in defense of their study to submit to the journal.</p>



<p>The <em>IJO</em> paper garnered some attention when it came out, including at least <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/163241704/news">six news</a> summaries and about <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/163241704/twitter">40 posts</a> on X. The study has been cited eight times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>In addition to unverifiable results, Allison said his team found “further things that seemed questionable.” He declined to go into detail about what those things were, but said his team has summarized the specifics in a report that will be published in the journal.</p>



<p>Allison added the <em>IJO</em> paper is related to the idea of “treatment response heterogeneity,” a growing field of study. <a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/EVIDe2400054">Heterogeneity of treatment</a> effect is the nonrandom variability in treatment effects for patients within a population.</p>



<p>“I do think the field needs to up its game in terms of getting people to understand what are reasonable and legitimate methods for studying treatment response heterogeneity,” he said.</p>



<p>Allison said he was pleased with how <em>IJO</em> handled the concerns about the article, especially considering the “tremendous variability” among journals in their willingness to fix reported errors, correct or retract articles, and take prompt action, he told us.&nbsp; Another paper his group critiqued in <em>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine </em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9829387">was retracted</a> more than three years after his team first raised concerns about the paper. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/18/prompt-and-decisive-editor-says-obesity-study-will-be-retracted-after-critique/">other cases</a>, editors have taken <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02601060241254944">swifter action</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m very pleased with the <em>IJO </em>journal editors that they&#8217;re taking matters seriously, and I think it would be good if more journal editors followed their example,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Update, Feb. 23, 2026: The first paragraph of the article was edited to clarify the two treatment groups.</em></p>
