<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/j-biogeography.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="196" height="258" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/j-biogeography.jpeg?resize=196%2C258" alt="" class="wp-image-127549" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Two-thirds of the associate editors of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>, a Wiley title, have resigned in a dispute with the publisher, and more resignations are likely, according to those involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the resignations, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/another-wiley-journal-board-resigns-after-month-long-strike">reported first</a> by <em>Times Higher Education</em>, were effective immediately, but a portion of the associate editors set August 28 as their effective date in hopes Wiley may negotiate with them about <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/08/01/associateeditors-workstoppage-jbiogeography-continues/">their concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the associate editors stopped processing new manuscripts at the end of June, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">we reported</a> last month, due to the dispute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In interviews with Retraction Watch, two associate editors who had put in their resignations described concerns with the journal’s high article processing charges (APCs) fueling Wiley’s profitability, as well as the “breakdown in negotiations” between the publisher and the journal’s lead editorial team. </p>



<span id="more-127686"></span>



<p>As we reported last week, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/01/an-editor-resigned-in-protest-now-wiley-is-firing-him-four-months-earlier-than-he-planned-to-leave/">moved to terminate</a> Mike Dawson, the chief editor of the journal, as of August&nbsp; 27, after he had tendered his resignation in early May with the contractually-required six months notice. Dawson expressed disappointment that the publisher had “not made any efforts to address any of the issues” the editorial team raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve taken these decisions because we believe the decisions lead to the greatest success and longevity of the journal,” Dawson said. “It’s disappointing Wiley is not engaged. They would benefit in the long run. It’s that simple.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignations at the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> are the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/">string</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">such actions</a> by <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/imaging-journal-editors-resign-over-extreme-open-access-fees/">editors</a> <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/elsevier-journal-board-follows-through-mass-resignation-threat">dissatisfied</a> with the actions of publishers. Last week, many moderators of ProMED-mail, an infectious disease bulletin that reported the first cases of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/03/promed-early-warning-system-on-disease-outbreaks-appears-near-collapse/">announced</a> they were suspending work for the service after the host society said it would start charging subscription fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> is not fully open access, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13652699/homepage/fundedaccess.html">charges APCs</a> of $4,800 for authors who wish to make their articles freely available.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127688" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?w=256&amp;ssl=1 256w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Krystal Tolley</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Such fees are “excessive,” and “not affordable,” said Krystal Tolley, one of the associate editors who put in her resignation for the end of the month. Tolley is based in South Africa, and said she and other researchers in the Global South “just don’t have those kinds of funds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley and other major publishers often waive fees for authors in low-income countries, and “transformative agreements” in which funding agencies or universities pay publication fees rather than authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither option is satisfactory, Tolley said. Few articles receive waivers, and as for transformative agreements, “I find it lip service. It’s not them who’s taking the hit, it’s still somebody who’s paying them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publishing model of charging high fees for open access publication, Tolley and other associate editors wrote in an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.14697#jbi14697-bib-0027">editorial</a> about their work stoppage:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>severely hampers the research visibility of early career researchers and those in countries with low-to-middle economies who cannot afford [open access] fees and therefore publish in less visible outlets. At the same time, this system promotes the visibility of those researchers with ample funds and allows unfair free access to their content. [Open access] combined with high APCs creates a pay-to-play system where those that have funds have research that is likely to be more visible and more cited.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides the journal’s high APC, the editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">have also objected</a> to what they understand as the publisher’s intention to make the journal entirely open access, increase its volume, and automatically refer rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors began trying to engage Wiley in discussion about their concerns near the beginning of this year, but the journal’s managers “essentially refused” to talk, Dawson said. After four months of frustration, he put in his resignation on May 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was clear that I could not achieve anything as chief editor when Wiley would not talk at all,” he said. He and the associate editors discussed what to do next, and settled on the work stoppage to try and pressure Wiley to the negotiation table. “Where we are now is the result of them not engaging seriously.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawson said he suspected an email he sent informing authors who had submitted to the journal during the work stoppage that processing their manuscripts could be delayed sparked Wiley’s decision to fire him. He said Wiley initially attempted to fire him by email, effective immediately. He pointed out that termination without notice was in breach of his contract, and later that day received a letter giving him 30 days notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson confirmed the dates of his resignation and termination but would not otherwise comment on the staffing changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson previously told us that the journal<em> </em>was no longer part of the referral program for rejected manuscripts, and “there are no plans to flip the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to open access but that we continually evaluate our journals to ensure they stay aligned with subject areas and funding trends.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither of those statements are concessions, Dawson said. He and the editors of the publisher’s other biogeography journals were only referring a small number of rejected manuscripts to each other, so they had essentially implemented the policy themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley “may not have an explicit plan” to make the journal open access, Dawson said, but at the beginning of the year the publisher was “absolutely clear” that they intended “to flip the journal to open access on a time horizon of two to four years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the resignations, a Wiley spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our highest priority is to continue delivering impactful research that serves the academic community and society at large. Wiley regularly meets with editors on issues that impact research publishing. To that end, we have extended several invitations to meet with the editors from the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to discuss their concerns and further support their important work. We appreciate the feedback shared by members of the academic publishing community and welcome further discussion to strengthen our journals and the people they serve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dawson noted that some of the <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">12 points</a> the editors had raised for discussion were more difficult to resolve than others, and said the editors would take action on the easier things, such as setting up an advisory board consisting of the chief editors of the publisher’s biogeography journals, as a sign of good faith. Then discussion of the difficult issues, such as what constitutes a fair APC and amount of profit for Wiley to make, could follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/staff/williams-jack/">Jack Williams</a>, chair of the department of geography at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who resigned as an associate editor of the journal last week, likened the current scientific publishing system to giving blood. He has gladly donated his time for peer review and editing “as service to science,” and has also given blood to the American Red Cross on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I found out the American Red Cross is making profit margins of 20% or whatever,” he said, he’d think, “Maybe I should give blood somewhere else. That’s not what I’m giving blood for.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, “When you see a model in which labor is essentially given for free, then made part of a business model that includes fees to authors, with fairly high profit margins, that&#8217;s a point of concern.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system can work, he said, but it “feels out of balance to me right now.” With such high APCs, “it doesn’t feel right to me to put my effort into that system currently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s still deciding where to draw the line on journals he will or will not support by editing or peer reviewing, but said shifting his donated service work towards nonprofit, society-associated journals with lower fees made sense. “There’s more alternatives out there now than there used to be. We have to take a hard look at the value we’re getting for the money we’re paying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tolley has decided to stop editing or reviewing articles for journals published by Wiley or the other major scientific publishers, and avoid submitting her own work to them when possible, “because they’re getting free content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of her coauthors don’t agree with that stance, so as a compromise, the group will not pay open access fees for a current submission to a major publisher’s journal, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To change the system, it has to be everyone who buys into this and says ‘No, I’m not going to pay that much money or work for free,’” Tolley said. “The majority of people have to do this, stop sending content to them, stop reviewing, stop editing. That’s the only way.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS is one of eight signatories on this letter. It was sent to Congress last week and posted publicly today (August 7, 2023).</p>



<p>Dear Chairwoman Granger and Subcommittee Chairman Rogers,</p>



<p><strong>RE: Response to House Appropriations Committee release of the Fiscal Year 2024 bill for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee<sup>1</sup></strong></p>



<p>In our capacity as representatives of leading fully Open Access research publishers and Open Science platforms, we submit our objection to the draft language<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;in the Subcommittee&rsquo;s FY24 spending bill<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;that&nbsp; blocks implementation&nbsp; of the Office of Science and Technology Policy&rsquo;s (OSTP) August 2022 guidance to make federally funded research freely available without delay.<br><br>As a group of global publishers, we share a single aim &ndash; the transition to fully open scientific communication for the benefit of all parts of society. We believe the restriction of funds as outlined in Sec 552 of the bill is detrimental to this goal. We strongly support the OSTP guidelines which we believe represent a significant policy advancement for global scientific and academic research.<br><br>If enacted, the current Appropriations Bill will prevent American taxpayers from seeing the societal benefits of the more than $90 billion in scientific research that the U.S. government funds each year, as most of the research remains locked behind publishing paywalls. And it will remove the current requirement for commercial publishers to adapt their business models to make public access to science fair. Science for the few who can access it &ndash; as opposed to the many who pay for it &ndash; is inefficient as scientific or governmental policy.</p>



<p>The political and societal move towards Open Science is well established as the demand for access to all publicly funded research intensifies. The retention of the 12-month embargo, as the Appropriations Bill stipulates, is a retrograde step within the global context of research and access to scientific literature.<br><br>As part of an established ecosystem of publishers, funding organizations, and governmental and scholarly institutions, we have seen prominent examples of the collaborative advancement of Open Science:</p>



<ul><li>The world&rsquo;s largest subscription publishers were transitioning to open policies for years prior to the OSTP announcement, in accordance with the principles of Plan S<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and alongside the organizations of cOAlition S.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;These efforts have received strong support from the Association of Research Libraries,<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;academic societies, and individual researchers.</li><li>Funders such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;have already limited or removed embargoes as a part of their funding mandates.</li><li>Longstanding governmental efforts, such as the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative,<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;increasingly rely on making published results of federally funded research more openly available to researchers and the public.</li></ul>



<p>The United States is a global scientific leader. The inclusion of the current language in relation to Sec 552 would be a block on the advancement of US research and its influence within the international scientific community.</p>



<p>We would be happy to work with the Committee to develop alternative language that maintains the existing direction of Open Science policy and scientific freedom.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><strong>Microtektites found in Caribbean may shed light on tektite origin </strong>—<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/microtektites-found-caribbean-may-shed-light-tektite-origin"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 11, 1973</p>



<p>Though their origin remains a mystery to scientists, huge strewn fields of tektites have been found in widely separated areas of the world&#8230;. Microtektites have now been found in the Caribbean, and the characteristics of these newly found specimens may ultimately shed some light on the question of tektite origin….</p>



<p>Some believe that the tektites come from the moon. They feel that tektites were formed when an asteroid hit the moon, splashing droplets of molten rocks so high that they escaped the moon&#8217;s gravity and fell to Earth. However, mass spectrographic analysis of lunar samples shows that elements in the lunar crust are far different from tektites. The tektites are more like the elements in the continental crust of the Earth itself. [Planetary scientist Billy P. Glass] feels that if the parent material of [newfound] microtektites can be determined … the discovery of the origin of the glassy objects might quickly follow suit.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Glass surmised that these geologic curiosities have earthly origins, based on his and his colleagues’ analyses of the North American strewn field — a blanket of glassy particles that covers much the southeastern United States and Caribbean and dates to about 35 million years ago. But it took another 20 years for researchers to identify the source.</p>



<p>In 1994, tektites and concentric fault lines in southern Virginia revealed an 85-kilometer-wide impact crater under Chesapeake Bay. <em>Science News</em> reported that &#8220;a structure this size would rank as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/large-meteorite-scar-identified-virginia">the largest crater in the United States</a>&#8221; and would be among the largest on Earth (<em>SN: 8/20/94</em>). What’s more, when the space rock slammed into our planet, the collision created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangled-microfossils-may-mark-impact-sites">intense seismic waves that bent microfossils</a> into odd shapes, scientists reported nearly a decade later (<em>SN: 6/11/03</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together with evidence from Earth’s three other major strewn fields, the findings helped confirm that tektites form when a bolide slams into our planet with enough force to blast liquified chunks of Earth&#8217;s crust into the atmosphere. These chunks then harden into raindrop-, barbell- and ravioli-shaped particles as they fall back to the surface.</p>



<p>So far, researchers have linked three of the four major strewn fields with impact craters. The North American strewn field is tied to the Chesapeake crater in Virginia, the central European strewn field is associated with the Ries crater in Germany, and the Ivory Coast strewn field originates from the Bosumtwi crater in Ghana. The holdout is the Australasian strewn field, which is the largest known and covers about 10 percent of Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Scientists recently got a break in the case. Analyses of tektites found in Thailand and other geologic evidence as well as computer simulations suggest a probable source. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1904368116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2-kilometer-wide meteorite struck Laos about 800,000 years ago</a> and flung debris across Asia, Australia and Antarctica, scientists reported in 2020 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. </p>



<p>The resulting crater, which may be about 13 kilometers wide by 17 kilometers long, was eventually buried under volcanic material, the team contends. Verifying this hypothesis will require drilling through lava fields to see if the rocks underneath show melting and shattering — both hallmarks of an impact.</p>



<p>To a collector, the curiosities found around an impact crater are full of wonder and poetry. To a planetary scientist, these small pieces of evidence may yet open big windows into Earth’s geologic past.</p>

<p>The authors of a response to an article critiquing the use of the term “terminal anorexia” retracted their letter last month after receiving major backlash from researchers, healthcare providers, and people with eating disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">Regardless of inequities in care, terminal anorexia nervosa exists: a response to Sharpe et. al</a>,” which defended the use of the term, was published May 20 in the <em>Journal of Eating Disorders</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter was a response to “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00791-2">Inaccessibility of care and inequitable conceptions of suffering: a collective response to the construction of “terminal” anorexia nervosa</a>,” an article published earlier in the month in the same journal by researchers with lived experiences of eating disorders<em>.</em> The article outlined methodological problems with the criteria for diagnosis of a “terminal eating disorder” put forward in “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00548-3">Terminal anorexia nervosa: three cases and proposed clinical characteristics,</a>” a previous paper by two of the authors of the response letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The response was retracted on July 17. Its retraction note reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127677"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have retracted this article following discussions with multiple stakeholders. The authors offer their deepest apologies for the distress and the unintended negative impact of this piece.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original response is no longer available online but can be viewed on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230520194241/https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">archived version</a> of the page. </p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Joel Yager, the first author of the retracted response, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We retracted the letter following conversations with involved and affected parties after we better understood how they were impacted by our language in this response letter. But please understand that we remain dedicated to continuing to help encourage compassionate and critical conversations about this patient population.&nbsp; We stand by our advocacy for the rare yet highly deserving population of adults who cannot survive their anorexia nervosa and thus deserve the full and compassionate care that anyone with a terminal illness is due.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response letter prompted immediate backlash online, with James Downs <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297">tweeting</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

In my view this is borderline an abuse of a publication platform and it’s hard to know how to respond without giving this harmful construct oxygen. <a href="https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD">https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD</a></p>&mdash; James Downs (@jamesldowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Downs, who is a psychological therapist, researcher, and a person with a longstanding eating disorder, wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Aside from some of the arguments made, the tone and personal nature of the response disturbed me the most. For instance, the insinuation that authors with lived experience of the subject are less aware of the realities of the deaths of patients with anorexia than clinicians and academics was highly condescending, I was particularly concerned that the response appeared to make a psychological interpretation of Sharpe et al.&#8217;s argument as a product of the &#8220;anorexic voice&#8221;, which felt to me like a misuse of clinical authority, publicly evoking the supposed-psychopathology those within a vulnerable population as a rhetorical device.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Others also felt the letter did not address the main points of the article to which it was responding. Sam Sharpe, the first author of that article, wrote in an email to Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publication by Yager et al. 2023 did not engage with the core components of our thesis and appeared to constitute an attempt to undermine the credibility of our team and other lived experience researchers that, without supporting evidence, likely doesn’t have a place in academic discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Scout Silverstein, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, told Retraction Watch that they and the other authors of the article agree that there are rare situations in which anorexia is deadly, and that people in this situation deserve compassion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Many of us agree that a fraction of people diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa will experience a critical stage of illness that may lead to death, and that those people deserve death with dignity. Our concerns about the original paper by Gaudiani et al. are its methodological flaws, failure to account for systemic inequities, and its lack of foresight in understanding the implications of introducing this diagnostic criteria in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the authors offer an apology in the retraction notice, Marissa Adams, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, pointed to an article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/anorexia-right-to-die-terminal-mental-health"><em>The Guardian</em></a> in which Jennifer Gaudiani, an author on both papers advocating for establishing criteria for “terminal anorexia,” said, “I know for a fact that this advocacy is correct and that these individuals deserve to be cared for compassionately at the end of their lives.”</p>



<p>The co-editors in chief of the journal, Phillipa Hay and Stephen Touyz, did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selene Cary, publishing director of fully open access journals at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article was retracted at the request of the authors, after they raised concerns about potential unintended negative impacts of the correspondence following discussions with multiple stakeholders. We took the concerns raised very seriously and concluded that retraction and removal of the correspondence from the journal website was the most appropriate and responsible action to take.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-human-body-climate">Extreme heat taxes the body in many ways. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded. It could even be the hottest month in human history.</p>



<p>And it’s just one in a chain of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">broken heat records</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>). A record-breaking heat wave is still lingering in the U.S. Southwest. In 2020, temperatures jumped to 38° Celsius in Siberia, marking the highest ever recorded in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context">the Arctic Circle</a> (<em>SN: 7/01/20</em>). Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have taken place in the last decade. &nbsp;</p>





<p>That heat has tested the limits of our very bodies to tragic effect: In 2003, an estimated 70,000 people died from a European heat wave. In 2022, another heat wave there <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused some 62,000 deaths</a>. Thousands more have died in other extreme heat events, and even more have suffered heat illness or injury.</p>



<p>The human body can adapt to heat, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">but only to a certain point</a>, research has shown (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>“The body works quite hard to keep the core body temperature within a pretty narrow range,” says Kristie Ebi, who researches climate change and health at the University of Washington in Seattle. “If you can&#8217;t cool down that core body temperature, then your cells and your organs start being affected.”</p>



<p>Sustained heat waves <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(21)01208-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place our bodies under strain</a>, which can set off a cascade of effects that can lead to permanent injury or death, Ebi and colleagues wrote in a 2021 review in the <em>Lancet</em>. Heat waves are also getting more humid, limiting our ability to cool down, and nights are growing hotter, cutting into the time we might rest and recover. Both these trends undercut our ability to adapt to rising heat.</p>



<p>While people have ways to keep themselves and their communities safe, heat risks will only increase with rising temperatures, researchers say. Here’s what extreme heat and high humidity do to the body — and how you can protect yourself.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Humid heat waves, hot nights</h4>



<p>The body has two main pathways to keep cool. First is sweating. As body temperature rises, sweat glands in the skin release salty water out of pores. That water absorbs heat as it evaporates, cooling you off.</p>



<p>At the same time, the body redirects blood toward the skin surface by dilating blood vessels just under the skin and pumping the heart harder, which is why many people look flush when they’re hot. This allows the blood to better disperse the heat to the surrounding air.</p>



<p>Within a certain range, these systems work in concert to keep your internal body temperature within a safe window, usually around 37° Celsius. Unfortunately, Earth isn’t just getting hotter; it’s getting hotter in ways that are harder for our bodies to handle.</p>



<p>Climate change is spurring <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">heat waves that are not only hotter</a> and longer but, crucially, more humid (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>). “It’s becoming more dangerous because the humidity is acting as a barrier to how we cool ourselves,” says Rachel Cottle, who researches thermoregulation at Penn State. Since humid air is full of water, sweat doesn’t evaporate like it would in drier climates. So instead of cooling us off, the sweat sticks to the skin, and the heart must work even harder to compensate by pushing blood away from our core.</p>





<p>Even nights aren’t offering much of a break. Usually, nighttime is much cooler than daytime, which allows the body to shed heat at night. But global nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime ones. And as nights get warmer, the heart must work harder.</p>



<p>Hotter nights also cut into our sleep, says Kelton Minor, a data scientist at Columbia University who studies climate risks. “Across seasons, demographics and different climate contexts, warmer outside temperatures consistently erode sleep.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00209-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332222002093%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2022 study of global sleep behaviors</a>, Minor and his colleagues found that on random, hot nights “individuals slept less, took longer to fall asleep and woke up earlier” compared with cooler nights, he says. Other research has linked poor sleep to decreased cardiovascular health and increases in the risk of injury, anxiety, depression or even gun violence and suicide, Minor says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The dangers of high heat</h4>



<p>The combined forces of increased heat, higher humidity and hotter nights tax the systems that cool our bodies. And when it stays too hot for too long, things can start to go haywire.</p>



<p>Pushing that blood toward the skin forces the heart to work harder while simultaneously reducing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Over several hours, this can lead to oxygen shortages in the heart and, eventually, heart failure.</p>



<p>This intense strain helps explain why cardiovascular failure is responsible for around half of the deaths among older people during heat waves, Ebi says. The other half happens when other organs, especially the lungs, fail under the stress of handling the heat, in part from lack of oxygen. Usually, these risks pop up in people with preexisting conditions such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>



<p>These risks are especially high if the body can’t keep its temperature stable. In that case, the body’s core temperature begins to crawl upward to dangerous levels. When a person’s internal temperature reaches around 38° C, they can experience heat exhaustion, which can lead to faintness, headache, dizziness and heavy sweating.</p>



<p>Left unchecked, heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke. Here, body temperature pushes past 40° C. The heat can kill cells and interfere with organ function. Symptoms include skin that is hot and dry, delirium and even seizures. Without immediate intervention, heat stroke can lead to organ failure, permanent injury and death.</p>



<p>Even sweating can have its risks. If you don’t drink enough water while sweating, your body begins to get dehydrated. Dehydration can thicken the blood, putting even more strain on the heart. It also puts pressure on the kidneys, which need water to filter out toxins and waste from the body. In cases of chronic dehydration, as with some outdoor workers, it can lead to kidney disease.</p>



<p>Even in cases that aren’t fatal, some research suggests heat-related injury can lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935107000163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years of increased risk</a> of heat injury or death.</p>



<p>While these symptoms and their outcomes may seem dire, “these mechanisms play out over hours,” Ebi says. “It’s not instantaneous.” People often begin to feel symptoms well before they end up in an emergency, she says. Mortality doesn’t start peaking until around 24 hours after a heat wave starts.</p>



<p>This means that, often, there’s time to act and help prevent the worst outcomes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to stay safe</h4>



<p>“Almost every heat-related death is preventable,” Ebi says. “People shouldn’t be dying from heat waves.” Preventing those deaths takes a mix of personal and societal actions to keep those who are most vulnerable safe.</p>



<p>Individuals should stay well hydrated in high heat. They should also turn on air conditioning if it’s available or, if possible, find a cooling center or public location with air conditioning. Cottle also recommends staying inside and avoiding vigorous activity during the hottest hours of the day. Putting a cool towel on your neck, using fans in humid heat or dipping your hands or feet in a cold-water bath can also help you keep cool, she says.</p>



<p>These tips may have particular relevance to those most at risk, either because they are less able to cool down or more susceptible to injury if they overheat. This includes adults over 65, newborns, pregnant people, individuals on certain medications and people with heart and lung conditions.</p>



<p>Some may also be put at increased risk due to their location or occupation. People who are unhoused and outdoor laborers may not have the option to go inside during the hottest part of the day. Poor urban neighborhoods, which tend to have many dark surfaces and relatively few trees, tend to be hotter, including at night, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">putting the people who live there at increased risk</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>). And globally, people living in warmer, humid climates, such as Southeast Asia, are at higher risk than those living elsewhere.</p>



<p>To help alleviate these risks, there are a few steps that local governments can take, such as implementing early warning systems that notify residents of upcoming heat waves, Ebi says. Or officials can require roofs that naturally cool buildings. White or light-colored paint, for example, reflects heat, while “green roofs” with plants on top can cool off buildings as they evaporate water into the air. Cooling infrastructure like trees throughout a city and air conditioning run by clean power to avoid contributing to greenhouse gas emissions would also help, Minor adds.</p>



<p>Some of these suggestions are starting to become reality. In the United States, cities such as Los Angeles, Denver and Washington, D.C., now require some new buildings to have light-colored or green roofs.</p>



<p>Additionally, Ebi says, the world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help limit the climate extremes that can be most fatal. “Heat is an all-of-society issue,” she says, “and needs an all-of-society approach to protect the most vulnerable to make sure that people have access to the services they need.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2023/08/04/so-youre-an-academic-who-wants-to-help-with-the-climate-crisis/">So you’re an academic who wants to help with the climate crisis? </a></h4>

              
                <p>With the hottest days in recorded history, oceans reaching 100°F, droughts, and wildfire air turning the sky orange, it takes little more than walking out your door to be reminded of the ongoing climate crisis we are experiencing. As an academic, you may understand why this is happening. You may also be frightened, angered, or depressed about it. But <strong><em>you may fall short of knowing all that you personally can do about it</em></strong>. If so, this article is for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step is to learn the basic mantra of tackling climate change:<strong> It’s happening. It’s us. We can fix it. </strong>That is: the world is undeniably warming, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, and we have a variety of methods for reducing those emissions and adapting to the unavoidable changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you can guess,<strong> it’s incredibly important that you act</strong>. The effects are already here and already troubling. But there is a lot more and far worse damage on the horizon that we can prevent by acting now. Every fraction of a degree matters. Every ounce of avoided emissions helps. And many of the needed solutions have secondary benefits, like cleaner air and cheaper energy. To serious people, there is therefore no space for doomerism or complacency. An incredible amount of necessary change is already happening, driven by people like you who care about fixing this problem, and<strong> they need your help </strong>to do even more.</p>



<p>What an academic can do ranges from the universal—personal actions anyone can take as a consumer and citizen—to the specific—use of hard-won expertise to advance technology and practice. I will cover the full range here, but, fair warning, <strong><em>I am going to try to convince you to change what you work on</em></strong>.</p>



<p>No matter what options you choose, to make the most impact, you will have to be bold. <strong>You will need to do things that haven’t been done before</strong>—things that aren’t the norm, or part of the typical academic path. Things that some people who don’t understand the situation as well as you might even think are <em>weird</em>. But that’s ok, because doing research and discovering new knowledge is inherently about working on the edge of what is known and comfortable. If you can forge new paths in your research, you can forge new paths in your personal and professional life as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unprecedented action is needed because we are facing unprecedented conditions. Imagine you were conducting a study in your field and saw these kind of outliers:</p>

<p>It would make you sit up and take notice.</p>



<p>For the past century or so, we have been conducting a large-scale experiment (that did not get IRB approval&#8230;) on our planet and our civilization, and the data are coming in with strong results. <strong>We are in a new era and a new world</strong>. The way systems functioned and how people behaved before this period of climate upheaval is not a relevant guide for how things should be done in this new era. We have to be different. You have to be different. As <a href="https://alexsteffen.substack.com/p/old-thinking-will-break-your-brain">Alex Steffan</a>, a writer who focuses on how to grapple with a rapidly evolving world in crisis, wrote “Being native to now demands <em>finding</em> insight, not just receiving it.”</p>



<p>In addition to being bold and creative, to have the most impact, you need to be a “<strong>force multiplier</strong>”. For every action you take, try to get 10 other actions out of it. This can be done by getting whole systems you have control over to change or by convincing other people to make the same changes you are making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>So what can you do from where you are now&#8230;</strong></p>



<p>As an academic, there are levers you can pull that will help reduce emissions and change the expectations and standards in your field. Much of the tips provided here come from Anne Urai and her colleagues whose extensive efforts help academics, and (neuro)scientists in particular, act on the climate crisis. <strong>Check out their </strong><a href="https://anneurai.net/green-neuroscience/"><strong>papers and videos</strong></a><strong> for more information.</strong></p>



<p>First, you have certain affordances due to your <strong>position within a university</strong>. Universities are large systems that can play important roles in their communities and even internationally. Working with (or putting pressure on) your university to take bold and necessary action is one way to be a force-multiplier. Resources that are particularly relevant on university campuses are <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/04/28/divestment-gains-some-colleges-can-it-spread-where-oil-rules">campaigns to divest from fossil fuels</a>, the work of your sustainability office (these can sometimes be hubs for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing">greenwashing</a>, but it is your job to make sure they are not by offering input), and activist organizations like <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/">Sunrise Movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Efforts to change university policies are also part of a general movement of people lobbying their employers for climate action under the notion that “every job is a climate job”. General resources for climate action at work include this <a href="https://drawdown.org/publications/climate-solutions-at-work">Project Drawdown guide</a> and the UK-based <a href="https://www.workforclimate.org/">Work for Climate</a> organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also do an accounting of the <strong>emissions that come from your research</strong>. Think about materials used, the <a href="https://climateaction.tech/">energy needed for computing power</a>, and the emissions that come from flying to conferences. To make changes in these areas, you may need to: petition companies to offer more sustainable products, ask your university about where the energy for computing clusters comes from, or lobby your academic societies to offer distributed conferences (either through several local hubs or remote virtual participation like <a href="https://conference.neuromatch.io/">neuromatch</a>). <a href="https://www.mygreenlab.org/">MyGreenLab</a> and the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/leaf-laboratory-efficiency-assessment-framework">Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework</a> may be good starting points. But in general, be creative. When you find lower carbon alternatives to things you use and do regularly, make sure to <strong><em>share your knowledge</em></strong>, like Anne has in her <a href="https://anneurai.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/rae-et-al-2022-climate-crisis-and-ecological-emergency.pdf">publications for neuroscientists</a>. This makes you a force multiplier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also consider<strong> what you teach</strong>. The causes of, effects from, and solutions to the climate crisis touch nearly every topic taught at a university. Teaching the physical science behind climate change is just as important as explaining the psychological tendencies that prevent action or the economic incentives needed for change. Try developing a new course on “Climate Change and X” for your department (for example, I teach <a href="https://lindsay-lab.github.io/teaching/#machine-learning-for-climate-change-spring-2023">Machine Learning for Climate Change</a> as part of the Data Science major at NYU). Or at least see where in your existing lectures a connection to climate change and its solutions can be made. Not only does this open the eyes of students to how their interests connect to this global problem, it also normalizes talking about it and may encourage them to focus their career on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professors, scientists, and academics are usually considered respected members of the community and therefore <strong>communicating from a place of authority</strong> can also be a useful option. Writing op-eds, appearing on podcasts, or helping <a href="https://scaan.net/">provide input for policy efforts</a> are ways academics can contribute to the conversation. <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-byzb-0s23">Research on how to communicate on climate has provided many tips</a>. In general, this communication can be particularly effective for targeted audiences, for example when commenting on how green efforts on your campus will be beneficial to the local community. Many scientists already engage in various forms of outreach, and including discussion of the climate crisis in these activities can be an easy way to get others talking. Scientists can even consider<a href="https://scientistrebellion.org/ways-to-join/"> joining Scientist Rebellion</a> to participate in coordinated action and activism. Getting the word out and normalizing the idea of taking climate action can be a force multiplier (for example, I’m force multiplying right now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>But you can also change what you do</strong></p>



<p>An academic’s identity can be very tightly wound up with their area of expertise. To suggest that someone change what they work on can be shocking, offensive even. But <a href="https://80000hours.org/">what you do during your working hours determines in large part the impact you have on this world</a>. If you want to increase your effort and expand your impact, <strong><em>pivoting your research to a climate-relevant topic is a great choice.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This pivot will admittedly be easier for some areas of expertise than others, but you may be surprised by the overlap in skills and knowledge that you have and what is needed for some specific corner of the climate crisis response. As mentioned above, it’s difficult to find a university department that has no relevant connection to climate change, and forging new connections can be incredibly important as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I <a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2022/10/19/an-introduction-to-the-lindsay-lab-what-we-are-researching-and-why/">wrote previously</a> about my change from pure neuroscientist to neuroscientist/remote-sensing-of-climate-impacts-scientist. Did I think when I got my PhD in computational neuroscience that I’d be analyzing satellite data as a professor or developing content for a <a href="https://academy.climatematch.io/">course on computational climate science</a>? Of course not. But entering this new field has been exhilarating and expansive. It also gives me clear purpose and a place to put my energy when the news has me frustrated or depressed. And it provides me the time and space to stay up-to-date on climate topics, which otherwise would be a job of its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an academic (especially if you are a tenured one), <strong>you have an uncommon degree of freedom</strong> in what you pursue. You also have a useful set of meta-skills—the ability to survey complicated literature, teach yourself new things, and manage multi-faceted research projects—that have value even outside of the domain you learned them in. This puts you in a rare position to explore and build and forge and test across a range of topic areas, and guide students into these areas as well. If you have the desire to make an impact on the climate crisis, don’t let the traditions of academia or a fear of what might come hold you back. <strong>Use the freedom and skills you have to do what you think is right</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how do you figure out the best topic areas for you? If you’re a novice, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709837/the-climate-book-by-greta-thunberg/">The Climate Book</a> is a decent place to start; it is a series of expert-authored essays that together provide a thorough lay of the land. Solutions-oriented frameworks like <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> and the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> can also point you to concrete areas that need attention. There are a <a href="https://unfccc.int/blog/5-climate-action-podcasts-you-should-be-listening-to">host of podcasts</a> to provide informal introductions to areas of interest and the people working on them; I prefer <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann">Catalyst</a> and <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/media/podcast">My Climate Journey</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also highly recommend joining the <a href="https://workonclimate.org/">Work on Climate</a> Slack. This is a very large community of people either working on, or hoping to work on, climate change problems. It was started with the explicit goal of getting people from all backgrounds into climate work. It was a big influence on me as I made my transition and provided several concrete opportunities. <strong><em>The community of people working on climate is also incredibly welcoming.</em></strong> You can even join the #role-academics channel, which I created to help shepard academics through this process!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to skill up with some online courses check out <a href="https://academy.climatematch.io/">Climatematch Academy</a>, <a href="https://airminers.org/learn">Airminers</a> (on carbon dioxide removal), <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/summer_school">Climate Change AI summer school</a>, or a wide variety of options on websites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=climate%20change">Coursera</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re currently at a university, see what kind of climate work is already going on and who is doing it. Ask to attend meetings and seminars and see what kind of help you can offer or if your colleagues have any pointers to resources that are a good match for you. Some universities, like <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/office-of-the-provost/current-priorities/climate-change.html">NYU</a>, have established clusters of climate research and are even aiming to fund it more. Columbia University has an <a href="https://www.climate.columbia.edu/">entire school dedicated to climate change</a>, which accurately reflects the importance of the problem and its highly interdisciplinary nature. If your university doesn’t have any hubs of climate work, make one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, you don’t have to completely abandon your past work and go 100% on climate change (though please do if you’d like!). You can explore on the edges at first, dipping a toe into a new topic and see how it feels before taking a deeper plunge.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>You may also conclude that you want to leave academia&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For all its perks, academic work can sometimes feel like fighting with one hand tied behind your back; resources can be sparse and the chance to truly directly create something or make change can be hard to come by. If you want to leave academia, there are many resources that will help you make this switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, know that you are in good company. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/academics-leaving-climate-tech-startups">Many academics</a> have left their university to start or join companies working on climate solutions. <strong>Companies are usually happy to find smart and motivated people who want to work on their problems.</strong> So all you have to do is convey that interest and know how to market your skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent years have seen a healthy increase in acknowledgement of the fact people with PhDs end up in other jobs. Many resources exist to teach former academics <strong>how to identify their skills and passions outside of the ivory tower </strong>and get a job that suits them. Such resources include <a href="https://fromphdtolife.com/">From PhD to Life</a> and <a href="https://www.whatcanyoubewithaphd.com/">What You Can Be with a PhD</a> and a variety of articles and conversations under the heading of “<a href="https://twitter.com/altacchats">alt-ac</a>”.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Thinking of starting your own company?</em></strong> Great! <strong>The world needs radically new ideas and ways of doing things as we undergo a massive climate transition.</strong> <a href="https://climatefounder.org/">Climate Founder</a> provides resources for entrepreneurs and <a href="https://subak.org/about">Subak</a> provides assistance and funding especially for non-profits. If you are still at a university, there may be a Tech Ventures office responsible for helping academics found start-ups. Funding agencies, like the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps/about-teams">NSF</a>, also have programs to get scientist’s ideas into the real world. And you can check out the <a href="https://leonardomassa.notion.site/leonardomassa/50e190493e514b0ba2307f154d0aa3ac?v=c3d6fa96698a4879864335ee18f4401b">Scientist Founder Hub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The past few years has seen the development of quite a <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2023/01/10/the-year-ahead-for-climate-tech-funding">healthy climate startup space</a>. The money is flowing, the work exists and<strong> you are wanted there.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>And don’t forget personal action</strong></p>



<p>The <strong>most important personal action you can do is vote</strong>, and otherwise organize politically, perhaps even through targeted civil disobedience, to make sure that people who have the interest of future generations at heart get into power and make the right choices. US-focused political organizations include <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/">Citizen’s Climate Lobby</a>, <a href="https://www.lcv.org/">League of Conservation Voters</a>, and <a href="https://peoplesclimate.org/">People&#8217;s Climate Movement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other personal action is important too—without individual change we wouldn’t get collective change. Changes in consumption habits regarding meat alternatives and electric vehicles, for example, have allowed companies pioneering these climate-friendly options to thrive and sent a message to the makers of emissions-heavy products that they are no longer wanted.</p>



<p>Individual choices, while having a small but real impact on their own, are also important as <strong>force multipliers because of the conversations they start</strong>. When it comes up at dinner that I eat chicken and fish but tend to avoid dairy and beef, I can explain that this is due to the heavy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">carbon footprint of food that comes from cows</a>. Similarly, when I decline an invitation to an international conference out of a desire to avoid too many flights, this may spur others to consider their own avenues for action as well. In <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Us/Katharine-Hayhoe/9781982143848">Saving Us: A Climate Scientist&#8217;s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World</a>, Katharine Hayhoe discusses how climate-friendly behavior can spread by seeing others do the same, and how <strong>conversations amongst people with shared values are the most effective</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another personal action that matters is donating. This gives the people dedicating their life to important fights in courts and on the ground the resources they need to do their job well. My preferred organizations are: <a href="https://www.catf.us/">Clean Air Task Force</a>, <a href="https://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a>, <a href="https://www.conservation.org/">Conservation International</a>, <a href="https://carbonfund.org/">Carbon Fund</a>, and <a href="https://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>But just do it</strong></p>



<p>Whatever of the above options resonates with you, just <strong>make sure you do it</strong>. Do it now and do more later. There is no reason to wait, and there truly is not time to. Action begets action. And action begets conversations that beget more action. Start the ball rolling now and reap the benefits that you sow.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>Katie Birditt reflects on her visit to Alzheimer’s Research UK's London Network Open Day and why making research accessible is so important.</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_f529397c09724a2d8a793715ed920b18~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Photo by Sincerely Media on Unsplash." ></figure><p><em>Like seeing the stars through a telescope for the first time. </em>Those words were spoken to Professor Frances Edwards at her stand as a member of the public observed a fluorescently dyed neuron under the microscope. This statement is a wonderful testament to the impact that Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) is having in engaging the public in a dialogue around dementia. </p>

<p>ARUK is one of the largest charities in the UK that funds dementia research and initiatives to promote greater understanding of the condition. The London Network Open Day they organised at UCL provided the public with a space to discuss some of the most exciting developments in the field with preeminent scientists. This event was suitable for anyone, from aspiring researchers and medical professors to families wanting to learn more about dementia. The day consisted of talks, poster stands, and activities designed to showcase the research being conducted at leading London institutions. Here I reflect on some personal highlights and hopefully encourage you to attend or get involved with your next local event.</p>
<h5>Posters </h5><p>My first stop was at the poster stands where an array of neuroscience research was being presented. Prior knowledge was not a prerequisite as all the studies’ key findings were highlighted in accessible, engaging ways. Before the day’s talks had even begun, I found myself on a whistle-stop poster tour of Alzheimer’s disease that took me from misbehaving proteins and faulty immune cells to blame for the disease to spatial transcriptomics (which has the misfortune of sounding more daunting than it really is!) Spatial transcriptomics is essentially a way of visualising and analysing RNA in the brain and identifying the ‘postcodes’ of these nucleic acids. DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids. However, double-stranded DNA <em>stores </em>genetic information while single-stranded RNA ensures that this information is used to make proteins. The transcription of DNA to RNA precedes protein production and can tell us a lot about abnormal processes in disease. When scientists mash brains up for experiments, information about where exactly the detected RNA has come from is inevitably lost. Spatial transcriptomics overcomes this problem by capturing RNA on barcoded surfaces where each barcode corresponds to a distinct tissue region. This ingenious approach allows for gene expression patterns to be compared across different parts of the brain. Spatial transcriptomics was unfamiliar terrain for me, but thanks to some friendly PhD students and post-doctoral researchers I enjoyed a great discussion about the potential of this method for neurodegenerative disease research. </p>
<blockquote>It was incredible to see researchers and the public come together</blockquote><h5>Public Engagement and Pipetting</h5><p>Each poster stand was accompanied by activities designed to start conversations around science. Abiding by journalism ethics and standards, I thought it was only right to give all the activities a go before writing about them! I applied some creative interpretation to images generated by fluorescent microscopy and put my pipetting ability to the test. It was a slightly surreal experience wielding a pipette and seeing a six-well plate outside its normal realm of the lab but once adjusted to the initial shock of this, I like to think some innate skills kicked in to warrant an impressive performance (disclaimer- no chemicals at all were involved in the participation of this activity, only some eager children and slightly competitive adults!) Who would have thought pipetting would be such an effective way of engaging the public and demystifying the inner workings of the lab. </p>
<h5>Presentations</h5><p>The talks encouraged the audience to consider various approaches to dementia research, management, and diagnosis.  Everything from the therapeutic potential of newly emerging drugs to the promise of digital biomarkers was discussed.  As someone who previously worked with rodent models to study Alzheimer’s, I was particularly intrigued by a talk from Professor Frances Edwards’, an academic at UCL. She talked about the relevance of improved mice models to understand Alzheimer’s disease. The use of animals in research is such a contentious topic, not only due to ethical considerations, but also because Alzheimer’s is highly unique to humans and therefore difficult to model accurately in mice. Moving away from a potentially flawed experimental paradigm where foreign genes are randomly integrated into rodent models and used to study disease progression, the Edwards lab conducts research on what’s known as knock-in mice. The older models had their place, but randomly inserting genes carries the risk of potentially confounding disruptions to other genes. These newer models in the Edwards lab are instead created through the <em>targeted </em>insertion of genes associated with developing Alzheimer's, allowing scientists to study important pathological relationships without impacting other gene expression. Professor Edwards and her team use these knock-in mice to investigate synaptic dysfunction in relation to the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s with the aim of discovering early disease-associated changes and identifying promising drug targets. </p>

<p>When speaking to Professor Edwards about the 2023 ARUK Network Open Day, she said her highlights were the “enlightening questions” from the public and the opportunity to “walk around and see the different displays that underline the wide variety of research going on across London”. I personally found it incredible to see researchers and the public come together, united on a shared quest to learn more about the devastating condition that is likely to affect us all in some way. It is easy to have a narrow overview of research, confining it to the realms of laboratories, academic journals, and symposiums. However, this ARUK event emphasised the importance of widely sharing research and making it accessible to those who will be impacted by it. As spatial transcriptomics shows us, information matters but context is important.</p><hr><p>This article was written by Katie Birditt and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/potential-giant-viruses-soil-microbiology">A fantastical world of potential giant viruses lurks beneath the soil</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant viruses may try out all sorts of funky lewks.</p>



<p>New images reveal the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.30.546935v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">varied — and sometimes whimsical — shapes</a> of hundreds of potential soil-dwelling giant viruses. One shape is dubbed “haircut” for its fibers that bristle like freshly buzzed hair. “Gorgon” has tubelike appendages snaking from its shell. And flaps poking out of “turtle” resemble the reptile’s head, limbs and tail, virologist Matthias Fischer and colleagues report June 30 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>These and other peculiar-looking shapes “clearly tell us that we&#8217;ve underestimated how structurally diverse these viruses are,” says Fischer, of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>





<p>Since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-giants-among-viruses">discovery of the first giant virus in 2003</a>, scientists collecting genetic material from the environment have uncovered a wide world of giant viruses (<em>SN: 3/21/18</em>). These viruses are roughly 10 to 50 times the diameter of viruses that cause the common cold. The genetic data suggest that giant viruses are diverse, widespread and abundant.</p>



<p>But genetics can’t tell us everything about a virus’s biology, says Steven Wilhelm, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. “We don’t know what we’re looking at, who it infects or what it could possibly be doing.”</p>

<p>The new work could help change that, Fischer says. Using transmission electron microscopy, his team analyzed about half a kilogram of soil from Harvard Forest in Petersham, Mass., to produce an image gallery of giant virus diversity — potentially.</p>



<p>Fischer is careful not to call the virus look-alikes “viruses” just yet. The researchers have seen the particles only with a microscope; they haven’t confirmed that the potential viruses can infect particular organisms.</p>



<p>Still, looking at the structures Fischer’s team identified, microbiologist Frederik Schulz of the Joint Genome Institute in Berkeley, Calif., says he’s “convinced that many of these are actual virus particles.”</p>



<p>Scientists can only speculate why giant viruses might form tubular, bristly or turtlelike appendages. They may help the virus infect a host or perhaps move through the environment, Fischer says. “It’s going to be a wild ride … to see what each of these structures do.”</p>



<p>Whatever function they may have, Fischer thinks even more peculiar shapes remain to be discovered. “If a handful of forest soil already contains so many different virus particles,” he says, “this is clearly just the very tip of the viral&nbsp;Mount&nbsp;Everest.”</p>

<p>A cancer researcher who admitted to faking data has pleaded guilty to attempted forgery in a case involving letters of recommendation he passed off as coming from his former supervisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Georgios Laliotis, a former postdoc at The Ohio State University, was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/22/fired-postdoc-faked-recommendation-letters-from-supervisor-osu-alleges/">charged with forgery</a> for allegedly creating a fake email address with the name of his PI, Philip Tsichlis, and using it to send two letters of recommendation to prospective employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laliotis was later indicted for identity fraud, forgery, and telecommunications fraud, and pleaded not guilty to each count. </p>



<span id="more-127665"></span>



<p>On June 27, Laliotis <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laliotis-plea-1.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> to the lesser charge of attempted forgery, and prosecutors dropped the other charges. In lieu of six months of jail time, a judge <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laliotis-judgment.pdf">sentenced</a> Laliotis to one year of non-reporting probation, on the condition that Laliotis not contact Tsichlis and “not apply to take medical exams” for the next four years, or until the conviction is sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don Olsen, Laliotis’ lawyer, has not responded to our request for comment, nor has Laliotis.</p>



<p>Also in late June, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/26/fired-osu-postdoc-charged-with-forgery-admitted-to-faking-data-feds-say/#comments">announced findings</a> that Laliotis fabricated “data, methods, results, and conclusions” in three published papers and two applications for grant funding from the National Institutes of Health. The findings were based in part on Laliotis’ admissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tsichlis had <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">discovered the data manipulation</a> and asked journal editors to retract two papers after another scientist contacted him about being unable to replicate some of the results. He also alerted Ohio State’s research compliance office, which initiated an inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20220504-Laliotis-Preliminary-Inquiry-Report.pdf">preliminary inquiry report</a>, which we obtained through a public records request, the panel “​​determined that the allegation does have sufficient substance to warrant investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, an investigation did not proceed, a university spokesperson told us, because “an admission from the Respondent closed the matter prior to a final inquiry report being generated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inquiry examined one allegation: Laliotis falsified an image in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24795-1"><em>Nature Communications</em> paper</a> “by splicing two sequencing chromatograms together to generate a false U2AF2 RNA transcript lacking Exon 2.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel could not find sequencing data to match the falsified RNA transcript. Rather, an image showing the purported transcript “appeared to be manipulated in several ways.” The report concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such falsification could not occur by honest error as it was created by combining two separate chromatograms for it to appear as a single contiguous chromatogram.</p>



<p>The report states that Laliotis did not provide a written response to the report, and canceled a scheduled interview “due to his military service in Greece.” The report’s timeline indicates that a research integrity officer at Ohio State sent him a retraction form for the paper in <em>Nature Communications</em> on April 7, 2022. His sister returned the signed form a week later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was retracted last June, two weeks after we published our <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/this-has-been-a-nightmare-one-paper-was-retracted-the-other-still-lingers/">initial story</a> about Tsichlis’ discovery and retraction requests, which he had sent the previous November. </p>



<p>The inquiry report also indicates that Laliotis’ postdoc position in Tsichlis’ lab ended on Feb. 28, 2021, contradicting the information in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/22-CRA-102730001.pdf">complaint</a> filed by an OSU police detective, which stated the university had terminated Laliotis “on or around November 30, 2021.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-children-health-risk">Climate change puts children’s health at risk now and in the future</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate-related environmental disasters have not let up this summer. Heat waves are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">roasting the United States, Europe, China</a> and North Africa (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>), while wildfires are raging in Canada and Greece. Choking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">smoke from the Canadian fires</a> has obscured skies throughout the United States (<em>SN: 7/12/23</em>).</p>



<p>This is harmful to everyone, but especially children. The United Nations Children’s Fund calls climate change a child rights crisis. The organization estimates that 1 billion children worldwide – <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/105376/file/UNICEF-climate-crisis-child-rights-crisis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of all children – are at extremely high risk of the effects of climate change</a>. This threatens the health of these children now and throughout their lives.</p>





<p>Children’s ongoing development from the fetal period through adolescence is one reason that they are particularly vulnerable to health harms from climate-related effects on the environment, says environmental health scientist Frederica Perera of Columbia University. She founded the <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health</a> in 1998. <em>Science News</em> talked with Perera about climate change and children’s health and well-being, the disparities in terms of who is at highest risk and why these early harms endanger health throughout life. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How does climate change’s effects on the environment, such as heat waves and wildfire smoke, affect children’s health?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: When we speak of the effects of climate change and air pollution on children, we really need to include the fetal period as well as infancy and childhood and even adolescence, because the brain and other systems are developing all through those periods.</p>



<p>There’s a multitude of health risks. Severe <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ppe.12834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heat is contributing to preterm births</a>, and it’s causing heat-related deaths and illnesses in infants and children. Children are also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23780231221135971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering from severe weather events</a>: they’re suffering physical injury and also psychological trauma. Longer <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013284118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollen seasons due to climate change</a> are causing more allergy and asthma. Asthma attacks are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502220/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased from breathing forest fire smoke</a>. There’s the issue of food insecurity and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905228116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunted growth due to drought</a> in certain areas of the world. Infectious diseases [spread by insects and other vectors are] increasing as <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2200092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticks and mosquitoes have extended</a> their range.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What are some of the physiological reasons that children are at higher risk than adults from the effects of climate change?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: First, there’s the very rapid and complex developmental programming during the fetal period, infancy and childhood, which is vulnerable to disruption by toxic pollutants, climate-related shocks and stressors. A second point is that infants and children don’t have the same fully functioning biologic defense mechanisms that operate in adults to protect them against toxic exposures.</p>



<p>[In terms of heat,] children have less ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control core body temperature during severe heat waves</a>. The young are dependent on us adults for hydration and for care when there are early indications of heat-related illness.</p>



<p>With respect to air pollution and smoke from forest fires, children are especially vulnerable because of increased exposure. They often spend more time outdoors. [Children have a larger lung surface area and so] breathe more air [per kilogram of] body weight [than adults]. [Children’s noses are less efficient at filtering inhaled] particles, so a higher proportion of these particles <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18097948/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penetrates deeply into the lungs</a>. Their narrow airways are more prone to effects of inflammation, and that results in constriction and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How does climate change affect children’s mental health?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: Climate change is affecting mental health both directly and indirectly. Children who experience severe storms and floods and wildfires show <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-020-01615-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated rates of symptoms of depression and also of post-traumatic stress disorder</a>.</p>





<p>But even if children haven’t directly experienced such a disaster, they’re being affected by climate anxiety. In a survey that covered 10 countries, more than 50 percent [of teens and young people] said they <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt very worried or extremely worried</a> about climate change, and this anxiety was negatively affecting their daily lives.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What disparities exist in terms of which children are at greatest risk from climate-related effects on the environment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: All children are vulnerable, but certain children are hurt first and worst, as we say. This is true globally [in terms of low-income countries compared with high-income countries], and also here in the United States, where communities of color and communities of low income have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04190-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately higher exposure to air pollution</a> as well as to severe heat and extreme weather events. If you take the United States, for example, polluting sources like major highways, bus and truck depots, industrial plants and power plants are disproportionately located in and near communities of color and communities of low income. Discriminatory policies like <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1759127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redlining have created urban heat islands</a>.</p>



<p>We see that disproportionate exposure combined with poverty and racism are contributing to the disparities in disease rates. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthmadata/Child_Prevalence_Race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asthma prevalence</a> and <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infant mortality</a> in Black children are twice the rates seen in white children. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preterm birth rate is 50 percent higher</a> [among Black women compared with white women].</p>



<p><em><strong>SN</strong></em><strong>:</strong> <strong>What do these early health harms to children mean for their lives ahead?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Perera</strong>: We know that there are long-term effects of these early harms and damages. Respiratory conditions frequently persist. Children with severe or <a href="https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-018-0890-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistent asthma are at increased risk</a> of permanent air flow obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Reduced <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30064-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual functioning associated with air pollution</a>, and also <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/7/e009330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malnutrition prenatally or in early life</a>, affects the ability to learn, and that affects the ability to earn and contribute to society. Stress and trauma from shocks of climate change and other adverse events that are <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced at a young age can affect mental health</a> throughout life.</p>



<p>We should be thinking about the long-term implications of these early health harms from climate change and air pollution. When we look then at policies and other interventions to eliminate fossil fuel emissions, we see enormous health and associated economic benefits. Children will be the greatest beneficiaries.</p>

<p>If Retraction Watch were the child of Jewish parents – which happens to be the case – it would be celebrating its bar mitzvah this year. Yes, that’s right, mazel tovs are in order: Retraction Watch turns 13 today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as the blog becomes some version of an adult, we have plenty to celebrate. This week, we published an <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-corrects-itself-right-a-scandal-at-stanford-says-it-doesnt/">op-ed in <em>Scientific American</em></a>. And here are highlights of the past 12 months:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">$250,000 grant from the WoodNext Foundation</a> that allowed us to hire another editor, Fred Joelving, who is already <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/frederik-joelving/">breaking stories right and left</a>.</li>



<li>The additional bandwidth got us back to partnering with other outlets. Since January, we’ve published investigations and other stories with <a href="https://undark.org/2023/05/31/in-the-death-of-an-iranian-scientist-hints-of-unchecked-strife/">Undark</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">Science</a>, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/09/retracted-suicide-risk-study-how-published/">STAT</a>, and the Flatwater Free Press (with <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/a-cornhusker-concussion-study-appeared-to-accurately-id-head-injuries-then-it-hit-a-brick-wall/">pickup by Nebraska Public Media</a>).</li>



<li>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104815">study published in Research Policy</a> &#8220;found that reporting retractions on RW significantly reduced post-retraction citations of non-swiftly retracted articles in biomedical sciences.&#8221; In other words, when Retraction Watch covers a retraction, the retracted paper is less likely to be cited.</li>



<li>The <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/">Retraction Watch Database</a> surpassed 40,000 retractions, which is three times as many as PubMed and multiples of other sources, and powers <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2119086119">scholarship</a> as well as retraction alerts in <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Wileys-Edifix-Integrates-with-the-Retraction-Watch-Database-to-Improve-Research-Integrity/default.aspx">Edifix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1458421915761221643">EndNote</a>, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/thirdiron/jan2021_newsletter-1414009">LibKey</a>, <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/blog-papers-announces-expanded-retraction-support/">Papers</a>, and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/">Zotero</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/08/02/introducing-arxivs-new-governance-model/">Introducing arXiv’s new governance model</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2022, arXiv embarked on a plan to reorganize its governance. We are happy to report that arXiv leadership, with significant input from its advisory board members, has finalized a new governance model. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/arXiv_bylaws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Bylaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went into effect on July 1, 2023. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the governance restructuring, the Member Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Board were retired, and three new Advisory Councils were created:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Editorial Advisory Council</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Editorial Advisory Council acts as the editorial board of arXiv. It organizes and monitors moderation of arXiv content. The former Subject Advisory Committees have been renamed Section Editorial Committees, and the chairs (also known as editors) of these committees are the regular members of the Editorial Advisory Council.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Institutions Advisory Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(IAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institutions Advisory Council represents the scholarly communications community and advises on topics such as issues related to publishing, standards, open access and open science; issues related to the arXiv membership program and policy; arXiv services, interoperability and advocacy to the community; user needs, metadata, technical and user trends, and other issues guiding the sustainability and success of arXiv. Institutions Advisory Council members must be affiliated with an arXiv member organization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Science Advisory Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(SAC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science Advisory Council represents the scientific and research community of arXiv by advising on topics such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intellectual impact and relevance of arXiv, including aspects of significant expansions, high-level issues of standards, expansion in new fields/sections, novelties and changes in the production and dissemination of scholarly works, and impact across disciplines. Science Advisory Council members should be active researchers, be tenured or in a position with similar seniority/stability, be recognized experts in their field, and have had a leadership position and/or successful experience in advisory committees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inaugural chairs of the new councils have been appointed: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editorial Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ralph Wijers, Professor, University of Amsterdam</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Maureen Walsh, Scholarly Sharing Strategist and Associate Professor, The Ohio State University Libraries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Advisory Council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Licia Verde, ICREA Research Professor, Universitat de Barcelona</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key difference in the new structure is the splitting of the former Scientific Advisory Board (which included a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mix of section chairs and scientific community members) into two councils–the SAC and the EAC–to better serve the arXiv community. The SAC will be focused on long-term policy and strategy, and the EAC will be responsible for policy and process specific to content moderation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The updated governance model is very important for our future success,&#8221; said arXiv Faculty Director Ramin Zabih. &#8220;I am grateful to all of the stakeholders who provided feedback throughout the process. Everyone involved in running arXiv looks forward to working with the new advisory councils as we navigate technological changes as well as the continuing evolution of the science communities that arXiv serves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new governance structure was put into place to position arXiv well as it seeks to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamline decision making and increase the operational effectiveness of arXiv</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create clear roles and responsibilities and foster accountability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have representation in governance that reflects the diversity of arXiv’s community</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure opportunities for new voices to be heard</span></li>
</ul>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">The thymus withers away after puberty. But it may be important for adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious organ that’s most active in childhood might play a previously underappreciated role in adults.</p>



<p>In a study of almost 2,300 adults who underwent chest surgery, removing the thymus gland was associated with <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 3 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. The discovery pushes back on a long-held belief that the immune system organ is somewhat expendable in adulthood.</p>





<p>“This is a really important finding,” says immunologist Dong-Ming Su of the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, who was not involved in the work. Prior to this study, he says, “there was no direct evidence to demonstrate [the thymus’] importance in adults.”</p>



<p>The thymus resides in the chest between the lungs, right in front of and above the heart. In infants, the gland almost completely covers the heart. It pumps out immune cells called T cells, which detect foreign invaders that could cause illness.</p>



<p>But the gland’s activity dwindles after puberty, producing fewer new T cells as we age. Adults mostly rely on memory T cells, long-lived cells that rapidly produce specialized T cells in response to intruders the body has fought before. The thymus gradually wastes away and gets replaced by fat.</p>



<p>“It progressively becomes something that looks like more of a fatty blob,” says hematologist-oncologist David Scadden of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Doctors might excise an adult’s thymus if it contains an abnormal growth, to help alleviate an autoimmune disease or simply because it’s in the way during chest surgery, he says. “It’s often removed because it’s not thought to be very consequential.”</p>



<p>To look at consequences of getting rid of the gland, Scadden and colleagues examined health outcomes in 1,146 patients who had their thymus removed from 1993 to early 2020 at Mass General. The researchers compared those patients’ outcomes with those of an equal number of patients, matched for age, sex and race, who had undergone chest surgery within that time period but kept their thymus.</p>



<p>Within five years after surgery, 8.1 percent of thymectomy patients died compared with 2.8 percent of patients whose thymus remained intact. That means that removing the thymus gland was associated with nearly three times the risk of death from any cause in that timeframe.</p>



<p>Similarly, thymus removal was associated with an increased risk of cancer within five years; thymectomy patients had twice the rate of cancer as patients who kept their thymus. The increased cancer risk, Scadden says, might come from the immune system’s compromised surveillance capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a handful of thymus-free patients who developed cancer after surgery and whose blood was analyzed, their T cells seemed unable to identify as many varieties of trespassers compared with T cells from patients who retained their thymus and also developed cancer. Whether the T cells’ reduced repertoire in thymectomy patients led to cancer or was a result of cancer remains unclear, Scadden says.</p>



<p>In patients who didn’t have cancer, infection or an autoimmune disease before surgery, thymus removal was associated with a greater risk of developing an autoimmune disease within five years after surgery, the researchers found. Blood samples from about 20 people in each group hinted that thymectomy might be linked to immune system dysregulation.</p>



<p>“This is pretty striking data,” says immunologist Donna Farber of Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “You don’t often find these huge survival differences with these kinds of [retrospective] studies.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>But the study can’t explain why or how thymectomy is connected to increased rates of death or other negative outcomes. “We don’t know for sure whether the deleterious effects on health are due to the lack of producing new T cells or some other less well-defined function of the thymus,” Scadden says. And Farber suggests that the thymus removal procedure itself — unrelated to the immune system — could even be the cause.</p>



<p>Still, she says, &nbsp;the new work hints that “maybe even that little bit of active thymic tissue you have [is] playing some role.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-necklace-ancient-farmer-social">A child’s ornate necklace highlights ancient farmers’ social complexity</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Middle Eastern child interred in a stone-lined grave around 9,000 years ago wore an elaborate necklace that illustrates the complexity of social life in an early farming community, researchers say.</p>



<p>More than 2,500 stone and shell beads strewn across the child’s upper body, along with a double-holed stone pendant positioned behind the neck and a mother-of-pearl ring laying on the chest, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally formed the impressive necklace</a>, archaeologist Hala Alarashi and colleagues report August 2 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Perforations around the upper half of the mother-of-pearl ring held strings or cords for seven rows of beads that connected to the pendant, they say.</p>





<p>“This imposing necklace was made to be buried with a child who had important social status,” says Alarashi, of the Spanish National Research Council in Barcelona. “We don’t know why this particular child was special.”</p>



<p>Artisans fashioned the necklace out of stones and shells imported from different parts of the Middle East. Two amber beads represent the oldest yet discovered.</p>



<p>The intricate necklace had come apart by the time the youngster’s grave was excavated in 2018 at a site in southern Jordan called Ba’ja. No strings or cords were preserved. So Alarashi and colleagues reconstructed the ornament first by analyzing the distribution of beads on the child’s skeletal remains. Microscopic differences in the intensity of wear in the beads’ openings helped to determine the position of each bead in strung rows. Comparisons of the partially preserved ring to similar objects previously found at Ba’ja let the researchers estimate how many necklace cords it could have held. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Alarashi suspects that a large group of mourners gathered at the densely inhabited village, located on a mountain plateau, to lay to rest the necklace-bedecked child, who was approximately 8 years old. Radiocarbon dating of charred wood bits puts the occupation of this farming village at between 7400 B.C. and 6800 B.C. Public <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-eats-12000-year-old-burial">rituals at gravesites</a> occurred as early as around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East (<em>SN: 8/30/10</em>).</p>



<p>The reconstructed necklace is now on display at Jordan’s Petra Museum in Wadi Musa.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/iceberg-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Image by Freepik" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Randomised trials with a placebo control group are the gold standard for evaluating new treatments to improve health outcomes or to prevent disease. However, it may be unethical to randomise patients to placebo if there is already an established effective method for the treatment or prevention of the condition in question. In this case, a commonly-used design randomises patients to receive either the new treatment or the standard treatment (known as active-control trials). The aim of such trials is often an attempt to show that a new treatment retains most of the effectiveness of the standard treatment while offering other benefits in cost, simplicity, or side effects. We illustrate the problem with a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine trial.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 vaccine trial</strong></p>
<p>The first licensed COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer), was found to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 by approximately 95%. Imagine that we wished to assess a new COVID-19 vaccine after BNT162b2 had been licensed. Given the very high efficacy of BNT162b2, we decide to conduct a trial comparing the new vaccine versus BNT162b2. It is a large trial, with 10,000 persons followed for one year.</p>
<p>Imagine that the rate of COVID-19 cases in the trial population would have been 4% per year <em>in the absence of vaccination</em> and that the new vaccine is 80% effective. With these assumptions we would observe 20 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 80 COVID-19 cases in the experimental vaccine group (see Table below).</p>

</table>
<p><em>Table. Values in bold are known or directly observed, other values are inferred.</em></p>
<p>The standard approach to analysing this hypothetical trial is to calculate the ratio of the numbers of observed cases in the two groups. Here, the value is 4, indicating that the new vaccine increases the risk of getting COVID-19 by a factor of 4, compared with BNT162b2. At face value, this analysis argues strongly against approving or using the new vaccine.</p>
<p>But this would mean rejecting a vaccine that we have assumed is 80% effective, much higher than the target of 50% that was set by the World Health Organization. 80% also happens to be the approximate efficacy of the ChAdOx1 viral-vector vaccine which is considerably cheaper than BNT162b2 and has less stringent cold chain requirements, a key consideration in resource-limited settings. Indeed, ChAdOx1 saved more lives worldwide in 2021 than any other COVID-19 vaccine. How do we resolve this paradox?</p>
<p><strong>The importance of averted events</strong></p>
<p>In our paper we argue that the interpretation of active-control trials must consider <em>averted </em>events as well as observed events. From Table 1 we see that BNT162b2 has averted 380 COVID-19 cases and that the new vaccine has averted 320 cases. The ratio of the numbers of averted cases is 320/380 = 0.842. The interpretation is that the new vaccine averts 84.2% of the COVID-19 cases that would have been averted by use of BNT162b2 (we call this the averted events ratio). This – rather than the ratio of 4 in terms of observed events – is the most relevant measure for policy makers trying to decide which vaccine to implement.</p>
<p>Naturally, if everything else was equal (including cost) then BNT162b2 would be the vaccine of choice, but real-world decisions are more complex than this.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>So far, we have skipped over a big problem in estimating the numbers of averted events: we need to make an assumption about the rate of COVID-19 in the absence of vaccination (we assumed 4% per year in our example). Without a placebo group, we cannot get this information directly from the trial and have to use external information instead.</p>
<p>Our paper discusses various approaches to address this problem. None of these are entirely satisfactory but we argue that this must be attempted to draw rational inferences. Our proposed method is especially relevant when the standard treatment is very effective, where it can lead to a substantial saving in sample size.</p>

                <p><em>Just back from her first conference, Sara Zsadanyi shares her own experience and tips on best to prepare for this research milestone.</em></p>

<p>My first-ever conference was an incredible experience. Fresh out of the first year of my PhD, I jumped into the deep end at the biggest conference of my field, the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), which welcomes over 7000 in-person attendees.</p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_0ed118a000794fa28bc0661b02237b28~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>Alongside presenting two posters, I’m also an ISTAART Ambassador this year meaning that I worked at the conference too. The ambassadors were responsible for keeping the conference running smoothly which meant setting up the talks and sessions, helping people around the venue, and giving out information to all those who needed it. Our other main role was to promote ISTAART, a community of more than 10,000 researchers with a shared goal of advancing Alzheimer’s research and treatment who collaborate and connect. It was exhausting, but so rewarding. Like many early in their careers facing their first conference,  I had no expectations for what a  conference would be like, so I hope my insights will help you to feel more prepared.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Firstly, the excitement leading up to the conference may distract you from lab work. Use this constructively and take the time to check out the conference schedule. Plan all the sessions you want to attend, and make sure to check out the poster abstracts as these are where you can engage in lively discussions. You won’t be able to get to all the posters or talks, so make sure that you plan ahead so you can catch all the ones you’re most interested in. Jot down the names of researchers you'd love to meet, and don't hesitate to reach out during the event - this is the point of conferences after all!</p>
<blockquote>The word ‘networking’ usually sends shivers down my spine, but the seasoned conference goers were friendly and understanding</blockquote>
<p>If you're presenting a poster at the conference, prepare well in advance. Don't leave the visual presentation for the last minute like I did! Read around your own research to remind yourself of the big picture, and anticipate the kinds of questions that experts, as well as those unfamiliar with your field, will ask. Your supervisor and lab mates can be very helpful for this part. Make sure that at some point you sit down and prepare the overview of your work that you will give people when they arrive at your poster. You don’t necessarily need to memorise your pitch word for word, but having a clear idea of what you’ll say will help to keep the nerves at bay.</p>

<p>Contrary to the media’s portrayal of conferences, AAIC was the most welcoming academic setting I've experienced. The word ‘networking’ usually sends shivers down my spine, but the seasoned conference goers were friendly and understanding, and many shared how uncertain they felt at their first conference with me. So, a few tips for approaching other researchers: we are all there to talk about our own research, so ask lots of questions, and approach these situations with an eagerness to learn. Go in with a big smile, a handshake, your name, and a compliment on their talk or poster. If you’re feeling nervous, ask your supervisor or other lab mates to introduce you to researchers they think you should know.</p>
<blockquote>You never know when a seemingly unrelated talk might change your view on your own research</blockquote>
<p>There were many insightful sessions related to my own research so I made sure to focus my efforts on getting to these, but one surprising by-product of my role as an ISTAART ambassador was  finding myself completely fascinated by the sessions unrelated to my topic that I was signed up to help out at. A big focus of AAIC was on patient/public engagement and dementia care which are now topics I am diving into so I can stay connected to the people behind our research. Venture out into different topics - you never know when a seemingly unrelated talk might change your view on your own research.</p>

<p>It's not just about the science, though. I loved the coffee breaks, lunches, immersion sessions, and evening networking events at AAIC. Don’t be shy, you might just find yourself making connections that last a lifetime!</p>

<p>So, first-time conference goers, get ready for an unforgettable experience. Plan ahead, embrace the atmosphere, engage with others and explore new topics. Conferences are about more than just research; they're about building connections and expanding your horizons. Dive in and make the most of this experience! Finally, I definitely recommend applying for a volunteering role, such as the ISTAART ambassadorship, because it gives even more opportunities to approach other researchers and opens doors to future collaborations and job opportunities. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Sara Zsadanyi and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colossal-ancient-whale-heaviest-animal">A colossal ancient whale could be the heaviest animal ever known</a></h4>

              
                <p>Move over, blue whales. There could be a new heavyweight champ in town.</p>



<p>Fossilized vertebrae and ribs from a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06381-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly discovered ancient whale</a> suggest that it could have outweighed modern blue whales, researchers report August 2 in <em>Nature</em>. If so, the extinct whale would be the heaviest animal ever known to exist.</p>



<p>The roughly 39-million-year-old behemoth, <em>Perucetus colossus</em>, is a type of cetacean, a group that includes modern whales, dolphins and porpoises. And its bones were massive. <em>P. colossus</em>’ skeleton alone could have weighed about 5 to 7 metric tons, two to three times as much as a 25-meter-long blue whale’s skeleton does, the researchers estimate.</p>



<p>The fossils, which were found in southern Peru, were “clearly something exceptional from the first look,” says Eli Amson, a paleontologist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. “You don’t move a vertebra like this by yourself.” Thirteen vertebrae were unearthed in total, each weighing over 100 kilograms, or more than a baby elephant.</p>

The vertebra, and 12 others like it, weighs over 100 kilograms.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130082">Giovanni Bianucci</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Such heavy bones are consistent with a coastal, shallow-diving lifestyle, Amson and colleagues say. For deep dives, whales need a lighter skeleton so they can come back up for air without working too hard. The massive bones of <em>P. colossus</em> could have helped it hover at shallow depths by balancing the upward buoyant force from the air in its lungs.</p>



<p>Overall, <em>P. colossus</em> could have weighed anywhere from 85 to 340 metric tons, the team estimates. That’s at least as much as a typical blue whale, and up to as much as eight passenger jets. But the animal’s true mass is difficult to determine from only fossils and would have also depended on the distribution and density of the creature’s soft tissues.</p>





<p>Some scientists are skeptical that <em>P. colossus</em> could have reached the upper end of that mass range. Without a fossil skull, it’s hard to know what <em>P. colossus</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-some-whales-are-giants-others-are-just-big">could have eaten</a> to sustain such an enormous size, says Nicholas Pyenson, a paleontologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>).</p>



<p>Amson says he is hopeful that the team will find a more complete specimen of the whale to better understand how it maintained its heavyweight status.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/july-2023-just-unfortunate-world-record-hot">July 2023 nailed an unfortunate world record: hottest month ever recorded</a></h4>

              
                <p>Most humans felt the scorching touch of climate change in July.</p>



<p>July 2023 was the<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/report/climate-shift-index-global-july-2023-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hottest month ever recorded</a>, and climate change made the elevated temperatures across 51 percent of Earth’s land surface at least five times more likely, according to a study released August 2 by Climate Central.</p>



<p>Researchers had already spotlighted the fingerprint of climate change on recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">heat waves</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">China, North America and Europe</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>;<em> SN: 7/25/23</em>). But the new report shows that during July, climate change’s influence extended across much of the globe, especially “a tropical band around the planet that includes Africa, South and Central America, the Malay Archipelago and many of the small island nations in both hemispheres,” Andrew Pershing, a climate scientist with the Princeton, N.J., nonprofit, said at an August 1 news briefing.</p>





<p>While the World Meteorological Organization has yet to officially deem July as Earth&#8217;s hottest recorded month, it has confirmed the month&#8217;s first three weeks were the&nbsp;<a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/july-2023-set-be-hottest-month-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hottest three-week period on record</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest global average temperature</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;17.23° Celsius (63.01° Fahrenheit)&nbsp;— was recorded on July 6 (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>). “It’s pretty clear that July is going to hit the record,” Pershing said.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues used computers to simulate the world with contemporary climate warming — 1.27 degrees C above preindustrial levels — and without it to isolate the influence of climate change on temperatures worldwide.</p>

<p>Climate change is making hotter temperatures more likely to occur around the world, especially in the tropics. This map shows how many times more likely average temperatures for the month of July were due to climate change than without it.</p>

<p>Last month more than 6.5 billion people, or 81 percent of the human population, experienced heat that was at least three times more likely in a world with climate change than without it, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The recent return of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that temporarily raises global average temperatures, is also “definitely having an effect,” said Pershing.</p>



<p>But humans are warming the climate so fast that this year’s elevated temperatures could soon return even without El Niño. “This is the hottest El Niño year we’ve ever had,” Pershing said, “and five years from now, this will be a normal year.”</p>

<p>The publisher Wiley has fired the chief editor of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> after he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">resigned</a> over conflicts with the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/michael-n-dawson">Michael Dawson</a>, a professor at the University of California, Merced, submitted his resignation on June 21, <a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563513268158464?s=20">tweeting</a> that he made the decision “because journal management declined to explore productive solutions to a suite of challenges facing the journal.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/21/chiefeditor-resign-jbiogeography/">blog post</a>, Dawson listed several concerns from his resignation letter, including proposed growth targets for the journal, equity issues in adopting an open access model in which authors pay fees to publish their work, and compensation for the editors. He <a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563512064389122?s=20">tweeted</a> that the journal’s December issue would be his last.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley, however, confirmed through a spokesperson that “we are working through him to a contractual termination date of August 27th.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawson told Retraction Watch that he was not available to speak before the end of the week.</p>



<p>Besides Dawson’s resignation and now firing, the journal has lost a deputy editor in chief, and the majority of its associate editors have been refusing to handle new submissions for the past month, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">we’ve previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The associate editors cited opposition to switching the journal to a full open access model, a proposed increase to the journal’s output, and automatic referral of rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals as the issues that triggered their work stoppage, set to end yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dispute between the editors of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> and Wiley is the latest in which journal editors have recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">resigned</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/"> en masse</a>, or <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a>, due to similar conflicts with for-profit publishers.</p>



<p>Update, 8/2/23, 0230 UTC: Following the publication of this post, a Wiley spokesperson tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley informed journal editors on July 14 that there are no plans to flip the Journal of Biogeography to open access but that we continually evaluate our journals to ensure they stay aligned with subject areas and funding trends. We also informed editors at that time that the Journal of Biogeography is no longer enrolled in the referral program.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-los-angeles-thread-millipede">The newfound Los Angeles thread millipede is ready for its close-up</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite living in the entertainment capital of the world, the Los Angeles thread millipede has avoided the limelight. But when researchers spotted it, they knew they’d found a creature worthy of center stage.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/102537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newfound species (<em>Illacme socal)</em></a> is small, pale and lives at least 10 centimeters under the soil, researchers report June 21 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. It’s just the third known species in this genus, a group of millipedes that stands out for their subterranean lifestyles and isolation from relatives.</p>





<p><em>I. socal</em> “looks like somebody plucked a thread out of their shirt,” says Paul Marek, a millipede biologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>Naturalists Cedric Lee, of the University of California, Berkeley, and James Bailey discovered the millipede on a slug-finding expedition in Lake Forest, Calif., in 2018. While hunting for gelatinous gastropods, they stumbled upon a millipede unlike any they’d seen before. The duo uploaded a record of their find to iNaturalist, an app that lets users share photos of organisms they find with others, and identified the specimen as a member of the Siphonophoridae family.</p>



<p>Marek, also an iNaturalist aficionado, has alerts set up for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/millipede-most-legs-eumillipes-persephone">these kinds of critters</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). The discovery piqued his interest because the only other places he knows this family from in California are hundreds of kilometers north of Los Angeles. Lake Forest is roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the city. So Marek teamed up with Lee and Bailey to solve the myriapod mystery.</p>



<p>During a visit to California over Christmas, Marek went to Lake Forest to look for more millipedes. “We collected around 10 individuals to get a good understanding of the variation” in what the critter looks like, he says. He then studied the males’ gonopods — sperm transfer organs that evolved from leg segments — to see if they matched any known species. “They were distinct,” Marek says. Genome sequencing confirmed that the Los Angeles millipedes are a newfound species.</p>

Marek <em>et al</em>/<em>ZooKeys</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Marek dubbed the species <em>I. socal </em>on the suggestion of Lee, but the team also wanted to be sure to give the millipede an easily recognizable stage name: the Los Angeles thread millipede. “If species are known by their common names,” Marek says, “it&#8217;s helpful for subsequent conservation action.”</p>



<p>While many other millipedes can be found close to the surface, those in the <em>Illacme</em> genus like to dig deep. “They live this almost completely subterranean lifestyle,” says Derek Hennen, a myriapod biologist at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville who was not involved in the study but who has worked with Marek. So it’s not too surprising that the newfound species went undiscovered for so long. The closest relatives of <em>Illacme</em> are “either in South Africa or maybe Chile,” Hennen says.</p>



<p>Marek says <em>I. socal </em>is proof of the startling amount of hidden diversity in the soil beneath us. “This is really a frontier of biodiversity. There&#8217;s a lot more stuff under our feet.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/miyazaki.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/miyazaki.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="" class="wp-image-124134" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Toshiaki Miyazaki</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The president of Aizu University in Japan has resigned after two investigations found he had self-plagiarized or double-submitted a dozen papers.</p>



<p>Toshiaki Miyazaki was also found to have “filed an application for a project subsidized by the national government without going through the university official procedures,” which “caused confusion,” <a href="https://u-aizu.ac.jp/en/information/20230727Resignation.html">according to Aizu</a>. He resigned effective today [July 31].</p>



<p>The move comes more than a year after the first investigation, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/03/university-president-in-japan-self-plagiarized-and-will-forfeit-some-pay/">we reported</a>, which concluded in February 2022 and found that Miyazaki had self-plagiarized four papers. At that time, he had to forfeit 20% of one month’s salary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, according to a <a href="https://u-aizu.ac.jp/files/bd9068b00200f3ef518c913848267fdf4c4311c3.pdf">report issued last week by the university</a>, Miyazaki “self-reported that there were 12 papers suspected of self-plagiarism.” A preliminary investigation then began, with a full investigation starting in April and lasting until February of this year.</p>



<span id="more-127644"></span>



<p>The university’s committee reviewed 54 papers, finding&nbsp; Miyazaki guilty of self-plagiarism in three and double submission in five. The committee defined the former as new papers that failed to cite previous overlapping work by Miyazaki, and the latter as papers that cited the previous work but did not advance it.</p>



<p>The papers were published between 2008 and 2016, and were studies of sensor networks. The committee determined that none of Miyazaki’s co-authors was at fault.</p>



<p>Miyazaki appealed the findings in February 2023. The committee reinvestigated, changing one of the double submissions to a case of self-plagiarism but keeping the other findings the same. They recommended retraction of the double submission papers, and correction of the self-plagiarism cases.</p>



<p>The report found that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In regard to the papers written on the development of systems, Professor Miyazaki thought that it did not constitute self &#8211; plagiarism to re &#8211; use the same sentences and figures used in his own papers previously published without citations to explain the common parts of the system in his new papers . He also thought that to some extent addition of contents different from previous papers to new papers without citations did not constitute double submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Such practices are, some argue, a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1550">gray area</a>.</p>



<p>Miyazaki also believed that after patenting his work, “he should publicize the technology repeatedly by using the opportunity as means to publish papers,” the report said. He also “failed to check the paper submission rules including the manuals and policies of the publishers to which he submitted the papers,” and “did not pay attention to the changes in the concept of research misconduct, such as the establishment of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Research Misconduct by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in 2006 and the revision of the same guidelines in 2014.”</p>



<p>The committee concluded Miyazaki “significantly neglected the basic duty of care expected of a researcher,” and “thought that data and research results of his students enrolled at the university belonged to him as they were under his supervision and not able to discuss with him on an equal footing.” He also included a student in the acknowledgements of a paper rather than as an author “due to the situation that it was difficult to contact them after their graduation.”</p>



<p>The university said it would make several changes in response to the episode, including “Providing provisions to categorize misconduct other than fabrication, falsification and plagiarism, such as self &#8211; plagiarism and double submission in concrete terms, and adding the provisions to ensure the effectiveness of research ethics education.”</p>



<p>Miyazaki did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Oldest rocks</strong> </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/natural-sciences-0"><em>Science News</em></a>, July 21, 1973</p>



<p>Until recently, Greenland possessed the oldest known rocks in the world. They <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/greenland-rocks-younger-still-old">date back 3.7 billion years</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/72, p. 374</em>). Now granite and crystalline schist specimens … suggest that the Antarctic Continent is older. These specimens date back 4 billion years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update:</h4>



<p>At about 4.3 billion years old, bedrock in northeastern Canada currently holds the title of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earths-original-crust-preserve-time-plate-tectonics">oldest known rock on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/17, p. 8</em>). In Western Australia, scientists have found zircon crystals in bedrock that are even older, dating to about 4.4 billion years ago. For comparison, Earth is only about 4.5 billion years old. </p>



<p>Since these ancient materials preserve information about early Earth, they have fueled ongoing debates about when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/age-earths-crust-confirmed">how Earth’s crust formed</a>, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">plate tectonics started</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/41-billion-year-old-crystal-may-hold-earliest-signs-life">when life on the planet first arose</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/14; SN: 5/2/22; SN: 10/19/15</em>). Additional clues that could help resolve the debates might lie on the moon. Lunar samples collected by Apollo 14 astronauts contain <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19300202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-billion-year-old zircons</a> that may have been delivered via an Earth meteor, scientists reported in 2019.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="233" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman-233x300.jpeg?resize=233%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-125707" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg?resize=233%2C300&amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russell Taichman</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Less than a year after he became dean of the University of Alabama Birmingham School of Dentistry, an uncomfortable email landed in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/dentistry/home/people/faculty/russell-taichman">Russell Taichman’s</a> inbox. </p>



<p>Overlapping and duplicated panels in one of Taichman’s 2005 papers were among a list of complaints relayed by the publisher of <em>Cellular Signalling </em>in the April 2020 correspondence – complaints which were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/15BDB9EC8B2E38E8A42D012280864A">publicly posted on PubPeer</a> by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The substance of the complaint is image manipulation, which if true, would violate our publishing policies,” the email stated. “Please note that if we do not have an adequate and timely response, we may be forced to conclude that the allegations are truthful.”</p>



<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656805000677">“Diverse signaling pathways through the SDF-1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in prostate cancer cell lines leads to altered patterns of cytokine secretion and angiogenesis”</a>, eventually became the first of five of Taichman’s papers to be retracted. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/26/dental-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions-for-cancer-research-papers/">first reported</a> on the retractions last September.&nbsp; Since then, following a public records request, we’ve obtained <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Responsive-Documents_Redacted.pdf">20 pages of redacted emails</a> that reveal the story behind the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127633"></span>



<p>As it turns out, Taichman himself pushed for one retraction, although the journal editor deemed an investigation unnecessary, and he initiated at least another two of the five of the retractions in an apparent bid to correct the scientific record. The emails reveal the now-former dean – who remains a professor at UAB after stepping down from his leadership post in July “to focus on teaching and scholarship” –&nbsp; began to suspect that his postdoctoral student at the time, Jianhua Wang, was to blame for the problematic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All five of the retracted papers were published when Taichman was a <a href="https://dent.umich.edu/directory/rtaich">professor of periodontics and associate dean for research</a> at the University of Michigan. He took on the role of dean in Alabama in July 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exchanges between Taichman, Wang and several journal publishers offer a rare look behind the scenes of the process of scientific correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Just two hours after receiving the first email from the publisher, Taichman forwarded it to Wang.&nbsp;Taichman wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Hope all is well. I received this below. I am not sure how to handle it but on the surface there looks as if there are issues which I did not know. Can you please help explain these or I am going to have little choice but to address this which could mean withdrawing the paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wang, who did not respond to our request for comment, replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I agree that this is a very serious charge. I double check my copy of notebook kept in my office and found the raw data is limited. Most of data were kept in UM lab. I will answer the concerns point to point as shown below in bold black. However, based on current situation of USA, the best way is that you make a final decision to withdraw the paper. Sorry for bringing this trouble to you AND I am also self-blamed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given the date – April 2020 – Wang may have been referring to the COVID outbreak in the US at the time as the “current situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang was a postdoctoral fellow in Taichman’s lab at the University of Michigan from 2005 to 2010. He was the first author of the five retracted papers, and was responsible for the primary generation of data and assembly of figures, according to the University of Alabama’s Open Records office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang returned to China in 2010.</p>



<p>In June 2020, the journal publisher contacted Taichman again, writing that the editor-in-chief would not take the investigation of the paper further. But that wasn’t good enough for Taichman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September the same year, Taichman wrote back saying he had been “mulling the issue”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I appreciate that the Editor in Chief has concluded their investigation into our work. Never the less, I would like to request retraction of the paper. Letting the record stand as incorrect, just does not sit right with me. I have corresponded with all the authors, they have suggested multiple fixes but in the end, I am not in a position to repeat the experiments, and I am still not able to travel during the pandemic to obtain the primary data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He goes on to suggest two versions of a retraction notice, the first of which placed the blame squarely on Jianhua Wang.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The corresponding author of the paper Wang et al, Cellular Signalling, Volume 17, Pages 1578-1592, 2005 would like to retract the above paper as he has become aware that the some of the figures including Figure 1B, and Figure 6A were duplicated by the first author. The corresponding author wishes to convey sincere regret to the editor and readers of the journal of Cellular Signaling.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109909">retraction notice</a> that was eventually published in January 2021 does not blame Wang, instead crediting Bik for discovering the image duplications.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Inspired by the initial complaints from <em>Cellular Signalling, </em>Taichman combed through papers from his lab in search of other anomalies in the work that Wang had contributed to, according to the FOIA emails. He spotted an image from the <em>Cellular Signalling </em>paper that was replicated in a later <em>Cancer Research </em>paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2971">A Glycolytic Mechanism Regulating an Angiogenic Switch in Prostate Cancer”</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, Taichman sent an email to the editors at <em>Cancer Research</em> describing his findings and attaching other complaints about the paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F812B34F81256487E17917D064C584">made on PubPeer</a>, again by Bik.</p>



<p>“I am intent on correcting the scientific record,” he wrote. “Many of the images were duplicated and while I might not agree with all the issues, there are enough which are indisputable from my perspective.</p>



<p>The next sentence revealed the incident was apparently not isolated to Taichman:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Further, this AM I reached out to one of my major collaborators [redacted] who published a paper with Dr. Wang independent of my involvement. Sadly, this issue with Dr. Wang was not unique to me, and apparently the issue was flagged some time ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, I am embarrassed and not clear how I missed these issues.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper was eventually <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-0464">retracted in March 2021</a>. Wang and two other authors did not respond to the journal’s correspondence about the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two more of Taichman and Wang’s papers in the journal were later retracted in September 2022, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-2398">“Characterization of Phosphoglycerate Kinase-1 Expression of Stromal Cells Derived from Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer Progression”</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-2399">“CXCR6 Induces Prostate Cancer Progression by the AKT/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling Pathway”</a>, for similar issues with duplicated images. Wang and several other authors did not respond about those retractions, either. It is not clear from the emails we obtained whether these retractions were prompted by Taichman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2021, Taichman again alerted staff at the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> to several problems in the paper <a href="https://doi-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/10.1074/jbc.M707465200">“The Role of CXCR7/RDC1 as a Chemokine Receptor for CXCL12/SDF-1 in Prostate Cancer</a>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As it turns out Dr. Jianhua Wang (1st Author) who was a post-doc in my laboratory when I was at U/ Michigan in the early 2000s, duplicated several pieces of the data,” he wrote. “Clearly I am embarrassed. But I am committed to doing the right thing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102126">notice</a> published in the journal in July 2022 stated that the authors had opted to withdraw the paper “to correct the scientific record,” except for Wang who could not be contacted. The paper was the most highly cited out of the five retractions, with 454 citations since its publication in 2008, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Taichman says that the emails obtained through a Alabama Open Records Act request “speak for themselves” in showing that Wang admitted guilt and that he worked diligently to correct the scientific record as soon as he became aware of the issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. Wang took advantage of trust, and it is safe to say the team and our collaborators certainly wish we had identified the issues in real time,” he wrote in an email in response to our questions. “We remain committed to proactively correcting the scientific record wherever necessary.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another seven of Taichman’s papers on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=taichman">have been flagged</a> for potential image anomalies, Wang is listed as a co-author on one of them. So far, two of the seven have been corrected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324007012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blight</a><br><em>Emily Monosson</em><br><em>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $28.95</em></p>



<p>In the summer of 1904, American chestnut trees in the Bronx were in trouble. Leaves, normally slender and brilliantly green, were curling at the edges and turning yellow. Some tree limbs and trunks sported rust-colored splotches. By the next summer, almost every chestnut tree in the New York Zoological Park, now the Bronx Zoo, was dead or dying. By around 1940, almost every American chestnut across its native range, the eastern United States, was gone. The trees had been felled by a microscopic fiend: <em>Cryphonectria parasitica</em>, a fungus that causes chestnut blight.</p>





<p>That fungus had been imported on Japanese chestnut trees. Once it arrived on U.S. soil, it spread like wildfire, driving the American chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) to functional extinction. </p>



<p>Today, some still grow, though only as immature trees popping up from the still-living roots of long-gone trees. But these shoots have no hope of towering over the forest as chestnut trees once did, standing as tall as a nine-story building. Because <em>C. parasitica </em>persists in the environment, the saplings are doomed to die from the moment they sprout.</p>



<p>The fate of the American chestnut is only one example of the devastation fungi can spawn. In her new book, <em>Blight:</em> <em>Fungi and the Coming Pandemic</em>, author Emily Monosson presents an eye-opening, and at times grisly, account of fungal diseases that threaten pine trees, bananas, frogs, bats and, increasingly, people.</p>



<p>Not all fungi are bad. In fact, “most fungi give life,” Monosson explains. By helping to decompose dead organisms, fungi recycle essential nutrients. But as people travel or trade plants and animals around the globe, foreign fungi hitch a ride to places they don’t belong and come into contact with organisms not accustomed to living with them — sometimes with deadly consequences.</p>



<p>Those consequences are the focus of the first half of the book. Monosson kicks off with the topic that might seem most pressing: Do fungi pose a threat to people? Fortunately, humans — and other mammals — run too hot for most fungi. “Our bodies are like Death Valley,” Monosson writes. An internal temperature of 98.6° Fahrenheit (37° Celsius) is white-hot for organisms that prefer 54° to 86° F (12° to 30° C). </p>



<p>What’s more, our immune systems are quite adept at fending off potential fungal foes. So while people who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for fungal infections, serious cases are relatively uncommon compared with other infectious diseases.</p>



<p>But climate change could push fungi to adapt to higher temperatures. Monosson highlights <em>Candida auris</em>, which evolved in the last decade or so to infect people and is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">spreading fast in health care facilities</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 5</em>). Other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">fungal infections in people</a>, such as valley fever, might also spread to new places alongside higher temperatures (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>Fungal pandemics in other species offer lessons for how devastating fungal diseases can be. Monosson describes these outbreaks in morbid detail.</p>

<p>Fusarium wilt strangles the plants that provide the world with yellow bananas. Carcasses of bats, starved to death by <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, the cause of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/probiotic-bacteria-spray-bats-deadly-white-nose-syndrome">white nose syndrome</a>, litter caves across the United States (<em>SN Online: 7/15/19</em>). Researchers studying frogs in Central America and elsewhere watch in horror as populations dwindle and disappear, suffocated by <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, or chytrid.</p>



<p>At this point in the book, I felt hopeless. Perhaps <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">HBO’s hit series <em>The Last of Us</em></a><em> </em>is a real glimpse into the future (<em>SN Online: /21/23</em>). But never fear, evolution can step in and provide “glimmers of hope,” Monosson writes. Affected plants and animals can adapt to better handle fungal foes. (Contrary to what Monosson says, however, pathogens don’t evolve for their own good in ways that make them more benevolent to their hosts. They change in ways that ensure spread.)</p>





<p>A handful of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/harlequin-frogs-lazarus-species-extinction-comeback">frog populations flattened by chytrid are appearing again</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 6</em>). In Yosemite National Park, frogs infected with the fungus show no sign of disease. Trees may be building resistance too. Some whitebark pine trees (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>) in the western United States have genes that render them resistant to white pine blister rust, a disease that has been afflicting the trees for more than a century.</p>



<p>People are also stepping in to help. And given our role in spreading fungal diseases, maybe we have an obligation to, Monosson argues. Fattening up bats in the fall, for example, could help them survive white nose syndrome, which robs the animals of fat stores during winter hibernation. Some researchers are even looking to natural resistance to find solutions, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/any-hope-old-chestnuts">efforts to resurrect American chestnuts</a> (<em>SN: 5/3/03, p. 282</em>). Botanists hope that by genetically altering the trees, “someday the chestnut may rise again, taking its place among the oak and hemlock,” Monosson writes.</p>



<p>For now, the best hope may be preventing fungal diseases in the first place. “When humans first began moving animals and plants, cut forests, expanded agricultural lands, there was no thought to planetary protection,” Monosson writes. “Now we know better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/playful-behavior-rats-area-brain">Playful behavior in rats is controlled by a specific area of their brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rats are extremely playful creatures. They love playing chase, and they literally jump for joy when tickled. Central to this playfulness, a new study finds, are cells in a specific region of rats’ brains.</p>



<p>Neurons in the periaqueductal gray, or PAG, are <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(23)00477-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active in rats during different kinds of play</a>, scientists report July 28 in <em>Neuron</em>. And blocking the activity of those neurons makes the rodents much less playful.</p>



<p>The results give insight into a poorly understood behavior, particularly in terms of how play is controlled in the brain. “There are prejudices that it&#8217;s childish and not important, but play is an underrated behavior,” says Michael Brecht, a neuroscientist at Humboldt University in Berlin.</p>





<p>Scientists think play helps animals develop resilience. Some even relate it to optimal functioning. “When you&#8217;re playing, you’re being your most creative, thoughtful, interactive self,” says Jeffrey Burgdorf, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the new study. This is the opposite of depressive states, and Burgdorf’s own research aims to turn understanding the neuroscience of play into new therapies for mood disorders.</p>



<p>For the new study, Brecht and colleagues got rats used to lab life and being tickled and played with in a game of chase-the-hand. When rats play, they squeal with glee at a frequency of 50 kilohertz, which humans can’t hear. The researchers recorded these ultrasonic giggles as a way of measuring when the rats were having fun.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch rats engage in play behavior with researchers and each other | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azeBn5CRWxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To explore how a specific brain region in rats might relate to their well-documented play behavior, researchers tickled rats on their bellies and backs and played chase-the-hand. Rats also played together, chasing and play-fighting. Ultrasonic giggles, processed to make them audible to humans, coordinate social play and show that the rats are having fun.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Brecht and colleagues suspected the PAG — a deep, midbrain region connecting the forebrain to the lower brainstem that’s involved in many automatic functions and instinctual responses — might be involved in play behavior, partly because it controls these vocalizations. If your playmate stops laughing, it is time to stop play-fighting.</p>



<p>The team recorded activity from individual cells in rats’ PAGs while they played chase-the-hand or were tickled. Cells located in two columns down the sides of the PAG were active during play, the researchers found. “These cells really go crazy, especially in response to tickling,” Brecht says. Importantly, the same cells were active during both chasing and tickling. “This was where we thought: These are the cells,” Brecht says. “They’re not about moving, or touch. They’re about fun.”</p>



<p>Making the rats anxious by putting them on an elevated, brightly lit platform suppressed playfulness and giggles, and reduced activity in these “fun” cells.</p>



<p>The researchers then genetically altered the cells so they could be turned off using light. Blocking activity in just these cells caused the rats to play much less and become less ticklish, as shown by an absence of giggles, the team found.</p>



<p>These results suggest that the PAG is required for play, probably as part of a circuit. Brecht and colleagues have previously found play-responsive neurons <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giggling-rats-help-reveal-how-brain-creates-joy">in the somatosensory cortex</a>, a brain region responsible for perceiving touch (<em>SN: 11/10/16</em>). However, other research has shown that animals without a cortex still play. Brecht doesn’t think the same will be true for animals lacking the play-associated part of the PAG. “We think it&#8217;s a control structure for playfulness.”</p>



<p>Understanding this circuitry better may help researchers improve <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">their knowledge of depression in people</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/23</em>). “The people that really, really need help are the ones that can&#8217;t play,” Burgdorf says. The new study is a step toward understanding what that looks like in the brain, which could one day help clinicians choose the best treatments for different patients, Burgdorf says.</p>



<p>The team plans to study this region in other animals to see how it might differ across species and to see if it helps explain why some animals are more playful than others, Brecht says. One of the first things Brecht did after realizing its importance in rats was look at the region in humans. “And guess what? It’s very large,” he says. “That&#8217;s not a coincidence: No animal plays as many games as we do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-poop-climate-warming-methane-red-algae">Cow poop emits climate-warming methane. Adding red algae may help</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth has a cow problem. Cow agriculture is one of the largest emitters of climate-warming methane to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But adding a type of red algae known for its methane-inhibiting properties to cow feces might help. Doing so <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1187838/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces the production of methane within feces</a> by about 44 percent, researchers report July 13 in <em>Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems</em>. That offers a promising new avenue to reduce overall methane emissions from cattle, the scientists say.</p>





<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows">Cow agriculture</a> is responsible for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">nearly a quarter of the world’s emissions of methane</a>, a potent greenhouse gas (<em>SN: 11/18/15; SN: 5/5/22</em>). Bacteria in the cows&#8217; guts make methane during digestion that is then released to the world, mostly via burps. A smaller — but not insignificant — amount of methane is also emitted directly from the cows’ feces during decomposition.</p>



<p>Researchers have been actively seeking solutions to the gut-produced methane. Adding just a pinch — 0.5 percent of the dry feed — of the red algae <em>Asparagopsis taxiformis </em>to the cows’ food can prevent <a href="https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(21)00092-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 65 percent of that methane production</a>.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous in tropical ocean waters, <em>A. taxiformis</em> contains an organic compound called bromoform, which inactivates an enzyme that normally helps the methane reaction along. This research has raised concerns that the milk of dairy cows fed the algae may contain toxic levels of bromoform as well as iodine in their milk and meat. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has assessed bromoform as a probable human carcinogen, and too much iodine can cause thyroid malfunction.</p>

<p>Mohammad Ramin, an animal scientist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå, and colleagues wondered whether it might be possible to cut out the middleman — by adding the algae directly to the cows’ poop. That wouldn’t reduce the gut-produced methane, but it might reduce overall cattle emissions without impacting meat or milk.</p>



<p>Methane emitted from feces is primarily a problem when it comes to dairy cows, says Sara Place, an animal scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who was not involved in the study. Dairy cows tend to be raised in environments with more oxygen-poor soils, and methane-producing bacteria thrive in such anaerobic environments. Cows raised for beef tend to live out their lives and defecate in open pasturelands or in an enclosed, but dry, feedlot, which is less conducive ground for methane production.</p>



<p>In the new study, Ramin and colleagues added algae to four dairy cows’ feces. Two had been fed the algae, and two hadn’t. Each fecal sample was divided further, with one subsample given additional algae and the other left alone. Then, all the fecal samples were allowed to incubate, slowly decomposing in the laboratory. After nine weeks, the team analyzed the subsamples to see how much methane they contained.</p>



<p>As expected, adding algae to the cows’ food did initially reduce methane in their poop. But once the poop began to decompose, the production of new methane wasn’t affected by whether the cows had eaten the algae or not. The team also examined the microbial communities living in the different types of poop, and they found that there wasn’t much difference between the algae-fed cows and the control cows. That suggests that algae food supplements aren’t that effective at inhibiting methane production outside the stomach.</p>



<p>But adding the algae directly to the feces did make a noticeable difference to methane coming from decomposition. That, the team says, suggests that this would be an effective part of the solution to the larger cow-methane problem.</p>



<p>The major strength of this new work is that it focuses on providing a solution to an understudied part of the cow-methane problem, says Christopher Glasson, a chemist at the University of Waikato in Tauranga, New Zealand, who studies agrichemicals derived from seaweed. But ultimately, he says, it may just not be cost-effective to produce <em>A. taxiformis</em> for this particular purpose. “I think [this strategy] is likely to be nonviable due to the cost of the production of the seaweed.”</p>





<p><em>A. taxiformis</em> may still be most effective at suppressing fermentation in a cow’s guts rather than in its manure. The good news, Glasson says, is that state-of-the-art feed additive technologies that use specific extracts from the algae rather than the whole biomass greatly mitigate the risk of iodine or bromoform toxicity.</p>



<p>And the study’s conclusion that algae in the cows’ feed doesn’t affect methane production in their feces might also be good news, in a way, Place says. One proposed avenue for mitigating emissions from cow feces is to harness the methane to make biogas. “If you feed [algae] to cattle for methane mitigation [and] if you don’t see any results [in the manure], that could be good for biogas production,” she adds — a possible two-fer for the industry.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geometry-architectural-problem-bee-wasp">How geometry solves architectural problems for bees and wasps</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees and yellow jackets don’t look much like mathematicians — for one thing, they’re smaller. But collectively, the insects can solve a common architectural conundrum using a geometric solution that they evolved independently of each other.</p>



<p>As their colonies grow, these bees and wasps eventually need to increase the size of the hexagonal cells that make up their nests. But nest material is expensive, and it’s hard to efficiently combine hexagons of different sizes into a single continuous array. Both the honeybees and wasps have solved this problem <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by mixing in some pairs of five-sided and seven-sided cells</a>, which bridge the gap between different sizes of the six-sided hexagons, researchers report July 27 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. This fix is close to the optimal solution to this problem, the team says.</p>





<p>“We’ve known for a long time that the hexagonal comb bees and wasps use is the most efficient, stable shape,” says Lewis Bartlett, a honeybee biologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved with the study. “But mixing different-sized hexagons is tricky.”</p>



<p>Social insect colonies, like those of honeybees and some wasps, are run by female workers who raise the offspring of their mother, the queen. They do this in hexagonal cells that honeybees build out of wax and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">wasps construct from paper</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/21</em>). At a certain point in its life cycle, the colony needs to switch from raising workers to raising reproductives, like males and new queens. These reproductives are often bigger than the workers, which means the hexagonal cells need to get bigger too.</p>

<p>“Think of someone tiling your bathroom floor,” says Michael Smith, a biologist at Auburn University in Alabama. “If you have two different sizes of hexagons, and you&#8217;re going to group the small ones on one side and the big ones on the other side, you&#8217;re inherently going to have some kind of an issue when you try to fit them together.”</p>



<p>To figure out how bees and wasps solve this tiling puzzle, Smith and colleagues analyzed 115 images of colonies of five species of honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>A. cerana</em>, <em>A. dorsata</em>, <em>A. florea </em>and <em>A. andreniformis</em>), four species of <em>Vespula </em>wasp (<em>V. vulgaris</em>, <em>V. maculifrons</em>, <em>V. flavopilosa</em> and <em>V. shidai</em>), commonly known in North America as yellow jackets, and one species of paper wasp (<em>Metapolybia mesoamerica</em>). </p>



<p>Using an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103605118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated image analysis tool</a> developed by team member Kirstin Petersen, a roboticist at Cornell University, the scientists extracted data from 22,745 cells such as lengths of cell walls and how many neighbors each cell has. (Smith also verified the data for each one of the cells by hand. “I was the unfortunate sap,” he says, “but I was also happy to do that.”)</p>



<p>The automated tool allowed the team to get data from irregular cells that aren’t perfect hexagons, which many scientists had ignored due to the difficulty of measuring them manually. These seemingly misshapen cells turned out to be anything but.</p>



<p>When transitioning from small worker cells to big reproductive cells, all the bees and wasps built pairs of adjoining five-sided and seven-sided cells to bridge the gap. A five-seven pairing has the same number of open sides as a pair of hexagons — both types of conjoined pairs have 10 sides available to connect to other cells — so it doesn’t disrupt the pattern. And the larger size of the seven-sided cell allows the bees and wasps to seamlessly start making larger hexagons on the other side of it. “They&#8217;re always building the five-sided cell first, and then the seven-sided cell,” Smith says.</p>



<p>Colleague Nils Napp, a computer scientist at Cornell University, designed a mathematical model of this strategy and found that what the bees and wasps are doing is close to the optimal geometric solution.</p>



<p>The most efficient way to build an array of shapes such that each cell is big enough to raise a baby bee or wasp can be represented by a Delaunay triangulation. Imagine a sheet of paper marked with dozens of dots. Then, fill the sheet with triangles by connecting only neighboring dots. Finally, around each triangle, draw a circle that touches each corner. In the layout of a Delaunay triangulation, no dot is inside any of those circles. Drawing additional lines that connect centers of neighboring circles produces a tiling of polygons, much like the latticework of hexagons found in the bee and wasp nests.</p>

<p>Napp’s model shows that adding bigger hexagons to the nest slowly inches the whole array away from perfection, such that gaps may form or the workers may need to build an unusable cell to keep the nest together. The optimal thing to do is to add a five-seven pair just as the Delaunay condition is about to be violated. Across the bee and wasp species, about 85 percent of all nonhexagonal cells are in five-seven pairs, just like the model predicts.</p>



<p>The bees and wasps used in this study are separated by 179 million years of evolution and build their nests out of different materials. “But both evolved to use this five-seven rule for transitioning between hexagon sizes,” Bartlett says. “Evolution has a tendency to solve challenges optimally.”</p>

<p><em>Science</em> has rescinded an expression of concern it issued one month ago after the authors provided data that “addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal had published the expression of concern for the 2021 article “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>” after two separate readers contacted the editorial team about an issue in the paper, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/29/science-paper-marked-with-expression-of-concern-after-readers-pointed-out-data-issue/">we reported</a> at the time. The expression of concern noted that &#8220;that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression.&#8221;</p>



<p>The article has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is publishing the newly submitted data as a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj7468">correction</a>, as well as an <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj7040">editor’s note</a> explaining the removal of the expression of concern. The new notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127605"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These changes have addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper. Therefore, <em>Science</em> has removed the Editorial Expression of Concern and posted this notification in its place to indicate the editors’ confidence in the Research Article’s data and conclusions. We thank the community for bringing these issues to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corrected version of the paper now includes GmNIN expression data in figure 5, and updates to the supplementary materials.</p>



<p>Neither of the two corresponding authors of the article, Shiyong Sun and Xuelu Wang of the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement at Henan University in Kaifeng, China, have responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>Last week, <em>Science Advances </em>published an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8941">expression of concern</a> after the authors of the article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3758">Unemployment and underemployment are causes of suicide</a>” notified the journal “of a quantitative error in their reporting of summary statistics” that they said did not affect their results or overall conclusions. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors regret this error and apologize to the community. <em>Science Advances</em> is examining the details of this issue and will proceed with a response as soon as sufficient information has been obtained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response from <em>Science</em> and its sister journal in these cases stands in stark contrast to the flagship publication’s failure to publish corrections to two of Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s articles that the neuroscientist and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/19/marc-tessier-lavigne-stanford-president-resignation/">former president of Stanford University</a> had submitted in 2015. “We regret this error,” Holden Thorp, editor in chief of <em>Science</em>, said in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stanford-investigates-potential-misconduct-president-s-research">statement</a> to the journal’s editorially independent news division.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A journal spokesperson told us: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> has been consistently more aggressive about correcting the record, where needed, in recent years. We take related matters very seriously and communicate such updates to reporters via the embargoed <em>Science</em> Press Package, to readers in our print and online issues, and via social media, to spread the word as widely as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the final blog in a series of posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/moving-beyond-the-apc-to-make-scholarly-publishing-more-equitable/">part three</a>, I discussed how institutional business models can also affect equitable change at scale.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>So where do we go from here? What&rsquo;s required of publishers to accelerate the transition to Open Science and change the landscape for the good of all of us?</p>



<p>Back in the early days of the pandemic&ndash; which now feels like a lifetime ago &ndash; I remember being deeply moved by Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s piece <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca">The Pandemic is a Portal</a> about the impact of the pandemic in India. Towards the end, she notes that &ldquo;&hellip;in the midst of this terrible despair, [this moment] offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that this same imperative applies to scientific publishing. I don&rsquo;t think that evolutionary change will get us to where we need to be fast enough. At the STM Conference in Frankfurt last October, even a panel of CEOs from the biggest publishers agreed that scholarly publishing hadn&rsquo;t changed that much.</p>



<p>While I&rsquo;m enormously proud of what PLOS has achieved in its first 23 years, our role is fundamentally that of a catalyst and so we&rsquo;re nowhere near done.</p>



<p>To inform our next leap forward, we&rsquo;ve been in deep conversation over recent months with four key groups: researchers, senior university administrators, librarians, and funders. While we&rsquo;ve heard support for much work done by publishers, we&rsquo;vealso heard convergence on what&rsquo;s failing and frustration at the lack of disruption.</p>



<p>One of our roles has always been to demonstrate what&rsquo;s possible and so that&rsquo;s again where our focus is now shifting. We have a vision for a radical reframing of research sharing, built on the principles of Open Science, based on rigor, openness, and equity.</p>



<p>That vision is something we&rsquo;re now making concrete as we create a new way of sharing research. This will shift us away from the final article being the sole center of attention to one of a series of research objects, shared and appropriately assessed at different points in the research lifecycle. One that demonstrates that the article doesn&rsquo;t have to be immutable but that conclusions may shift over time. And one in which peer review evolves into less of a binary accept/reject decision to a more nuanced assessment.</p>



<p>There are a growing number of other innovators alongside us. But not enough. Our industry must embrace more radical change and let go of its own distorting incentives, those of profits and prestige.</p>



<p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>



<p>And so as with all good experiments, the one we&rsquo;ve lived these past few years will only be useful if we learn something and change as a result. We&rsquo;ve all seen what&rsquo;s possible. And we know what&rsquo;s at stake. Now is the time to capitalize on this progress, to deepen interconnection, to align infrastructure and policies. We know that Open Science is the most effective way to tackle our common global challenges.</p>



<p>And so, I&rsquo;d like to leave you with a question: as a publisher, funder, scientist, or policymaker, what steps can you each take to move us forward?</p>



<p>Publishers have both an opportunity and a responsibility to act now, but we all share that responsibility. Everyone in this ecosystem is a crucial partner in the ambitions that I&rsquo;ve outlined in this series of blogs posts. If each of us is willing to take one disruptive step, we can ensure the pandemic&rsquo;s legacy is a reminder not just of what science can do, but also of how science should be done.</p>

<p>The journal <em>BMC Public Health</em> plans to retract an article that found smoking rates fell faster than expected in the US as use of e-cigarettes increased, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The authors contend that they addressed the issues cited in the retraction notice during the peer review process and say they addressed them even more extensively when the journal said they intended to retract.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>,” was published last October. The authors are all employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some journals, including several in the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5193">BMJ family</a> and the <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306916">American Journal of Public Health</a>, will not publish research funded by the tobacco industry, which has led to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/30/bmj-journal-retracts-e-cigarette-paper-after-authors-disclose-tobacco-industry-funding-late-in-the-process/">at least one retraction</a>. But the planned BMC Public Health retraction notice does not refer to that conflict of interest.</p>



<span id="more-127608"></span>



<p>An unpublished letter to the editor prompted the investigation that led to the journal’s retraction decision, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorena Verduci, an editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, shared the letter with the authors on May 24. She also included an assessment of the letter by an unnamed editorial board member who agreed with the critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other critiques, the letter called out Juul’s support for the article, and that the analysis assumed the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the US was zero in 2010 and rose in a linear fashion until a CDC survey began gathering data on usage in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ filling in linear data points between 2010 and 2014 for their main analysis was “questionable,” the letter stated, and findings from an additional analysis that left out those filled-in values “are hidden in the manuscript.” Reading the paper’s supplementary materials, the letter said, revealed that “most estimated associations were no longer statistically significant” in that analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Floe Foxon, the original article’s corresponding author, sent the authors’ response on June 12.&nbsp;In their response, the authors highlight sensitivity tests they performed using 2009 and 2011 as alternative cutoff years, which they said “support the findings of the main analysis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z/peer-review">peer review record</a>, which is available online, indicates that the authors added those sensitivity tests in a <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12889-022-14341-z/12889_2022_14341_AuthorComment_V3.pdf">revision</a> responding to reviewer feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also wrote that the analysis leaving out the filled-in data:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>showed that the results of our main analyses were robust for the younger adult and male cohorts in these sensitivity tests. These are the cohorts with the highest e-cigarette use prevalence, and thus the most relevant to the research question. Contrary to the Letter, which claims that our results were not mentioned in text, the findings from this analysis are reported in the Results section of our manuscript under the subheading ‘Sensitivity test results.’ Thus, the allegation in the Letter that we “directed attention elsewhere” is simply untrue.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci, who has not responded to multiple requests for comment over the past week, informed Foxon on July 18 that the journal had decided to retract the article in light of the editorial board member’s assessment of the authors’ response. She included the assessment, which did not explicitly recommend retraction. However, the editorial board member wrote: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am not convinced that the authors’ response addresses the main issues and serious flaws raised by the authors of the Letter.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci proposed the following text for the retraction notice, and asked the authors if they agreed with it, giving them a deadline of July 25 to respond: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers have raised concerns around the methodology. In particular, the paper&#8217;s conclusions are based on assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data. Without this assumption, the results become non-significant.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon replied on July 21 that the authors “object strenuously to the intention to retract our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reply included additional analyses using 2006, 2007, and 2008 as cutoff years when e-cigarette use was zero in the US, and offered to add them to the paper. The authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fundamental finding remains: smoking is declining at a faster-than-expected rate, in a manner that correlates with the rise in e-cigarette prevalence. In fact, the correlation coefficients change little with these variations in cut-off years, which suggests that the findings are robust.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon told us the email informing the authors of the retraction was “baffling.” He maintained that the authors had “thoroughly addressed” the criticisms, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was not previously indicated that a retraction was on the table; the previous correspondence we received from the journal did not contain any accusation of fabrication, falsification, or anything else in the COPE guidelines that would warrant a retraction. We were asked to respond to concerns raised by an anonymous reader and an anonymous Editorial Board Member, but at that time there was no mention of an investigation into a retraction; we were never notified that such an investigation was taking place.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what Foxon thought should happen instead of a retraction. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am a firm believer in open science, and that path would entail publishing both sides of the disagreement: the anonymous Letter to the Editor and the anonymous Editorial Board Member’s opinions, as well as our responses. That would allow interested readers to decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data. Retracting the paper does not afford readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Readers may welcome seeing an analysis which the anonymous Letter-writer and Editorial Board Member believe is more correct. NHIS is a publicly-available dataset, and they have the same access to these data as we did.</p>
