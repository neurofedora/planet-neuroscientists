<p>The editors of <em>Scientific Reports</em> have retracted an article on burnout because the statistical analysis of its main finding was “unsound.” But the authors dispute the editors’ take on the statistics and claim a mistake in the paper triggered an unfair review.</p>



<p>For the paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79925-8">published in November</a>, the authors measured concentrations of cortisol in hair samples from nearly 500 healthcare workers in Buenos Aires to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic stress and burnout. The analysis hinged on a statistical method called mediation analysis.</p>



<p>“Mediation analysis is a method to understand how one thing causes another by looking at what happens in between,” said lead author Federico Fortuna, of the Institute of Physiopathology and Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Buenos Aires. “In our study, we examined whether depersonalisation mediates the relationship between hair cortisol — a biological stress marker — and emotional exhaustion, a key psychological symptom of burnout.”</p>



<span id="more-132302"></span>



<p>On the day the paper was published, Ian Walker, an environmental psychologist at Swansea University in Wales, saw the article and noticed something amiss. He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianwalker.bsky.social/post/3lbh3txtl4k2l">posted on Bluesky</a>, “How did editor and reviewers not spot that the (wrongly labelled) mediation statistic sits outside its own confidence interval?” His post included a screenshot from the paper showing the issue.</p>



<p>That was in fact a typographical error, Fortuna conceded. “Neither the reviewers nor we noticed the typo during the peer review process — and yet we all missed it,” he said. What was labeled as the indirect effect should have been the direct effect, and the confidence interval was missing a zero.</p>



<p>The editors at <em>Scientific Reports</em> saw Walker’s Bluesky post and sought clarification from the authors, according to correspondence seen by Retraction Watch. But then a few weeks later, the journal followed up, stating, “We sought advice from our Editorial Board on your article and I’m afraid some further concerns have now been identified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What followed was a lengthy back-and-forth, and, ultimately, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01566-2">the paper’s retraction</a> on May 19. The notice reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Post-publication peer-review has confirmed that the basis of the mediation analysis itself is unsound. Hair cortisol concentration, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalisation are all indicators of stress and as such investigating causal effects between these is not justified. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice continued with some specific details, and concluded: “The Editors no longer have confidence in the claims of this Article.”</p>



<p>But Fortuna said while the way his group presented the stat in question had an error in it, the editors misinterpreted the analysis. “It is widely recognised in the field of mediation analysis that a statistically significant relationship between the independent variable and the mediator is not a strict requirement,” he said. “The non-significant correlation reported [in the study] between hair cortisol and depersonalisation does not invalidate the overall mediation model, particularly given that the indirect effect remained statistically robust.”</p>



<p>Elizabeth Mann, deputy editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, declined to comment on the article’s review process.</p>



<p>“It seems the retraction was driven by confusion over statistical methods rather than any actual flaw in the analysis — and it’s concerning that this confusion is coming from the editorial side, not the peer reviewers who originally approved the work,” Fortuna told us.</p>



<p>In a follow-up email, Walker, whose Bluesky post set off the review, said his post was a comment “on an error in statistical reporting that I thought spoke to issues with the peer review process in general.”</p>



<p>Fortuna emphasized that “the only actual error in the paper was a simple typographical oversight — a missing zero in the confidence interval for the direct effect,” he said. “We promptly acknowledged this and submitted the corrected values. Instead of addressing this as a standard corrigendum, the journal opted for a full retraction, citing methodological unsoundness that, in our view, was not present.”</p>



<p>“We stand by the validity of our methods and results,” Fortuna said. “The decision to retract — based on a misunderstanding and a minor formatting error — feels disproportionate and discouraging.”</p>

<p>The retraction of a paper looking at posts in a Reddit subforum about mental illness has once again raised questions about informed consent in research using public data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To study the experience of receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a U.K.-based team of researchers collected posts from the Reddit subforum r/schizophrenia, which is dedicated to discussing the disorder. They analyzed and anonymized the data, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-06175-2">published their findings</a> in June 2024 in <em>Current Psychology</em>, a Springer Nature journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper prompted backlash on X in the subsequent months, and in the Reddit community used for the study. People on the subreddit were concerned about the lack of consent, potential lack of anonymity, and the hypocrisy of discussing ethics in the paper while not seeking consent, a moderator of that subreddit who goes by the handle Empty_Insight told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-132297"></span>



<p>“The subreddit has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/rules/research/">clear rule</a> that all research requires approval of the moderators, which was affirmed to be sufficient by the community after the fact,” Empty_Insight, who coordinates all research conducted on the subreddit, told us. “However, no such attempt at contact was made.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is no small feat for someone with schizophrenia who grapples with paranoia to speak in a semi-anonymous setting, so the intrusion is particularly violating in light of that,” the moderator added. They also said this intrusion feeds historical mistrust of researchers due to “the not-so-distant past of unsavory, unethical practices where consent was foregone and the only reason that could be given was ‘The ends justify the means’.&#8221;</p>



<p>Researchers have long debated the ethics around informed consent when using public data. In 2016 the Center for Open Science <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/05/16/publicly-available-data-on-thousands-of-okcupid-users-pulled-over-copyright-claim/">took down a dataset of users of the dating site OkCupid</a> from its Open Science Framework because it contained potentially identifying information on people who did not consent to its use. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/experiment-using-ai-generated-posts-on-reddit-draws-fire-for-ethics-concerns/">Earlier this year</a>, we reported on researchers who posted AI-generated messages on a Reddit subforum without the forum’s, or user’s, knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following “extensive complaints, feedback, and discussions within the team, other researchers, and people with lived experiences,” the researchers chose to retract the paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-06175-2">the December retraction notice</a> stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are sorry that our work caused distress to the community in question and consequently retracted the paper,” said lead author Minna Lyons, a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University in England.</p>



<p>Although the researchers stated in the paper that they “secured ethical approval,” relatively few study authors who use data from Reddit seek approval from a research ethics committee. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051211019004">A 2021 study</a> found only 13.9% of studies examined mentioned a related term like “institutional review board.” </p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17470161231210542">Many</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3633070">papers</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231192021">have</a> discussed the ethics of using social media, and Reddit in particular, in research. Groups such as the Association of Internet Researchers have published <a href="https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf">ethical guidelines</a> that detail the difficulties in obtaining informed consent and urge researchers to mitigate harm by considering the questions they use in their research, how they process sensitive data, and how they deal with risk during data storage, aggregation, and publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This an important emerging area where the researchers using pervasive data and internet technologies are giving more thought to how ethical standards should be applied, and we commend the authors for taking the proactive step to retract their paper given the concerns around consent,” Ellie Gendle, head of journals policy at Springer Nature, told Retraction Watch in an email. Due to “challenges in forming a universal policy” and a lack of ”consistently held standards” on the use of these types of data and technologies, the journal evaluates each paper on a case-by-case basis, she told us.</p>



<p>After learning about the <em>Current Psychology </em>paper, the subreddit moderators conducted a poll of its users on how to address future research requests. They chose to stick to the existing research approval policy, and added a user flair – a tag that appears next to a user’s handle – to opt out of data collection for research purposes. Empty_Insight noted that people didn’t use this flair, so they have since removed it.</p>



<p>The decision to retract the paper “sets the right precedent, and sends the signal that what degree of privacy can be preserved for those with psychotic disorders will be respected,” Empty_Insight said. “We cannot forgo consent for the sake of convenience.”</p>

                <p>If you&rsquo;ve followed PLOS before, you know we&rsquo;re committed to improving the ways in which research outputs and contributions are evaluated. Citations have long-been the primary method to evaluate research output but this measure alone fails to capture other ways in which research makes an impact, or the practices that make it impactful.</p>



<p>Open science practices and open science monitoring have an important role to play in our ongoing efforts to recognize a broader range of research contributions. They not only present a more complete picture of the diverse activities and expertise behind a research study or project, they also make those contributions visible and accessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet for many years we lacked rigorous, accessible tools for monitoring the growth and impact of open science practices at scale. This was the driving force behind our decision to develop Open Science Indicators (OSIs). While we designed OSIs with our own goals for open science enablement in mind,we knew that others faced similar challenges. By sharing our learnings publicly and being open to community input, we assumed we could help other related efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After many new developments, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/05/driving-open-science-adoption-with-a-global-framewo/">collaborations</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/collaboratively-seeking-better-solutions-for-monitoring-open-science/">feedback </a>from diverse stakeholders, OSIs are becoming a valuable resource for the wider scholarly community. We&rsquo;ve just released our latest update in partnership with DataSeer which now includes over 166,000 article records from PLOS and a range of comparator journals. The latest release offers full integration of indicators for protocols and study registration as well as a new method for preprint detection. For those who haven&rsquo;t yet explored the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686">data</a>, or are considering open science monitoring solutions of your own, we want to share what we&rsquo;ve learned and the possibilities for the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why do OSIs matter?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The benefits of open science practices are wide-ranging and well-evidenced: they improve research integrity and reproducibility, make visible a broader and more diverse range of research contributions, and have the potential to increase both the academic and social impact of research. These benefits are enjoyed by a wide variety of stakeholders, including researchers, universities, funders, publishers, policymakers, journalists, teachers, medical professionals, and the general public.</p>



<p>When we created OSIs, we wanted to be able to measure trends in open science and the effects of our activities to advance key practices &mdash; which tools and services were researchers using? How did open science practice vary from journal communities to regional differences? Were our policies effective? In order to realize our vision of a better future where science is open to all, for all, we first needed to understand where we are at currently and be able to measure the effectiveness of different initiatives that aim to move the needle.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What knowledge have we gained from OSIs so far?</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A FAIR foundation for monitoring open science practices&nbsp;</strong><br>Our work began with a set of <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889?file=38446724">principles </a>which would underpin our approach and pave the way for others. We knew we wanted OSIs to be transparent, inter-operable and valuable in order to facilitate further discussions and collaboration around open science monitoring in the scholarly community. Many of the detailed requirements for some indicators were created in consultation with the research community. Based on feedback from others, we&rsquo;ve also made updates to our underlying methods along the way to improve the accuracy of the results.<br><br>Our work on OSIs has enabled us to contribute to and integrate with other global monitoring efforts including the Open Science Monitoring Initiative (OSMI) who have just published their <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15807481">Principles of Open Science Monitoring</a>. We look forward to conducting a self-assessment to evaluate the extent to which OSIs align with these principles. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Better context for open science behaviors</strong><br><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial">There is a wealth of information for each individual article represented in the dataset opening up more pathways to analyze trends. Not only do OSIs offer a consistent framework for measuring the number of papers sharing code, for example, but we can even more granularly look at code sharing trends as a percentage of articles which </span><em style="font-size: revert;color: initial">generated </em><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial">code. This enables users to more accurately focus on the behaviors they want to evaluate.</span><br><br>The dataset extends beyond PLOS including a set of comparator articles from other publishers. It also contains information about the mechanisms of sharing and chronology. This extra detail enables <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41060-024-00617-7#Bib1">metaresearchers </a>and others to use the data to get a more nuanced understanding of specific author behaviors.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ability to understand trends for a specific audience cohort</strong><br><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial">OSIs enable data users to track engagement with different practices over time and across academic disciplines and geographic regions. These insights enable stakeholders to identify a baseline of open science behaviors for a given research community, understand what&rsquo;s working well, and identify opportunities for improvement.&nbsp;</span><br><br>From institutional leaders to funding program officers to academic librarians, open science monitoring is a task that falls on many shoulders. OSIs can save time and resources by indicating where further analysis and new solutions are needed, or act as a comparison to insights gathered from other monitoring solutions and needs assessments.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved solution design for open science tools and services</strong><br>OSIs have been key to measuring the success of publishing solutions we&rsquo;ve implemented at our own journals. From deciding to implement a preprint server solution of our environmental journals to adapting our approach to increase data repository usage, OSIs have helped validate areas for improvement and iterate to find the solution that works for our audiences.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Effective policy design and compliance monitoring</strong><br>Insights from OSIs can be used to design policies that are well-suited to specific research communities based on their current level of engagement with open science practices. The data also give policymakers and officers tools and methods for monitoring compliance and measuring success.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Toward a more collaborative, integrated approach to open science monitoring</strong></h2>



<p>What questions about open science behaviors spark your interest? How can the data drive your decisions?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We invite everyone &ndash; researchers, librarians, funders, policymakers, institutional leaders and other publishers&ndash; to explore our data and consider what open science monitoring could mean for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, we envision a world in which open science monitoring becomes more ubiquitous, helping to improve how the value of research and the contributions of researchers are assessed. We hope that deeper understanding of open science practices will contribute to a broader view of what it means to conduct rigorous, trustworthy, impactful research.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2025/07/embrace-the-uncertainty/">Embrace the uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ever since Werner Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty principle, physics has been grappling with the unsettling realization that the universe does not function like clockwork—a metaphor Newton introduced and which held sway for centuries. In a world where predictability and uncertainty intertwine, interpretations range from die-hard determinists, who reject quantum events despite the mounting evidence, to more esoteric merchants of doubt who exploit the ambiguity.</p>



<p>If Werner Heisenberg brought uncertainty to physics, his son, Martin Heisenberg, sought to introduce uncertainty into neuroscience. Returning from a postdoctoral stint at CalTech with Max Delbrück, the trained geneticist embarked on a neuroscience career in the late 1960s at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen. At the time, neuroscience remained deeply deterministic. Two decades earlier, Donald Hebb’s <em>The Organization of Behavior</em> had framed behavior in terms of stimulus and response—along with what transpires in the “interval between them”, as the subtitle explained. When Martin Heisenberg arrived in Tübingen, Skinnerian behaviorism was a dominant force in the U.S., while the Max Planck Institute where he worked operated under a different, yet equally deterministic assumption: that by precisely controlling the input-output relationships of experimental animals, one could decipher the control logic governing behavior. To this day, the institute retains its name, “biological cybernetics.”</p>



<p>In a series of experiments, some initiated in Tübingen and continuing through his later years as a professor in Würzburg, Martin Heisenberg challenged these deterministic foundations. In one such experiment with the fruit fly <em>Drosophila</em>, he systematically removed all known sensory inputs that had previously been used to map control loops predicting behavioral responses. If flies were merely biological thermostats, reacting with predictable, corrective responses to external perturbations, then a complete absence of input should result in no response at all. But even in this sensory-deprived state, the flies behaved with striking variability—shifting from one action to another without apparent external trigger. Contrary to the expectations of control theory, no stimulus was necessary for the animals to act. They behaved spontaneously. Or, as the Harvard Law of Animal Behavior wryly states: “Under carefully controlled experimental circumstances, an animal will behave as it damn well pleases.” Because this spontaneity was independent of sensory input, it was also fundamentally unpredictable—mirroring the quantum uncertainties Werner Heisenberg had uncovered decades earlier. Animal behavior, it turned out, was not strictly deterministic, but probabilistic. Over time, accumulating evidence has only reinforced this insight.</p>



<p>Many of Martin Heisenberg’s experiments relied on equipment that had been in use at the Tübingen institute for many years already. At the heart of these setups were torque meters to which flies were tethered for stationary flight. These measurement devices were sensitive enough to detect the minuscule forces a fruit fly generates when attempting to rotate around its vertical body axis (yaw), typically in the range between piconewton-meters to nanonewton-meters (~10⁻¹⁰ Nm). This precision allowed researchers to measure the fly’s intended rotational force without the animal actually moving. Since both the body and head were fixed, the fly always faced the same direction, isolating the yaw component from other aspects of flight control. Crucially, this setup also eliminated feedback from the fly’s two primary motion-sensing organs—its eyes and its halteres, small gyroscopic structures behind each wing. This rigorous isolation of behavioral variables proved essential to Martin Heisenberg’s approach, which he termed “microbehavior.”</p>



<p>One such microbehavior that had been extensively studied in Tübingen before Martin Heisenberg arrived was optomotor behavior. Like most animals, flies attempt to stabilize their visual field when confronted with moving stimuli. For example, a tethered fly on the torque meter would generate right-turning torque when presented with vertical gratings rotating from left to right (clockwise from above) around the fly. Earlier research had shown that control theory could reasonably predict the dynamics of these optomotor responses, including rise times and amplitudes. The prevailing conclusion was that these control loops were innate steering mechanisms, allowing flies to maintain a straight trajectory. If visual input indicated an unintended drift, the optomotor response would automatically and predictably correct the displacement.</p>



<p>Martin Heisenberg, however, had reason to question this rigid depiction. If optomotor responses were so hardwired and deterministic, how did flies manage to make voluntary turns? Turning in free flight should generate visual feedback that would, according to control theory, force the fly back onto its previous course. In reality, flies execute sharp turns—body saccades—by rapidly twisting their bodies in midair. Instead of banking like an airplane, they pivot abruptly with a burst of torque. In tethered flight, this manifests as a sudden spike in torque output. Heisenberg discovered that during these voluntary torque spikes, flies temporarily suppress their motion vision, effectively preventing optomotor responses from interfering with their intent to turn. The fly’s internal decision to change course overrides its deterministic cruise control. This revelation exposed a fundamental flaw in the assumption of a strict input-output relationship governing behavior: flies were not merely reacting to stimuli—they were acting on their own accord. There seemed to be something fundamentally wrong with the assumption that there was some tight connection between sensory input and motor output.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png" alt="Torque meter and torque traces" class="wp-image-2977"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 1: Torque meter setup and yaw torque traces</figcaption></figure>



<p>Today, we know that analogous processes occur in human eye saccades, enabling us to shift our gaze seamlessly. In flies, recent research has identified octopaminergic centrifugal neurons as the agents responsible for suppressing motion vision during voluntary movements. The recently completed connectome of <em>Drosophila</em> reveals nearly a thousand such centrifugal neurons projecting from the brain to the optic lobes. Some serve to briefly shut down motion vision, while others fine-tune the sensitivity of motion-detecting neurons based on the fly’s behavioral state. When at rest, the fly’s motion sensitivity is low, increasing when it starts to walk and peaking in flight. The precise function of most of the centrifugal neurons remains unknown for now, but what is already clear is that a fly perceives the world differently depending on whether it is sitting still or in motion. This is just one example of what modern neuroscience now describes as “active sensing,” where an animal’s behavior actively shapes its sensory input rather than passively receiving information from the environment.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, as a geneticist, Martin Heisenberg played a key role in the emergence of neurogenetics, which uses genetic tools to probe the workings of the nervous system. His lab conducted large-scale mutagenesis screens to identify genes essential for motion vision or for brain structure. Among the mutants he studied was <em>rol/sol</em> (<em>reduced optic lobes, small optic lobes</em>), a double mutant with drastically diminished optic lobes. These flies were not blind—they could still orient toward a light source (phototaxis)—but they entirely lacked optomotor responses. According to prevailing wisdom at the time, this should have made straight flight impossible. To test this assumption, Heisenberg placed <em>rol/sol</em> flies in a <em>Drosophila</em> flight simulator, where a single vertical stripe moved around the fly in response to the fly’s yaw torque, mimicking visual feedback from turning. Wild-type flies in this setup fixated on the stripe, keeping it centered in their frontal visual field by adjusting their yaw torque. Biological cybernetics suggested that without optomotor responses, <em>rol/sol</em> flies should fail catastrophically. Instead, while their fixation ability was noticeably impaired, they still managed to fly straight toward the stripe. This unexpected result demonstrated that optomotor responses, though helpful, were not essential for stable flight. They acted as an enhancement rather than a prerequisite, supplementing an independent flight control system. But if optomotor reflexes weren’t necessary, what underlying mechanism allowed these mutant flies to stay on course?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="403" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1-1024x403.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2978" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1-1024x403.png 1024w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1-300x118.png 300w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1-768x303.png 768w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1-50x20.png 50w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1.png 1358w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 2: The brain structure of rol/sol mutant flies</figcaption></figure>



<p>If anything, a second experiment with these <em>rol/sol</em> flies dealt an even greater blow to the deterministic view of flight control. In a standard flight simulation, steering to the right induces leftward motion, and vice versa. However, in this experiment, Martin Heisenberg reversed the coupling—so that the more the fly attempted to turn right, the more the stripe moved to the right, and the same for leftward turns. Remarkably, the behavior of <em>rol/sol</em> double mutants remained unchanged between these conditions. This not only reinforced the conclusion that <em>rol/sol</em> flies were incapable of perceiving motion, but it also revealed the only possible way they could keep the stripe fixated: by correlating their own actions with the stripe’s position and adjusting their behavior accordingly. Deprived of motion vision, the flies had no choice but to explore and discover through trial and error what actions would keep them on course. Just like the sensory-deprived flies from Heisenberg’s earlier experiments, the genetic loss of motion perception exposed an underlying spontaneity in behavior—an exploratory drive independent of deterministic input-output loops. Freed from inborn reflexes that would have caused incorrect turns, <em>rol/sol</em> mutants flew straight just as effectively whether the coupling was normal or inverted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="529" height="469" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2979" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2.png 529w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2-300x266.png 300w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2-50x44.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 3: Schematic depiction of &#8220;inversion googles&#8221; experiments: when the fly attempts to turn towards a stripe, the stripe moves in the opposite direction than it would in free flight.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Martin Heisenberg subjected wild-type flies to the same “inversion goggles” experiment, they struggled far more with the altered coupling, unable to stabilize the movement of the vertical stripe. Their optomotor responses, typically crucial for flight control, instead became a hindrance. However, as time passed, an intriguing behavioral pattern emerged. Initially, the flies flailed, sending the stripe spinning wildly. But gradually, they adapted, first learning to keep the stripe behind them, where their abdomen blocked it from view. With continued exposure, they began to bring the stripe forward in fits and starts, interspersed with rapid rotations. After 40 to 50 minutes, they had learned to fixate on the stripe almost as effectively as the <em>rol/sol</em> flies. Since this task required overriding their innate optomotor reflexes, the flies could not have relied on any hardwired strategy. Instead, they had to suppress their automatic responses and actively discover which movements brought the stripe into position. These findings not only challenged the idea that optomotor reflexes are fixed and essential for flight—they revealed that, under the right conditions, they could be <em>unlearned</em>. Rather than behaving as rigid input-output machines, these experiments suggested that animals operate in the opposite direction: they generate behavior first, then evaluate the sensory consequences to guide their actions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2980" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png 1500w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 4: Wild type flies at the torque meter with realistic coupling between torque and rotation of a single, vertical stripe (left) and with inverted coupling (right).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Beyond reinforcing the idea that fly behavior is <em>active</em> rather than merely <em>reactive</em>, these findings also provided strong evidence for operant learning in insects. Operant (or instrumental) learning occurs when an action is consistently followed by a consequence, allowing an animal to adjust its behavior to maximize future outcomes. In these experiments, both wild-type and <em>rol/sol</em> flies generated spontaneous movements and then modified their actions based on sensory feedback. Over the years, Martin Heisenberg conducted a long series of experiments testing whether flies could learn to associate arbitrary motor outputs with meaningful sensory inputs. These included connections between torque and banana odor, leg posture and stripe rotation, torque and heat, and many others.</p>



<p>While these experiments were deliberately artificial, one in particular—the operant coupling of heat to the fly’s yaw torque—hinted at potential real-world, ethological relevance. In this setup, flies were tethered in the sensory deprivation chamber, but this time, an invisible infrared heat beam was triggered whenever they generated, say, right-turning yaw torque. The flies had no prior knowledge of this rule; they had to experiment with different movements until they discovered how to keep the heat off. Remarkably, within minutes, they learned to avoid the punished torque domain, and after just eight minutes of training, they continued avoiding it even when the heat was permanently switched off. Their spontaneous actions had shifted—fewer punished movements, more rewarded ones. While their behavior remained probabilistic, operant conditioning had subtly reshaped the likelihood of certain actions over others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="360" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2981" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-4.png 480w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-4-300x225.png 300w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-4-50x38.png 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 5: Torque learning setup. No other stimulus is contingent on the fly&#8217;s behavior, only the heat. In this example, left turning attempts are punished while right turning attempts are rewarded.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This experimental setup was, of course, an artificial construct—no natural scenario would require a fly to avoid heat by constantly turning in one direction. However, one could imagine situations in which flies must consistently generate torque in a particular way. A prime example is a fly with asymmetrical wings due to injury. If such a fly attempted to fly straight by beating both wings equally, it would rotate uncontrollably toward the damaged side. To compensate, the damaged wing would need to generate more force, or the healthy wing would need to reduce its output—or both adjustments would need to occur simultaneously. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="990" height="844" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2982" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-5.png 990w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-5-300x256.png 300w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-5-768x655.png 768w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-5-50x43.png 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 6: When the wings are asymmetric, straight flight requires the nervous system to generate torque towards one side to compensate for the less effective wing.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Traditionally, optomotor reflexes were thought to handle such corrections, stabilizing flight by counteracting unintended rotations. But what happens when the fly <em>intends</em> to turn and, hence, the optomotor response was switched off? If optomotor reflexes alone couldn’t account for these adjustments, how did the fly’s nervous system compensate for such asymmetry? The heat-based yaw torque learning experiment offered a potential answer: flies can learn to reset their torque balance. If this operant experiment really had such ethological relevance, it could provide an evolutionary rationale for why animals are not rigid, deterministic machines but instead operate with an intrinsic level of unpredictability: it is an adaptive trait shaped by natural selection to manage unpredictable circumstances &#8211; even flying in sensory deprivation chambers where experimenters can turn on life-threatening heat.</p>



<p>Today, genetic data on operant torque learning suggests this process traces back roughly 550 million years, to the last common ancestor of vertebrates and invertebrates. A well-known gene involved in this learning mechanism is the fly ortholog of the human <em>FOXP2</em> gene, which is crucial for speech acquisition. Decades ago, B.F. Skinner likened language learning to the operant conditioning he described in pigeons and rats, only to be famously rebuked by Noam Chomsky, whose critique helped launch the Cognitive Revolution against behaviorism. Yet modern neuroscience has vindicated at least part of Skinner’s intuition—at least for the speech aspects of language. Acquiring language as an infant and learning to shift torque preferences in a fly share the operant organization and the evolutionary ancestry of the underlying mechanism.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="844" src="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2983" srcset="https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-6.png 900w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-6-300x281.png 300w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-6-768x720.png 768w, https://bjoern.brembs.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-6-50x47.png 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 7: FoxP phylogeny</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were no torque meters 550 million years ago, so why would this mechanism have evolved? Emerging evidence about the neurons in which these genes manifest plasticity may provide a plausible answer. Researchers using a combination of gene expression analysis and optomotor experiments, identified a distinct set of motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. These neurons expressed two known operant learning genes, from which it had been known that selectively knocking out either one in just these motor neurons eliminated learning. A key breakthrough came from an optomotor test conducted after operant training. Echoing Martin Heisenberg’s findings from decades earlier, researchers observed that optomotor responses were not fixed but instead modified by learning. Notably, the magnitude of optomotor reflexes decreased specifically in the torque domain associated with heat punishment, while remaining unchanged for unpunished domains. Since the brain sends optomotor commands directly to precisely those flight steering motor neurons, these findings suggest that the steering neurons themselves serve as sites of plasticity—reshaped by experience, fine-tuned by operant learning. It seems plausible that early bilaterian animals around 550 million years ago were all facing similar problems when learning how to move their newly evolved bodies and their appendages in space. The genetic data suggest that in the end an operant learning process won out in the struggle for survival: the animals which tried out the large array of new movements they had just evolved and then were able to store the successful ones in their motor control systems, became the ancestors of all extant vertebrate and invertebrate animals today.</p>



<p>The most parsimonious conclusion from this research spanning more than five decades is that flies continuously inject spontaneous actions into their behavioral stream and then evaluate how the world reacts. In the case of flight steering, flies initiate maneuvers, and in natural settings, motion cues from the eyes and halteres inform them about the effectiveness of these movements. While the fly nervous system has evolved to prioritize feedback from these senses—manifesting in mechanisms like optomotor responses—experiments show they can adapt to almost any arbitrary feedback. Importantly, this feedback shapes future behavior by modifying the motor system itself, while seemingly leaving intact the brain circuits that generate spontaneity in the first place (Martin Heisenberg called this faculty &#8220;initiating activity&#8221;). Inborn behaviors such as optomotor responses may assist the fly on an instantaneous, moment-to-moment basis, while goal-directed adjustments happen via spontaneous actions and the longer term modifications of the motor system after evaluating the outcomes of these actions. This emerging picture raises an intriguing possibility: the ability to initiate spontaneous behavior may be so fundamental that operant learning shapes the fine-tuning of the “envelope”, so to say, of individual behaviors rather than altering the core circuits that drive them.</p>



<p>For Martin Heisenberg’s experiments to yield reliable results, it was crucial to isolate a single behavioral variable (‘microbehavior’) from most or all sensory feedback. This allowed him to assign arbitrary sensory feedback to each microbehavior and demonstrate that the fly’s nervous system, through trial and error, could determine which behavior controlled which stimulus. The ability to finely dissect the intricate relationships between actions and feedback enabled the identification of steering motor neurons as the site of plasticity in yaw torque learning. This approach will remain crucial as the fly connectome, combined with increasingly precise methods to manipulate individual neurons and circuits, allows for ever finer dissection of the <em>Drosophila </em>nervous system. As we gain the ability to manipulate ever smaller sets of neurons with greater precision, our reliance on studying well-defined behaviors that involve approximately the same number of neurons as those being manipulated will become even more important. Behaviors requiring broad neural activity may show little change if only a subset of neurons is altered. Martin Heisenberg, with only hardware, electronics, and early computers at his disposal, pioneered the dissection of microbehavior using physical isolation by experimental design. In the era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it may become possible to perform this crucial dissection in freely moving animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While flight course control in a highly evolved insect species may seem like an esoteric study subject, the evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms suggests that the active, operant organization of fly course control can be generalized to many animal behaviors, including human behavior. This emerging perspective places behavioral uncertainty at the core of nervous system function—not just in operant learning, but as a fundamental principle governing how animals interact with the world. A growing body of evidence across biological disciplines now supports the idea that uncertainty is not a flaw or a limitation but an essential feature of how nervous systems evolved to organize behavior.</p>



<p>While a fly in a sensory deprivation chamber may seem artificial at first, countless natural situations similarly lack clear sensory cues—though perhaps to a lesser degree. Animals frequently make decisions without explicit guidance from their environment. These range from the mundane (e.g., choosing which leg to step forward with) to the complex (e.g., selecting a route around an unknown obstacle). From an ecological and ethological perspective, we now recognize that the ability to choose between options, even in the absence of external cues, is critical for survival. Nervous systems resolve such ambiguities effortlessly, many times a day. A few examples illustrate the broader significance of spontaneous decisions—beyond operant learning—to domains such as survival, self-other distinction, and problem-solving.</p>



<p>Much of the evidence for the evolutionary importance of spontaneous decisions comes from studies of behavioral variability. Acting in an unpredictable manner, even under identical conditions, has been shown to be advantageous in many contexts. In competitive scenarios, for instance, behaving the same way in every instance makes an organism predictable to competitors, prey, or predators—an evolutionary liability. Another key function of spontaneity lies in distinguishing between ex-afferent and re-afferent sensory stimuli. This differentiation is only possible when behavior arises independently of external stimuli. Without it, an organism’s nervous system could not determine whether a motion stimulus is caused by an object moving in the environment (“ex-afferent”) or by the organism’s own movement (“re-afferent”). Operant learning also contributes to problem-solving: most organisms lack complete information about obstacles or resource locations. Exploring different strategies without prior knowledge of which will be beneficial is fundamental to survival and reproduction across species.</p>



<p>While some branches of neuroscience continue to grapple with the fundamental uncertainty Martin Heisenberg introduced to the field—just as parts of physics still struggle with the implications of the uncertainty principle his father formulated—evolutionary biology has largely embraced it. When it became clear that unpredictable behavior could be more evolutionarily stable than deterministic behavior, biologists had little trouble accepting this idea. One reason may be that evolution itself is a fusion of chance and necessity, much like the quantum world Werner Heisenberg described. Unlike physicists, evolutionary biologists have had since Darwin’s time to consider the interplay of determinism and randomness in shaping life. The debate between these extremes settled long ago into an understanding that uncertainty is not an obstacle to evolution but an essential, well-harnessed component of it. Eventually, neuroscience may similarly recognize that nervous systems evolved to leverage the problem-solving and life-preserving power of uncertainty, while mitigating its downsides. Perhaps, in time, physics too will fully embrace uncertainty—not as an inconvenience to be minimized, but as a fundamental force that shaped the universe, allowing for the emergence of galaxies, stars, and life itself. Rather than “turtles all the way down”, our universe may be better described by “uncertainty all the way up”.</p>

<p>The Jocelyn Bell Burnell Inspiration Medal was presented to arXiv in June at the European Astronomical Society Annual Meeting in Cork, Ireland. arXiv was represented at the annual meeting by <a href="https://liciaverde.icc.ub.edu/">Licia Verde</a>, <a href="https://icc.ub.edu/">ICCUB</a>&#8216;s Scientific Director and sitting Chair of arXiv&#8217;s <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/people/science_advisory_council.html">Science Advisory Council,</a> and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/i/r.a.m.j.wijers/r.a.m.j.wijers.html?cb#Biography">Ralph Wijers</a>, Professor of High-Energy Astrophysics at University of Amsterdam and sitting Chair of <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/people/editorial_advisory_council.html">arXiv&#8217;s Editorial Advisory Council.</a></p>
<p>Both Ralph and Licia have dedicated their time and talents to advising and improving arXiv for many years, and accepted the award on arXiv&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, arXiv is an inspiring success story. arXiv took an ideal &#8211; open science &#8211; and helped to make it a reality,&#8221; said Licia. &#8220;I am honored to have had the opportunity to contribute to the arXiv community and the arXiv mission in an advisory role since 2016, and to help with the global democratization of knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the leading open-access preprint repository for physics, astronomy, and related disciplines, arXiv plays a fundamental role in ensuring that scientific knowledge is rapidly disseminated, openly accessible, and freely available to all. This democratization of knowledge allows researchers from different institutions and countries to engage with the latest findings without financial barriers.</p>
<p>By fundamentally changing how astronomical knowledge is shared, arXiv exemplifies the spirit of the Jocelyn Bell Burnell Inspiration Medal, celebrating contributions that extend beyond traditional research to inspire and enable progress in astronomy and empower the global scientific community.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you to the European Astronomical Society for this great honor, from all the staff and volunteers at arXiv!</strong></p>

<p>Seven papers on various aspects of vaping and cigarettes published in <em>Toxicology Reports </em>listed each authors’ affiliation –&nbsp; the tobacco company Philip Morris International – when they originally appeared in the journal between 2019 and 2023. And all but one article disclosed the funding for the research originated from the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That apparently wasn’t enough for the journal.</p>



<p><em>Toxicology Reports </em>has issued a correction to add those affiliations as a conflict of interest. The statements were “missing or incorrect” in the original papers, according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2024.101881">correction notice</a>, published in the June 2025 issue of <em>Toxicology Reports</em>. In addition to reiterating that the authors work for PMI, the correction also adds to the conflict of interest statements that the authors were funded by the company and used its products in the research.</p>



<span id="more-132294"></span>



<p>“While the authors’ affiliation to Philip Morris was indeed listed on the articles, Elsevier policies and ICMJE recommendations require disclosures of competing interests to be added to articles, and full details on the potential conflict of interests of authors, where applicable, must be provided,” a spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told us.</p>



<p>The spokesperson said the issue “was flagged to us recently” but would not say by whom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier contacted the authors at Philip Morris, and both parties agreed to the correction. “At the publisher’s request, we added details to the conflict of interest section to reflect information already included in the author affiliations,” a spokesperson for the company said. </p>



<p>The correction added the following “Declaration of competing interest” to each paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The work reported in this publication involved products developed by Philip Morris Products S.A., which is the sole source of funding and sponsor of this research. All authors are employees of PMI R&amp;D or worked for PMI R&amp;D under contractual agreements.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The papers included reviews and primary research on the toxicology of heated tobacco and e-cigarettes. Others ranged from a study of aerosols from hookah tobacco to a methods paper comparing multiple cigarettes for use as a baseline reference in studies of other tobacco products. Most of the papers have been cited up to 19 times; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018307352?via%3Dihub">one of them</a> has been cited 63 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p><em>Toxicology Reports </em>has had oversight issues in the past. In 2021, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/19/elsevier-subjects-entire-special-issue-of-journal-on-covid-19-to-an-expression-of-concern/">issued an expression of concern</a> on an entire special issue on COVID-19 over “concerns raised regarding the validity and scientific soundness of the content.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100161X">At least</a> two <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750021000445">of the papers</a> in the issue have since been retracted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as a Harvard lab brought in tens of millions of dollars in private equity funding to pursue new treatments for obesity, past research from its lead investigator has come under fresh scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the lab of Gökhan Hotamışlıgil, a professor of genetics and metabolism at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/drawing-on-harvard-chan-school-research-biotech-startup-aims-to-to-tackle-age-related-illness/">secured a $39 million dollar investment</a> from İş Private Equity, an Istanbul-based firm. The partnership centers on FABP4, a protein associated with obesity and other metabolic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over the past decades, two of Hotamışlıgil’s papers have been corrected for image duplications, and since the announcement, renewed scrutiny of Hotamışlıgil’s work appeared on PubPeer, including for issues with statistical analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132282"></span>



<p>“Of course when we become aware of an irregularity or mistake, or someone makes an allegation, we take these issues very seriously and do all we can to address the question,” Hotamışlıgil told us in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most recent comments are from <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Reese Richardson</a>, a computational biologist <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">who looks into</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/patent-mills-sell-scientists-inventorship-bizarre-medical-devices">scientific reproducibility</a>. Richardson said he became curious about Hotamışlıgil’s work after seeing news about the funding deal. He soon found existing concerns flagged on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I figured that it would be worthwhile to check his papers out,” Richardson told us. Initially, two articles piqued his interest, although Hotamışlıgil is not the senior author on either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one PubPeer post, Richardson <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B02230187046D5707C7EF41936F01">raised concerns</a> about a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28346411/">2017 paper in <em>Nature Medicine</em></a> in which he discovered mislabelling of data, claims of statistical significance the raw data didn’t seem to support, and some missing source data. The author contribution statement indicates Hotamışlıgil oversaw some of the experiments.</p>



<p>Richardson also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8F92D52CAB80E6456D2D0364086C5C#0">looked into</a> a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413119303742">2019 article in <em>Cell Metabolism</em></a> that contained “either wrongly reported or apparently manipulated” statistics, he told us. Nearly every result “features inexplicable methodological inconsistencies or reporting errors,” he wrote on PubPeer. “These result in a massive exaggeration of the effects observed.”</p>



<p>According to Richardson’s analysis, some statements made in the paper were true only when samples were arbitrarily excluded, but the methods didn’t describe any procedure for the exclusion of samples. According to the author contribution statement, Hotamışlıgil helped with the discussion and interpretation of results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Heathers, a scientific sleuth and director of the Medical Evidence Project — an initiative of the Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch — said the extent of the problem is mostly unknowable. “How can you adjust for the effects of data that isn&#8217;t presented?” If outliers are left in the dataset, but redacted from the analysis, “the redaction should be explained in 100% of cases,” he said.</p>



<p>Hotamışlıgil said the work for those two papers was led by Yu-Hua Tseng, another researcher at Harvard, and his group’s involvement was limited. “We have provided some help with their experiments, my fellow Alex Bartelt provided some training and physiology and biochemistry experiments,” he told us. “We were not directly involved with the rest of the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Apart from Richardson’s recent comments, anonymous commenters on PubPeer have pointed out irregularities in Hotamışlıgil’s published work over the years. A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18773087">2008 <em>PLOS One</em> paper</a>, for example, was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/annotation/1074cd39-708b-45ef-943a-e9d1c5bbdedd">corrected</a> after a commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A750E93E9DF8076D38B99B0B520573#">found a duplicated image</a>. A <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6700A447752FC285435695E91506A4#">similar issue was flagged</a> in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.11.009">2020 paper in <em>Cell Metabolism</em></a>, which included two identical images in one figure. “We deeply regret this unfortunate error,” one of the authors wrote on PubPeer. That paper was <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00321-1">also corrected</a>. Another flagged paper appears to contain <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C2B3AE84F49A817EB59C491B3EEB#">similar-looking blots</a>. Hotamışlıgil is listed as the senior and corresponding author on each of these papers.</p>



<p>For a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aav0120">2019 article in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em></a> related to FABP4&nbsp; — the protein at the center of the new funding deal — <a href="http://pubpeer.com/publications/24DA13D73B914C4B429A12B9ADBD1D#">an anonymous commenter questioned</a> the statistical significance of the findings. After analysing the raw data, the commenter found no statistical significance for some findings reported in the paper, despite them having been reported as such. Hotamışlıgil was the senior and corresponding author for this paper. Heathers said these statistical concerns comprised “a concerning pattern of oversights” and would “necessitate exactly the kind of audit that universities tend not to do.”</p>



<p>Reflecting on the PubPeer posts appearing under his name, Hotamışlıgil said, “In many cases, there is no basis, for example there are several posts where there is no comment, there is even one post about a review that I have written but nothing can be found at the post, and some state opinions or perceptions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hotamışlıgil also co-authored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01137">a 2002 <em>Nature</em> paper</a> with Michael Karin, a prominent cancer researcher and the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=michael+karin&amp;sessionid=64B62C7B545931FCFC39&amp;commit=Search+Publications">subject of previous scrutiny</a> for image problems, including in our own <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/08/29/authors-including-highly-cited-cancer-researcher-blame-clerical-error-for-image-mixup-in-cancer-paper/">reporting</a>. The paper was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06285-0">corrected in 2023</a> after <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4966AA09CF15E616FF386E8643BE34#0">PubPeer commenters identified</a> duplicated blots. In the correction, the editors wrote: “as the raw data for the blots used in the manuscript are no longer available, unfortunately we cannot ascertain the issue with the figure.” Hotamışlıgil was listed as the senior and corresponding author on this paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has also co-authored papers with Umut Ozcan, <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2015/06/18/former-researchers-sue-hospital-lab-chief/">who in 2015</a> was accused by postdocs of fabricating data and creating a hostile work environment. The case was dismissed from court in 2018. Hotamışlıgil <a href="https://kectil.com/leadership/faculty/gokhan-s-hotamisligil-m-d-ph-d/">was Ozcan’s graduate advisor</a>, and the two articles where Hotamışlıgil is listed as the senior and corresponding author, and Ozcan as the first, appear to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/36D0A9BC3CE8FF1D6D8A53DCF6A497#">contain duplicate lanes</a> in the blot data or have a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8EEA13EA78904DA5D1388923A9E2E6#">mismatched number of lanes</a>. Mike Rossner, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/03/guest-post-nih-funded-replication-studies-reproducibility-crisis-preclinical-research/">an image manipulation consultant</a>, said these PubPeer allegations also had merit, although the mismatched lanes could be a clerical error, which is “unusual, but not unheard of,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Harvard <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/drawing-on-harvard-chan-school-research-biotech-startup-aims-to-to-tackle-age-related-illness/">has described</a> the Turkish firm’s partnership with Hotamışlıgil’s lab as a “potential model” for revenue for the T.H. Chan School. According to a press release about the funding, the school has seen almost $200 million in federal funding dry up in recent months, and the Trump administration terminated nearly every direct federal grant for research and training. The deal was in progress before the administration came into office, and would have taken place despite the recent decline in federal funding, a Harvard spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iş Private Equity is currently the only private equity funder at the T.H. Chan School, although the school is “accelerating” efforts to engage with the private sector, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such arrangements between universities and private equity are “not common,” Robert Field, a professor of law and public health at Drexel University in Philadelphia, told us. In recent years, private equity has been moving into health care — buying up hospitals, nursing homes and physician practices — but investing into universities is unusual. Private equity is “by nature, profit oriented, and usually short-term profit oriented,” Field said, and are most likely to fund projects that are close to fruition, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research has the same oversight, regardless of the funding source, said the Harvard spokesperson, and they will not accept collaboration that “imposes any restriction on our faculty’s freedom to publish and speak about their research.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Richardson told us he shifted his focus to Tseng, who was the senior author on the two recently flagged papers. Richardson came across a different pair of 20-year-old papers she was the lead author on, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/49CF8B8D475FEC31081FB3A677DB01">both of which</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BCA9D861466EC06B0852887D54EF37">seem to contain</a> similarities between parts of Western blots, or inconsistent features in the blot lanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rossner told us the allegations about image duplications had merit and the data raise enough concerns for a journal editor to want to verify the published results. Some of the PubPeer comments note mismatched lanes in the Western blots; this could be due to clerical error, Rossner said, and one image was too low resolution to tell whether it could be a duplicate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richardson has also since raised concerns about <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7D9D497F92B58F02D10436D77F2F47">several</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/35F1CF6464E70D7DE92656681D5FB0">other</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B02230187046D5707C7EF41936F01">papers</a> by Tseng, citing statistical irregularities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tseng told us she is aware of the comments and has “already discussed them with the leading authors.” Since speaking with <em>Retraction Watch</em>, she has responded on the platform, writing, “Thank you for your comments. We are currently reviewing the original data and conducting additional analysis. We will respond to the comments once the investigation is complete.”&nbsp;</p>
