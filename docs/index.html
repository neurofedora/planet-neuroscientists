                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Battling against Covid-19: A Literature Review&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The
rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for
immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research
in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial
Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in
tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the
applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease
via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying
severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology,
pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a
comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the
difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI
approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing
of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is
comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in
understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the
paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide
some suggestions for future works.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-terms-jargon-meaning-doctor-patient-confusion">Some common medical terms may be more confusing than doctors think</a></h4>

              
                <p>Medical language can sometimes stump patients. And some common sayings are straight-up head-scratchers.</p>



<p>Calling a patient’s neurological exam “grossly intact,” for example, might not sound so great, says Michael Pitt, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. But it actually means that everything is normal and working as expected.</p>



<p>In 2021, Pitt and his colleagues asked 215 adults at the Minnesota State Fair to decipher that language and 12 other medical sayings a patient might hear from a doctor or read in their notes. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799079?resultClick=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People can trip up on familiar words and phrases</a> that have one meaning in everyday English and an entirely different meaning in medicine, the researchers report November 30 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>





<p>Only about 20 percent of people surveyed, for example, understood what it meant when their doctor said, “The findings on the X-ray were quite impressive.” In plain language, that means the doctor is giving you bad news, Pitt says — the opposite of what some patients might expect.</p>



<p>When surveyed, doctors overwhelmingly agree that they should avoid medical jargon when speaking with patients, Pitt says. But many don’t even know they’re doing it. There’s a technical term for this too, Pitt adds: “jargon oblivion.”</p>



<p>He’s hoping his team’s results give doctors an “aha moment” and some awareness about phrases that might be puzzling patients. If a doctor says something that’s unclear, Pitt says, he wants patients to feel empowered to speak up.</p>



<p>He’s coached his family for years on this. When they go to the doctor, there’s one question in particular he wants them to ask. Before they leave an appointment, they’ll summarize what the doctor has said and ask, “Am I getting this right?”</p>



<p>“That type of phrase is amazing to have in your back pocket,” Pitt says.</p>

                "Later today, the House of Commons will vote to approve Bill C-18, the Online News Act, sending it to the Senate just prior to breaking for the holidays. While Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez and media lobbyists will no doubt celebrate the milestone, it should not go unremarked that the legislative process for this bill has been an utter embarrassment with an already bad bill made far worse. The government cut off debate at second reading, actively excluded dozens of potential witnesses, expanded the bill to hundreds of broadcasters that may not even produce news, denigrated online news services as “not real news”, and shrugged off violations of international copyright law. All the while, it acknowledged that mandated payments for links are the foundation of the bill with officials stating that individual Facebook posts accompanied by a link to a news story would be caught by the law. As for the purported financial benefits, the government’s own estimates are less than half those of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who also concluded that more than 75% of the revenues will go to broadcasters such as Bell, Rogers, and the CBC. The end result is a bill that will undermine competition and pose a threat to freedom of expression, while potentially leading Facebook to block news sharing in Canada and Google to cancel dozens of existing agreements with Canadian news outlets...."

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-climate-change-bill-legislation-clean-energy">2022’s biggest climate change bill pushes clean energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world needed bold climate action this year, and we got it.</p>



<p>California and other states announced plans to phase out gas-powered cars after 2035. The United States ratified an international treaty to slash production of the climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons used in cooling and refrigeration. The European Union is finalizing its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent relative to 1990s levels by 2030. The list of legislative victories goes on. </p>



<p>But the biggest win came August 16, when President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>





<p>The historic legislation marks the first major move by the United States, which has emitted more carbon dioxide than any other country, toward neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions. It gets the ball rolling by investing $369 billion into accelerating the adoption of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources and decarbonizing the economy. By the end of the decade, the act will help cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/updated-inflation-reduction-act-modeling-using-the-energy-policy-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 40 percent of the levels in 2005</a>, when U.S. emissions nearly peaked, scientists project, bringing the nation within reach of fulfilling <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its pledge</a> to halve emissions by 2030.</p>



<p>The legislation is no panacea for the climate emergency, but researchers and activists are optimistic that it will be the helping hand that clean energy needs to flourish. “There would be no way to really mitigate the climate crisis without the investments in this bill,” says Raul Garcia, a legislative director at Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at some of the law’s major provisions and a few of its limitations.</p>



<h4>Cheaper clean energy</h4>



<p>The law aims to ease and incentivize the transition away from fossil fuels by creating tax credits that reduce the cost for companies to adopt clean energy. For instance, small businesses can qualify for credits that support up to 30 percent of the cost of transitioning to solar power.</p>



<p>The act also aims to help consumers, with $9 billion for rebates that help people ditch gas and buy appliances powered by electricity, such as electric induction cooktops and heat pump water heaters. Households can also get up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicle purchases.</p>





<p>“It’s huge,” Denise Mauzerall, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University, says of the law’s potential to advance clean energy. But if the United States is to take full advantage of the increased clean energy capacity, it will be crucial to also construct sufficient infrastructure to deliver that energy, she notes. The bill offers only some support to build overhead power lines and other ways to transmit energy. “Without transmission,” she says, “we will really slow ourselves down.”</p>



<h4>Clean energy jobs and goods</h4>



<p>A major goal is to build up a clean energy economy by promoting high-quality jobs in industries such as solar and wind. To maximize tax credits, companies must pay workers a “prevailing wage” and employ apprentices to work a minimum number of hours on clean energy projects.</p>



<p>The legislation also invests in the domestic manufacturing of clean energy goods. Tax credits of up to 30 percent are available to companies that build or recycle wind turbine blades, solar panels, energy storage equipment and other clean energy products, and funds grants to retool factories to make electric vehicles.</p>

<h4>Reducing pollution</h4>



<p>Methane — a greenhouse gas that can trap more than 25 times as much heat as CO<sub>2</sub> — is another target. The legislation devotes $850 million to the monitoring and mitigation of methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. It also establishes a fine for operations that annually release amounts of methane that exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent.</p>



<p>And CO<sub>2</sub> is legally defined as an “air pollutant,” cementing the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate its production under the Clean Air Act.</p>



<p>But there’s more to the climate problem than decarbonizing today’s pollutive energy industry, Mauzerall says. “Going forward, we need to pay more attention to reducing emissions from the agricultural sector,” she says. About <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions</a> and about a third of global emissions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">come from agriculture</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<h4>Climate justice</h4>



<p>Billions of dollars are slated to go toward climate justice, a movement that confronts the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities. Funding includes $2.8 billion in grants for community-based projects, such as those that increase energy efficiency in affordable housing developments or monitor air quality in marginalized communities.</p>



<p>“But there are some troubling provisions,” Garcia says. The law authorizes new offshore oil and gas leases and provides fossil fuel companies with carbon capture and sequestration tax credits. These could prolong the life of pollutive oil and gas operations, which are often located near marginalized communities. </p>



<p>It will be crucial to follow these investments with laws that enforce both climate justice and the clean energy transition, Garcia says. “We need rules and regulations that hold industries’ feet to the fire, to make sure that those investments are going where they need to.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-snakes-clitorises-evolution">Scientists thought snakes didn’t have clitorises. They were wrong</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female snakes have clitorises too, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The research raises the possibility that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sex lives of snakes are more complicated and diverse</a> than previously understood, researchers report December 14 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Clitorises are found in a wide range of vertebrate life, from crocodiles to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-female-clitoris-sexual-anatomy">dolphins</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 1/10/22</em>). One exception is birds, which lost their clitorises over the course of their evolution. Female snakes appeared to have lost the sex organ too, which was puzzling, since their close lizard relatives possess paired clitorises, called hemiclitorises. Male lizards and snakes have accompanying paired phalli, or hemipenises.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This element of female snakes’ sexual anatomy went unexamined in detail for so long partly because hemiclitorises can be fragile and easy to miss, but also because female genitalia have historically been considered “quite taboo,” says evolutionary biologist Megan Folwell of the University of Adelaide in Australia.</p>



<p>“Even in humans, the proper function and significance of the human clitoris was still being discussed in 2006,” she says.</p>



<p>Conflicting accounts of snake hemiclitorises in some scientific papers led Folwell to take a detailed look.&nbsp;She first examined a euthanized female common death adder (<em>Acanthophis antarcticus</em>). “I just started with dissecting the tail and going into it with a really open mind of what I might find,” she says.</p>



<p>She was “pleasantly surprised” to find dual organs within that were completely different from the hemipenises found in male snakes. Also, unlike lizard hemiclitorises, the snake’s couldn’t turn out externally.</p>



<p>To confirm she wasn’t looking at a lump of some other tissue, Folwell and her colleagues carefully examined sections of the organs under a microscope. The team also soaked the tail in iodine, which allowed the soft tissues in the genital region to be seen with greater resolution using X-rays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These analyses showed that the tissues were fundamentally different from the male snake’s hemipenises. The female organs were full of primarily collagen rather than muscle fibers running through the structure. Another analysis showed the organs had “heaps of nerves” throughout them, Folwell says, suggesting they probably have substantial tactile sensitivity. Like other species’ clitorises, the snake’s showed a robust blood supply. </p>





<p>The team expanded its study to eight more snake species across four families, revealing a dizzying array of clitoral diversity. For instance, Folwell says, the hemiclitorises of the Mexican cantil viper (<em>Agkistrodon bilineatus</em>) are huge, filling the space of the tail. “Then you see the Ingram&#8217;s brown snake, which was so teeny tiny. If you didn&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for, it definitely could have been missed,” Folwell says.</p>



<p>Some hemiclitorises are thin and lay atop the scent glands, while others are sandwiched between or even a combination of on top and between, she adds.</p>

Folwell <em>et al</em>/<em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Snakes are thought to have evolved from lizard ancestors. The findings show that, evolutionarily speaking, the snake clitoris “wasn’t lost; it was just changed,” says Diane Kelly, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who wasn’t involved with this study.</p>



<p>Folwell and her colleagues think the hemiclitorises may be stimulated during courtship and mating behaviors, such as the twisting together of tails. This may make the female more receptive, encouraging longer and more frequent mating and enhancing the chances of fertilization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s been often believed that, in snakes, it&#8217;s been all about coercion, and all about the male driving mating,” Folwell says. “It may be a little bit closer toward seduction in some species.”</p>



<p>Going forward, Folwell wants to look further into how nerves in hemiclitorises are involved in any touch sensitivity and function during mating.</p>



<p>Kelly notes that comparing hemipenises and hemiclitorises of the same species could help get an idea of the organs’ function in snakes, and potentially reveal any back-and-forth evolution between males and females.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s 2022, and here&#8217;s a brand-new anatomical finding in a really common animal,” Kelly says. “There&#8217;s a lot of anatomy that we still don&#8217;t know yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">The Hunga Tonga volcano eruption touched space and spawned a lightning blitz</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano in the Pacific Ocean erupted earlier this year, the event was one for the record books — in several surprising ways.</p>



<p>The January 15 eruption was so explosive that it injected water vapor so high that it touched space, a first-of-its-kind observation for an earthly volcano. And the event produced the greatest concentration of lightning ever detected — making it far flashier than the 2018 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia or the 2021 tornado outbreak across the U.S. South.</p>





<p>The eruption also released so much energy that its disturbance of a charged layer of Earth’s atmosphere, called the ionosphere, rivaled that of a solar geomagnetic storm.</p>



<p>Seismologists, geophysicists and oceanographers described these and other eruption superlatives at a news conference on December 12 and in several presentations in Chicago at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>“These are once in a lifetime … observations,” said Larry Paxton, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>He and colleagues examined data from NASA’s Global Ultraviolet Imager, on a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. On the day of the eruption, Paxton said, the instrument revealed “something unusual” in the far-ultraviolet light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: a roundish spot in the satellite data coinciding with the volcano’s location where there was a temporary decrease in those UV emissions.</p>



<p>The instrument doesn’t see anything in the atmosphere below about 100 kilometers above sea level, what’s typically thought of as the boundary of space. That means that some sort of emitted material — most likely water vapor from the undersea volcano — had <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1092781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached high enough into space to briefly absorb those particles of light</a>, the researchers reported. Scientists had previously estimated that the eruption extended past the stratosphere and into the mesosphere. The new finding suggests the explosion reached even higher.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">volcano woke up in December 2021</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). By early January, the ongoing eruption was already “one of the most prolific lightning producers” on the planet, said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist with Vaisala Inc., an environmental instruments company headquartered in Vantaa, Finland.</p>



<p>Using Vaisala’s Global Lightning Detection Network, Vagasky and colleagues estimate that on the day of the big blast on January 15 alone, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1157048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were at least 400,000 lightning strikes at and around the volcano</a> — an order of magnitude higher than generally observed in Earth’s most powerful supercell thunderstorms, Vagasky said. “This was the most extreme lightning event ever detected by the global network.”</p>





<p>Some of the volcano’s explosive energy made it to the ionosphere, the layer of Earth’s atmosphere where charged plasma coexists with other atmospheric particles. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">Atmospheric pressure waves from the eruption propagated into space</a>, shifting the plasma around (<em>SN: 8/29/22</em>).</p>



<p>Those plasma shifts then rippled along Earth’s magnetic field lines, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1160627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resonating through the ionosphere to disturb plasma thousands of kilometers away</a>. “It’s like plucking a guitar string,” said Claire Gasque, a space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. (<em>Gasque is the daughter of </em>Science News<em>’ news director, Macon Morehouse, who wasn’t involved in this article.)</em></p>



<p>In the vicinity of the volcano, that effect on the ionosphere from the January 15 eruption rivaled, and even surpassed, the impact of a minor solar geomagnetic storm that began on January 14, Gasque added. “Despite a simultaneous geomagnetic storm, the volcano dominated changes in ionospheric dynamics.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Most people think of space weather as caused by solar influences,” Gasque said. But these data suggest a volcano can have just as much power.</p>



<p>The volcano may yet break other records, the researchers said, as scientists continue studying data from the powerful explosion.</p>

                <p>Thanks to a bit of good luck, the Mars rover Perseverance has captured the first-ever sound of a Martian dust devil.</p>



<p>The NASA rover has witnessed dusty whirlwinds before. But when this one swept right over Perseverance, the rover’s microphone happened to be turned on. So the first-of-its-kind data include <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35100-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sounds of dust grains</a> either pinging off the microphone or being transmitted to the mic through the rover’s structure, researchers report December 13 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>Because the rover’s microphone is turned on only occasionally, the team estimates that such events, when they occur, might be recorded just around 0.5 percent of the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On September 27, 2021, Perseverance’s navigation camera spotted a dust devil (purplish cloud in the images at top, which were processed to reveal the dust) whirling toward it from 50 to 60 meters away. As the whirlwind swept across the rover, Perseverance’s microphone recorded the sound it made, capturing the first-ever audio of a Martian dust devil (middle), and the rover’s instruments detected a slight drop in atmospheric pressure (bottom). These data may someday help researchers better understand dust dynamics on Mars.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wind speeds in the walls of the dust devil reached nearly 40 kilometers per hour, planetary scientist Naomi Murdoch of the Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France, and colleagues report. As with previous whirlwinds detected by other instruments, this late-morning dust devil caused a slight drop in atmospheric pressure and rise in temperature as it swept over the rover on September 27, 2021. It was 25 meters in diameter, at least 118 meters tall and ambled by at about 20 kilometers per hour.</p>



<p>One big surprise, Murdoch says, is that a prodigious amount of dust was airborne in the calm center of the whirlwind as well as in the brisk winds that formed its walls. Data from this event, as well as from other whirlwinds measured by the rover’s instruments, will help researchers better understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satanic-winds">how dust gets lifted off the Martian surface</a> (<em>SN: 10/24/06</em>). As of yet, Murdoch says, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">remains a mystery</a> to planetary scientists (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/4-major-coronavirus-pandemic-tools-2022">How 4 major coronavirus tools impacted the pandemic in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>The third year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States introduced vaccines for very young children and an updated booster, plus wider availability of an antiviral drug and at-home antigen tests. Here’s what we’ve learned since these achievements first made a splash.</p>



<h4>Shots for the littlest kids</h4>



<p>On June 18, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-kids-babies-under-5-fda-united-states">COVID-19 vaccine was recommended for children under 5</a>, the last group in the United States waiting for the shots (<em>SN Online: 6/17/22</em>). The thumbs-up was supported by immunity and safety data and the clear-and-present health risks of COVID-19 for young kids.</p>





<p><strong>Update:</strong> Many young children in the United States are still unvaccinated. Only 11 percent of those 6 months through 4 years old, or 1.8 million children, had received at least one dose as of December 7. A survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor conducted in mid-July explored some <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasons for the lackluster response</a>, including concerns that the vaccine hasn’t been tested enough.</p>



<p>There are also barriers to getting the vaccine, with 44 percent of Black parents worried about taking time off from work to vaccinate young kids or take care of them if they have side effects. Among Hispanic parents surveyed, 45 percent are concerned they won’t have the option to vaccinate at a place they trust.</p>



<h4>A new booster</h4>



<p>An updated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">COVID-19 vaccine became available as a booster</a> in the United States in early September for those 12 and older, and for those 5 to 12 years old in mid-October (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 7</em>). The vaccine, which targets two omicron subvariants as well as the original version of SARS-CoV-2, was designed to spur a broader immune response, protecting against more versions of the virus.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just 13.5 percent of people in the United States ages 5 and older, or 42 million people, had gotten the updated bi­valent booster by December 7. In a survey conducted in September, <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of U.S. adults had heard little or nothing about the new booster</a>, underscoring the need for more public outreach. President Joe Biden, who had COVID-19 in July, received his updated vaccine on October 25 and announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-additional-efforts-to-help-americans-get-their-free-updated-covid-19-vaccine-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new measures to get more boosters into arms</a>. A study of U.S. adults, reported in November, found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7148e1.htm?s_cid=mm7148e1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the updated booster provided added protection</a> against symptomatic COVID-19 in those who had already gotten at least two doses of the original vaccine.</p>



<h4>At-home COVID-19 tests</h4>





<p>Early in 2022, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7113e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the use of at-home COVID-19 tests</a> soared in response to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-testing-treatment">the winter omicron surge</a> (<em>SN Online: 1/11/22</em>). From January to September, the Biden administration mailed roughly 600 million free tests to people’s homes.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> At-home antigen tests are quick and easy, though the guidance on how to interpret the results has changed. With data that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.05.22278466v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeat testing</a> improved the chances of detecting a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended in August that people with and without symptoms who were exposed to the virus and tested negative <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-results-fda-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take additional tests over the next several days</a>.</p>



<p>A drawback to at-home tests is that the results have not been systematically tallied, leading to an undercount of cases. Estimates vary on how many cases have been missed. One research group calculated that in New York City between April 23 and May 8, around 1.5 million adults had COVID-19, nearly <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.22275603v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 times as many as</a> the official case count of 51,218.</p>



<h4>A new drug</h4>



<p>The antiviral Paxlovid — authorized at the end of 2021 — became one of a few COVID-19 treatment options in pill form. A study published in April reported that Paxlovid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-drugs-treatments-latest-news">reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 by 89 percent</a> compared with a placebo (<em>SN Online: 5/11/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> In July, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pharmacists-prescribe-paxlovid-certain-limitations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA authorized pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid</a> to get the drug more quickly to more people, since it needs to be taken early in an infection. A study conducted during the omicron surge suggested that the drug is <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2204919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beneficial for those 65 and older</a> but is not helpful to those 40 to 64.</p>



<p>Paxlovid also made news this year when reports popped up of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci">COVID-19 symptoms returning after treatment with the drug</a> ended (<em>SN Online: 8/12/22</em>). It’s not clear how common so-called Paxlovid rebound is. Some research has found the incidence is similar among Paxlovid-treated and placebo-treated patients, while other researchers have reported that rebound occurs more often with Paxlovid than with no treatment.</p>



<p>There’s also early evidence that Paxlovid may reduce the risk of developing long COVID. A preliminary study of U.S. veterans reported in November that treatment with Paxlovid within five days of a positive COVID-19 test was associated with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci">a 26 percent reduction in risk of long COVID</a> compared with a group that did not receive antiviral treatment after an infection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-energy">In a breakthrough experiment, nuclear fusion finally makes more energy than it uses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have finally managed to bottle the sun.</p>



<p>At 1:03 a.m. PST on December 5, researchers with the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, Calif., ignited controlled nuclear fusion that, for the first time, resulted in the net production of energy. A 3-million-joule burst emerged from a peppercorn-sized capsule of fuel when it was hit with a 2-million-joule laser pulse. Details of the long-awaited achievement, which mimics how the sun makes energy, were revealed in a news conference December 13 by U.S. Department of Energy officials.</p>





<p>“This is a monumental breakthrough,” says physicist Gilbert Collins of the University of Rochester in New York, who is a former NIF collaborator but was not involved with the research leading to the latest advance. “Since I started in this field, fusion was always 50 years away…. With this achievement, the landscape has changed.”</p>



<p>Fusion potentially provides a clean energy source. The fission reactors now used to generate nuclear energy rely on heavy atoms, like uranium, to release energy when they break down into lighter atoms, including some that are radioactive. While it’s comparatively easy to generate energy with fission, it’s an environmental nightmare to deal with the leftover radioactive debris that can remain hazardous for hundreds of millenia.</p>



<p>Controlled nuclear fusion, on the other hand, doesn’t produce such long-lived radioactive waste, but it’s technically much harder to achieve in the first place. In nuclear fusion, light atoms fuse together to create heavier ones. In the sun, that typically occurs when a proton, the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, combines with other protons to form helium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting atoms to fuse requires a combination of high pressure and temperature to squeeze the atoms tightly together. Intense gravity does much of the work in the sun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the National Ignition Facility, 192 lasers directed at a small pellet filled with deuterium, a heavy type of hydrogen, provided a blast of energy that did the trick instead. About 4 percent of the deuterium was fused in the process. The new result far surpassed the 1.3 million joules of energy produced by an earlier NIF experiment that marked the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">first time the team managed to ignite nuclear fusion</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;These recent results [at] NIF are the first time in a laboratory anywhere on Earth [that] we were able to demonstrate more energy coming out of a fusion reaction than was put in,&#8221; NIF physicist Tammy Ma said at the news conference. She predicted that pilot projects for power plants based on the fusion approach will be built in the &#8220;coming decades.&#8221;</p>



<p>But this latest fusion burst still didn’t produce enough energy to run the laser power supplies and other systems of the NIF experiment.&nbsp;It took about 300 million joules of energy from the electrical grid to get a hundredth of the energy back in fusion.</p>





<p>“The net energy gain is with respect to the energy in the light that was shined on the target, not with respect to the energy that went into making that light,” says University of Rochester physicist Riccardo Betti, who was also not involved with the research. “Now it’s up to the scientists and engineers to see if we can turn these physics principles into useful energy.”</p>



<p>Despite that, it’s a potential turning point in the technology comparable to the invention of the transistor or the Wright brothers’ first flight, says Collins. “We now have a laboratory system that we can use as a compass for how to make progress very rapidly,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/katydids-earliest-insect-ears-fossils-jurassic">Katydids had the earliest known insect ears 160 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over 100 million years ago, the chirps of insects known as katydids dominated the sounds of Earth’s nights. Now, fossils reveal what the katydid ears that heard those sounds looked like.</p>



<p>Twenty-four fossils of roughly 160 million-year-old katydids unearthed in China represent the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2210601119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest known insect ears</a>, researchers report December 12 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>These ancient sensors of sound — identical to the ones found on today’s katydids — may have picked up the first short-range, high-frequency calls of any kind, helping the insects hide from predators.</p>





<p>Insects were the first land dwellers to send sound waves through the air, allowing the creatures to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-wings-communication-noise-light-fossil-paleontology">communicate over longer distances</a> than sight often allows (<em>SN: 7/15/21</em>). While some insects use their antennae to detect vibrations in the air, katydids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-katydids-evolved-mammal-ears">have mammal-like ears that use an eardrum</a> to hear (<em>SN: 11/15/12</em>). Yet because well-preserved insect eardrums are rare in the fossil record, it’s unclear how katydid ears evolved, say paleontologist Chunpeng Xu of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology in China and colleagues.</p>



<p>Analyses of the Chinese fossils push the known record of male and female katydid ears’ ability to listen for potential mates or male competitors to the mid-Jurassic, between 157 million and 166 million years ago. The previous record holders for oldest insect ears, katydids and crickets <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/abs/exceptionally-preserved-fossil-insect-ears-from-the-eocene-green-river-formation-of-colorado/86C59E301111033E2DCDAA26C3B99C95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in Colorado</a>, are around 50 million years old.</p>



<p>What’s more, sound-producing structures on 87 fossilized male katydid wings from China, South Africa and Kyrgyzstan — which date from about 157 million to 242 million years ago — may have generated a variety of chirps, including high-frequency calls up to 16 kilohertz. (Humans, by comparison, can hear frequencies from roughly 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.)</p>



<p>High-frequency chirps don’t travel far, which would have allowed katydids to communicate over short distances. Such a trait may have been useful because mammal hearing was improving around the same time, Xu says. Limiting the range of some calls could have helped katydids hide from predatory eavesdroppers on the hunt for an insect feast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-orion-moon-spacecraft-capsule">Artemis 1’s Orion capsule returned safely to Earth. What’s next?</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA’s Orion passenger space capsule has passed a huge test, splashing down intact in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico on December 11. The successful splashdown caps the complex and delayed Artemis 1 mission, which sent Orion around the moon and back in an early test of bringing humans back to the lunar surface.</p>



<p>Now mission scientists will examine the capsule for damage, paying close attention to how its heat shield performed on its searing reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, as well as spots where a prelaunch hurricane damaged the capsule’s caulking. When it entered Earth’s atmosphere, Orion was traveling some 40,000 kilometers per hour, but atmospheric drag and massive parachutes quickly slowed it. The resulting friction heated the spacecraft to nearly 2700⁰ Celsius, fully testing Orion’s heat shield’s ability to protect what’s inside the spacecraft.</p>





<p>The team will also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">analyze data from its faux astronaut pilot, Moonikin Campos</a>, and his female torso passengers Helga and Zohar (<em>SN: 8/26/22</em>). Those data will help to determine things like how much radiation and acceleration the real human astronauts will face, how well their protective gear works and how female bodies will fare during the planned launch of a crewed Orion space capsule. That’s scheduled for 2024, when Artemis II will send a crewed capsule to orbit the moon. NASA then aims to land astronauts on the moon as early as 2025 as part of Artemis III.</p>



<p>Some 140 gigabytes of data were already downloaded during the nearly monthlong flight, “but there&#8217;s a lot of data that’s stored on the vehicle, particularly for some of the things that were flying inside the crew cabin,” says NASA’s Debbie Korth, Orion deputy program manager.</p>



<p>To prep for Artemis II, “the next step is adding the crew and adding an environmental control and life support system to the Artemis II spacecraft,” Korth says. Several components of the Space Launch System rocket that will launch that next flight are being constructed, and the next Orion crew and service modules are being tested and completed at Kennedy Space Center.</p>



<p>“This was a challenging mission, and this is what mission success looks like,” said NASA’s Mike Sarafin, the Artemis I mission manager of this test flight during a news conference after the splashdown. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a look back at Orion’s 25.5-day historic trek <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">after its nail-biting launch</a> on November 16 (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Day 3: Bye-bye, CubeSats</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="515" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-1.jpg" alt="the Orion spacecraft against the backdrop of space" class="wp-image-3120083" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-1-506x383.jpg 506w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-1-594x450.jpg 594w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-1-246x186.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120083">A camera attached to Orion’s solar array captured this view of the spacecraft on the mission’s third day as part of a routine inspection to see how the capsule fared after flying through an area full of space debris.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120083">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The mission launched with 10 shoebox-sized CubeSats that sat between the rocket’s core stage and the Orion spacecraft. On Day 3, the Artemis I team confirmed that all 10 deployed at their planned times but it appears that about half either didn’t turn on or aren’t operating as expected.</p>



<p>The ones that seem to be working so far include ArgoMoon, the European CubeSat that’s taken photos of the moon and Earth, plus NASA’s BioSentinel experiment, which is testing cosmic radiation’s effect on yeast. NASA’s LunaH-Map CubeSat, which is looking for areas rich in hydrogen and water on the&nbsp;moon’s&nbsp;surface, is functioning, although its propulsion system isn’t working properly.</p>





<p>The Japanese space agency contributed two CubeSats: EQUULEUS is testing water propulsion in space, and it is working as expected, but the nation’s lunar lander, OMOTENASHI, had been in and out of radio contact and its mission was scrubbed.</p>



<p>Orion also did a bit of self-inspection on Day 3, snapping pics of its exterior to check for damage after the first leg of its flight.</p>



<h4>Day 4: Radiation test</h4>



<p>The sun, which is in its active solar cycle, sent out a pretty big flare on November 19. It was the most energetic flare Orion encountered on its trip (though not even in the top 50 most powerful ones of the year) and a good test of how radiation affects the manikin passengers. Once back on Earth, scientists can analyze the thousands of sensors on those manikins to have a better idea how the radiation will affect humans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2.jpg" alt="A manikin wearing a spacesuit and helmet 'stares' at sensors and screens inside the Orion space capsule" class="wp-image-3120084" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120922_lk_Orion-spashdown_inline-2-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120084">By the time this image was taken on Day 9, radiation from the November 19 solar flare likely would have hit Orion. Radiation sensors on Moonikin Campos (at left) and his fellow manikins will provide valuable data to scientists.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120084">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Especially interesting will be the differences between Zohar and Helga. While Zohar is wearing a vest to protect its torso from radiation, Helga isn’t.</p>



<h4>Day 8: Can you hear me now?</h4>



<p>Mission control temporarily lost communication with the space capsule for 47 minutes on November 23. This happened while Orion was trying to chat with the Deep Space Network, the large radio dishes on Earth that send and receive signals to and from spacecraft.</p>



<p>The team downloaded a bunch of data to try to understand why that happened. They’re trying to figure out if it was a problem on the Orion end or on the Deep Space Network side of things. Other Orion check-ins with the same radio network have worked flawlessly.</p>



<h4>Day 10: New orbit</h4>



<p>After passing by the moon, Orion entered a new orbit following an engine burn to change its direction. This distant retrograde orbit put the capsule more than 65,000 kilometers above the lunar surface.</p>



<p>It was far enough away from the moon that Orion wouldn&#8217;t have to use a lot of fuel to stay stable, allowing the mission team to test how this spacecraft functions in a deep space environment. They plan to test its star trackers — what the team uses to orient the capsule in space — and other parts of its guidance and control systems that can’t be tested on Earth.</p>



<h4>Day 13: Breaking a record</h4>



<p>Orion reached 432,210 kilometers from Earth, giving it an amazing view of both Earth and the moon.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just Orion’s maximum flight distance, but it’s the farthest any spacecraft designed for humans has gone. It beat the record that’s been in place for more than 50 years, set by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/july-6-2019">Apollo 13</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/19</em>).</p>



<h4>Day 20: Farewell moon</h4>



<p>In a farewell kiss, Orion swung just 129.7 kilometers above the lunar surface. Its engineers intended for that flyby to use the moon’s gravitational force to alter the direction of its flight.</p>



<p>The spacecraft also burned its main engine for nearly three and a half minutes to boost its speed.</p>



<p>Those actions let Orion break free of the moon’s sphere of influence, where lunar gravity was the main force acting on it, and direct it back to Earth.</p>

<h4>Day 26: Splashdown!</h4>



<p>Following a harrowing nearly 20-minute descent through Earth’s atmosphere, skipping through the thick gaseous layers, the Orion crew capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Guadalupe Island, off the coast of Mexico’s Baja Peninsula.</p>



<p>While it hit the atmosphere at just under 40,000 kilometers per hour, it landed in the water at 32 km/hr, slowed primarily by Orion&#8217;s 5-meter diameter heat shield against the atmosphere. Special material that makes up the shield burned off in the atmosphere as friction slowed the craft, carrying some of the intense heat away from the capsule. Then, in the last four minutes of descent, a series of 11 parachutes deployed, helping to plop Orion softly into the ocean.</p>

Prior to these chutes, eight others had deployed and been released.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120087">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mission scientists then checked the temperature in the cabin and outside and took other remote measurements before recovery teams snagged it several hours later and brought it to U.S.S. <em>Portland</em>.</p>



<p>“I don’t think any one of us could have imagined a mission this successful, but we had a very successful flight test,” Sarafin said. “We now have a foundational deep-space transportation system.”</p>

                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>Open Science is on the rise. We can infer as much from the proliferation of Open Access publishing options; the steady upward trend in bioRxiv postings; the periodic rollout of new national, institutional, or funder policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what do we actually <em>know </em>about the day-to-day realities of Open Science practice? What are the norms? How do they vary across different research subject areas and regions? Are Open Science practices shifting over time? Where might the next opportunity lie and where do barriers to adoption persist?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To even begin exploring these questions and others like them we need to establish a shared understanding of how we define and measure Open Science practices. We also need to understand the current state of adoption in order to track progress over time. That&rsquo;s where the Open Science Indicators project comes in. <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889">PLOS conceptualized a framework</a> for measuring Open Science practices according to the FAIR principles, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">partnered with DataSeer</a> to develop a set of numerical &ldquo;indicators&rdquo; linked to specific Open Science characteristics and behaviors observable in published research articles. Our very first dataset, now available for download at <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686">Figshare</a>, focuses on three Open Science practices: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.</p>



<h2>How can this dataset be used?</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators are a tool with broad potential applications to many different situations and questions in research communications. Indicators can complement and support the aims of the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/natural-sciences/open-science/implementation">UNESCO Open Science Monitoring Framework Working Group</a> and meet the needs of <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9/">organizations that wish to better understand Open Science practices</a>. They can also be used to assess the impact of policy changes, like those set forth in the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-cheers-the-ostp-memorandum/">recent OSTP memo</a>, across the literature&mdash;or, in the future, to parse by research discipline or subject, institution, region, or time period. They can tell us which infrastructure is used most often, and by whom.</p>



<p>At PLOS in particular, we hope that a better understanding of how Open Science tools and practices are applied today can help us to identify barriers, understand community norms,&nbsp; better support best practices, and track changes over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, our intention is <em>not </em>for these indicators to be used as a tool for ranking journals, authors or institutions. As for every quantitative assessment of research characteristics, responsible use calls for context and multiplicity of measures (see for example <a href="https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/">The Metric Tide</a> and <a href="http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/">Leiden Manifesto</a>). We feel, however, that these indicators are best used as a tool for improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>This is just the beginning</h2>



<p id="poll">In the future we plan to expand on this dataset with new data points, additional publication years, and fresh indicators related to other aspects of Open Science practice. We appreciate your feedback to help inform future iterations. Let us know what you think of the data fields collected, <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889">our Open Science Indicator definitions</a>, the Open Practices identified and how we have measured them in this first, early sharing of the results.

<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h2 id="outcomes"><strong>Initial observations</strong></h2>



<p>In the initial dataset we primarily examine data-sharing and code-sharing behaviors in both PLOS articles, and in the wider scientific literature. This dataset also includes insights into preprint posting.</p>



<p>The data cover approximately 61,000 PLOS research articles published in the 3.5 years between January 2019 and June 2022, as well as a comparator set of 6,000 publicly-available research articles from PubMed Central (10% of the PLOS sample).</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that this dataset only measures machine-detectable traits. If, for example, the authors of an article have shared a dataset without labeling it as such, that data may not be counted as &ldquo;shared.&rdquo; The accuracy rates for data sharing range from 81% for comparator articles to 85% for PLOS articles. For code sharing, accuracy rates range from 94% for comparators to 97% for PLOS. Preprint accuracy rates are 96% for comparators and 94% for PLOS. Our goal is to reach an accuracy rate of at least 85% for all indicators and content sources. For Open Science Indicators to function at scale, it is essential to automate the process and compare this work with that of other researchers, and we are working with DataSeer to improve these accuracy rates, which will be reported with <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686">each data release</a>.</p>

<h3>Data repository use</h3>



<p>While there are many ways to share data, depositing it in a purpose-built data repository is considered best practice. Data repositories offer benefits like improved discoverability and metadata, stable unique identifiers, and archival measures to maintain the integrity of the record over time.</p>



<p>The Open Science Indicators dataset offers two different views into data-sharing methods:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Confirmed data repository:</strong> Data deposited in a &ldquo;known repository&rdquo; based on a controlled list of ~130 repositories. This number may be somewhat conservative.</li><li><strong>Available online:</strong> Data available at a recognizable url. This is a less conservative number that will include less frequently used repositories, including some institutional repositories, as well as other online methods for sharing data&nbsp; (e.g. open notebooks, lab websites, etc.).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>By either measure, PLOS articles are more likely to link to an associated public dataset than comparable articles published elsewhere. When viewed over time, a generally positive trend in confirmed repository usage is evident for both PLOS and comparator articles.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/#asterisk">*</a> </p>

<h3>Code sharing</h3>



<p>Code-sharing rates among PLOS and comparator articles are generally similar to one another. Overall, code sharing &ndash; in any form &ndash; is less common than data sharing, due perhaps in part to reduced relevance (most research generates datasets, but only some research produces code).</p>

<p>In addition to code-sharing rates, the dataset also captures whether code was generated as part of the research, lending new insight into adoption rates and potential future adoption. We aim to explore this data more fully in a future post.</p>



<h3>Preprint posting</h3>



<p>The data indicate that PLOS articles are more likely to have an associated preprint than comparable articles published elsewhere. Overall, 21% of PLOS articles have an associated preprint, versus 19% of comparator articles.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is next for Open Science Indicators?</h2>



<p>This summary explores the three Open Science Indicators we described in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">September announcement</a>&mdash;but there are many other ways the dataset can be analyzed to understand Open Science practices. For example, you can delve into data- and code-sharing methodologies, differentiating between sharing as Supporting Information (SI) or in a repository. We are eager to hear from you on what aspects of the data are most useful, and what additional data points you&rsquo;d like to see. At the same time, we&rsquo;ll take a deeper look at Open Science practices within different research communities.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-ebola-monkeypox-mpox-polio-hepatitis-bird-flu-2022">Viruses other than the coronavirus made headlines in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year delivered many sobering reminders that the coronavirus isn’t the only viral threat out there.</p>



<h4>Mpox went global</h4>



<p>The mpox virus, a relative of the virus that causes smallpox, had never before spread widely among people outside of Central and West Africa. But in May, mpox, previously known as monkeypox, burst onto the global scene. As of November 28, there have been more than 81,100 cases across 110 countries and 55 deaths.</p>



<p>The disease, which can cause a rash with painful, pus-filled lesions, mainly spreads through close contact. Although anyone can be infected, outside of West and Central Africa the current outbreak <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">is primarily affecting men who have sex with men</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 6</em>). Waning immunity worldwide to smallpox — which was eradicated in 1980, ending vaccination programs — likely helped mpox spread.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In the United States and Europe, cases started going down in August as people at high risk changed their behavior or received vaccines. Preliminary data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/cases-data/mpx-vaccine-effectiveness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination is protective</a>. Yet vaccines are still not available in African countries where mpox has historically circulated.</p>



<h4>Ebola surged in Uganda</h4>



<p>Two small Ebola virus outbreaks were reported in Congo this year. But more worrisome was an <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON410" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outbreak in Uganda that began in September</a>. Current Ebola vaccines and treatments don’t offer protection against the strain causing that country’s outbreak. But clinical trials for three vaccine candidates were set to begin in late 2022.</p>



<p>The outbreak, however, appears to be on the decline after peaking in mid-October.&nbsp;As of&nbsp;December 5, there were no active cases in Uganda. In total, the outbreak has had&nbsp;142&nbsp;confirmed cases and&nbsp;56&nbsp;confirmed deaths, including at least seven health care workers.</p>

<h4>Poliovirus found in sewage</h4>



<p>A version of the poliovirus was detected in sewage in New York, Israel, the United Kingdom and some other places where polio had been eliminated, suggesting the virus — which can cause paralysis — was circulating there. In March, Israeli officials confirmed a case of paralytic polio in an unvaccinated 3-year-old; an unvaccinated man in New York was paralyzed by polio in June.</p>



<p>These cases were linked <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polio-cdc-spread-new-york-vaccine-virus">to vaccine-derived polioviruses</a> (<em>SN Online: 9/14/22</em>). One type of polio vaccine relies on live but weakened virus to teach the body to mount immune defenses against the disease. In rare cases, that weakened, or attenuated, virus can spread, mutate and regain the ability to cause paralysis in people who are not vaccinated. Attenuated vaccines are not used in the United States, but are common in some countries, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last two places that are still working to eliminate polio.</p>

<h4>Unexplained hepatitis hit children</h4>



<p>Between October 2021 and July 8, the last time the World Health Organization released an update, more than 1,000 children globally had developed severe hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. Experts still aren’t sure why. They also don’t know whether it’s a new outbreak, or if doctors are just paying more attention in the wake of the pandemic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hepatitis-cases-children-liver-adenovirus">Many cases were linked to an adenovirus</a>, which typically causes colds (<em>SN Online: 5/19/22</em>). But having a previous case of COVID-19 could also factor in. Another hypothesis is that kids with a certain genetic susceptibility are <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.22277425v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting hepatitis after a double infection</a>, perhaps with an adenovirus plus a second virus called AAV2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_viruses_hep.jpg" alt="a computer generated illustration of adenovirus structures in green and purple" class="wp-image-3120015" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_viruses_hep.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_viruses_hep-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120015">Adenoviruses (illustrated) typically cause colds. But one type made headlines this year as a suspect in an outbreak of unexplained liver inflammation in children.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120015">KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Bird flu wreaked havoc</h4>



<p>Birds around the world also faced a deadly viral foe this year: the H5N1 influenza virus. In the United States alone, more than 4,300 wild birds have tested positive for the virus. A record number of farmed poultry — more than 53 million — died from either infection or being culled to control the virus’ spread. In Europe, the 2021–2022 season was also the largest known epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza, with more than 2,600 outbreaks across 37 countries in farmed or captive birds. Researchers are concerned that H5N1 poses a long-term threat to poultry, wild birds and potentially other animals; the virus was linked this year to <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/recent-increase-seal-deaths-maine-linked-avian-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seal die-off in Maine</a>.</p>



<p>People can also be susceptible, with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0428-avian-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two reported cases</a> since December 2021. Although bird flu doesn’t easily spread among people, experts worry that as the epidemic continues the virus will pick up mutations that allow it to transmit from person to person.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-much-water-should-you-drink">How much water should you drink a day? It depends on several factors.</a></h4>

              
                <p>Are you drinking enough water?</p>



<p>The question seems like it should have a straightforward answer — a specific amount of water you need to drink daily to combat dehydration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the rate and way in which the human body takes in and excretes water is not as universal as you might expect. By studying more than 5,000 people living in 23 countries and ranging in age from 8 days to 96 years, researchers have found that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the turnover of water in a person’s body varies widely</a> depending on the individual’s physical and environmental factors. </p>





<p>The results, published in the Nov. 24 <em>Science</em>, suggest that the idea that a person should ideally consume eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day is not a one-size-fits-all solution to peak hydration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even within the calculations, “individual variabilities could be huge,” says biomedical engineer Kong Chen, director of the metabolic research program at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center.</p>



<p>Yosuke Yamada, a physiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition in Japan, and colleagues used a stable isotope of hydrogen known as deuterium to track the movement of water through people’s bodies. Drinking water accounts for only half of the total water intake by humans, with the rest coming from food. Simply measuring the amount of water that a person drinks in a day is not enough to accurately gauge water turnover or the amount of water used by the body daily.</p>



<p>The researchers found that men ages 20 to 30 and women ages 20 to 55 had the highest water turnover. These numbers varied significantly depending on humidity, altitude, latitude and physiological factors, such as whether a person was athletic. For men and women, the low end of water turnover averaged around 1 to 1.5 liters a day and the high end averaged around 6 liters a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the findings laid out in the study are not a road map for how much water individuals in certain populations should drink daily, Chen says. “There’s still a lot of complex relationships that need to be teased out,” he says. Instead, the data raise more questions about the effects of particular environments on an individual&#8217;s water turnover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most unexpected finding is that people who are living in poor countries … , or lower <a href="https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human development index</a> countries, have a higher water turnover,” Yamada says. Even when the researchers adjusted for climate, body size, sex and other factors, people living in low-HDI countries — which, for this study, included Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania — still had higher water turnover rates than those in high-HDI countries, including Belgium, Japan and the United States. The disparity may be due to the frequent use of indoor climate control in the wealthier countries, the researchers suggest.</p>





<p>The water turnover rate could also represent a significant marker of an individual’s metabolic health. Ten percent of a person’s total water body water is lost daily to the metabolic processes occurring in our cells. For people with less access to safe drinking water, this loss can also be a “huge issue,” Yamada says.</p>



<p>More than 2 billion people in the world <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-will-people-have-enough-water-live">don’t have access to safe drinking water</a> and that number is projected to grow, according to a 2018 United Nations report (<em>SN: 8/16/18</em>). Hopefully the research will help the people of the world fight against dehydration in the face of water shortages, Yamada says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-fatigue-end-covid-19-burnout-2022">Why pandemic fatigue and COVID-19 burnout took over in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>2022 was the year many people decided the coronavirus pandemic had ended.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said as much in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-joe-biden-60-minutes-interview-transcript-2022-09-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with <em>60 Minutes</em></a><em> </em>in September. “The pandemic is over,” he said while strolling around the Detroit Auto Show. “We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over.”</p>



<p>His evidence? “No one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.”</p>



<p>But the week Biden’s remarks aired, about 360 people were still dying each day from COVID-19 in the United States. Globally, about 10,000 deaths were recorded every week. That’s “10,000 too many, when most of these deaths could be prevented,” the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news briefing at the time. Then, of course, there are the millions who are still dealing with lingering symptoms long after an infection.</p>

<p>Those staggering numbers have stopped alarming people, maybe because those stats came on the heels of two years of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">mind-boggling death counts</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/18/22</em>). Indifference to the mounting death toll may reflect pandemic fatigue that settled deep within the public psyche, leaving many feeling over and done with safety precautions.</p>



<p>“We didn’t warn people about fatigue,” says Theresa Chapple-McGruder, an epidemiologist in the Chicago area. “We didn’t warn people about the fact that pandemics can last long and that we still need people to be willing to care about yourselves, your neighbors, your community.”</p>



<p>Public health agencies around the world, including in Singapore and the United Kingdom, reinforced the idea that we could “return to normal” by learning to “live with COVID.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">guidelines raised the threshold for case counts</a> that would trigger masking (<em>SN Online: 3/3/22</em>). The agency also shortened <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">suggested isolation times for infected people to five days</a>, even though most people still test positive for the virus and are potentially infectious to others for several days longer (<em>SN Online: 8/19/22</em>).</p>



<p>The shifting guidelines bred confusion and put the onus for deciding when to mask, test and stay home on individuals. In essence, the strategy shifted from public health — protecting your community — to individual health — protecting yourself.</p>

<p>Doing your part can be exhausting, says Eric Kennedy, a sociologist specializing in disaster management at York University in Toronto. “Public health is saying, ‘Hey, you have to make the right choices every single moment of your life.’ Of course, people are going to get tired with that.”</p>



<p>Doing the right thing — from getting vaccinated to wearing masks indoors — didn’t always feel like it paid off on a personal level. As good as the vaccines are at keeping people from becoming severely ill or dying of COVID-19, they were not as effective at protecting against infection. This year, many people who tried hard to make safe choices and had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">avoided COVID-19 got infected by wily omicron variants</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/22/22</em>). People sometimes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">got reinfected</a> — some more than once (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 8</em>).</p>





<p>Those infections may have contributed to a sense of futility. “Like, ‘I did my best. And even with all of that work, I still got it. So why should I try?’ ” says Kennedy, head of a Canadian project monitoring the sociological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Getting vaccinated, masking and getting drugs or antibody treatments can reduce the severity of infection and may cut the chances of infecting others. “We should have been talking about this as a community health issue and not a personal health issue,” Chapple-McGruder says. “We also don’t talk about the fact that our uptake [of these tools] is nowhere near what we need” to avoid the hundreds of daily deaths.</p>



<p>A lack of data about how widely the coronavirus is still circulating makes it difficult to say whether the pandemic is ending. In the United States, the influx of home tests was “a blessing and a curse,” says Beth Blauer, data lead for the Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coronavirus Resource Center</a>. The tests gave an instant readout that told people whether they were infected and should isolate. But because those results were rarely reported to public health officials, true numbers of cases became difficult to gauge, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-data-surge-spread-testing-wastewater-yankee-candles">creating a big data gap</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/27/22</em>).</p>

<h3>Lagging on vaccines &nbsp;</h3>



<p>About 80 percent of the U.S. population got the first COVID-19 vaccine dose and close to 70 percent completed the primary series. The updated booster, made available in September, had only made it into the arms of 12 percent of people age 5 and older as of November 24.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The flow of COVID-19 data from many state and local agencies also slowed to a trickle. In October, even the CDC began reporting cases and deaths <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly instead of daily</a>. Altogether, undercounting of the coronavirus’s reach became worse than ever.</p>



<p>“We’re being told, ‘it’s up to you now to decide what to do,’ ” Blauer says, “but the data is not in place to be able to inform real-time decision making.”</p>



<p>With COVID-19 fatigue so widespread, businesses, governments and other institutions have to find ways to step up and do their part, Kennedy says. For instance, requiring better ventilation and filtration in public buildings could clean up indoor air and reduce the chance of spreading many respiratory infections, along with COVID-19. That’s a behind-the-scenes intervention that individuals don’t have to waste mental energy worrying about, he says.</p>



<p>The bottom line: People may have stopped worrying about COVID-19, but the virus isn’t done with us yet. “We have spent two-and-a-half years in a long, dark tunnel, and we are just beginning to glimpse the light at the end of that tunnel. But it is still a long way off,” WHO’s Tedros said. “The tunnel <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1572953387314057219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still dark, with many obstacles</a> that could trip us up if we don’t take care.” If the virus makes a resurgence, will we see it coming and will we have the energy to combat it again?</p>

<p><strong>A New Figure for the Cosmic Speed Limit </strong>– <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-figure-cosmic-speed-limit"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 2, 1972</p>



<p>A group at the National Bureau of Standards at B­oulder, Colo., now reports an extremely accurate [speed of light] measurement using the wavelength and frequency of a helium-neon laser.… The result gives the speed of light as 299,792.4562 kilometers per second.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>That 1972 experiment measured the two-way speed of light, or the average speed of photons that traveled from their source to a reflective surface and back. The result, which still holds up, helped scientists redefine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-recipe-new-meter">the standard length of the meter</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/83, p. 263</em>). But they weren’t done putting light through its paces. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, photons set a record for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/17561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowest measured speed of light</a> at 17 meters per second and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-stands-still-atom-clouds">froze in their tracks</a> for one-thousandth of a second (<em>SN: 1/27/01, p. 52</em>). For all that success, one major hurdle remains: directly testing the one-way speed of light. The measurement, which many scientists say is impossible to make, could resolve the long-standing question of whether the speed of light is uniform in all directions.</p>

In 2020, our team analyzed research methodology and characteristics of journal articles with original data, preprint articles and registered clinical trial protocols about COVID-19. During the conduct of the study, which was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01047-2">published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a>, we noticed that many registered clinical trials for COVID-19 mentioned standard of care (SoC) as a comparator for an intervention tested for COVID-19 but without an explanation/description of what will be the SoC.</p>
<p>SoC (also called standard care, standard treatment, usual care, basic care, conventional treatment) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15265160802654129">normally means the best currently available</a>, proven treatment, established effective treatment. So, we were very confused by the fact that trials designed in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic would use the term “standard of care”. If the disease is new, we cannot have an SoC for it yet.</p>
<p>Thus, we decided to conduct a new study in which we ought to examine what the trial authors decided to proclaim SoC for an emergent disease. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-022-01646-1">our analysis, published recently in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a>, we screened 6022 records from the WHO ICTRP clinical trial registry, 9358 preprint records and 356 records from Cochrane COVID–19 Study Register related to COVID-19. We found 737 trials that reported they used standard, usual, conventional, or routine treatment for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Among 737 unique trials included in the analysis, only 129 (18%) trials reported component(s) of SoC; the remaining trials simply reported that they used SoC, with no further detail. Among those 129 trials, the number of components of SoC ranged from 1 to 10. The most commonly used groups of interventions in the SoC were antiparasitics (62% of the trials), antivirals (57%), antibiotics (31%), oxygen (17%), antithrombotics/anticoagulants (14%), vitamins (13%), immunomodulatory agents (13%), corticosteroids (12%), analgesics/antipyretics (12%). Various combinations of those interventions were used in the SoC, with up to 7 different types of interventions combined. Dosing, timing, and method of administration were frequently not reported for SoC components.</p>
<p>This study has highlighted multiple problems. Firstly, our study indicates that many experimental, i.e. investigational interventions, were described as SoC in early COVID-19 trials, even though their risk/benefit profile in targeted patients was unknown. Secondly, many of those interventions were later proven ineffective or even detrimental to patients suffering from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the majority of trials poorly reported therapy given to participants. Research that is poorly reported is considered research waste. Clinical trials need to be transparently reported to be replicable, and providing details about interventions is essential. This is also important for many other reasons, such as more accurate risk-benefit assessment, adherence to reporting guidelines, ethics and future research. Authors of future trials need to transparently report their interventions in all reports about the trial, including the study registrations, study protocols and full research reports. It is particularly disheartening to see so many poorly reported clinical trials related to the topic of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that this was not a study that aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of any type of intervention for COVID-19. We know that many interventions used early in the COVID-19 pandemic to treat patients can be considered experimental (i.e. investigational) as the disease was previously unknown. Instead, we intended to analyze which interventions the trialists labelled as SoC.</p>
<p>The trialists did not have to use the term SoC when describing the therapies they decided to give to their patients in the trial as comparators. The term SoC implies that something is the standard, i.e. usual therapy, in a certain setting. We consider that in the early stage of the pandemic, there could be no SoC in the real sense since the disease was new. Thus, it was curious that so many trialists opted to use the term SoC.</p>
<p>An additional aspect of our study is that we have shown the wide diversity of the SoC, showcasing all kinds of experimental/investigational approaches that were tested initially when treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>A takeaway message is that the term “standard of care” should not be used lightly in reports about interventions for emergent diseases and that authors should better report their clinical trials so that their methods are transparent and replicable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brief-burst-activity-health-benefits">Brief bursts of activity offer health benefits for people who don’t exercise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making day-to-day activities more vigorous for a few minutes — such as briefly stepping up the pace of a walk — could offer people who don&#8217;t exercise some of the health benefits that exercisers enjoy.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new study of roughly 25,000 adults who reported no exercise in their free time. Those who incorporated three one- to two-minute bursts of intense activity per day saw a nearly a 40 percent drop in the risk of death from any cause compared with those whose days didn’t include such activity. The risk of death from cancer also fell by nearly 40 percent, and the risk of death from cardiovascular disease dropped almost 50 percent, researchers report online December 8 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>





<p>In a comparison with around 62,000 people who exercised regularly, including runners, gym-goers and recreational cyclists, the mortality risk reduction was similar.</p>



<p>“This study adds to other literature showing that even short amounts of activity are beneficial,” says Lisa Cadmus-Bertram, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the research. “So many people are daunted by feeling that they don’t have the time, money, motivation, transportation, etc. to go to a gym regularly or work out for long periods of time,” she says. “The message we can take is that it is absolutely worth doing what you can.”</p>



<p>Emmanuel Stamatakis, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, and his colleagues analyzed a subset of records from the UK Biobank, a biomedical database containing health information on half a million people in the United Kingdom. The study’s non-exercising participants — more than half of whom were women and were 62 years old on average — had worn movement-tracking devices for a week.</p>



<p>Over an average seven years of follow-up, for those whose days included three to four bursts of activity, the mortality rate was 4.2 deaths from any cause per 1,000 people for one year. For those with no activity bursts, it was 10.4 deaths per 1,000 people for one year.</p>



<p>The researchers were looking for bursts of vigorous activity that met a definition determined in a laboratory study, including reaching at least 77 percent of maximum heart rate and at least 64 percent of maximum oxygen consumption. In real life, the signs that someone has reached the needed intensity level are “an increase in heart rate and feeling out of breath” in the first 15 to 30 seconds of an activity, Stamatakis says.</p>



<p>Regular daily activities offer several opportunities for these vigorous bursts, he says. “The simplest one is maximizing walking pace for a minute or two during any regular walk.” Other options, he says, include carrying grocery bags to the car or taking the stairs. “The largest population health gains will be realized by finding ways to get the least physically active people to move a little more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-to-make-metal-snowflakes">How to make tiny metal snowflakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Look closely at a snowflake, and you’ll observe a one-of-a-kind gossamer lattice, its growth influenced by ambient conditions like temperature and humidity. Turns out, this sort of intricate self-assemblage can also occur in metals, researchers report in the Dec. 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>In pools of molten gallium, physicist Nicola Gaston and colleagues <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm2731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew zinc nanostructures</a> with symmetrical, hexagonal crystal frameworks. Such metal snowflakes could be useful for catalyzing chemical reactions and constructing electronics, says Gaston, of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.</p>





<p>“Self-assembly is the way nature makes nanostructures,” she says. “We&#8217;re trying to learn to do the same things.” Figuring out how to craft tiny, complex metal shapes in fewer steps and with less energy could be a boon for manufacturers.</p>



<p>The researchers chose gallium as a growth medium, due to its relatively low melting point, ability to dissolve many other metals and the tendency for its atoms to loosely organize while in a liquid state.</p>



<p>After mixing zinc into the gallium, the team subjected the alloy to elevated temperatures and different pressures, and then let the mixture cool to room temperature. The loose ordering of gallium atoms appeared to coax the crystallizing zinc to bloom into symmetrical, hexagonal structures resembling natural snowflakes and other shapes, the team found. It’s somewhat like how a fruit tray imparts order on the fruits stacked within, Gaston says.</p>



<p>The future may be bright for research into applications of gallium and other low-temperature liquid metals. “Not to take that snowflake metaphor too far, but [this work] really hints at new branches for scientific discovery,” Gaston says.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, December 8, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) today announced that it has partnered with <a href="https://eartharxiv.github.io/index.html">EarthArXiv</a>, which enables authors submitting to <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em> to post preprints with ease. Beginning next year, submitting authors will have the option to automatically forward their manuscript to the EarthArXiv preprint server, directly from our submission system.</p>



<p>PLOS sees preprints as integral to our mission of accelerating progress in scholarly research, and to our goal of increasing adoption of Open Science practices. Authors use preprints to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, and advance their careers. Early, transparent sharing via preprints disseminates new insights faster and increases efficiency across the entire research ecosystem.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Researchers told us they needed a community-recognized solution for sharing preprints when submitting to <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em>. We&rsquo;re thrilled to partner with EarthArXiv &ndash; hosted by the California Digital Library &ndash; to offer these research communities an integrated solution that meets their needs and enhances our author service,&rdquo; said Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions at PLOS.</p>



<p>EarthArXiv is a community-based server, governed by a diverse advisory council with representatives from many regions and institutions, and hosted by the <a href="https://cdlib.org/">California Digital Library (CDL),</a> an organization committed to open scholarship.</p>



<p>Tom Narock, Co-Founder of EarthArXiv and a member of its Advisory Council adds, &ldquo;The EarthArXiv preprint community welcomes PLOS as a new partner. We are excited to combine our joint interests in open-access research publication. Preprints allow colleagues to easily find, use, and review the latest research results. PLOS&rsquo; streamlined integration with EarthArXiv expands our open-access research offerings while making preprinting easier for Earth science researchers.&rdquo;</p>



<p>EarthArXiv is PLOS&rsquo; third preprint server integration. Our previously established partnerships with <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> have shown that preprint posting is a valued author service, and that making preprint sharing easy for authors increases their uptake. PLOS is now expanding the benefits of facilitated posting to more of the researchers and research communities we serve.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/metric-system-prefixes-what-to-know">The metric system is growing. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meet the metric system’s newest prefixes: ronna-, quetta-, ronto- and quecto-.</p>



<p>Adopted November 18 at the 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, ronna- and quetta- <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe exceedingly large numbers</a> while ronto- and quecto- describe the exceedingly small. This is the first time that the International System of Units, or <a href="https://youtu.be/LqFbuRbOUtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SI, has expanded</a> since 1991, when the prefixes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/measuring-superconductor-magnetic-noise">zetta-, yotta-, zepto and yocto-</a> were added (<em>SN: 1/16/93</em>).</p>



<p>Numerically, ronna- is 10<sup>27 </sup>(that’s a digit followed by 27 zeroes) and quetta- is 10<sup>30</sup> (30 zeroes). Their tiny counterparts ronto- and quecto- also refer to 27 and 30 zeroes, but those come after a decimal point. Until now, yotta- and yocto- (24 zeros) capped off the metric system’s range.</p>





<p><em>Science New</em>s spoke with Richard Brown, head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England, about <a href="https://www.npl.co.uk/si-prefix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what the latest SI expansion means for science</a>. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Why do we need the new prefixes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown:</strong> The quantity of data in the world is increasing exponentially. And we expect that to continue to increase and probably accelerate because of quantum computing, digitalization and things like that. At the same time, this quantity of data is starting to get close to the top range of the prefixes we currently use. People start to ask what comes next?</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Where do the prefix names come from?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>About five years ago, I heard a BBC podcast about these new names for quantities of data. And the two that they mentioned were brontobyte and hellabyte. Brontobyte, I think comes from brontosaurus being a big dinosaur and hellabyte comes from “‘hell of a big number.”</p>



<p>The problem with those from a metrology point of view, or measurement point of view, is they start with letters B and H, which already are in use for other units and prefixes. So we can&#8217;t have those as names. [It was clear] that we had to do something official because people were starting to need these prefixes. R and Q are not used for anything else, really, in terms of units or SI prefixes. [The prefix names themselves are] very, very loosely based on the Greek and Latin names for nine and 10.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> How will the prefixes be used?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>The whole point of the International System of Units is it&#8217;s an accepted global system, which if you use, you will be understood.</p>



<p>When you use a prefix with a unit, it means that the number associated with the unit changes. And people like small numbers that they can understand. So you can express the mass of the Earth in terms of ronnagrams; it&#8217;s six ronnagrams. And equally the mass of Jupiter is two quettagrams. Some good examples of [small numbers] are that the mass of an electron is about one rontogram, and the mass of one bit of data as stored on a mobile phone is around one quectogram. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the use of a suitable prefix makes things more understandable. And I think we shouldn&#8217;t forget that even if there&#8217;s not always a direct scientific usage immediately, they will gain traction over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gamma-ray-burst-breaks-rules-kilonova">A bizarre gamma-ray burst breaks the rules for these cosmic eruptions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers have spotted a bright gamma-ray burst that upends previous theories of how these energetic cosmic eruptions occur.</p>



<p>For decades, astronomers thought that GRBs came in two flavors, long and short — that is, lasting longer than two seconds or winking out more quickly. Each type has been linked to different cosmic events. But about a year ago, two NASA space telescopes caught a short GRB in long GRB’s clothing: It lasted a long time but originated from a short GRB source.</p>





<p>“We had this black-and-white vision of the universe,” says astrophysicist Eleonora Troja of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. “This is the red flag that tells us, nope, it’s not. Surprise!”</p>



<p>This burst, called GRB 211211A, is the first that unambiguously breaks the binary, Troja and others report December 7 in five papers in <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Prior to the discovery of this burst, astronomers mostly thought that there were just two ways to produce a GRB. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">collapse of a massive star</a> just before it explodes in a supernova could make a long gamma-ray burst, lasting more than two seconds (<em>SN: 10/28/22</em>). Or a pair of dense stellar corpses called neutron stars could collide, merge and form a new black hole, releasing a short gamma-ray burst of two seconds or less.</p>



<p>But there had been some outliers. A surprisingly short GRB in 2020 seemed to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion">a massive star’s implosion</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/21</em>). And some long-duration GRBs dating back to 2006 lacked a supernova after the fact, raising questions about their origins.</p>



<p>“We always knew there was an overlap,” says astrophysicist Chryssa Kouveliotou of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wrote the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...413L.101K/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1993 paper that introduced the two GRB categories</a>, but was not involved in the new work. “There were some outliers which we did not know how to interpret.”</p>



<p>There’s no such mystery about GRB 211211A: The burst lasted more than 50 seconds and was clearly accompanied by a kilonova, the characteristic glow of new elements being forged after a neutron star smashup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="409" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline.jpg" alt="This shows the glow of a kilonova that followed the oddball gamma-ray burst called GRB 211211A, in images from the Gemini North telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope." class="wp-image-3119969" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline-637x383.jpg 637w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline-309x186.jpg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3119969">This shows the glow of a kilonova that followed the oddball gamma-ray burst called GRB 211211A, in images from the Gemini North telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119969">M. Zamani/International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA, NASA, ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Although we suspected it was possible that extended emission GRBs were mergers … this is the first confirmation,” says astrophysicist Benjamin Gompertz of the University of Birmingham in England, who describes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01819-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observations of the burst</a> in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. “It has the kilonova, which is the smoking gun.”</p>



<p>NASA’s Swift and Fermi space telescopes detected the explosion on December 11, 2021, in a galaxy about 1.1 billion light-years away. “We thought it was a run-of-the-mill long gamma-ray burst,” says astrophysicist Wen-fai Fong of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>





<p>It was relatively close by, as GRBs go. So that allowed Fong’s and Troja’s research groups to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05390-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independently</a> continue closely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05327-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observing</a> the burst in great detail using telescopes on the ground, the teams report in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>As the weeks wore on and no supernova appeared, the researchers grew confused. Their observations revealed that whatever had made the GRB had also emitted much more optical and infrared light than is typical for the source of a long GRB.</p>



<p>After ruling out other explanations, Troja and colleagues compared the burst’s aftereffects with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">first kilonova ever observed in concert with ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). The match was nearly perfect. “That’s when many people got convinced we were talking about a kilonova,” she says.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it feels obvious that it was a kilonova, Troja says. But in the moment, it felt as impossible as seeing a lion in the Arctic. “It looks like a lion, it roars like a lion, but it shouldn’t be here, so it cannot be,” she says. “That’s exactly what we felt.”</p>



<p>Now the question is, what happened? Typically, merging neutron stars collapse into a black hole almost immediately. The gamma rays come from material that is superheated as it falls into the black hole, but the material is scant, and the black hole gobbles it up within two seconds. So how did GRB 211211A keep its light going for almost a minute?</p>



<p>It’s possible that the neutron stars first merged into a single, larger neutron star, which briefly resisted the pressure to collapse into a black hole. That has implications for the fundamental physics that describes how difficult it is to crush neutrons into a black hole, Gompertz says.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that a neutron star collided with a small black hole, about five times the mass of the sun, instead of another neutron star. And the process of the black hole eating the neutron star took longer.</p>



<p>Or it could have been something else entirely: a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05403-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutron star merging with a white dwarf</a>, astrophysicist Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and colleagues suggest in <em>Nature</em>. “We suggest a third type of progenitor, something very different from the previous two types,” he says.</p>



<p>White dwarfs are the remnants of smaller stars like the sun, and are not as dense or compact as neutron stars. A collision between a white dwarf and a neutron star could still produce a kilonova if the white dwarf is very heavy.</p>



<p>The resulting object could be a highly magnetized neutron star called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">magnetar</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). The magnetar could have continued pumping energy into gamma rays and other wavelengths of light, extending the life of the burst, Zhang says.</p>



<p>Whatever its origins, GRB 211211A is a big deal for physics. “It is important because we wanted to understand, what on Earth are these events?” Kouveliotou says.</p>



<p>Figuring out what caused it could illuminate how heavy elements in the universe form. And some previously seen long GRBs that scientists thought were from supernovas might actually be actually from mergers.</p>



<p>To learn more, scientists need to find more of these binary-busting GRBs, plus observations of gravitational waves at the same time. Trejo thinks they’ll be able to get that when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, comes back online in 2023.</p>



<p>“I hope that LIGO will produce some evidence,” Kouveliotou says. “Nature might be graceful and give us a couple of these events with gravitational wave counterparts, and maybe [help us] understand what’s going on.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope brought us new views of the cosmos</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This year marked the end of a decades-long wait for astronomers. The James Webb Space Telescope is finally in action.</p>



<p>The telescope, which launched in December 2021, released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first science data in July</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>) and immediately began surpassing astronomers’ expectations.</p>



<p>“We’ve realized that James Webb is 10 times more sensitive than we predicted” for some kinds of observations, says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. His team released in September the telescope’s first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">direct image of an exoplanet</a> (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>). He credits “the people who worked so hard to get this right, to launch something the size of a tennis court into space on a rocket and get this sensitive machinery to work perfectly. And I feel incredibly lucky to be the beneficiary of this.”</p>





<p>The telescope, also known as JWST, was designed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">to see further back into the history of the cosmos</a> than ever before (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>). It’s bigger and more sensitive than its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. And because it looks in much longer wavelengths of light, JWST can observe distant and veiled objects that were previously hidden.</p>



<p>JWST spent its first several months collecting “early-release” science data, observations that test the different ways the telescope can see. “It is a very, very new instrument,” says Lamiya Mowla, an astronomer at the University of Toronto. “It will take some time before we can characterize all the different observation modes of all four instruments that are on board.”</p>



<p>That need for testing plus the excitement has led to some confusion for astronomers in these heady early days. Data from the telescope had been in such high demand that the operators hadn’t yet calibrated all the detectors before releasing data. The JWST team is providing calibration information so researchers can properly analyze the data. “We knew calibration issues were going to happen,” Mowla says.</p>



<p>The raw numbers that scientists have pulled out of some of the initial images may end up being revised slightly. But the pictures themselves are real and reliable, even though it takes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-challenges-artists-see-infrared">some artistry</a> to translate the telescope’s infrared data into colorful visible light (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>The stunning photos that follow are a few of the early greatest hits from the shiny new observatory.</p>



<h4>Deep space</h4>

<p>JWST has captured the deepest views yet of the universe (above). Galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 (bluer galaxies) is 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. It acts as a giant cosmic lens, letting JWST zoom in on thousands of even more distant galaxies that shone 13 billion years ago (the redder, more stretched galaxies). The far-off galaxies look different in the mid-infrared light (above left) captured by the telescope’s MIRI instrument than they do in the near-infrared light (above right) captured by NIRCam. The first tracks dust; the second, starlight. Early galaxies have stars but very little dust.</p>



<h4>Rings around Neptune</h4>

<p>JWST was built to peer over vast cosmic distances, but it also provides new glimpses at our solar system neighbors. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">pic of Neptune</a> was the first close look at its delicate-looking rings in over 30 years (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 5</em>).</p>



<h4>Under pressure</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1022" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3119904" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-562x383.jpg 562w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-660x450.jpg 660w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-273x186.jpg 273w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-851x580.jpg 851w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-1139x776.jpg 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3119904">NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The rings in this astonishing image are not an optical illusion. They’re made of dust, and a new ring is added every eight years when the two stars in the center of the image come close to each other. One of the stars is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is in the final stages of its life and puffing out dust. The cyclical dusty eruptions allowed scientists to directly measure for the first time <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-stars-space-starlight-stardust-astronomy">how pressure from starlight pushes dust around</a> (<em>SN: 11/19/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<h4>Galaxy hit-and-run</h4>

<p>With JWST’s unprecedented sensitivity, astronomers plan to compare the earliest galaxies with more modern galaxies to figure out how galaxies grow and evolve. This galactic smashup, whose main remnant is known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-cartwheel-galaxy-image">the Cartwheel galaxy</a>, shows a step in that epic process (<em>SN Online: 8/3/22</em>). The large central galaxy (right in the above composite) has been pierced through the middle by a smaller one that fled the scene (not in view). The Hubble Space Telescope previously snapped a visible light image of the scene (top half). But with its infrared eyes, JWST has revealed much more structure and complexity in the galaxy’s interior (bottom half).</p>

<p>The gas giant HIP 65426b was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">first exoplanet</a> to have its portrait taken by JWST&nbsp;(each inset shows the planet in a different wavelength of light; the star symbol shows the location of the planet’s parent star). This image, released by astronomer Sasha Hinkley and colleagues, doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other spectacular space vistas from JWST. But it will give clues to what the planet’s atmosphere is made of and shows the telescope’s potential for doing more of this sort of work on even smaller, rocky exoplanets (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brewing-yeast-ancestor-ireland-beer">The ancestor to modern brewing yeast has been found hiding in Ireland</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1516, the duchy of Bavaria in Germany imposed a law on its beer brewers meant to reserve ingredients like wheat and rye for the baking of bread. The decree restricted brewers to using only barley, hops, water and yeast to make their libations, and set the prices for beer depending on the time of year. The law inadvertently limited brewing to the winter, which favored a cold-tolerant yeast called <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>, which brews lager, over the more common <em>S. cerevisiae, </em>which brews ale<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>S. pastorianus </em>is a hybrid, produced from the mating of <em>S. cerevisiae </em>with another yeast called <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Despite lager’s European origins, <em>S. eubayanus </em>hadn’t actually been found there and was only first discovered in 2011, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lagers-mystery-ingredient-found">in the Patagonia region of South America</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/11</em>). Now, thanks to a research project carried out by undergraduate students, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/femsyr/foac053" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>S. eubayanus</em> has been found living in European soil</a> — fittingly, in the beer-loving nation of Ireland.</p>





<p>“Since the discovery of <em>S. eubayanus</em> [more than] 10 years ago, it’s been a fun puzzle putting together where the species is actually found,” says Quinn Langdon, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>A leading theory is that <em>S. eubayanus</em> originated in Patagonia and then spread around the world, eventually mating with <em>S. cerevisiae </em>in European breweries to make <em>S. pastorianus</em>.</p>



<p>Geraldine Butler, a geneticist at University College Dublin and leader of the project, always thought that teaching genome-sequencing techniques by having students scour soils for yeast could turn up <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Still, she says, she couldn’t contain her excitement when she saw the first hint of the microbe. “I was sitting by the sequencer waiting for the results to come out,” she says.</p>



<p>One of Butler’s students, Stephen Allen, found two local strains of <em>S. eubayanus</em> hiding in plain sight on the Belfield campus of University College Dublin. The team has since gone back and found the yeast again, Butler says, suggesting that there is a stable population of the yeast living in the Irish soil.</p>



<p>The new discovery was published December 7 in <em>FEMS Yeast Research</em>.</p>



<p>Butler hopes this discovery will brew interest elsewhere in Europe to search for <em>S. eubayanus</em>, including in Bavaria, where lager brewing is thought to have first started. She is also looking for commercial partners to try making beer with the Irish strains.</p>



<p>Langdon isn’t confident that the new microbes will lead to tasty brews because there are other <em>S. eubayanus </em>strains that don’t grow well on maltose, the sugar that needs to be digested by yeasts during the brewing process. Still, Langdon says, “it’d be fun to brew with them.”</p>





<p>Whether the newly discovered Irish strains of <em>S. pastorianus</em>’ missing parent taste good or not, there’s no denying that their discovery helps solve a little piece of the puzzle of lager brewing’s origins. That 16th century shift from <em>S. cerevisiae</em> to <em>S. pastorianus</em> led to a global shift that continues to this day — more than 90 percent of beer sold worldwide today is lager.</p>



<p>Fungi are the “forgotten kingdom,” Langdon says, not getting as much attention as plants or animals, despite playing an outsize role in human history. “Yeasts are just single cells living in the soil, and they’re doing really important things.”</p>
