                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="480" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations-1024x480.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131643" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations-1024x480.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations-300x141.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations-768x360.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/irrelevant-citations.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>A paper that <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/01/28/veziroglu-journal-of-papermill-energy/">made the rounds</a> last year for its blatantly “irrelevant” citations has now been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier’s <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> published “Origin of the distinct site occupations of H atom in hcp Ti and Zr/Hf” in November 2024.</p>



<p>Paragraph seven of the introduction consists of a single sentence: “As strongly requested by the reviewers, here we cite some references [35-47] although they are completely irrelevant to the present work.” One of the authors told us they included the references as a “joke” after reviewers pressured them.</p>



<p>All 13 of the references include Sergei Trukhanov as an author, and all but one also includes Alex Trukhanov.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131632"></span>



<p>According to his most recent paper, <a href="https://vestnik.vstu.by/eng/editorial_committee/truhanov-av/">Alex Trukhanov</a> is affiliated with the Scientific-Practical Materials Research Centre of NAS of Belarus in Minsk. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-4371">Sergei Trukhanov</a> is listed as a researcher at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow on his most recent paper. Neither responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319924043957">retraction notice</a>, “the authors were requested by two of the reviewers to insert redundant references. The peer review process is deemed to have been compromised.” The notice also states the reviewers responsible for the citation prompting have been removed from the “journal database, so that they cannot review papers in the future.”</p>



<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0810-8847">Qing-Miao Hu</a>, one of the corresponding authors of the paper and a professor at the Institute of Metal Research Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang, told us in an email he did not want to speculate who the reviewers were. “There are quite a few such kind of reviewers, and the authors suffer from them a lot in recent years,” Hu added.</p>



<p>Hu said the reviewers asked the researchers to add the citations during their second round of edits. He said the phrasing was “to make a joke with the reviewers,” and that they didn’t expect the manuscript “with such a statement” to be accepted for publication. “We were annoyed but did not felt [sic] pressured to add the citation,” Hu said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us they were “currently investigating this matter and cannot comment on open investigations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> has appeared in Retraction Watch before. In 2023, we reported the journal was one of a handful that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">published papers by an apparently nonexistent author</a>. In 2017, the journal retracted several papers over <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/21/elsevier-retracting-26-papers-accepted-fake-reviews/">fake peer reviews</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors have already resubmitted the paper to the same journal, Hu said, and agreed with the retraction “because it was indeed published without a normal peer review.”</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Audio summaries are coming to arXiv! arXiv has partnered with </span><a href="http://www.sciencecast.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScienceCast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a pilot project to bring 60-second AI-generated audio summaries to arxiv.org. This follows our efforts to make arXiv’s scientific content even more broadly available by supporting additional formats beyond PDF, starting with HTML versions of recent papers, which we </span><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/12/21/accessibility-update-arxiv-now-offers-papers-in-html-format/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">began rolling out in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pilot project with ScienceCast is initially limited to a small subset of arXiv papers, namely those in the astro-ph.HE category. However, we expect that it will be rolled out to more categories, and that other forms of audio content will be supported in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScienceCast has a long-standing relationship with arXiv, and has successfully partnered on a </span><a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/news/2023/11/08/summaries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar pilot with bioRxiv since November 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their AI-driven platform allows authors to create audio and visual enhancements for their scientific papers. They became an </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXivLabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collaborator in 2022, making ScienceCast content discoverable on arXiv through the “Code, Data, Media” tab on the abstract page. This new project with ScienceCast automatically generates 60-second audio summaries for select arXiv preprints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“arXiv’s overarching mission is to ensure science is open to all, and available to everyone,” said Ramin Zabih, arXiv Faculty Director and Professor of Computer Science, Cornell Tech. “The arXiv repository hosts over 2.6 million articles, and is a crucial resource for many fields of science including CS, math and physics. This partnership between ScienceCast and arXiv is an opportunity to break down another barrier that researchers face in keeping up with discoveries both inside and outside of their field. Audio summaries can help a broader audience engage with new research.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At ScienceCast, we believe that making science more accessible makes science better,” said Erin Sharoni, CEO of ScienceCast. “We’re excited about this partnership with arXiv which reflects our mission to remove friction from research workflows and enable anyone, from scientific experts to science enthusiasts, to engage with new knowledge and contribute to novel discoveries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio summaries are currently only available in </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.HE/recent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high energy astrophysics (astro-ph.HE)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new papers, produced from TeX, posted to arXiv on or after December 1, 2024. Audio summaries are automatically generated shortly after each new paper is posted to arXiv, and a link to them will be available in a menu on the paper’s abstract page.</span></p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Xinge Tong will talk about her PhD work in the presentation entitled &quot;Exploring the Use of Online Reviews in the Development of Video Game&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that online game reviews can play an important role in both
reflecting game-player experiences and influencing business decisions regarding future
video game development. Some studies have analysed different approaches to processing game
reviews in the context of video game data development to assess their practical efficacy.
However, most works in the field of game studies seem to rely on qualitative analysis
approaches and software-related tools. These not only consume time and human resources but
might also raise concerns about the difference in the focus of entertainment between
software and games. The study described in this presentation sets out to explore the
possibility of introducing natural language processing (NLP) into game review studies. It
was noted that game reviews on Steam are a rich and valuable source. One of the main
challenges of using NLP to process game reviews is how to extract effectively the
diversity of meaning and accurately summarises the views of players. This study focuses on
the accurate filtering of useful feedback information that is based on different contexts,
the evaluation of user feedback, and the formulation of appropriate and effective game
development strategies that incorporate this feedback. The main contribution of this study
is the exploration and development of an NLP-based game review analysis system that: a) is
able to process both topic and sentiment classification, b) makes highly accurate
predictions and classifications to reviews by adopting advanced machine learning models
with training on a newly produced game specific dataset, c) can be adopted and
incorporated to the practical video game development lifecycle to process various tasks
and meet developers’ diverse needs.</p>

<p>The Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences in India has been on our radar for a while. So when we got word the university’s channel on an open access journal platform disappeared, we were curious what might be going on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just this year, we reported Saveetha was among <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/10/bibliometrics-universities-publication-metrics-authorship/">14 universities with “questionable publication practices,”</a> defined as unusually fast growth in research output, as measured by published journal articles.</p>



<p>Our 2023 investigation into Saveetha’s dental school uncovered <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">an elaborate self-citation scheme</a>: Undergraduates write manuscripts as part of their exams; student and faculty reviewers then insert scores of citations to papers by Saveetha faculty to inflate the university’s citation rankings.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131626"></span>



<p>That year we also reported the school offered an adjunct position — and payment — to a prominent economist in exchange for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/21/exclusive-researcher-outs-indian-universitys-publishing-scam-after-it-fails-to-pay-him/">adding his Saveetha affiliation to his papers</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, we reported on the flood of <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise">low quality, AI-generated commentaries</a> overwhelming journals’ manuscript pipeline. Our investigation found Saveetha authors had published more than 1,200 letters, comments and editorials in 2024, a ninefold increase from the year before.&nbsp; And Saveetha topped the list of author affiliations on retracted papers from <em>Neurosurgical Review</em>, a Springer Nature title working to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/10/as-springer-nature-journal-clears-ai-papers-one-universitys-retractions-rise-drastically/">clear its catalog of AI-generated articles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given what our past reporting turned up, when bibliometrics expert Reese Richardson wrote to tell us the Saveetha’s channel at <em>Cureus</em>, part of Springer Nature, <a href="https://www.cureus.com/channels/simats/about">has disappeared</a>, it seemed worth a closer look.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Channels on the publishing platform enable “channel members to publish peer-reviewed articles, as well as post meeting abstracts, posters, announcements and other content produced by channel members, staff, residents, and/or students,” according to <a href="https://www.cureus.com/academic_channels_guide#!/overview/introduction">a guide</a> on the <em>Cureus</em> website. Institutions pay a fee to have a <em>Cureus</em> channel.</p>



<p>So, did <em>Cureus</em> take down Saveetha’s channel for all its ties to questionable citation practices? Did the publisher audit all channels and remove those with unusual activity?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The response from a <em>Cureus</em> spokesperson:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The channel was closed on March 18<sup>th</sup> because of non-payment of fees. No other channels were removed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saveetha didn’t pay its bill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Richardson, who’s at Northwestern University and worked with us on the 2024 investigation, maintains there should be more quality control on <em>Cureus</em>’ part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Cureus&#8217; response implies that had Saveetha continued to pay their fee, they would have kept their channel. This suggests profound inattentiveness towards publication ethics by Cureus and, by extension, Springer Nature. Saveetha has been implicated in systematic abuses of publication ethics and integrity many times now, including through this backdoor channel in Cureus. Cureus&#8217; channel system should be dismantled entirely, especially if Cureus will continue to allow universities gaming their metrics to appoint their own editorial officers so long as they pay their fees on time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The managing editors and entire editorial board of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213870"><em>Mathematical Logic Quarterly</em></a>, a Wiley title, have resigned, citing “unilateral decisions” by the publisher “that affected the editorial process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do not believe that Wiley is currently providing an environment that allows the editors to do their editorial work according to the standards of the academic community and free from the negative influence of commercial and profit-oriented interests,” the editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mlq_wiley_openletter.pdf">wrote in their resignation letter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors have launched a new journal with a “diamond” open-access model, not charging fees to read or publish papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131618"></span>



<p>“We are always proud to partner with the academic community to deliver high-quality scholarship that moves the world forward,” a Wiley spokesperson said in a statement. “We regretfully accept these resignations and wish the former editors success in their new endeavor.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal is the latest of many additions to our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a>, which documents walkouts and resignations at nearly two dozen journals since 2023, often citing tensions between academic editors and for-profit publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The resignations include all 20 members of the editorial board, as well as managing editor Deirdre Haskell, who is listed as the managing editor of the newly announced journal. The other two managing editors, Manuel Bodirsky and Klaus Meer, are still under contract but will resign as soon as their contract allows, the letter stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The German-language mathematical society Deutsche Vereinigung für Mathematische Logik und für Grundlagenforschung der exakten Wissenschaften (<a href="https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/spag/ml/DVMLG/overview.html">DVMLG</a>) has had a publishing agreement with Wiley for the journal since 2010. The <a href="https://www.dvmlg.de/documents/dvmlg_wiley_openletter.pdf">society has also informed the publisher</a> it will not renew the agreement ending this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley acquired the journal in 1999, and the society has nominated the journal’s editors since 2011.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The editors and managing editors of <em>MLQ</em> reported that the attitudes and procedures of Wiley have changed considerably in the last few years and that commercial and profit-oriented interests are now influencing the editorial process negatively,” the letter stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letters of the DVMLG and resigning editors share language on how they believe scientific publishing should work, such as making research results free to read and publish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both groups state they believe the editorial process should be controlled by “an editorial team consisting of members of the academic research community that are entirely free from pressure or influence of commercial and profit-oriented interests.” Publishers, they write, should “provide the editorial team with an environment that efficiently assists them in their task and conforms to the specifications of the academic research community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is a tension between the interests of commercial and profit-oriented publishers and the main purposes of academic publishing,” both letters stated. “A cooperation of the academic community with a commercial, profit-oriented publisher is only fruitful if the publisher respects the expectations and demands of the academic community.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The name of the new journal, <a href="https://zml.international/"><em>ZML: Zeitschrift für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik</em></a>, hearkens back to the original name of <em>Mathematical Logic Quarterly</em> at its founding in 1955, according to information provided by <a href="https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/index.html">Benedikt Löwe</a>, a former managing editor who will serve as coordinating editor of the new title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cambridge University Library will provide indexing, digital hosting and preservation, and assign an ISSN and DOIs to <em>ZML</em>’s papers, <a href="https://zml.international/files/zml-open-letter.pdf">according to the letter announcing the journal’s launch</a>. Some members of the editorial board are financing the journal’s management, typesetting and submission system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We, the editors of ZML, support true open access removing all barriers to access,” according to the letter. The journal will publish papers and make them available to read for free. The editors write they “believe that the scientific content of research journals must be under the sole control of the academic community and should be free from any commercial or profit-oriented influence.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A prominent Italian pharmacologist under investigation for embezzlement and rigging university contracts has garnered a dozen and a half retractions in the last year for image alterations and duplications.</p>



<p>But Salvatore Cuzzocrea, the former rector of the University of Messina, told us he did not agree with the retractions because they were decided “without clear communication,” and that none of the papers had problems that he wasn’t able to reply to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cuzzocrea, a professor of pharmacology at Messina, is <a href="https://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2025/03/24/news/messina_ex_rettore_cuzzocrea_rinviato_a_giudizio_abuso_ufficio_turbativa_d_asta-424083065/">set to face an Italian court</a> over rigging bids for university contracts and is <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2023/10/06/news/cuzzocrea_rettore_universita_rimborsi_dimissioni-417085837/">under investigation</a> for allegedly embezzling more than 2 million euros worth of reimbursements.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131597"></span>



<p>Cuzzocrea said he has had “very few” publications corrected and retracted: “I’m saying ‘very few’ because I published more than 900 papers, and I have only 70 with some problem, and only eight or nine were retracted.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In reality, <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCuzzocrea%252c%2bSalvatore">18 of his</a> <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCuzzocrea%252c%2bS">papers</a> have been retracted since January last year, and 179 <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=salvatore+cuzzocrea">have been flagged</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=S+Cuzzocrea">on PubPeer</a>. Critics have pointed to image overlap, manipulation, and duplication across multiple articles. So far, the issues raised span papers published over the past three decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611345/">a 1999 paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Pineal Research,</em> a figure purporting to show “COX-2 staining” had also been used in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014299999002009?via%3Dihub">a paper published the same year</a> in the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em> to show “nitrotyrosine staining.” An anonymous commenter on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E4BA8543CC44188BA2445BF3BC6F4">spotted the discrepancy</a> in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice from the <em>Journal of Pineal Research</em>, the data Cuzzocrea sent to the editors at their request “was insufficient to address the concerns.” The journal said it had “lost trust in the accuracy and integrity of the overall body of data presented in the article and consider its conclusions invalid.”</p>



<p>The article in the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EB385F726AD797B2A05F20901A38F3#1">also flagged on PubPeer</a>, appears to contain additional problems, including spliced images in Western blots and duplication of lanes from unrelated studies. One lane appears to be reproduced from a 1998 paper in <em>Immunology</em>;&nbsp; other images show cells that seem to be duplicated from a different investigation published two years earlier, according to the anonymous data sleuth on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em>, said: “We are aware of the allegations made against Cuzzocrea and an investigation is currently ongoing.”</p>



<p>In several of Cuzzocrea’s retractions, the notices state journal editors engaged with the authors, but the explanations fell short of addressing their concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked why he thought the editors deemed the explanations “insufficient,” Cuzzocrea told us spotting duplications was harder 20 years ago. When he received draft manuscripts as senior author of the publications, he said, he didn’t remember the same images from three months or a year before. “If a postdoc, or a guy from another department made a picture from the same slide,” he said, “how can I understand? Especially because we don’t have, at that stage, artificial intelligence that can help us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In two other retractions, <a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/sj.bjp.0703695">both for papers published</a> <a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/sj.bjp.0704463">in 2009</a> in the <em>British Journal of Pharmacology</em>, the editors found the data had appeared elsewhere in a “different scientific context.” However, because of the time since publication, the authors were “unable to retrieve the full set of original data, and the data provided was found insufficient to address the concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cuzzocrea referred us to guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics that encourage investigators to retain data for only 10 years following publication. But according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124122546/https://publicationethics.org/files/u7141/1999pdf13.pdf">COPE Guidelines for Good Publication Practice</a>, a principal investigator’s responsibility for long term retention of data “may be up to 15 years.” <a href="https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf">(Guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a> recommends 10 years for medical publications.)</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Of the 150-plus papers flagged on PubPeer, Cuzzocrea has personally responded to comments on two. “I don&#8217;t like people that don&#8217;t show their face,” Cuzzocrea said of PubPeer. “I don’t trust this website.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one post, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E0F176A11ED830E9075C4D4929FE6E">he agreed</a> his lab flipped an image, and said he requested a correction to be issued (<a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2020/09000/activation_of_sphingosine_1_phosphate_receptor.17.aspx">none has yet appeared</a>).&nbsp; In another, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FEE7BAEF9972CD49A1D034FDFCE652#8">he responded at length</a> to an anonymous comment that <a href="https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/abstract/2004/01000/protective_effects_of_m40401,_a_selective.23.aspx">a 2004 article in <em>Critical Care Medicine</em></a> contained the same micrograph as one published <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/mol.61.5.997">two years earlier in <em>Molecular Pharmacology</em></a>, despite describing different experimental conditions. In this response, he partly attributed the problem to a histologist involved in both studies, and stated he had contacted the journal to correct the images. None appears to have been issued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The question is, if we have nine authors in the publication, why is it my fault?” he told us. “I didn’t publish by myself, I submitted the manuscripts, the manuscript goes through a peer review process, maybe that in one journal was rejected, and then I sent to another one, and then to another one, maybe it was seen by seven referees, and three editors. At the end, it was published, nobody saw the problem for 20 years?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Cuzzocrea admitted problems “could be possible” in the papers: “I’m not saying that I’m perfect. But if you take the fact that there are retracted papers in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>, in top journals, it means it was not possible for senior authors to understand, to look at everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven of Cuzzocrea’s intact articles flagged on PubPeer appear in the <em>FASEB Journal</em>. Darla Henderson, FASEB Publications’ research integrity officer, said the journal has looked at all seven of the papers and four &#8220;have been through our full process with corrections issued, sometimes with images included,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The other 3 cases remain open, and we are following COPE processes and guidelines.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In October 2023, Cuzzocrea resigned from his position as rector of the University of Messina, and also from his presidency at the Conference of Italian University Rectors. “There was a sort of newspaper attack,” he told us.“And I decided to defend myself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Around that time, news broke that Cuzzocrea was <a href="https://messina.gazzettadelsud.it/articoli/cronaca/2024/11/26/caso-cuzzocrea-la-procura-di-messina-chiede-una-proroga-di-6-mesi-7897b041-6755-4ea7-991e-00d5ccaa848a/">under investigation</a> by the Italian Prosecutor’s Office <a href="https://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/12160">following an audit request</a> to several regional authorities from another Italian university leader. Italian scientist and pseudonymous sleuth Aneurus Inconstans <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/10/16/cuzzocreas-magnificent-fall/">reported on the resignation</a> at the time. The investigation centers on more than 2 million euros in reimbursements tied to Cuzzocrea. According to local media reports, the reimbursements were purportedly used to cover research materials, and amounted to about 40,000 euros per month. He said he resigned as “a sort of respect for the institution,” not because he thought he did anything wrong. Cuzzocrea is also now facing a trial <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/03/24/messina-ex-rettore-cuzzocrea-rinviato-a-giudizio-appalti-senza-gara/7926532/">for allegedly awarding contracts without a contract selection process.</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cuzzocrea is still a professor of pharmacology at the university, and <a href="https://www.messinatoday.it/cronaca/incarico-cuzzocrea-ministro-bernini-rettore-ex.html">as of last year</a>, was appointed as an advisor to the Italian Ministry of University and Research by the minister.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He is also among the Italian researchers included in the <a href="https://journal.topitalianscientists.org/Main_Page"><em>Top Italian Scientists Journal</em></a>, a publication that started last January. <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/06/26/top-italian-scientists/">As Aneurus Inconstans reported</a>, the journal includes researchers in the country who have a h-index – a measure of research performance – higher than 30. Cuzzocrea is on the editorial board of the journal, and is named as a “Top Italian Scientist” in biomedical sciences.&nbsp;</p>
