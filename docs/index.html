<p>A highly cited economics paper that suggested people raised during recessions were more likely to vote for left-leaning political parties has been retracted, apparently due to a coding error that rendered the results invalid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction marks a rarity among economics papers, which research has shown are infrequently retracted compared to papers on other subjects. The article appears to be the first in <em>The Review of Economic Studies</em> to have been retracted for a reason other than publisher error.</p>



<p>The study’s authors, Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo, are economists at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles and the International Monetary Fund, respectively. Giuliano is also the Chauncey J. Medberry Chair in Management at UCLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper,<a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/81/2/787/1520611?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> “Growing up in a Recession,”</a> was published in November 2013. It has been cited 222 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/political-efficacy-and-participation_4548cad8-en">Working</a> <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/an-updated-oecd-framework-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-to-meet-current-and-future-challenges_b6c5478c-en">papers</a> from the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37569">World</a> <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36913">Bank</a> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have also cited the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126415"></span>



<p>The paper was retracted on January 11. According to the retraction notice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors and editorial team are retracting this article because the original findings cannot be replicated, likely as a result of an inadvertent coding error. While the original codes and data sets are no longer available, new analysis with a markedly similar data set does not support the original results.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the paper’s authors nor the editors of the journal responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023060848id_/http://www.anderson.ucla.edu:80/faculty/paola.giuliano/Recession_RESTUD.pdf">study</a> has received a fair amount of media attention. An article in<a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/12/03/study_recession_could_create_a_generation_of_democrats_partner/"> <em>Salon</em></a>, published soon after the final version of the study, was titled, “Has the recession spawned a generation of Democrats?” An earlier, working version of the article available in 2009 sparked an opinion piece in the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/opinion/30douthat.html"> <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>from conservative columnist Ross Douthat. More recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/15/the-2000-stimulus-cheques-alone-wont-work-the-us-needs-better-infrastructure">articles</a> have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-covid-19-led-to-donald-trumps-defeat-150110">cited the study</a> in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. government’s response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retractions from economics journals have been rarer than for some other subjects, such as the biomedical sciences. A<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/12/12/why-arent-there-more-retractions-in-business-and-economics-journals/"> 2012 study</a> examining retractions of economics papers for plagiarism found only six going back to 2009. But the Retraction Watch Database shows that around 700 economics papers were retracted between 2013 and December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion of the retraction on Twitter was mixed. Economist Florian Ederer<a href="https://twitter.com/florianederer/status/1613112047926902786"> </a>applauded the authors for retracting the paper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Others were more critical of the retraction notice, particularly the assertion that the code used in the study no longer exists.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t really understand the reason,” wrote Tim Martens, an assistant professor of accounting at Bocconi University in Italy, in a<a href="https://twitter.com/econ_martens/status/1613116811079258113"> reply to Ederer’s tweet</a>. “Did their dogs eat the code?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hydrogel-electronics-nanostructure-materials">Want a ‘Shrinky Dinks’ approach to nano-sized devices? Try hydrogels</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-tech shrink art may be the key to making tiny electronics, 3-D nanostructures or even holograms for hiding secret messages.</p>



<p>A new approach to making tiny structures relies on <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrinking them down after building them</a>, rather than making them small to begin with, researchers report in the Dec. 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The key is spongelike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breakup-doesnt-keep-hydrogel-down">hydrogel materials</a> that expand or contract in response to surrounding chemicals (<em>SN: 1/20/10</em>). By inscribing patterns in hydrogels with a laser and then shrinking the gels down to about one-thirteenth their original size, the researchers created patterns with details as small as 25 billionths of a meter across.</p>





<p>At that level of precision, the researchers could create letters small enough to easily write this entire article along the circumference of a typical human hair.</p>



<p>Biological scientist Yongxin Zhao and colleagues deposited a variety of materials in the patterns to create nanoscopic images of Chinese zodiac animals. By shrinking the hydrogels after laser etching, several of the images ended up roughly the size of a red blood cell. They included a monkey made of silver, a gold-silver alloy pig, a titanium dioxide snake, an iron oxide dog and a rabbit made of luminescent nanoparticles.</p>

The red stripes on the left dragon are each just 200 nanometers thick.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120791">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Carnegie Mellon University</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Because the hydrogels can be repeatedly shrunk and expanded with chemical baths, the researchers were also able to create holograms in layers inside a chunk of hydrogel to encode secret information. Shrinking a hydrogel hologram makes it unreadable. “If you want to read it, you have to expand the sample,” says Zhao, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “But you need to expand it to exactly the same extent” as the original. In effect, knowing how much to expand the hydrogel serves as a key to unlock the information hidden inside. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the most exciting aspect of the research, Zhao says, is the wide range of materials that researchers can use on such minute scales. “We will be able to combine different types of materials together and make truly functional nanodevices.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-microbes-eat-virus-virovory-algae">Scientists have found the first known microbes that can eat only viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>New Year, new viral diet — literally.</p>



<p>Tiny, pond-dwelling <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215000120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Halteria</em> ciliates are virovores</a>, able to survive on a virus-only diet, researchers report December 27 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The single-celled creatures are the first known to thrive when viruses alone are on the menu.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that some microscopic organisms snack on aquatic viruses such as chloroviruses, which infect and kill algae. But it was unclear whether viruses alone could provide enough nutrients for an organism to grow and reproduce, says ecologist John DeLong of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>





<p>In laboratory experiments, <em>Halteria</em> that were living in water droplets and given only chloroviruses for sustenance reproduced, DeLong and colleagues found. As the number of viruses in the water dwindled, <em>Halteria</em> numbers went up. Ciliates without access to viral morsels, or any other food, didn’t multiply. But <em>Paramecium</em>, a larger microbe, didn’t thrive on a virus-only diet, hinting that viruses can’t satisfy the nutritional requirements for all ciliates to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Viruses could be a good source of phosphorus, which is essential for making copies of genetic material, DeLong says. But it probably takes a lot of viruses to account for a full meal.</p>



<p>In the lab, each <em>Halteria</em> microbe ate about 10,000 to 1 million viruses daily, the team estimates. <em>Halteria</em> in small ponds with abundant viral snacks might chow down on about a quadrillion viruses per day.</p>



<p>These feasts could shunt previously unrecognized energy into the food web, and add a new layer to the way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-plankton-held-hostage-pirate-viruses">viruses move carbon</a> through an ecosystem — if it happens in the wild, DeLong says (<em>SN: 6/9/16</em>). His team plans to start finding out once ponds in Nebraska thaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There shouldn’t have been many differences between the women recruited for the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14767058.2015.1011121?journalCode=ijmf20">three</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767058.2016.1192601">clinical</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-015-3911-y">trials</a>: All of them gave birth at the same two Cairo hospitals over a period of less than three years, and all of them were treated to prevent or manage postpartum bleeding. Three samples from this pool of patients, Ben Mol felt, should have had largely similar baseline characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, mysteriously, the women’s mean age and BMI varied markedly across the studies—from 25 to 34 years and from 25 to 29 kg/m2, respectively—as did the birthweight of their babies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the researcher turned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">data sleuth</a> began digging. His worries only grew. Eventually, he would come to question the integrity of <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">nearly two dozen randomized controlled trials</a> led by Ahmed Maged, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Egypt&#8217;s top medical school, Kasr AlAiny at Cairo University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, based in part on Mol’s findings, two journals published by Taylor &amp; Francis have issued a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">retraction</a> and nine expressions of concern for the following papers:</p>

</ul>



<p>&#8220;What we see here, nine expressions of concern in one month, is really a breakthrough,&#8221; Ben Mol, who leads the Evidence-based Women’s Health Care research group at Monash University, in Australia, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Among these titles, there are papers that inform the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, which is maternal-mortality cause number one around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This stuff ends up in <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011689.pub2/full">meta-analyses</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This is the first time a journal has publicly expressed concern over Maged’s work. Mol, however, has taken aim at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">research</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/10/critics-face-legal-threats-as-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-act/">from</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/">Egypt</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/15/how-journal-editors-kept-questionable-data-about-womens-health-out-of-the-literature-years-before-retractions/">several</a> times before, using statistical techniques and simple reasoning to flag potential fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor and publisher of <em>The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care</em>, which retracted a 2018 report by Maged and his colleagues titled “Benefits of vaginal misoprostol prior to IUD insertion in women with previous caesarean delivery: a randomised controlled trial,” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2022.2156744">state</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, significant concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data and reported results in the article. While the authors have fully cooperated with the investigation and provided information in response to our queries, they have not been able to adequately address the concerns raised. As we cannot verify the validity of the published work, we are therefore retracting the article. The authors listed in this publication have been informed, and they do not agree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science; the nine papers that earned expressions of concern from <em>The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine</em> have been cited 86 times in total. </p>



<p>In each of these nine cases, the journal notes that the authors have provided their raw data, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have also referred concerns about this paper to the authors’ institution, in order to conduct a full investigation. As this investigation may take some time to resolve, we advise readers to interpret the information presented in the article with due caution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sabina Alam, director of Publishing Ethics and Integrity at Taylor &amp; Francis, told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction and expressions of concern notices have come about as a result of an investigation being carried out by my Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity team. This investigation does stem partly from concerns raised by Ben Mol about specific papers, but also partly from issues raised through internal audits of our journals. We take cases of unethical conduct very seriously and comply fully with COPE guidelines in any investigation we undertake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added that her team nearly doubled in size last year, reflecting a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">growing industry trend</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis has been investing in resources for ethics and integrity so that my team is now able to lead all large or complex ethics cases, like this one. This brings more expertise and consistency to the investigations and subsequent resolutions of such cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expressions of concern include two of the three studies of women with postpartum bleeding. The third was published in the Springer journal <em>Maternal-Fetal Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol emailed Maged with his concerns in the summer of 2020, two months before he and his colleagues submitted <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">the paper</a> detailing their findings to the <em>American Journal of Perinatology</em>. Later, he also shared his misgivings with the 13 journals that have published the dozens of reports spawned by Maged&#8217;s clinical trials. So far, Taylor &amp; Francis is the only publisher to have taken visible measures as a result.</p>



<p>Maged has defended his work vociferously on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Ahmed+M.+Maged%22">PubPeer</a>, but appears to have offered little by way of evidence or scientific explanations. Instead, in an August email to Monash that Retraction Watch has seen, he accused Mol of &#8220;racist behavior&#8221; and &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; He sounded the same notes in an email to Retraction Watch, adding several unsubstantiated claims and noting that he and his coauthors:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… completely refused the retraction as no evidence that require retraction was proved by either the complainer or the editor. The authors believe that if all these issues undergo a fair, ethical, and unbiased investigations, the journal will withdraw the retraction and expression of concerns.</p>



<p>Wait for the new evidence and changes of these decisions within the near time</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mol told Retraction Watch what drives him “is that I&#8217;m very concerned actually about the impact [scientific misconduct] has on the outcomes of meta-analyses and therefore guidelines all around the world.”</p>



<p>He believes fraud is much more widespread in the literature than most people realize and that blindly trusting the data is a risky proposition:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>So it&#8217;s nice to say that we should work on trust, but whether you talk about your tax return or sports or the safety of airplanes, right, there are controls and checks there … I think that nobody actually has really considered that this happened on such a large scale, and I think that is still part of the problem that editors and publishers do not believe that it&#8217;s happening on such a big scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidna-snot-bubble-cooling">These adorable Australian spike-balls beat the heat with snot bubbles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals cover themselves in all kinds of unsavory fluids to keep cool. Humans sweat, kangaroos spit and some birds will urinate on themselves to survive hot days. It turns out that echidnas do something much cuter — though perhaps just as sticky (and slightly icky) — to beat the heat.</p>



<p>The spiny insectivores <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay cool by blowing snot bubbles</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. The bubbles pop, keeping the critters’ noses moist. As it evaporates, this moisture draws heat away from a blood-filled sinus in the echidna’s beak, helping to cool the animal’s blood.</p>





<p>Short-beaked echidnas (<em>Tachyglossus aculeatus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/echidnas-do-list-sleep-eat-dig-australia">look a bit like hedgehogs but are really monotremes</a> — egg-laying mammals unique to Australia and New Guinea (<em>SN: 11/18/16</em>). Previous lab studies showed that temperatures above 35° Celsius (95° Fahrenheit) should kill echidnas. But echidnas don’t seem to have gotten the memo. They live everywhere from tropical rainforests to deserts to snow-capped peaks, leaving scientists with a physiological puzzle.</p>



<p>Mammals evaporate water to keep cool when temperatures climb above their body temperatures, says environmental physiologist Christine Cooper of Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “Lots of mammals do that by either licking, sweating or panting,” she says. “Echidnas weren’t believed to be able to do that.” But it’s known that the critters blow snot bubbles when it gets hot.</p>



<p>So, armed with a heat-vision camera and a telephoto lens, Cooper and environmental physiologist Philip Withers of the University of Western Australia in Perth drove through nature reserves in Western Australia once a month for a year to film echidnas.</p>



<p>In infrared, the warmest parts of the echidnas’ spiny bodies glowed in oranges, yellows and whites. But the video revealed that the tips of their noses were dark purple blobs, kept cool as moisture from their snot bubbles evaporated. Echidnas might also lose heat through their bellies and legs, the researchers report, while their spikes could act as an insulator.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="See where echidnas’ bodies are hot — and where they’re not | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDzYMU0iLuI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An echidna looks like a hot spiky ball of yellow, orange and white in this heat-vision video — except for its chilly nose, which shows up as a purple and black blob. That’s because these Australian mammals blow snot bubbles to keep their noses wet, which cools the critters down as the moisture evaporates, a new study concludes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Finding a way of doing this work in the field is pretty exciting,” says physiological ecologist Stewart Nicol of the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, who was not involved in the study. “You can understand animals and see how they&#8217;re responding to their normal environment.” The next step, he says, is to quantify how much heat echidnas really lose through their noses and other body parts.</p>



<p>Monotremes parted evolutionary ways with other mammals between 250 million and 160 million years ago as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tethys-ocean-implicated-pangaea-breakup">the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/15</em>). So “they have a whole lot of traits that are considered to be primitive,” Cooper says. “Understanding how they might thermoregulate can give us some ideas about how thermal regulation … might have evolved in mammals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemists-long-lasting-roman-concrete">These chemists cracked the code to long-lasting Roman concrete</a></h4>

              
                <p>MIT chemist Admir Masic really hoped his experiment wouldn’t explode.</p>



<p>Masic and his colleagues were trying to re-create an ancient Roman technique for making concrete, a mix of cement, gravel, sand and water. The researchers suspected that the key was a process called “hot mixing,” in which dry granules of calcium oxide, also called quicklime, are mixed with volcanic ash to make the cement. Then water is added.</p>



<p>Hot mixing, they thought, would ultimately produce a cement that wasn’t completely smooth and mixed, but instead contained small calcium-rich rocks. Those little rocks, ubiquitous in the walls of the Romans’ concrete buildings, might be the key to why those structures have withstood the ravages of time.</p>





<p>That’s not how modern cement is made. The reaction of quicklime with water is highly exothermic, meaning that it can produce a lot of heat — and possibly an explosion.</p>



<p>“Everyone would say, ‘You are crazy,’” Masic says.</p>



<p>But no big bang happened. Instead, the reaction produced only heat, a damp sigh of water vapor — and a Romans-like cement mixture bearing small white calcium-rich rocks.</p>



<p>Researchers have been trying for decades to re-create the Roman recipe for concrete longevity — but with little success. The idea that hot mixing was the key was an educated guess.</p>



<p>Masic and colleagues had pored over texts by Roman architect Vitruvius and historian Pliny, which offered some clues as to how to proceed. These texts cited, for example, strict specifications for the raw materials, such as that the limestone that is the source of the quicklime must be very pure, and that mixing quicklime with hot ash and then adding water could produce a lot of heat.</p>



<p>The rocks were not mentioned, but the team had a feeling they were important.</p>





<p>“In every sample we have seen of ancient Roman concrete, you can find these white inclusions,” bits of rock embedded in the walls. For many years, Masic says, the origin of those inclusions was unclear — researchers suspected incomplete mixing of the cement, perhaps. But these are the highly organized Romans we’re talking about. How likely is it that “every operator [was] not mixing properly and every single [building] has a flaw?”</p>



<p>What if, the team suggested, these inclusions in the cement were actually a feature, not a bug? The researchers’ chemical analyses of such rocks embedded in the walls at the archaeological site of Privernum in Italy indicated that the inclusions were very calcium-rich. </p>



<p>That suggested the tantalizing possibility that these rocks might be helping the buildings heal themselves from cracks due to weathering or even an earthquake. A ready supply of calcium was already on hand: It would dissolve, seep into the cracks and re-crystallize. Voila! Scar healed.</p>



<p>But could the team observe this in action? Step one was to re-create the rocks via hot mixing and hope nothing exploded. Step two: Test the Roman-inspired cement. The team created concrete with and without the hot mixing process and tested them side by side. Each block of concrete was broken in half, the pieces placed a small distance apart. Then water was trickled through the crack to see how long it took before the seepage stopped.</p>



<p>“The results were stunning,” Masic says. The blocks incorporating hot mixed cement healed within two to three weeks. The concrete produced without hot mixed cement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never healed at all</a>, the team reports January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Cracking the recipe could be a boon to the planet. The Pantheon and its soaring, detailed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-concrete-planet-strange-and-fascinating-story-worlds-most-common-man-made">concrete dome have stood nearly 2,000 years</a>, for instance, while modern concrete structures have a lifespan of perhaps 150 years, and that’s a best case scenario (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>). And the Romans didn’t have steel reinforcement bars shoring up their structures.</p>



<p>More frequent replacements of concrete structures means more greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete manufacturing is a huge source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, so longer-lasting versions could reduce that carbon footprint. &#8220;We make 4 gigatons per year of this material,” Masic says. That manufacture produces as much as 1 metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per metric ton of produced concrete, currently amounting to about 8 percent of annual global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>



<p>Still, Masic says, the concrete industry is resistant to change. For one thing, there are concerns about introducing new chemistry into a tried-and-true mixture with well-known mechanical properties. But “the key bottleneck in the industry is the cost,” he says. Concrete is cheap, and companies don’t want to price themselves out of competition.</p>



<p>The researchers hope that reintroducing this technique that has stood the test of time, and that could involve little added cost to manufacture, could answer both these concerns. In fact, they’re banking on it: Masic and several of his colleagues have created a startup they call DMAT that is currently seeking seed money to begin to commercially produce the Roman-inspired hot-mixed concrete. “It’s very appealing simply because it’s a thousands-of-years-old material.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cyclones-arctic-intense-frequent-climate">Cyclones in the Arctic are becoming more intense and frequent</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> – In January 2022, a cyclone blitzed a large expanse of ice-covered ocean between Greenland and Russia. Frenzied gusts galvanized 8-meter-tall waves that pounded the region’s hapless flotillas of sea ice, while a bombardment of warm rain and a surge of southerly heat laid siege from the air.</p>



<p>Six days after the assault began, about a quarter, or roughly 400,000 square kilometers, of the vast area’s sea ice had disappeared, leading to a record weekly loss for the region.</p>





<p>The storm is the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD037161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongest Arctic cyclone ever documented</a>. But it may not hold that title for long. Cyclones in the Arctic have become more frequent and intense in recent decades, posing risks to both sea ice and people, researchers reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. “This trend is expected to persist as the region continues to warm rapidly in the future,” says climate scientist Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<h4>Rapid Arctic warming and more destructive storms</h4>



<p>The Arctic Circle is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">about four times as fast</a> as the rest of Earth (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). A major driver is the loss of sea ice due to human-caused climate change. The floating ice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-reflection-light-dim-earthshine-moon-solar-radiation">reflects far more solar radiation</a> back into space than naked seas do, influencing the global climate (<em>SN: 10/14/21</em>). During August, the heart of the sea ice melting season, cyclones have been observed to amplify sea ice losses on average, exacerbating warming.</p>



<p>There’s more: Like hurricanes can ravage regions farther south, boreal vortices can threaten <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-report-card-how-poor-environmental-health-affects-everyday-life">people living and traveling in the Arctic</a> (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). As the storms intensify, “stronger winds pose a risk for marine navigation by generating higher waves,” Vavrus says, “and for coastal erosion, which has already become a serious problem throughout much of the Arctic and forced some communities to consider relocating inland.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">Climate change is intensifying storms farther south</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). But it’s unclear how Arctic cyclones might be changing as the world warms. Some previous research suggested that pressures, on average, in Arctic cyclones’ cores have dropped in recent decades. That would be problematic, as lower pressures generally mean more intense storms, with “stronger winds, larger temperature variations and heavier rainfall [and] snowfall,” says atmospheric scientist Xiangdong Zhang of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</p>



<p>But inconsistencies between analyses had prevented a clear trend from emerging, Zhang said at the meeting. So he and his colleagues aggregated a comprehensive record, spanning 1950 to 2021, of Arctic cyclone timing, intensity and duration.</p>



<p><a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1095296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctic cyclone activity has intensified in strength and frequency</a> over recent decades, Zhang reported. Pressures in the hearts of today’s boreal vortices are on average about 9 millibars lower than in the 1950s. For context, such a pressure shift would be roughly equivalent to bumping a strong category 1 hurricane well into category 2 territory. And vortices became more frequent during winters in the North Atlantic Arctic and during summers in the Arctic north of Eurasia.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Storm surge</h3>



<p>In the last decade, strong vortices — with central pressures lower than 990 millibars — appeared in the Arctic more often each year, on average, than in the 1950s, up about 20 percent in the winter and 35 percent in the summer.</p>

<p>What’s more, August cyclones appear to be <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1053374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damaging sea ice more than in the past</a>, said meteorologist Peter Finocchio of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, Calif. He and his colleagues compared the response of northern sea ice to summer cyclones during the 1990s and the 2010s.</p>



<p>August vortices in the latter decade were followed by a 10 percent loss of sea ice area on average, up from the earlier decade’s 3 percent loss on average. This may be due, in part, to warmer water upwelling from below, which can melt the ice pack’s underbelly, and from winds pushing the thinner, easier-to-move ice around, Finocchio said.</p>



<h4>Stronger spring storms spell trouble too</h4>



<p>With climate change, cyclones may <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1092888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue intensifying in the spring too</a>, climate scientist Chelsea Parker said at the meeting. That’s a problem because spring vortices can prime sea ice for later summer melting.</p>



<p>Parker, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and her colleagues ran computer simulations of spring cyclone behavior in the Arctic under past, present and projected climate conditions. By the end of the century, the maximum near-surface wind speeds of spring cyclones — around 11 kilometers per hour today — could reach 60 km/h, the researchers found. And future spring cyclones may keep swirling at peak intensity for up to a quarter of their life spans, up from around 1 percent today. The storms will probably travel farther too, the team says.</p>



<p>“The diminishing sea ice cover will enable the warmer Arctic seas to fuel these storms and probably allow them to penetrate farther into the Arctic,” says Vavrus, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Parker and her team plan to investigate the future evolution of Arctic cyclones in other seasons, to capture a broader picture of how climate change is affecting the storms.</p>



<p>For now, it seems certain that Arctic cyclones aren’t going anywhere. What&#8217;s less clear is how humankind will contend with the storms&#8217; growing fury.</p>

<p>In October 2021, a Reddit user on the r/badscience subforum posted a long critique of an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">article published in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a> earlier that year that had analyzed the “anti-vaccination infodemic” on Twitter and concluded that former U.S. president Donald Trump was “the main driver of vaccine misinformation” on the platform before his account was suspended.</p>



<p>The critique, titled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/qbma8a/terrible_plosone_paper_dissected/">Terrible PlosOne Paper Dissected</a>,” listed concerns about the sample size (50 pro-vaccine and 50 anti-vaccine accounts), method of selecting the sample and control groups, and data analysis. The Redditor also looked at the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">reviews</a> of the article which <em>PLOS ONE</em> made available, and concluded that “clearly neither reviewer actually read it in any detail.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day after the comment was posted, an account for PLOS Communications responded, thanking the user “for your post publication peer review” and saying that <em>PLOS ONE</em> was looking into the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126400"></span>



<p>According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, the PLOS publication ethics team emailed the corresponding author on the article in June 2022 with the subject line “Request for clarification about published PLOS ONE article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, the article was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The lengthy retraction notice detailed a back-and-forth with the authors about methodological concerns in the article. The editors concluded those concerns meant the paper “did not meet <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s publication criteria,” but one of the authors told us he believes a correction could have addressed them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The June email from the PLOS publication ethics team stated that “some concerns have been raised regarding your article with respect to some clarity in the reporting and methodology,” and asked the authors to submit a revision to the article with specific changes “in order to comply with our publication criteria.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Germani, the corresponding author, sent the journal an updated version of the paper less than two weeks after receiving the request. But he didn’t hear back for months, he told us, until an October email from the publication ethics team informed him and his co-author that the editors had decided to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The email included a draft of the retraction notice listing methodological concerns, to which the authors responded in detail in their appeal of the decision. The journal rejected their appeal and sent them a revised retraction notice in November. After more back-and-forth about the wording of the notice, the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279796">retraction was published</a> on Dec. 22, 2022. The notice began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding the methodology, results, and conclusions presented in this article. The editorial team and a subject expert have re-evaluated the article and determined that the concerns listed below remain unresolved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice listed five bullet points of concerns, including this one:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reported conclusion “Our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, before his profile was suspended, was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter.” is not supported by the research reported in this study. Although the reported results suggests [sic] that people who tweet anti-vaccine content are likely to be in Trump’s network, the reported results are not sufficient to support the claim that Trump himself is driving vaccine misinformation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rest of the notice contains the authors’ response to the concerns. About Trump:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Regarding the conclusion, the authors agreed that the sentence regarding Trump’s role, taken out of context, is not supported by the data presented in the paper, but they maintain that their results, as described in the discussion section, show that Trump’s profile was, at the time, “the main influencer in the anti-vaccination web” on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642#pone.0279796.ref001">1</a>] because, per our editorial assessment, it did not meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria (#3, 4) [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642#pone.0279796.ref002">2</a>]. We regret that the issues with the article were not identified and addressed prior to its publication.</p>



<p>Both authors did not agree with the retraction and stand by the article’s findings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Germani told us he thought the journal’s initial request for a revision to the paper “would have been a reasonable approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his co-author, Biller-Andorno, disagreed with the editorial team and subject expert’s assessment of the methodological concerns, he said, but were “happy to have the opportunity to make corrections to the paper,” and the back-and-forth of corrections, or a response article and reply, “is just how science should work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings about Trump’s role in the anti-vaccine Twitter community were a surprise to him, he said, and he expressed concern that political considerations could have influenced the retraction decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s not clear to us why this paper had to be retracted at all costs and with little communication from the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Germani and Biller-Andorno have posted a revised version of the paper as a <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7528138#.Y8Bn3ezMKhx">preprint</a>, with a disclaimer detailing the history with <em>PLOS ONE</em> and a supplementary PDF responding to the issues listed in the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to PLOS for comment on Germani’s concern that PLOS’s editors may have felt political pressure to retract the article. Renee Hoch, managing editor for publication ethics, responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The claim is untrue. The retraction decision reflects PLOS’ assessment of how the unresolved issues identified in our post-publication editorial assessment aligned with the PLOS Retraction Policy and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Retraction Guidelines. External parties do not contribute to or influence our editorial decisions.</p>



<p>We recognize that individuals raising concerns may have potential competing interests. Our Publication Ethics team and journal editors are well-versed at evaluating potential competing interests and isolating scientific and ethical criticisms/concerns from personal assertions, opinions, or agendas that sometimes accompany complaints. We focus our investigations on the scientific and ethical concerns, and our editorial decisions reflect our assessment of how any verified and unresolved concerns align with PLOS policies, journal requirements, and relevant COPE guidance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We had also asked through what venue concerns were raised about the paper, and Hoch pointed us to the Reddit post. As for why the issues with the paper weren’t raised during peer-review, before the article was accepted for publication, she said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reddit posts discussed concerns about the article’s published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642">peer review history</a>. We cannot disclose any unpublished information about the article’s peer review. However, in responding to the concerns raised in this case we completed a thorough, rigorous assessment of the article and obtained input from a well-qualified expert. We regret that the issues identified in this assessment did not surface during the pre-publication peer review.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She also noted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We addressed why these cases take so long sometimes, and why some of these issues are not caught before, in this blog post, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-publication-ethics-a-frank-discussion-on-handling-difficult-cases/#issuesnotidentified">here</a>. It&#8217;s quite a good read.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-lightning-rod-electricity">A powerful laser can redirect lightning strikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a high-tech hammer of Thor, a powerful laser can grab hold of a lightning bolt and reroute its path through the sky.</p>



<p>In a mountaintop experiment, such a laser <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01139-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bent lightning toward a lightning rod</a>, researchers report online January 16 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>. Scientists have used lasers to wrangle electricity in the lab before, but this is the first demonstration that the technique works in real-world storms and could someday lead to better protection against lightning.</p>





<p>Today’s most common anti-lightning tech is the classic lightning rod, a meters-long metal pole rooted to the ground. The metal’s conductivity lures in lightning that might otherwise strike nearby buildings or people, feeding that electricity safely into the earth. But the area shielded by a lightning rod is limited by the rod’s height.</p>



<p>“If you want to protect some large infrastructure, like an airport or a launching pad for rockets or a wind farm … then you would need, for good protection, a lightning rod of kilometer size, or hundreds of meters,” says Aurélien Houard, a physicist at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Palaiseau, France. Such a tall metal pole would be impractical. But a laser could reach that far, intercepting distant lightning bolts and ushering them down to ground-based metal rods.</p>



<p>Houard and his colleagues tested this idea atop the Säntis mountain in northeastern Switzerland. They set up a high-power laser near a telecommunications tower tipped with a lightning rod that is struck by lightning around 100 times every year. The laser was beamed at the sky for about six hours total during thunderstorms from July to September 2021.</p>

The lightning followed the route of the laser light for some 50 meters.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121065">A. Houard <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Photonics</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The laser blasted short, intense bursts of infrared light at the clouds about 1,000 times per second. This train of light pulses ripped electrons off air molecules and knocked some air molecules out of its way, carving out a channel of low-density, charged plasma. Sort of like clearing a path through the woods and laying down pavement, this combination of effects made it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superfast-laser-pulses-could-pave-way-beam-weapons">easier for electric current to flow</a> along this route (<em>SN: 3/5/14</em>). That created a path of least resistance for lightning to follow through the sky.</p>



<p>Houard’s team tuned their laser so that it formed this electrically conductive pathway just above the tip of the tower. This allowed the tower’s lightning rod to intercept a bolt snagged by the laser before it zipped all the way down to the laser equipment.</p>



<p>The tower was hit by lightning four times while the laser was on. One of those strikes happened in a fairly clear sky, allowing two high-speed cameras to capture the moment. Those images showed lightning zigzagging down from the clouds and following the laser light for some 50 meters toward the tower’s lightning rod.</p>





<p>To track the paths of the three bolts that they could not see, the researchers looked at radio waves shed by the lightning. Those radio waves showed that the three strikes followed the path of the laser much more closely than other strikes that happened when the laser was off. This hinted that the laser guided these three strikes to the lightning rod, as well.</p>

<p>“It’s a real achievement,” says Howard Milchberg, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park not involved in the work. “People have been trying to do this for many years.” Scientists’ main goal in bending lightning to their will is to increase safety, he says. But “if this thing ever became really, really efficient, and the probability of guiding a discharge was increased way beyond what it is now, it could potentially even be useful for charging things up.”</p>



<p>Atmospheric and space scientist Robert Holzworth is more cautious about imagining the applications. “They only showed 50 meters of [guiding] length, and most lightning channels are kilometers long,” says Holzworth, of the University of Washington in Seattle. So scaling the laser system up to have a useful reach may take a lot of work.</p>



<p>Using a higher-frequency, higher-energy laser could extend its reach, Houard says. “This is a first step toward a kilometric-range lightning rod.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology">How rare earth elements’ hidden properties make modern technology possible</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In Frank Herbert’s space opera <em>Dune</em>, a precious natural substance called spice melange grants people the ability to navigate vast expanses of the cosmos to build an intergalactic civilization.</p>



<p>In real life here on Earth, a group of natural metals known as the rare earths has made possible our own technology-powered society. Demand for these crucial components in nearly all modern electronics is skyrocketing.</p>



<p>Rare earths fulfill thousands of different needs — cerium, for instance, is used as a catalyst to refine petroleum, and gadolinium captures neutrons in nuclear reactors. But these elements’ most outstanding capabilities lie in their luminescence and magnetism.</p>





<p>We rely on rare earths to color our smartphone screens, fluoresce to signal authenticity in euro banknotes and relay signals through fiber-optic cables across the seafloor. They are also essential for building some of the world’s strongest and most reliable magnets. They generate sound waves in your headphones, boost digital information through space and shift the trajectories of heat-seeking missiles. Rare earths are also driving the growth of green technologies, such as wind energy and electric vehicles, and may even give rise to new components for quantum computers.</p>



<p>“The list just goes on and on,” says Stephen Boyd, a synthetic chemist and independent consultant. “They’re everywhere.”</p>



<h4>Rare earths’ superpowers come from their electrons</h4>



<p>The rare earths are the lanthanides — lutetium and all 14 elements between lanthanum and ytterbium across one row of the periodic table — plus scandium and yttrium, which tend to occur in the same ore deposits and have similar chemical properties to the lanthanides. These gray to silvery metals are often malleable with high melting and boiling points.</p>



<p>Their secret powers lie in their electrons. All atoms have a nucleus surrounded by electrons, which inhabit zones called orbitals. Electrons in the orbitals farthest from the nucleus are the valence electrons, which participate in chemical reactions and form bonds with other atoms.</p>



<p>Most lanthanides possess another important set of electrons called the “f-electrons,” which dwell in a Goldilocks zone located near the valence electrons but slightly closer to the nucleus. “It’s these f-electrons that are responsible for both the magnetic and luminescent properties of the rare earth elements,” says Ana de Bettencourt-Dias, an inorganic chemist at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Place on the periodic table</h3>



<p>The rare earths are a group of 17 elements (highlighted in blue on the periodic table). A subset of rare earths known as the lanthanides (lutetium, Lu, plus the row starting with lanthanum, La) each contain a subshell that typically houses f-electrons, which bestow the elements with magnetic and luminescent properties.</p>

<h4>Rare earths add color and light</h4>



<p>Along some coasts, the night sea occasionally glows bluish green as bioluminescent plankton are jostled in the waves. Rare earth metals also radiate light when stimulated. The trick is to tickle their f-electrons, de Bettencourt-Dias says.</p>



<p>Using an energy source like a laser or lamp, scientists and engineers can jolt one of a rare earth’s f-electrons into an excited state and then let it fall back into lethargy, or its ground state. “When the lanthanides come back to the ground state,” she says, “they emit light.”</p>



<p>Each rare earth reliably emits precise wavelengths of light when excited, de Bettencourt-Dias says. This dependable precision allows engineers to carefully tune electromagnetic radiation in many electronics. Terbium, for instance, emits light at a wavelength of about 545 nanometers, making it good for constructing green phosphors in television, computer and smartphone screens. Europium, which has two common forms, is used to build red and blue phosphors. All together, these phosphors can paint screens with most shades of the rainbow.</p>



<p>Rare earths also radiate useful invisible light. Yttrium is a key ingredient in yttrium-aluminum-garnet, or YAG, a synthetic crystal that forms the core of many high-powered lasers. Engineers tune the wavelengths of these lasers by lacing YAG crystals with another rare earth. The most popular variety are neodymium-laced YAG lasers, which are used for everything from slicing steel to removing tattoos to laser range-finding. Erbium-YAG laser beams are a good option for minimally invasive surgeries because they’re readily absorbed by water in flesh and thus won’t slice too deep.</p>

<p>Beyond lasers, lanthanum is crucial for making the infrared-absorbing glass in night vision goggles. “And erbium drives our internet,” says Tian Zhong, a molecular engineer at the University of Chicago. Much of our digital information travels through optical fibers as light with a wavelength of about 1,550 nanometers — the same wavelength erbium emits. The signals in fiber-optic cables dim as they travel far from their source. Because those cables can stretch for thousands of kilometers across the seafloor, erbium is added to fibers to boost signals.</p>



<h4>Rare earths make mighty magnets</h4>



<p>In 1945, scientists constructed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/adds-15000-second">ENIAC, the world’s first programmable, general purpose digital computer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/46, p. 118</em>). Nicknamed the “Giant Brain,” ENIAC weighed more than four elephants and had a footprint roughly two-thirds the size of a tennis court.</p>



<p>Less than 80 years later, the ubiquitous smartphone — boasting far more computing power than ENIAC ever did — fits snugly in our palms. Society owes this miniaturization of electronic technology in large part to the exceptional magnetic power of the rare earths. Tiny rare earth magnets can do the same job as larger magnets made without rare earths.</p>



<p>It’s those f-electrons at play. Rare earths have many orbitals of electrons, but the f-electrons inhabit a specific group of seven orbitals called the 4f-subshell. In any subshell, electrons try to spread themselves out among the orbitals within. Each orbital can house up to two electrons. But since the 4f-subshell contains seven orbitals, and most rare earths contain fewer than 14 f-electrons, the elements tend to have multiple orbitals with just one electron. Neodymium atoms, for instance, possess four of these loners, while dysprosium and samarium have five. Crucially, these unpaired electrons tend to point — or spin — in the same direction, Boyd says. “That’s what creates the north and the south poles that we classically understand as magnetism.”</p>



<p>Since these lone f-electrons flitter behind a shell of valence electrons, their synchronized spins are somewhat shielded from demagnetizing forces such as heat and other magnetic fields, making them great for building permanent magnets, Zhong says. Permanent magnets, like the ones that hold up pictures on a fridge door, passively generate magnetic fields that arise from their atomic structure, unlike electromagnets, which require an electric current and can be turned off.</p>



<p>But even with their shielding, the rare earths have limits. Pure neodymium, for example, readily corrodes and fractures, and its magnetic pull begins to lose strength above 80° Celsius. So manufacturers alloy some rare earths with other metals to make more resilient magnets, says Durga Paudyal, a theoretical physicist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa. This works well because some rare earths can orchestrate the magnetic fields of other metals, he says. Just as weighted dice will preferentially land on one side, some rare earths like neodymium and samarium exhibit stronger magnetism in certain directions because they contain unevenly filled orbitals in their 4f-subshells. This directionality, called magnetic anisotropy, can be leveraged to coordinate the fields of other metals like iron or cobalt to formulate robust, extremely powerful magnets.</p>



<p>The most powerful rare earth alloy magnets are neodymium-iron-boron magnets. A three-kilogram neodymium alloy magnet can lift objects that weigh over 300 kilograms, for instance. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 95 percent of the world’s permanent magnets</a> are made from this rare earth alloy. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets generate vibrations in smartphones, produce sounds in earbuds and headphones, enable the reading and writing of data in hard disk drives and generate the magnetic fields used in MRI machines. And adding a bit of dysprosium to these magnets can boost the alloy’s heat resistance, making it a good choice for the rotors that spin in the hot interiors of many electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>Samarium-cobalt magnets, developed in the 1960s, were the first popular rare earth magnets. Though slightly weaker than neodymium-iron-boron magnets, samarium-cobalt magnets have superior heat and corrosion resistance, so they’re put to work in high-speed motors, generators, speed sensors in cars and airplanes, and in the moving parts of some heat-seeking missiles. Samarium-cobalt magnets also form the heart of most traveling-wave tubes, which boost signals from radar systems and communications satellites. Some of these tubes are transmitting data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">Voyager 1 spacecraft</a> — currently the most distant human-made object — over 23 billion kilometers away (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Because they are strong and reliable, rare earth magnets are supporting green technologies. They’re in the motors, drivetrains, power steering and many other components of electric vehicles. Tesla’s use of neodymium alloy magnets in its farthest-ranging Model 3 vehicles has sparked supply chain worries; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">China provides the vast majority of the world&#8217;s neodymium</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rare earth magnets are also used in many offshore wind turbines to replace gearboxes, which boosts efficiency and decreases maintenance. In August, Chinese engineers introduced “Rainbow,” the world’s first maglev train line based on rare earth magnets that enable the trains to float without consuming electricity.</p>



<p>In the future, rare earths may even advance quantum computing. While conventional computers use binary bits (those 1s and 0s), quantum computers use qubits, which can occupy two states simultaneously. As it turns out, crystals containing rare earths make good qubits, since the shielded f-electrons can store quantum information for long periods of time, Zhong says. One day, computer scientists might even leverage the luminescent properties of rare earths in qubits to share information between quantum computers and birth a quantum internet, he says.</p>



<p>It may be too early to predict exactly how the rare earth metals will continue to influence the expansion of these growing technologies. But it’s probably safe to say: We’re going to need more rare earths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">Here’s what you need to know about COVID’s XBB.1.5 ‘Kraken’ variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The omicron variant’s family tree has grown substantially over the last year. The brood now encompasses a subvariant soup with alphanumeric names such as BA.2, BA.5 and BF.7. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that two versions — BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 — caused just over half of new infections in the United States during the week ending January 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, a newcomer dubbed XBB.1.5 seems poised for a rise to dominance. According to CDC estimates, it accounts for more than 80 percent of new cases in parts of the northeastern United States. For the week ending January 14, it was responsible for 43 percent of new cases across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>But while previous variants such as alpha, delta and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">original omicron</a> were linked to massive surges of new infections, it’s not yet clear whether XBB.1.5 is destined for a similar path (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). Preliminary evidence suggests the subvariant, nicknamed the Kraken in some circles, is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.522427v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more transmissible</a> than its predecessors. That trait, however, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants">a hallmark of viral evolution</a> — successful new variants must be able to outcompete their siblings (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, experts at the World Health Organization are keeping a close eye on XBB.1.5. But it’s <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/11jan2023_xbb15_rapid_risk_assessment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too early to say</a> whether it might take over the globe. Most cases currently come from the United States, the United Kingdom and Denmark.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with infectious diseases specialist Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco about the latest coronavirus variant to make headlines. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What is the difference between XBB.1.5 and earlier versions of omicron?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: There are lots of variants that get produced all the time. It’s a normal thing for the virus as the virus makes more copies of itself. It’s not exactly precise or accurate, so it makes errors, [which are the variants]. It’s kind of like a bad photocopy machine in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB, a sibling of XBB.1.5, was scary — and that was seen in the fall of 2022 — because it was one of the most immune-evasive variants around. But the reason why XBB never took off around the world — it was really in Singapore and India — was that it didn’t really infect cells quite as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB.1.5 has the immune slipperiness of XBB, but it also has this new mutation that makes it easy to infect cells. So it’s kind of like a bulldog in not wanting to let go of the cell. Whereas XBB was kind of invisible, like it had the invisibility cloak from <em>Harry Potter</em>, it didn’t have the bite. But XBB.1.5 has the invisibility cloak, plus the bite.&nbsp;</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Is that why it’s spreading so effectively in some areas?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: We think so. Because to be very efficient at infecting cells is a really important superpower if you are a virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can be invisible [to the immune system] all you want, but if you’re not infecting cells efficiently, you probably won’t be as infectious. That could be [the reason] XBB.1.5 is spreading, because it has both of those things going for it. Seeing how it’s crowding out the other variants now makes us worried that it’s something to pay attention to. And it’s accompanied by increasing cases and hospitalizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Previous variants were linked to big surges of infections. Can we expect the same of XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: It’s complicated. If it were March 2020, it would be a very simple answer: Yes. But in January of 2023, you have so much variation in the amount of experience people have toward COVID, even if it’s a different type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can have somebody who got infected two or three times plus they got vaccinated and boosted. That’s going to be somebody who’s going to be really, really well protected against getting seriously ill. Maybe they might get a cold. Maybe they wouldn’t even know they had an infection versus somebody who didn’t get vaccinated and never got exposed and they’re older. It might as well be March of 2020 for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That [second] kind of person is, for example, in China. In China, XBB.1.5 might cause a lot of problems. But XBB.1.5 going to, you know, the middle of Manhattan might not cause as many problems in a highly vaccinated and exposed group of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Timing also matters] because we saw a lot of BQ.1, BQ.1.1 recently, and a lot of people got infected after Thanksgiving. This rise of XBB.1.5 is coming after a lot of people already got infected recently. So it probably won’t do as much damage as if you had a long lull and all of a sudden you have this new thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Do vaccines and treatments still work against it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The new updated boosters generally work a little better than the old vaccines in terms of overall efficacy and preventing infection. But with these new slippery variants like XBB.1.5 … if you’re looking to prevent infections, even a mild infection, the vaccines are probably going to last maybe three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re talking about preventing me from dying or going to the hospital, those vaccines are going to give me a boost of protection for many, many months, probably until next winter for most people. For older people, older than 65, if they’re not boosted today, then it’s a problem.</p>



<p>[Drugs such as] Paxlovid and remdesivir work independent of the spike protein [the part of the virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">targeted by vaccines</a> but where many of the defense-evading mutations are (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>)]. So it doesn’t matter what invisibility cloak the variant has. They’re going to work because they work on shutting down the virus factory, which is one of the early steps, before the spike protein gets made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they will work no matter what [spike] variant comes along, which is a good thing. Even if you didn’t get vaccinated or never got exposed, if you got diagnosed and you get early therapy, it will cut down your hospitalization rates substantially.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, all monoclonal antibodies don’t work. [The virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">has changed too much</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/22</em>).]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why is it that only omicron variants are popping up?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: I think omicron has hit on a magical formula. It’s going to be hard to kick it off the gold medal stand. It’s so good at transmission, and all these other aspects that are good for the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the [earlier] days, it was two or three months, and you had a new coronavirus variant somewhere in the world. Now it’s been omicron since two Thanksgivings ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>With each variant more transmissible than the last, is it inevitable that everyone will get COVID?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The people who didn’t get infected before are going to have a really, really hard time escaping this one. But it’s not impossible. It’s just going to be harder and harder, not only because XBB.1.5 is so transmissible, but also because we don’t have so many restrictions anymore. You’re going to the grocery store, nobody’s wearing a mask or you don’t feel like you have peer pressure to wear masks. So you’re going to get exposed just like you get exposed to colds….&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you can reduce the risk in the short term by getting a booster, if you haven’t already gotten one. And certainly [the booster] can reduce the risk of dying, particularly if you’re older or immune-compromised….&nbsp;</p>



<p>[People still wearing masks] have to wear really good quality masks [such as KN95s] because you can’t rely on everybody else wearing masks anymore.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How worried should people be about XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The world is divided into two groups of people. The people whose bodies are very, very experienced with COVID — it’s gotten vaccines or boosting or … a couple of infections. And then there are people whose body isn’t well-experienced with COVID. For that [latter] group, they should be worried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For someone, you’re looking around and your neighbor got it and nothing happened, or your cousin or a person at work, and it&#8217;s like it’s no big deal. But there are still 500 people dying every day in the United States [from COVID]. And to those people, it’s a huge deal….</p>



<p>It’s a weird situation because it’s not one-size-fits-all anymore, and different people have different levels of risk.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In preparation for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) negotiations, a group of experts came together in late 2021, convened by <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEO BON</a> and <a href="https://futureearth.org/">Future </a><a href="https://futureearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth</a>, to compile a series of scientific <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefs</a> showing assessments and recommendations for select GBF targets and goals. In order to distill key aspects of these briefs and make their overarching messages more accessible to the broader scientific community, these experts authored and published the first of a series of Policy Perspective companion pieces in <em>PLOS Climate </em>and <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>. Read on for a summary of these papers with links to the full articles below.</p>



<h3>Background&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The articles summarize key focus areas to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. These areas include increasing natural ecosystem area by 2030, focusing on specific restoration needs to meet this goal, and cautioning that specific efforts must respect biodiversity criteria and rights of local populations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Articles</h3>



<p>In the <em>PLOS Climate</em> paper, the authors share opportunities to minimize<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hashtag_click"> </a>climate change impacts on<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/biodiversity?src=hashtag_click"> </a>biodiversity, how biodiversity can support<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adaptation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>adaptation and<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mitigation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>mitigation, and how climate action can avoid negative impacts on biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em> paper describes actions to achieve ambitious net gains in natural<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecosystem?src=hashtag_click"> </a>ecosystem areas, and the second<a href="https://twitter.com/PLOSSustain"> </a>paper addresses the complexities of setting ambitious international<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/restoration?src=hashtag_click"> </a>restoration objectives for terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Future Publications</h3>



<p>Two more papers are under review addressing sustainable agriculture, and sustainable use of biodiversity. Altogether, and with other outputs from the same group, the authors hope that scientific support for the development of the GBF will help align countries during negotiations and facilitate integrated implementation of the targets in coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-snow-saturn-cassini">Enceladus is blanketed in a thick layer of snow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus is shrouded in a thick layer of snow. In some places, the downy stuff is 700 meters deep, new research suggests.</p>



<p>“It’s like Buffalo, but worse,” says planetary scientist Emily Martin, referring to the famously snowy city in New York. The snow depth suggests that Enceladus’ dramatic plume <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103522004614?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have been more active in the past</a>, Martin and colleagues report in the Mar. 1 <em>Icarus</em>.</p>



<p>Planetary scientists have been fascinated by Enceladus’ geysers, made up of water vapor and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">other ingredients</a>, since the Cassini spacecraft spotted them in 2005 (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>). The spray probably comes from a salty ocean beneath an icy shell.</p>





<p>Some of that water goes to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">form one of Saturn’s rings</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But most of it falls back onto the moon’s surface as snow, Martin says. Understanding the properties of that snow — its thickness and how dense and compact it is — could help reveal Enceladus’ history, and lay groundwork for future missions to this moon.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to land a robot there, you need to understand what it’s going to be landing into,” says Martin, of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>To figure out how thick Enceladus’ snow is, Martin and colleagues looked to Earth — specifically, Iceland. The island country hosts geological features called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-dione-has-stripes-no-others-solar-system">pit chains</a>, which are lines of pockmarks in the ground formed when loose rubble such as rocks, ice or snow drains into a crack underneath (<em>SN: 10/23/18</em>). Similar features show up all over the solar system, including Enceladus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="426" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1.jpg" alt="A person walks near pit chain craters in Iceland." class="wp-image-3120901" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1-611x383.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/010923_lg_enceladus-snow_inline1-297x186.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120901">Pit chain craters in Iceland, like those shown here, helped planetary scientist Emily Martin and colleagues verify that they could measure the depth of craters on Enceladus. Martin took this image during a field excursion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120901">E. Martin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previous work suggested a way to use geometry and the angle at which sunlight hits the surface to measure the depth of the pits. That measurement can then reveal the depth of the material the pits sit in. A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few weeks of fieldwork in Iceland</a> in 2017 and 2018 convinced Martin and her colleagues that the same technique would work on Enceladus.</p>



<p>Using images from Cassini, Martin and colleagues found that the snow’s thickness varies across Enceladus’ surface. It is hundreds of meters deep in most places and 700 meters deep at its thickest.</p>





<p>It’s hard to imagine how all that snow got there, though, Martin says. If the plume’s spray was always what it is today, it would take 4.5 billion years — the entire age of the solar system — to deposit that much snow on the surface. Even then, the snow would have to be especially fluffy.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely that the plume switched on the moment the moon formed and never changed, Martin says. And even if it did, later layers of snow would have compressed the earlier ones, compacting the whole layer and making it much less deep than it is today.</p>



<p>“It makes me think we don’t have 4.5 billion years to do this,” Martin says. Instead, the plume might have been much more active in the past. “We need to do it in a much shorter timeframe. You need to crank up the volume on the plume.”</p>



<p>The technique was clever, says planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Without rovers or astronauts on the ground, there’s no way to scoop up the snow and see how far down it goes. “Instead, the authors are very cleverly using geology to be their rovers, to be their shovels.”</p>



<p>MacKenzie was not involved in the new work, but she led a mission concept study for an orbiter and lander that could one day visit Enceladus. One of the major questions in that study was where a lander could safely touch down. “Key to those discussions was, what do we expect the surface to be?” she says. The new paper could help “identify the places that are too fluffy to land in.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780316540537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Far the Light Reaches</a><br><em>Sabrina Imbler</em><br><em>Little, Brown &amp; Co., $27</em></p>



<p>In <em>How Far the Light Reaches</em>, Sabrina Imbler shows us that the ocean, in all its mystery and dazzling glory, is queer — that is, the life that takes shape there challenges how we landlubbers perceive ways of being. This collection of essays tells the stories of 10 sea creatures, with Imbler, a queer and mixed-race writer, weaving in stories of their own family, self-discovery, sexuality and healing. The profiled animals, often thought of as strange or alien, transform into recognizable emblems of identity, community and queer joy in this delectable amalgam of memoir and science journalism.</p>





<p>Imbler begins with a confession: “The truth is that I was asked to leave the Petco, but I told everyone I was banned.” Thirteen-year-old Imbler had staged a protest in the store, attempting to convince customers not to buy goldfish bowls. The bowls, Imbler writes, condemn the fish to a truncated life in a transparent coffin, in which they will die isolated, starved of oxygen and poisoned with ammonia from their own urine.</p>



<p>But unencumbered by the confines of a bowl, the fish thrive. When bored pet owners dump goldfish in lakes or rivers, the fish can balloon to the size of jugs of milk. They are “so good at living they have become an ecological menace,” breeding with abandon, uprooting bottom dwellers, and fomenting bacterial growth and algal blooms, Imbler writes.</p>



<p>Yet Imbler can’t help but admire the feral goldfish’s resilience: “I see something that no one expected to live not just alive but impossibly flourishing.”</p>



<p>Survival among unthinkable circumstances is a theme common to all the profiled animals. Take the yeti crab (<em>Kiwa puravida</em>), which, after reading this book, I now proclaim a queer icon (step aside, the Babadook). In the frigid dark, about 1,000 meters below the sea surface, the crab finds solace near hydrothermal vents.</p>



<p>Such hot spots foster life in a desolate wasteland. Heat and chemicals from inside the Earth sustain an ecosystem of crabs, clams, mussels, tube worms and more. There, in true queer fashion, <em>K. puravida</em> “dances to live,” Imbler writes. The yeti crab throws its claws in the air and waves ’em like it just don’t care. In doing so, it is “farming” the bacteria that it eats, which cling to the crab’s bristly claws. Waving the claws in a slow but steady rhythm ensures the bacteria get nutrients.</p>



<p>In telling the crab’s story, Imbler reminisces on their quest to find community after moving to Seattle in 2016. Feeling alone among the mostly white people they met, Imbler discovered a monthly party called Night Crush, thrown by and for queer people of color. Night Crush became Imbler’s own hydrothermal vent — an oasis warmed by people dancing in mesh, sequins, glitter and joy. “As queer people, we get to choose our families,” Imbler writes. “Vent bacteria, tube worms, and yeti crabs just take it one step further. They choose what nourishes them.”</p>





<p>Imbler looks to the sea to explore all aspects of family. The purple octopus (<em>Graneledone boreopacifica</em>), for instance, offers insights on motherhood. During a four-and-a-half-year brooding period, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octomom-sets-egg-brooding-record">longest known for any animal</a>, the octopus starves herself to death, foregoing hunting to protect her eggs (<em>SN: 7/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Through the octopus’ saga, Imbler reflects on their own mother, who moved to the United States from Taiwan as a child. Imbler’s mother felt like she was on “a new planet.” To survive, she learned to want to be as white and “American” as possible, and as thin as possible — traumas inherited by Imbler, who developed an eating disorder.</p>



<p>In their recovery, Imbler has realized their mother’s wish for them to be thin, though damaging, was, in a way, an act of love: “She wanted me to be skinny so things would be easier. White, so things would be easier. Straight, so things would be easy, easy, easy. So that unlike her, no one would ever question my right to be here, in America.”</p>

<p>It is with that same grace, clarity and tenderness that Imbler crafts the book’s other essays, whether it’s meditating on their own gender expression through the cuttlefish’s mastery of metamorphosis or examining their experience of sexual assault through the sand striker, an ambush predator of the seafloor.</p>



<p>Like a goldfish confined by a bowl, I am confined by my word count and can’t say everything I want to about this must-read book. So I’ll end on one final insight. In one essay, Imbler introduces salps. These jelly-like blobs exist as a colony of hundreds of identical salps joined in a chain. The creatures do not move in one synchronized effort. “Salps allow each individual to jet at its own pace in the same general direction,” Imbler writes. “It is not as fast as coordinated strokes, but it’s more sustainable long-term, each individual sucking and spurting as it pleases.”</p>



<p>This idea of one collective, made up of individuals marching toward a common cause at their own pace, is one that queer people and other marginalized groups know well — whether creating community or protesting for civil rights. And it’s a notion that Imbler imparts upon their reader: “We may all move at different paces, but we will only reach the horizon together.”</p>

                This week, a good friend (let&#8217;s call them W.) was facing a big decision: they got a job offer but were unsure whether to accept as it would come with some major life changes. W&#8217;s hesitation, doubt and slight panic reminded me of myself just 2 years ago.

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/singel-cell-2-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When Barbara McClintock dubbed them “<a href="http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/21/197">controlling elements</a>”, the term she used was perhaps far more prescient and descriptive than the term more commonly used today, transposable elements (TEs). In many organisms, including in clades as diverse as plants, animals – mammalian and otherwise -, and bacteria, TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation. In humans, roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35057062">45% of the genome comprises TEs</a>, with a large majority of that consisting of retrotransposons, while in mice, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01262">TEs make up 37% of the genome</a>. Far from mere evolutionary junk, TEs have a variety of modes of impact on the genome and the transcriptome. Even in mammalian genomes, where many TEs are dormant, multiple classes of TEs, such as LINEs and Alu elements, still show active transposition [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722770/">1</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33725281/">2</a>]. This can be a part of the normal genetic variety of the species, but is more frequently linked with adverse outcomes, such as developmental disorders, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0165-8">genetic diseases</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc.2017.35">tumor formation</a> . To prevent such outcomes, TE activity and expression is tightly regulated in many genomes, often using TE proprietary regulatory mechanisms. For example, the suppression of TEs during development often remains intact, despite near-global demethylation and formation of pervasive euchromatin regions [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0159-6">3</a>].</p>
<p>In more recent years, the initial spike in research pertaining to TEs has been followed by a steady decline in the number of publications since 2013 (based on number of publications listed on the PubMed archives). In comparison, even when we do not account for the large amount of research related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of total research articles, as well as research in other fields has seen a general steady increase. While TEs continue to be a source of novel and vital information in many types of biological activity, the research has simply failed to catch up with the growing understanding of their importance in the genome.One of the potential reasons for this decline is the same property of TEs that makes them so important to the genome: as repeat elements, which, unlike tandem repeats, are found scattered across the genome, in-depth study of TEs requires increasingly more specialized tools and methods to yield new insights [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z">4</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5</a>]. For example, due to the potential impact of individual TE instances on the local genomic regions, such as through contributions of regulatory motifs (e.g. transcription factor binding sites), analyzing TE activity as a single meta-gene might lead to insufficient or misleading results. In addition, as mentioned previously, many TEs are actively transposed in both germline and somatic cells, often creating large scale structural variances that are difficult to capture properly without examination of the individual cells or organisms. Use of a reference genome for an organism without taking into account the possibility of such transposition might lead to missed opportunities for TE research. Overcoming such challenges might require extensive modifications to or adaptations of accepted methodologies, which is no trivial task.</p>
<blockquote><p>TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the decrease in published TE research, recent years have also seen an increasing number of computational tools designed to create bespoke solutions for problems faced by TE researchers [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5]</a>. In bulk RNA sequencing, the analysis of TEs has seen significant improvements, thanks to tools such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218879/">SalmonTE,</a> by Hyun-Hwan Jeong <em>et al</em>., and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624635/">SQuIRE</a>, by Wan R Yang <em>et al</em>. . These tools allow improved locus specific quantification, allowing for more precise data. Due to the more complicated nature of the resulting data, TE research using single cell sequencing continues to see improvements. Previously, Jiangping He and colleagues have made available the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21808-x">scTE pipeline</a>, which allowed for the quantification of TEs on a metagene level in single cell RNA-seq data. More recently, Rocío Rodríguez-Quiroz and Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana have published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04020-5">soloTE</a> , which can quantify TE expression in single cell data on a locus-specific level, leading to further refinement of such analysis. For analysis of retrotransposons which code for peptides, and thus contain speficic domain sequences, Mikhail Biryukov and Kirill Ustyantsev have created <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35052350/">DARTS</a> , for domain associated retrotransposon search in genome assemblies. Meanwhile, even more improved usage of such developed tools is possible. In a benchmark analysis involving multiple algorithms and pipelines, including the previously mentioned SQuIRE and SalmonTE, Natalia Savytska <em>et al</em>. have integrated transcription start site profile data to more accurately identify and quantify instance specific TE expression [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9633680/">6]</a>. Thanks to such innovations, there is hope that our understanding of TEs will soon see an acceleration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, TE research remains a vital, yet underappreciated field of study. Lowering the barriers to conducting and understanding TE research is an important prospect, requiring the contributions of many researchers in multiple biological disciplines. This is why we would like to attract your attention to our new <em><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Genomics</a> </em>collection, titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/transposons">Transposable elements</a>&#8220;, to shine a spotlight on our current and growing knowledge of TEs.</p>

<p>A study in the journal <em>Smart Materials in Medicine</em> has earned a retraction, seemingly not because of scholarly malfeasance or an inadvertent oversight, but because of a “lack of agreement on affiliation format.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crucial fact seems to be that almost all of the article’s authors, including its two senior authors, list affiliations in Taiwan, raising the question if the retraction is based on the geopolitical dispute about whether Taiwan is an independent nation or part of China.</p>



<p>The article, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183421000478">“Anti-microbial/oxidative/inflammatory nanogels accelerate chronic wound healing,”</a> was published online in late 2021. The journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science, although there are 10 citations of&nbsp; the article listed on the article’s web page as of January 12. There is no Twitter chatter indicating anything amiss with the article’s conclusions or methods, and no discussion about it on PubPeer.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when exactly the paper was retracted. Its cryptic retraction notice states:</p>



<span id="more-126390"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Due to the lack of agreement on affiliation format between authors and the owner of the journal, this article has been retracted at the request of all authors, the Editors-in-Chief and the owner of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Smart Materials in Medicine </em>is published by Elsevier on behalf of KeAi Communications, an open access publisher <a href="https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/about-us/contact/">based in Beijing</a>. According to KeAi’s <a href="https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/about-us/">website</a>, Elsevier cofounded the publisher with China Science Publishing &amp; Media Ltd, and the company “believe[s] in the global impact of research from China.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Chinese government has attempted to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/china-takes-big-publishers-world-class-journal-drive">influence scientific publishing</a> in other ways before, resulting in publishers “self-censoring content on ‘sensitive’ topics,” <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/depth/can-academic-publishers-resist-self-censorship-china">according to <em>Times Higher Education</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Elsevier did not reply to our requests for comment. We also did not hear back from the journal’s editor, Donghui Zhu of Stony Brook University in New York. The study’s corresponding authors &#8211; Huan-Tsung Chang of the National Taiwan University in Taipei and Chih-Ching Huang of the National Taiwan Ocean University and ​​Kaohsiung Medical University &#8211; also did not reply to our requests for comment. So the exact nature of the “lack of agreement on affiliation format” remains unknown.</p>



<p>That said, Elsevier includes this familiar disclaimer on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/smart-materials-in-medicine/about/editorial-board">journal’s editorial board listing</a>, though it doesn’t appear on the retracted article page:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All members of the Editorial Board have identified their affiliated institutions or organizations, along with the corresponding country or geographic region. Elsevier remains neutral with regard to any jurisdictional claims.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Update, 1730 UTC, January 17, 2023</strong>: Following publication of this post, Retraction Watch received a copy of an email that Qi Yi, the publisher of <em>Smart Materials in Medicine, </em>sent to all authors of the paper, on August 25, 2022. The email stated, in part, that a review of the latest papers in the journal found that for the article at issue, “there is no China added in the Taiwan authors’ affiliation. As a Chinese publisher, KeAi (the owner of Smart Materials in Medicine) shall be governed according to the policy which is that &#8216;China&#8217; must be added as the country.”</p>



<p>The email acknowledged that adding China as the country “may somehow jeopardize author’s position/career in Taiwan.” Yi wrote that he’d conferred with senior author Huang, and that Huang “has to propose to <strong>retract the paper</strong>.” (emphasis original) Yi’s email asked all the other authors if they agreed to retract, with a week to respond.</p>

                <p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://education.ucdavis.edu/young-scholars-program" target="_blank">UC Davis Young Scholars Program</a> is a summer residential program that provides high school students the opportunity to work one-on-one with research faculty in state-of-the-art labs for six weeks.

<p>Professor Guo, who was the chairman of the UC Davis Chemistry Department from 2016-2018, has been mentoring high school students for over a decade. Already in 2010, he was awarded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/diversity-reigns" target="_blank">Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community</a> by then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/10/uc-davis-chancellor-resigns-after-pepper-spray-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chancellor Linda Katehi</a>. In January of that year, he started mentoring a high school student, who had written to him asking whether she could shadow him at work for an assignment from her AP Chemistry teacher. She had written to several professors and he was the first to reply affirmatively.</p>

<p>In 2018, the high school student from 2010 who had shadowed Professor Guo for an AP Chemistry assignment, and was by then at UC Santa Barbara, contacted a USCB Police Department detective to report that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by Professor Guo in 2010. This is detailed in a lawsuit (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trellis.law/case/cv2020-1704/jane-doe-vs-ting-guo-board-regents-university-california-davis" target="_blank">CV2020-1704</a>) filed by the student against Professor Guo and the Board of Regents of the University of California, Davis. The filing describes an alleged incident on August 7, 2010, where the high school student (now the plaintiff) presented Professor Guo with some gifts (per her cultural custom) and offered to help him carry them home. At his house he allegedly offered her beer (which she declined because she was underage), and they apparently talked about Star Wars and his complete collection of the movies. Below is an excerpt from her statement to the UCSB police that is reproduced in the filing: </p>

<p>The plaintiff alleges that a few months later, by September 2010, she had been sexually assaulted three times:</p>

<p>The details are painful and poignant. After the second assault he allegedly offered her $60: &#8220;She refused and felt disrespected. But then he said to give it to her mom.&#8221; And as is often the case when massive power differentials are at play, the victim &#8220;carried on like normal- like nothing strange had happened because she did not want to face it or deal with it or process it. The plaintiff didn&#8217;t want to believe that Professor Guo was that kind of person.&#8221; </p>



<p>I was heartbroken reading the following passage describing the plaintiff&#8217;s frame of mind after the first sexual assault:</p>

<p>According to the filing, the report that was filed with police at UCSB followed therapy sessions and a meeting with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://care.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">CARE</a> counselor at UCSB. It included not only a statement by the victim, but text messages with friends about the events when they happened. The UCSB police forwarded the report to police at UC Davis, who spoke to Professor Guo. He denied anything had happened. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Turning a blind eye</strong></p>



<p>You might think, that UC Davis, which became aware of the allegations in 2018 when the UCSB police report was forwarded to the UC Davis police, and which certainly reviewed the allegations in the lawsuit filed in 2020, would <strong>at least protect</strong> <strong>high school students</strong> by not allowing Professor Guo to interact with them until the truth, or falsehood, of the allegations against him could be established. At universities, investigations of allegations against a professor can take a long time, and it is understandable that a university would afford professors a presumption of innocence until determination of guilt or innocence is complete (although to be clear, the timescale of investigations is frequently not reasonable at all). In any case, the possibility of guilt in a case where serious allegations of violence and sexual assault are alleged, demand protection of students in the interim. Protection, at a minimum, would entail not allowing Professor Guo to mentor high school students and refuse him the privilege of serving as a mentor in the Young Scholars Program. This would be a limitation, but not one that is very restrictive for a professor. Of course, one would hope that UC Davis would also protect undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, but again, <strong>at least, one would hope, UC Davis would protect high school students</strong>. However, UC Davis allowed Professor Guo to continue mentoring high school students up until 2021, as the Facebook post shown at the top of this post demonstrates. In fact, <strong>Professor Guo mentored a high school student</strong> by the name of Jonathan Ma in 2019,<strong> after UC Davis knew about the allegations against Professor Guo</strong>. Below is an excerpt from an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stltoday.com/pr/lifestyles/local-student-spends-summer-conducting-research-at-uc-davis/article_b4459e84-acff-11e9-9d86-5cb9017bdf7c.html" target="_blank">article in the the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> dated July 22, 2019 about the student and his summer experience in Professor Ting Guo&#8217;s lab:</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Tampering with evidence</strong></p>



<p><strong>In 2019 California changed the statute of limitations for adult survivors of sexual abuse from 3 years to 10 years</strong>. Assaults that occurred before January 1, 2019, can be held to the three-year limit. For this reason, the court sustained demurrers by Ting Guo and the Board of Regents of the University of California against the plaintiff in the CV2020-1704 lawsuit. There will be no trial to establish the truth or falsehood of the allegations.</p>



<p>Now suppose you were an administrator at UC Davis, and you believed that the allegations against Professor Ting Guo were <strong>FALSE</strong>. Suppose you believed that Professor Ting Guo was <strong>INNOCENT</strong>. Why would you tamper with websites simply showing that Professor Guo regularly mentored high school students via the UC Davis Youth Scholars Program? After all, you would believe him to be an <strong>INNOCENT</strong> man&#8230; so what would there be to hide? Well&#8230;it turns out that <strong>recently websites of the Youth Scholars Program were tampered with to remove all evidence of Professor Ting Guo&#8217;s involvement with the program</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br></p>



<p>For example, consider student Sean Wu who participated in the Youth Scholars Program in 2018, and was mentored by Professor Ting Guo:</p>

<p>Several other Youth Scholars Program high school students who worked in Professor Guo&#8217;s lab, and that had previously listed him as their mentor on the Youth Scholars Program websites, have just had their mentor retroactively changed to Jennifer Lien by edits to the website. These include Jonathan Ma (the student from 2019 who is mentioned above), and another student Susan Garcia (2017).  I wonder who chose Jennifer Lien to replace Ting Guo as the mentor of the students, in some cases more than 5 years after the fact.</p>



<p>Susan Garcia&#8217;s project was also deleted from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230112163316/https://ysprogram.ucdavis.edu/research-projects/2017?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this website</a>.

<p>In addition, the Facebook post shown at the top of this post, was also deleted. The cover up was sloppy (the need to scrub <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://nanofast.ucdavis.edu/alumni.html" target="_blank">Professor Guo&#8217;s website</a> was seemingly overlooked), but whoever did this clearly wanted to hide the fact that Professor Ting Guo mentored high school students via the Youth Scholars Program.</p>



<p>The digital tampering that was performed is reminiscent of one of the scandals that led to Chancellor Linda Katehi&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/embattled-university-of-california-davis-chancellor-resigns.html" target="_blank">resignation &#8220;under fire&#8221; in 2016</a>, when she was being investigated for using university money to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/disgraced-uc-davis-chancellor-katehi-obsessed-online-image-article-1.2746114" target="_blank">try to remove negative online search results about herself</a>. Seriously, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/11/06/an-outrage-at-uc-davis/" target="_blank">what is going on at UC Davis?</a> </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="Summary"><strong>The end</strong></p>



<p>In summary, a high school student working in UC Davis Chemistry professor Ting Guo&#8217;s lab in 2010 alleged in a police report filed in 2018 that she was sexually assaulted by him multiple times. In 2020, she filed a lawsuit against Professor Guo and The Board of Regents of the University of California, Davis. UC Davis continued to allow Professor Guo access to high school students via the Youth Scholars Program even after finding out about the serious allegations against him. Recently, websites of the Youth Scholars Program have been altered or deleted to remove any evidence showing that Professor Guo was ever a mentor in the program. </p>



<p>How many more such cases are there that have not see the light of day because evidence was more effectively tampered with? How many universities are wiping their records to hide evidence of their negligence in protecting students? How many more women must suffer? Will we ever see the end?</p>

                <p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release on January 12, 2023</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce a consortium agreement with Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) that allows member institutions to participate in PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models. This two-year agreement provides researchers affiliated with consortium members with unlimited publishing privileges in PLOS journals without them having to cover fees themselves. The TIB-led consortium has more than 40 members<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the first time that TIB has negotiated a consortial contract with a Gold OA publisher that is open to institutions across Germany. There was a clear need for an agreement that allows universities, universities of applied sciences and research institutions to centrally cover publication fees in PLOS journals for their researchers, and as consortial leader it is our mission to meet those needs. This partnership will play a key role in alleviating barriers for researchers when publishing their work Open Access, such as eliminating author-facing article processing charges (APCs) and including the entire PLOS portfolio under the deal,&rdquo; said Dr. Irina Sens,&nbsp;deputy director of TIB.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond APCs to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn4"><u>[4]</u></a>.</p>



<p><a>&ldquo;This agreement represents a new model for institutions to collaborate and invest equitably in our common interests in advancing Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;TIB shares our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The members of the TIB-led consortium join a growing list of institutions including the <a href="https://btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a>, the University of California system, <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">CRL</a> and <a href="https://nerl.org/">NERL</a>, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the <a href="https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en">Canadian Research Knowledge Network</a> <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hdl-good-cholesterol-heart-health">HDL ‘good’ cholesterol isn’t always good for heart health</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Good” and “bad” cholesterol: These well-known characters have long starred in the saga of heart health. But in a major plot twist, “good” cholesterol, it turns out, is not always so good.</p>



<p>In the last dozen years or so, research on the particles that carry so-called good cholesterol — known as high-density lipoprotein, or HDL — has presented a much more nuanced and conflicted story about HDL’s effect on cardiovascular disease.</p>



<p>And a new, large study brings fresh doubt. High levels of <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HDL cholesterol were not associated with protection against heart disease</a> in Black or white participants, researchers reported in the November <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology. </em>For low levels of HDL cholesterol, there was a split, with a link to higher risk of heart disease in white participants but not in Black participants.</p>





<p>The study is the first to find a difference in the risk tied to low levels of HDL cholesterol between Black and white people. It also adds to accumulating evidence that a high level of HDL cholesterol isn’t necessarily helpful for one’s heart health.</p>



<p>There appear to be other attributes of HDL that can be good. But researchers have also found that HDL’s role in health is complicated and ever-changing, with plenty to figure out.</p>



<h4>The link between HDL and heart disease isn’t clear-cut</h4>



<p>Cholesterol has long been explained as the “good” versus the “bad.” A high level of the “good” kind has been tied to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while having lots of the “bad” kind — carried by low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, particles — has been linked to a higher risk.</p>



<p>One of the big reports to bestow HDL cholesterol with the label of “good” came out of the Framingham Heart Study, a government-led effort launched in 1948 to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In 1977, Framingham researchers reported an <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/0002-9343(77)90874-9/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol and coronary disease risk</a> in a group made up of white participants.</p>



<p>But later studies undercut the premise that high levels are automatically good for heart health. People with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-cholesterol-may-not-be-what-keeps-heart-healthy">genetic mutation that boosts their HDL cholesterol level</a>, for example, do not have lower risk of heart attacks than people without the mutation (<em>SN: 5/18/12</em>). And a class of drugs developed to increase HDL cholesterol did a great job upping numbers, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6354546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t make a difference when it came to cardiovascular risk</a>.</p>





<p>A person’s HDL cholesterol level is just one part of the story, though. Commonly reported on blood tests, the level reflects the amount of cholesterol that HDL particles have on board. HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries to the liver to be excreted. This helps keep cholesterol from building up in artery walls, which can eventually impede blood flow.</p>



<p>Recently, research on HDL has started looking beyond its cholesterol payload. “The big understanding over the last decade or so is that while you can measure the cholesterol, it doesn’t really reflect the actual functions that HDL is doing in the body,” says Anand Rohatgi, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p>



<p>How well HDL removes cholesterol appears to matter. One measure of this job performance is HDL’s ability to receive cholesterol from a type of cell called a macrophage. In a U.S. study of close to 3,000 adults, 49 percent who were Black, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher this capacity, the lower the incidence of heart</a> attacks or strokes, Rohatgi and colleagues reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 2014.</p>



<p>Ridding the body of cholesterol is just one of HDL’s many jobs. HDL also has <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.312617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inflammatory and other protective effects</a> that appear to guard against cardiovascular disease. But even these effects don’t always lead to a net good. In certain circumstances, HDL can become dysfunctional, such that its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrcardio.2015.124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity to receive cholesterol is reduced</a>, and it contributes to inflammation. The fact that HDL’s roles can change, depending on the context, has made studying HDL particles challenging, Rohatgi says.</p>



<p>How well HDL performs is still far from something that can be tested as part of a regular physical exam. It’s not clear “how to do it yet for the general public,” says Nathalie Pamir, a researcher who studies cardiology at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland.</p>



<h4>The impact of HDL cholesterol on heart health may differ by race</h4>



<p>As researchers work toward a fuller understanding of HDL and how it might be better used as a clinical measure, the view of HDL cholesterol as uniformly “good” is still out there. And one’s HDL cholesterol level is still one entry in a widely used calculator that estimates cardiovascular risk. Pamir and her colleagues wanted to examine what high and low HDL cholesterol levels mean in a contemporary, diverse population.</p>



<p>In the new study, the team analyzed data from the REGARDS trial, designed to study potential regional and racial differences in death from stroke in the United States. The study included nearly 24,000 participants — of which 42 percent were Black — who did not start out with coronary heart disease. Over roughly 10 years, 664 out of 10,095 Black participants and 951 out of 13,806 white participants had a heart attack or died from one.</p>



<p>Increased levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol were tied to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, in line with past research, the team found. But for HDL cholesterol, high levels weren’t protective for anyone, and low levels were only predictive of higher risk in white people. That finding suggests it may be necessary to revisit how HDL cholesterol is used in the cardiovascular disease risk calculator, Pamir says.</p>



<p>Rather than just good, HDL cholesterol “is complicated,” she says. If a patient has high HDL cholesterol, a doctor “can say, ‘well, currently we don’t know what that means.’”</p>



<p>Although the study suggests that the impact of HDL cholesterol levels on disease risk may differ by race, it’s important to remember that race is a social construct, not a biological one, says Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p>



<p>Some of the risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure and smoking, “are more prevalent in self-described Black Americans,” he says. And a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-you-live-can-affect-your-blood-pressure-study-suggests">community’s access to health care, nutritious food and opportunities for education</a> and employment can influence those risk factors (<em>SN: 5/15/17</em>). “There is something unique about place and the history of place which may predispose to the burden of hypertension, obesity, even diabetes,” Yancy says.</p>



<p>It will take more research to understand what’s behind the potential race-based difference that the study reports, Yancy says, and what it means in terms of HDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk. But it remains the case that high levels of LDL cholesterol — which can accumulate in artery walls — are associated with an increased risk, he says. “The LDL cholesterol seems to be our most relevant barometer.”</p>



<p>For all that is known about what impacts cardiovascular disease risk, researchers still don’t have the full picture. The number of times that cardiologists see heart attacks in patients with normal cholesterol levels and normal blood pressure, Yancy says, suggests that, with current methods, “we’re not able to capture the entirety of the risk.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-green-pea-galaxies-universe">The James Webb telescope found ‘Green Pea’ galaxies in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Galaxies that helped transform the early universe may have been small, round and green.</p>



<p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have spotted <a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/AAS241_Mon1_JamesRhoads.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Green Pea” galaxies dating to 13.1 billion years ago</a>. These viridescent runts, spotted just 700 million years after the Big Bang, might have helped trigger one of the greatest makeovers in cosmic history, astronomers said at a January 9 news conference in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting.</p>



<p>Green Peas first showed up in 2009 in images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, an ambitious project to map much of the sky. Citizen science volunteers gave the objects their colorful name. Their greenish hue is because most of their light comes from glowing gas clouds, rather than directly from stars.</p>





<p>These galaxies are rare in the present-day universe. Astronomers think that the ones that do exist are analogs of galaxies that were more plentiful in the early universe.</p>



<p>“They’re a bit like living fossils,” said astrophysicist James Rhoads of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “Coelacanths, if you will,” referencing a fish thought to be extinct until it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/find-extinct-fish-alive-south-african-waters">showed up off the coast of South Africa in 1938</a> (<em>SN: 12/2/11</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These galaxies leak much more ultraviolet light, which can rip electrons from atoms, than typical galaxies do. So Green Peas dating to the universe’s first billion years or so could be partly responsible for a dramatic and mysterious cosmic transition called reionization, when most of the hydrogen atoms in the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reionization-hydrogen-galaxies-big-bang">had their electrons torn away</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Three ancient Green Peas turned up in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-galaxy-stars-data">JWST’s first image</a>, released in July 2022 (<em>SN: 7/21/22</em>). The objects look red in JWST’s infrared vision, but the wavelengths of light they emit are like those of the previously discovered Green Peas. The findings <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acaaaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were also published</a> in the Jan. 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“This helps us explain how the universe reionized,” Rhoads said. “I think this is an important piece of the puzzle.”</p>

<p>In the wake of a new law that bans “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences” in Russia, some journals have retracted articles they fear could attract state attention, a move a publishing watchdog in the country has called “self-censorship.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/28/russian-philosophy-journal-cites-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-in-retraction/">we reported</a> in December, the Russian philosophy journal <em>Logos</em> retracted an article about lesbian fashion magazines for being “in violation of standards,” citing the new ban.</p>



<p>More journals have followed suit, according to the Russian Council on Publication Ethics, which <a href="https://publication-ethics.ru/2022/12/declaration-on-retraction-misuse-eng/">issued a statement</a> decrying “retraction misuse” by journals in response to the law, though it also expressed concern for the safety of journal staff and authors if they ignored it. The statement began: </p>



<span id="more-126381"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After 24 February 2022, a situation has arisen in Russia in which legal requirements and legal enforcement practices may directly conflict with the norms of academic freedom and scientific integrity.</p>



<p>In these circumstances, some Russian journals take the path of self-censorship by retracting articles whose publication (in the view of the editors) could lead to sanctions from the state. A new wave of such retractions is associated with the effect of Federal Law of Russia No. 217471-8 «On Amendments to the Federal Law ‘On Information, Information Technologies and the Protection of Information’ and Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation (as regards the prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships and/or preferences)». The Council points out to the fact that scientific research may not be equated with propaganda and is bound to state that in these cases the retraction mechanism is used without convincing grounds. The purpose of retraction of scientific articles is to correct errors and reduce scientometric biases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Part of the statement appeared to directly reference the reason <em>Logos</em> offered for the retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is important to understand that what the editorial boards occasionally call retraction is not retraction. Self-invented wording («Publication of research in violation of the standards», etc.) in fact turns out to be self-censorship. Such and similar actions (deletion, concealment, withdrawal of publications) are irrelevant to maintaining the ethics of scientific publications, the integrity of scientific knowledge, and good scientific practice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retracted paper, “<a href="https://logosjournal.ru/upload/iblock/6bd/Logos%201-2022_Press-173-196.pdf">Looking good: The lesbian gaze and fashion imagery</a>,” appeared&nbsp; in a 2022 special issue of <em>Logos</em> on feminism and visuality. The article, by <a href="https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/579-reina-lewis/about">Reina Lewis</a> of the London College of Fashion, was a Russian translation of an article Lewis published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1057/fr.1997.6">the <em>Feminist Review</em></a> in 1997. Lewis told us she didn’t know the paper had been retracted until we emailed her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The translation still appears online, but the issue in which the paper appeared is no longer available on the journal’s website. An <a href="https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=48052624">entry</a> on the Russian database eLIBRARY indicates the article was retracted “due to the presence of signs that fall under the scope” of the new law, which carries significant fines for violations, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-parliament-passes-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-among-adults-2022-11-24/">according to Reuters</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement from the Russian Council on Publication Ethics continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe that the safety of journal staff and authors and the continuation of scientific publications in the current circumstances are important, so we understand their compelled action, to the very desire to avoid reprisals, but not to the distortion of ethical principles and publication procedures.</p>



<p>In terms of international practice, in similar circumstances, publishers may be advised to refer to the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radbruch_formula">legal formula of Gustav Radbruch</a>.</p>



<p>The Council on Publications Ethics, together with foreign partners, is currently looking for options allowing Russian journals to resolve this difficult situation with dignity, and asks that no precipitate decisions be taken.</p>



<p>We ask everyone to consider that Article 54 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states that the law establishing or aggravating liability has no retroactive force. No one can be held liable for an act which was not an offence at the time it was committed.</p>



<p>The Council deeply regrets this situation and is always ready to provide the necessary support.</p>

<p>An oral surgeon in Japan falsified images in several papers, granted authorship to whomever he saw fit and stored experimental data sloppily, according to an investigation by Showa University in Tokyo, where the physician was a lecturer at the time of the misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of the findings, the university has recommended retracting eight papers by the surgeon, Masayasu Iwase, according to a translation commissioned by Retraction Watch of a December <a href="https://www.showa-u.ac.jp/news/albums/abm.php?d=4820&amp;f=abm00039533.pdf&amp;n=%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%BB%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E6%A6%82%E8%A6%81.pdf">report</a> from the committee that investigated the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September 2021, the <em>International Journal of Cancer</em> issued <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33825">an expression of concern</a> about one of them, noting that it had also contacted the university &#8220;but no investigation was initiated.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Showa report states that a preliminary committee was established on July 16, 2021, to investigate concerns raised by &#8220;a journal editor-in-chief&#8221; who had contacted the university the previous day.</p>



<p>The committee&#8217;s investigation focuses on papers based on research by four of Iwase&#8217;s then-graduate students. The students&#8217; experimental data were stored on a shared computer, the report notes, but Iwase:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>did not have a clear rule on how to save data. Therefore, when he used the data, he was unsure which data was from which experiment. He said the data management was sloppy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The studies used β-actin as a control for Western blotting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>but Iwase did not consider it as important. So even though he was unsure about the link between the experiment and the β-actin image, he used it for the papers. As a result, the same image has been published in multiple papers as images of different experiments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report states that, at that time, another university instructor strictly emphasized the importance of the β-actin control to students, leading the committee to conclude that Iwase lacked &#8220;awareness of research integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The committee also asked a company specializing in image matching to check the images in the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company found that “what was described as different image data in the papers showed an extremely high matching rate,&#8221; leading to the conclusion that Iwase was guilty of &#8220;data falsification.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iwase, who, according to the report, &#8220;did not understand the authorship criteria at the time,&#8221; also appears to have wielded autocratic powers over which research was submitted for publication and who was listed as authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when someone gave advice on experimental techniques or the contents of a paper, he made them an author; a person responsible for the graduate program was also made an author. &#8220;However, Iwase does not recall why he chose someone in another research group as an author,&#8221; the report states.</p>



<p>When one student proved unable to write his dissertation in English, as required by his supervisor, Iwase himself wrote and submitted papers based on the student&#8217;s work, without offering further guidance to the student. As a result, the student &#8220;could not complete&#8221; his dissertation, according to the investigators, who add:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Masayasu Iwase sometimes showed the manuscript draft to some of the authors, but he did not give authors opportunities to check the contents and he submitted [the papers] without their approval.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iwase has been notified about the findings and has not contested them, according to the report, which does not identify any of the former students by name.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The committee doesn&#8217;t just point fingers at individuals, but also blames systemic issues at Showa University. During the period when the misconduct occurred, the institution &#8220;did not work hard&#8221; to promote research ethics and appropriate data management and authorship practices, the report states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another Showa researcher, anesthesiologist Hironobu Ueshima, previously was found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/28/anesthesiology-researcher-guilty-of-misconduct-in-more-than-140-papers-investigation/">fabricated data and tinkered with authorship</a> in 142 papers.</p>



<p>Today, extensive ethics education is mandatory for both graduate students and faculty at the university, according to the report, and the school has established an explicit authorship policy. In 2016, Showa University also introduced a set of regulations to prevent research misconduct, and random checks are being done to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>We will update this post if we hear more from Showa University about which papers it recommends for retraction.</p>



<p>Update, Jan. 12, 2022, 1430 UTC: Showa University provided this list of papers they recommended for retraction:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">Rare earth mining may be key to our renewable energy future. But at what cost?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In spring 1949, three prospectors armed with Geiger counters set out to hunt for treasure in the arid mountains of southern Nevada and southeastern California.</p>



<p>In the previous century, those mountains yielded gold, silver, copper and cobalt. But the men were looking for a different kind of treasure: uranium. The world was emerging from World War II and careening into the Cold War. The United States needed uranium to build its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mining homegrown sources became a matter of national security.</p>





<p>After weeks of searching, the trio hit what they thought was pay dirt. Their instruments detected intense radioactivity in brownish-red veins of ore exposed in a rocky outcrop within California’s Clark Mountain Range. But instead of uranium, the brownish-red stuff turned out to be bastnaesite, a mineral bearing fluorine, carbon and 17 curious elements known collectively as rare earths. Traces of radioactive thorium, also in the ore, had set the Geiger counters pinging.</p>



<p>As disappointing as that must have been, the bastnaesite still held value, and the prospectors sold their claim to the Molybdenum Corporation of America, later called Molycorp. The company was interested in mining the rare earths. During the mid-20th century, rare earth elements were becoming useful in a variety of ways: <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/58/cerium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cerium</a>, for example, was the basis for a glass-polishing powder and <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/63/europium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">europium</a> lent luminescence to recently invented color television screens and fluorescent lamps.</p>



<p>For the next few decades, the site, later dubbed Mountain Pass mine, was the world’s top source for rare earth elements, until two pressures became too much. By the late 1980s, China was intensively mining its own rare earths — and selling them at lower prices. And a series of toxic waste spills at Mountain Pass brought production at the struggling mine to a halt in 2002.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the story. The green-tech revolution of the 21st century brought new attention to Mountain Pass, which later reopened and remains the only U.S. mine for rare earths.</p>



<p>Rare earths are now integral to the manufacture of many carbon-neutral technologies — plus a whole host of tools that move the modern world. These elements are the building blocks of small, super­efficient permanent magnets that keep smartphones buzzing, wind turbines spinning, electric vehicles zooming and more.</p>

<h3>Rare earths’ journey from mine to magnet</h3>



<p>Here are the steps that get rare earth elements out of the ground and into our hi-tech products. While the United States mines and concentrates rare earths, later steps needed to make magnets currently happen overseas.</p>

<p>Mining U.S. sources of rare earth elements, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Joe Biden’s administration stated in February 2021</a>, is a matter of national security.</p>



<p>Rare earths are not actually rare on Earth, but they tend to be scattered throughout the crust at low concentrations. And the ore alone is worth relatively little without the complex, often environmentally hazardous processing involved in converting the ore into a usable form, says Julie Klinger, a geographer at the University of Delaware in Newark. As a result, the rare earth mining industry is wrestling with a legacy of environmental problems.</p>



<p>Rare earths are mined by digging vast open pits in the ground, which can contaminate the environment and disrupt ecosystems. When poorly regulated, mining can produce wastewater ponds filled with acids, heavy metals and radioactive material that might leak into groundwater. Processing the raw ore into a form useful to make magnets and other tech is a lengthy effort that takes large amounts of water and potentially toxic chemicals, and produces voluminous waste.</p>



<p>“We need rare earth elements … to help us with the transition to a climate-safe future,” says Michele Bustamante, a sustainability researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C. Yet “everything that we do when we’re mining is impactful environmentally,” Bustamante says.</p>



<p>But there are ways to reduce mining’s footprint, says Thomas Lograsso, a metallurgist at the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the director of the <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/cmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Materials Institute</a>, a Department of Energy research center. Researchers are investigating everything from reducing the amount of waste produced during the ore processing to improving the efficiency of rare earth element separation, which can also cut down on the amount of toxic waste. Scientists are also testing alternatives to mining, such as recycling rare earths from old electronics or recovering them from coal waste.</p>



<p>Much of this research is in partnership with the mining industry, whose buy-in is key, Lograsso says. Mining companies have to be willing to invest in making changes. “We want to make sure that the science and innovations that we do are driven by industry needs, so that we’re not here developing solutions that nobody really wants,” he says.</p>



<p>Klinger says she’s cautiously optimistic that the rare earth mining industry can become less polluting and more sustainable, if such solutions are widely adopted. “A lot of gains come from the low-hanging fruit,” she says. Even basic hardware upgrades to improve insulation can reduce the fuel required to reach the high temperatures needed for some processing. “You do what you [can].”</p>



<h4>The environmental impact of rare earth mining</h4>



<p>Between the jagged peaks of California’s Clark range and the Nevada border sits a broad, flat, shimmering valley known as the Ivanpah Dry Lake. Some 8,000 years ago, the valley held water year-round. Today, like many such playas in the Mojave Desert, the lake is ephemeral, winking into appearance only after an intense rain and flash flooding. It’s a beautiful, stark place, home to endangered desert tortoises and rare desert plants like Mojave milkweed.</p>



<p>From about 1984 to 1998, the Ivanpah Dry Lake was also a holding pen for wastewater piped in from Mountain Pass. The wastewater was a by-product of chemical processing to concentrate the rare earth elements in the mined rock, making it more marketable to companies that could then extract those elements to make specific products. Via a buried pipeline, the mine sent wastewater to evaporation ponds about 23 kilometers away, in and around the dry lake bed.</p>

<p>The pipeline repeatedly ruptured over the years. At least 60 separate spills dumped an estimated 2,000 metric tons of wastewater containing radioactive thorium into the valley. Federal officials feared that local residents and visitors to the nearby Mojave National Preserve might be at risk of exposure to that thorium, which could lead to increased risk of lung, pancreatic and other cancers. </p>



<p>Unocal Corporation, which had acquired Molycorp in 1977, was ordered to clean up the spill in 1997, and the company paid over $1.4 million in fines and settlements. Chemical processing of the raw ore ground to a halt. Mining operations stopped shortly afterward.</p>



<p>Half a world away, another environmental disaster was unfolding. The vast majority — between 80 and 90 percent — of rare earth elements on the market since the 1990s have come from China. One site alone, the massive Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, accounted for 45 percent of rare earth production in 2019.</p>



<p>Bayan Obo spans some 4,800 hectares, about half the size of Florida’s Walt Disney World resort. It is also one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth. Clearing the land to dig for ore meant removing vegetation in an area already prone to desertification, allowing the Gobi Desert to creep southward.</p>



<p>In 2010, officials in the nearby city of Baotou noted that radioactive, arsenic- and fluorine-containing mine waste, or tailings, was being dumped on farmland and into local water supplies, as well as into the nearby Yellow River. The air was polluted by fumes and toxic dust that reduced visibility. Residents complained of nausea, dizziness, migraines and arthritis. Some had skin lesions and discolored teeth, signs of prolonged exposure to arsenic; others exhibited signs of brittle bones, indications of skeletal fluorosis, Klinger says.</p>



<p>The country’s rare earth industry was causing “severe damage to the ecological environment,” China’s State Council wrote in 2010. The release of heavy metals and other pollutants during mining led to “the destruction of vegetation and pollution of surface water, groundwater and farmland.” The “excessive rare earth mining,” the council wrote, led to landslides and clogged rivers.</p>



<p>Faced with these mounting environmental disasters, as well as fears that it was depleting its rare earth resources too rapidly, China slashed its export of the elements in 2010 by 40 percent. The new limits sent prices soaring and kicked off concern around the globe that China had too tight of a stranglehold on these must-have elements. That, in turn, sparked investment in rare earth mining elsewhere.</p>



<p>In 2010, there were few other places mining rare earths, with only minimal production from India, Brazil and Malaysia. <a href="https://lynasrareearths.com/about-us/locations/mt-weld-western-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new mine in remote Western Australia came online</a> in 2011, owned by mining company Lynas. The company dug into fossilized lava preserved within an ancient volcano called Mount Weld.</p>



<p>Mount Weld didn’t have anywhere near the same sort of environmental impact seen in China: Its location was too remote and the mine was just a fraction of the size of Bayan Obo, according to Saleem Ali, an environmental planner at the University of Delaware. The United States, meanwhile, was eager to once again have its own source of rare earths — and Mountain Pass was still the best prospect.</p>

<h4>Mountain Pass mine gets revived</h4>



<p>After the Ivanpah Dry Lake mess, the Mountain Pass mine changed hands again. Chevron purchased it in 2005, but did not resume operations. Then, in 2008, a newly formed company called Molycorp Minerals purchased the mine with ambitious plans to create a complete rare earth supply chain in the United States.</p>



<p>The goal was not just mining and processing ore, but also separating out the desirable elements and even manufacturing them into magnets. Currently, the separations and magnet manufacturing are done overseas, mostly in China. The company also proposed a plan to avoid spilling wastewater into nearby fragile habitats. Molycorp resumed mining, and introduced a “dry tailings” process — a method to squeeze 85 percent of the water out of its mine waste, forming a thick paste. The company would then store the immobilized, pasty residue in lined pits on its own land and recycle the water back into the facility.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Molycorp “was an epic debacle” from a business perspective, says Matt Sloustcher, senior vice president of communications and policy at <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP Materials</a>, current owner of Mountain Pass mine. Mismanagement ultimately led Molycorp to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015. MP Materials bought the mine in 2017 and resumed mining later that year. By 2022, Mountain Pass mine was producing 15 percent of the world’s rare earths.</p>



<p>MP Materials, too, has an ambitious agenda with plans to create a complete supply chain. And the company is determined not to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors. “We have a world-class … unbelievable deposit, an untapped potential,” says Michael Rosenthal, MP Materials’ chief operating officer. “We want to support a robust and diverse U.S. supply chain, be the magnetics champion in the U.S.”</p>



<h4>The challenges of separating rare earths</h4>



<p>On a hot morning in August, Sloustcher stands at the edge of the Mountain Pass mine, a giant hole in the ground, 800 meters across and up to 183 meters deep, big enough to be visible from space. It’s an impressive sight, and a good vantage point from which to describe a vision for the future. He points out the various buildings: where the ore is crushed and ground, where the ground rocks are chemically treated to slough off as much non–rare earth material as possible, and where the water is squeezed from that waste and the waste is placed into lined ponds.</p>



<p>The end result is a highly concentrated rare earth oxide ore — still nowhere near the magnet-making stage. But the company has a three-stage plan “to restore the full rare earth supply to the United States,” from “mine to magnet,” Rosenthal says. Stage 1, begun in 2017, was to restart mining, crushing and concentrating the ore. Stage 2 will culminate in the chemical separation of the rare earth elements. And stage 3 will be magnet production, he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Sources of rare earth elements over time</h3>



<p>In the mid-20th century, the U.S. Mountain Pass mine was the world’s top source for rare earth oxides. China began to dominate global production in the 1990s. In the last decade, the return of Mountain Pass along with the opening of Australia’s Mount Weld and production in Myanmar, Brazil and other locations have begun to shift that balance.</p>

<p>Since coming online in 2017, MP Materials has shipped its concentrated ore to China for the next steps, including the arduous, hazardous process of separating the elements from one another. But in November, the company announced to investors that it had <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begun the preliminary steps for stage 2, a “major milestone”</a> on the way to realizing its mine-to-magnet ambitions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With investments from the U.S. Department of Defense</a>, the company is building two separations facilities. One plant will pull out lighter rare earth elements — those with smaller atomic numbers, including neodymium and praseodymium, both of which are key ingredients in the permanent magnets that power electric vehicles and many consumer electronics. MP Materials has additional grant money from the DOD to design and build a second processing plant to split apart the heavier rare earth elements such as dysprosium, also an ingredient in magnets, and yttrium, used to make superconductors and lasers.</p>



<p>Like stage 2, stage 3 is already under way. In 2022, the company broke ground in Fort Worth, Texas, for a facility to produce neodymium magnets. And it inked a deal with General Motors to supply those magnets for electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>But separating the elements comes with its own set of environmental concerns.</p>



<p>The process is difficult and leads to lots of waste. Rare earth elements are extremely similar chemically, which means they tend to stick together. Forcing them apart requires multiple sequential steps and a variety of powerful solvents to separate them one by one. Caustic sodium hydroxide causes cerium to drop out of the mix, for example. Other steps involve solutions containing organic molecules called ligands, which have a powerful thirst for metal atoms. The ligands can selectively bind to particular rare earth elements and pull them out of the mix.</p>



<p>But one of the biggest issues plaguing this extraction process is its inefficiency, says Santa Jansone-Popova, an organic chemist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The scavenging of these metals is slow and imperfect, and companies have to go through a lot of extraction steps to get a sufficiently marketable amount of the elements. With the current chemical methods, “you need many, many, many stages in order to achieve the desired separation,” Jansone-Popova says. That makes the whole process “more complex, more expensive, and [it] produces more waste.”</p>



<p>Under the aegis of the DOE’s Critical Materials Institute, Jansone-Popova and her colleagues have been hunting for a way to make the process more efficient, eliminating many of those steps. In 2022, the researchers identified a ligand that they say is much more efficient at snagging certain rare earths than the ligands now used in the industry. Industry partners are on board to try out the new process this year, she says.</p>



<p>In addition to concerns about heavy metals and other toxic materials in the waste, there are lingering worries about the potential impacts of radioactivity on human health. The trouble is that there is still only limited epidemiological evidence of the impact of rare earth mining on human and environmental health, according to Ali, and much of that evidence is related to the toxicity of heavy metals such as arsenic. It’s also not clear, he says, how much of the concerns over radioactive waste are scientifically supported, due to the low concentration of radioactive elements in mined rare earths.</p>



<p>Such concerns get international attention, however. In 2019, protests erupted in Malaysia over what activists called “a mountain of toxic waste,” about 1.5 million metric tons, produced by a rare earth separation facility near the Malaysian city of Kuantan. The facility is owned by Lynas, which ships its rare earth ore from Australia’s Mount Weld to the site. To dissolve the rare earths, the ore is cooked with sulfuric acid and then diluted with water. The residue that’s left behind can contain traces of radioactive thorium.</p>

<p>Lynas had no permanent storage for the waste, piling it up in hills near Kuantan instead. But the alarm over the potential radioactivity in those hills may be exaggerated, experts say. Lynas reports that workers at the site are exposed to less than 1.05 millisieverts per year, far below the radiation exposure threshold for workers of 20 millisieverts set by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of misinformation about by­products such as thorium.… The thorium from rare earth processing is actually very low-level radiation,” Ali says. “As someone who has been a committed environmentalist, I feel right now that there’s not much science-based decision making on these things.”</p>



<p>Given the concerns over new mining, environmental think tanks like the World Resources Institute have been calling for more recycling of existing rare earth materials to reduce the need for new mining and processing.</p>



<p>“The path to the future has to do with getting the most out of what we take out of the ground,” says Bustamante, of the NRDC. “Ultimately the biggest lever for change is not in the mining itself, but in the manufacturing, and what we do with those materials at the end of life.”</p>



<p>That means using mined resources as efficiently as possible, but also recycling rare earths out of already existing materials. Getting more out of these materials can reduce the overall environmental impacts of the mining itself, she adds. </p>



<p>That is a worthwhile goal, but recycling isn’t a silver bullet, Ali says. For one thing, there aren’t enough spent rare earth–laden batteries and other materials available at the moment for recycling. “Some mining will be necessary, [because] right now we don’t have the stock.” And that supply problem, he adds, will only grow as demand increases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">Why it’s easier to catch a cold, the flu or COVID in the winter</a></h4>

              
                <p>When bitter winds blew and temperatures dropped, my grandmother would urge me to come inside. “You’ll catch your death of cold out there,” she’d say.</p>



<p>Sure, freezing to death is possible in frigid temperatures. But doctors and other health experts have long stressed that <em>being</em> cold won’t give you a cold. Still, winter is undisputedly cold-and-flu season. It’s also a period when COVID-19 spreads more.</p>



<p>But if the chill doesn’t matter, why does the spread of so many respiratory viruses peak during the season?</p>





<p>“I’ve spent the past 13 years looking into this question,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies viruses in the air. “The deeper we go, the more I realize we don’t know [and] the more there is to figure out.”</p>



<p>She and I are not alone. “That wintertime seasonality has puzzled people for a very long time; thousands of years, to be honest,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases researcher who directs the Climate and Health Program at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.</p>



<p>There is some evidence that winter’s shorter days may make people more susceptible to infection, he says. Less sunlight means people make less vitamin D, which is required for some immune responses. But that’s just one piece of the puzzle.</p>



<p>Scientists are also looking at what other factors may play a role in making winter a sickening season.</p>



<h4>Illness may spread more inside.</h4>



<p>My grandma’s well-intentioned urging to come in from the cold may have instead increased the risk that I’d get sick.</p>





<p>Colds, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are all illnesses that are more prevalent at certain times of year when people spend more time inside. That includes winter in temperate climates, where there are distinct seasons, and rainy seasons in tropical zones. COVID-19 also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">spreads more indoors</a> than outside (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Those diseases are caused by viruses that are transmitted primarily through <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breathing in small droplets known as aerosols</a>. That’s a change in thinking. Many scientists thought until very recently that such viruses were spread mainly by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">touching contaminated surfaces</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>).</p>



<p>“When you’re outdoors, you’re in the ultimate well-ventilated space,” says David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Viruses exhaled outside are diluted quickly with clean air.</p>



<p>But inside, aerosols and the viruses they contain can build up. “When you’re in a poorly ventilated space, the air you breathe in is often air that other people have breathed out,” he says.</p>



<p>Since viruses come along with that exhaled breath, “it makes a lot of sense that proximity to individuals who might be contagious would facilitate transmission,” Shaman says.</p>



<p>But there is more to the story, says Benjamin Bleier, a specialist for sinus and nasal disorders at Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>“In modern society, we’re indoors all year round,” he says.</p>



<p>To drive the seasonal pattern we see year after year, something else must be going on too to make people more susceptible to infection and increase the amount of virus circulating, he says.</p>



<h4>Drier air can give some viruses a boost.</h4>



<p>Some viruses thrive in winter. But the reason why may not be so much about temperature, but humidity.</p>



<p>“There are some viruses that like it warm and wet, and some viruses like it dry and cold,” says Donald Milton, an aerobiologist at the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. For instance, rhinoviruses — one of the many types of viruses that cause colds — survive better when it is humid. Cases of rhinovirus infection typically peak in early fall, he says.</p>



<p>Marr and other researchers have found that viruses that surge in the winter, including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — survive best when the relative humidity in the air falls below about 40 percent.</p>



<p>Viruses aren’t usually floating around naked, Marr says. They are encased in droplets of fluid, such as saliva. Those droplets also have bits of mucus, proteins, salt and other substances in them. Those other components may determine if the virus survives drying.</p>



<p>When the humidity is higher, droplets dry slowly. Such <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501658v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow drying kills viruses</a> such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, Marr and colleagues reported July 27 in a preprint at&nbsp;bioRxiv.org. During slow drying, salt and other things that may harm the virus become more concentrated, although researchers still don’t fully understand what’s happening at the molecular scale to inactivate the virus.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;flash drying in parched air preserves&nbsp;those viruses. “If the air is very dry, the water quickly evaporates. Everything is dried down, and it’s almost like things are frozen in place,” Marr says.</p>

<h3>How humidity affects airborne droplets</h3>



<p>At low humidity levels, airborne droplets, or aerosols, dry quickly (left), preserving viruses under a feathery crystalline lattice, as this microscope image shows. At intermediate humidity levels, crystals form inside liquid droplets (middle), but those crystals may inactivate viruses, not preserve them. At high humidity levels (right), aerosols remain liquid, allowing viruses to survive better than at midlevel humidity. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dryer, smaller aerosols are also more buoyant and may hang in the air longer, increasing the chance that someone will breathe them in, Fisman says.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, dry air can tear down some of people’s defenses against viruses. Studies in animals suggest that <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dry air can trigger death of some cells</a> lining the airways. That could leave cracks where viruses can invade.</p>



<p>Mucus in the airways can trap viruses and help protect against infection. But breathing cold, dry air can also slow the system that usually moves mucus out of the body. That may give viruses time to break out of the mucus trap and invade cells, Fisman says.</p>



<h4>Cold may harm our ability to fight off viruses.</h4>



<p>Being cold may not give you a cold, but it could make you more susceptible to catching one.</p>



<p>Normally, the immune system has a trick for warding off viruses, Bleier and colleagues recently discovered. Cells in the nose and elsewhere in the body are studded with surface proteins that can detect viruses. When one of these sensor proteins sees a virus coming, it signals the cell to release tiny bubbles called extracellular vesicles.</p>



<p>The bubbles work as a diversionary tactic, a bit like chaff being released from a military jet trying to avoid a heat-seeking missile, Bleier says. Viruses may go after the vesicles instead of infecting cells.</p>



<p>If a virus docks with one of the bubbles, it’s in for a surprise: Inside the vesicles are virus-killing bits of RNA called microRNAs. One of those microRNAs known as <em>miR-17</em> could kill two types of rhinoviruses and a cold-causing coronavirus, the team reported December 6 in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How cold weather affects the immune system</h3>



<p>The immune system has a diversionary tactic to keep viruses from infecting cells in the nose:&nbsp;When viruses (black and gray spheres) are detected, nasal cells&nbsp;release bubbles called extracellular vesicles (blue circles). These bubbles are studded with proteins (red, blue and black shapes on blue circles) that are normally found on the surface of nasal cells. Viruses may go after the bubbles instead of infecting cells. When temperatures in the nose drop below body temperature (right), cells release fewer bubbles, making it easier for viruses to find and infect nasal cells.</p>

<p>Researchers measured bubbles released from human nasal cells grown in lab dishes at 37° Celsius, our typical body temperature. Then the scientists lowered the thermostat to 32° C. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cells released about 42 percent fewer vesicles</a> at the cooler temperature, the team found. What’s more, those vesicles carried fewer weapons. Vesicles can pack in about 24 percent more microRNA at body temperature than when it is cooler.</p>



<h4>Three tips to bolster our immune system.</h4>



<p>I asked the experts what people can do to protect themselves from viruses in the winter. Some said using a humidifier might help raise moisture levels enough to slow the drying of virus-laden droplets, killing the viruses.</p>



<p>“Any increase in humidity should be beneficial,” says Shaman. “You get a lot of bang for your buck if you go from very dry to dry.”</p>



<p>But Milton doesn’t think it’s a good idea to pump a lot of moisture into a house when it is cold outside. “That humidity is going to find all of the cold spaces in your house and condense there,” creating a breeding ground for mold and rot, he says.</p>



<p>Instead, he advocates turning on kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans to increase ventilation and to use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">HEPA filters or Corsi-Rosenthal boxes</a> to filter unwanted viruses out of the air (<em>SN: 7/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Bleier suggests wearing a mask. Not only can masks filter out viruses, but “our work suggests these masks have a second mechanism of action,” he says. “They keep a cushion of warm [moist] air in front of our noses, which could help bolster the immune system.”</p>

                Flu meds and prescription drugs have been in short supply all winter—but the problem goes back over a decade.
