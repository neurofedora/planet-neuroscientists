                <p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s been only three years since we launched our first partnership models at PLOS. After adding five new journals to our portfolio in 2021, and introducing our Global Equity model to support regional equitable Open Access publishing, we saw explosive growth in our partnerships program and we&rsquo;re very excited to report that we&rsquo;re still growing!</p>



<p>Since our last <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">progress update</a>, we&rsquo;ve welcomed 107 new institutions to our program&ndash;including our first partners in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/05/plos-expands-footprint-in-europe-with-a-publishing-agreement-in-italy/">Italy </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/plos-announces-publishing-agreement-with-the-largest-research-institution-in-mexico/">Mexico</a>. As of today, we have nearly 300 partners across 28 countries, working alongside PLOS to reduce the burden of APCs on authors and eliminate barriers to Open Access publishing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="417" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21590" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png 800w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-300x156.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>



<p> Authors based in Research4Life countries also automatically publish in our journals at <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">reduced or no cost</a>.  </p>



<p><strong>Why are PLOS models different?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has always been a nonprofit, fully Open Access publisher working to ensure anyone can access, learn from, share and reuse rigorous, high-quality research. While our articles have always been open to everyone to read, lack of consistent funding for APCs has created a barrier for many researchers. In the wider industry, the dominance of pay-per-article models has increased pressure on academic volume output to generate profits, and created opportunities for exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to do things better.</p>



<p>Our models are designed to address critical challenges to inclusion in Open Access publishing that are a byproduct of the APC system: equitably distributing the cost of selective publishing, providing regionally equitable ways to ensure our inclusive journals represent researchers from all backgrounds; and streamlining the support system for libraries to reduce administrative burdens. All PLOS journals offer APC-alternatives through these partnerships, including our new launches <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> and <em>PLOS Mental Health</em> which will be supported by our Global Equity model and Flat Fee Agreements respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited by the enthusiasm we&rsquo;ve seen from the scholarly community for these models, and to have the opportunity to welcome so many new partners. Each new partnership is a step towards making Open Access publishing more equitable and inclusive. As we expand our portfolio this year, and continue to innovate on our models and services for both authors and their institutions, we hope to see this trend continue until cost is no longer a barrier for any author who wants to make their work open.<br></p>



<p><strong>Together, we&rsquo;re building the future of Open Access publishing</strong></p>



<p>Our work wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the support of the librarians who work with us now, and who we hope to work with in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To truly change the scholarly landscape, we need to work together on solutions that are sustainable for all stakeholders. Since we developed our first APC-alternative models in 2020, we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to improve our services, understand and support their needs so that the cost of Open Access publishing is managed more equitably and sustainably through effective partnership. Together we can rewrite the system.</p>



<p>Your feedback and support is what makes this growth possible. We want to thank all of our partners for their commitment to Open Access and support of their researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/catalog-human-cells-math-pattern">A catalog of all human cells reveals a mathematical pattern</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human body is made up of a complex community of trillions of cells of diverse shapes and sizes, all working together to keep you alive. The smallest of these cells, like platelets and red blood cells, are dwarfed by massive muscle cells. When it comes to size, it’s like comparing a shrew to a blue whale.</p>



<p>Now, after collecting data on all of the major types of cells in the body, researchers have revealed a familiar mathematical pattern in these cells’ relationship. There is an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303077120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inverse relationship between cell size and number</a>, meaning smaller cells are more numerous than larger cells. What’s more, cells of different size classes all have a similar total mass, such that small, numerous cells such as red blood cells contribute the same amount to the body’s total mass as the largest cells, the researchers report September 18 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“We see this pattern all over the place,” across disparate fields, says Ian Hatton, an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal.</p>



<p>The pattern between size and number “has lots of different names,” he says. In ecology, it’s often called the Sheldon spectrum after marine ecologist Raymond Sheldon. Sheldon and his colleagues discovered that when you <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.4319/lo.1972.17.3.0327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort plankton by size</a> in orders of magnitude on a logarithmic scale, each size class has the same mass of organisms. As you go up in size, the number of individuals in a class drops, but the overall mass is unchanged.</p>



<p>In 2021, Hatton and colleagues showed that the same pattern exists when you sort <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abh3732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biomass of ocean organisms generally</a> on a logarithmic scale, “from bacteria to whales,” not just plankton.</p>



<p>A parallel trend may also be seen in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-014-0585-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequency of words used in language</a>, where it’s known as Zipf’s law after linguist George Zipf. &nbsp;For example, if you analyze the words used in a book, you’ll find it dominated by a few, short, high-frequency words (like “the” and “of”) with many longer, low-frequency words (like “trombone” and “parliament”) making up the rest.</p>



<p>Finding this pattern in human cells took a <a href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colossal amount of data.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It might sound surprising that we still don&#8217;t understand cell size well,” says Evgeny Zatulovskiy, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study. The new study “provides a very comprehensive catalog of different cell types in our body regarding their counts and their size.”</p>



<p>Independent researcher Jeffery Shander first started assembling this data more than a decade ago. Much of it comes from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which has autopsied countless cadavers and weighed their organs to build a reference model of a person.</p>



<p>But “the ICRP focused on the male model,” Hatton says. He and his colleagues wanted to estimate information for a typical human female and child as well. That, along with the fact that the ICRP was focused on organs and tissues rather than cells, meant turning to the scientific literature.</p>



<p>In total, the researchers gathered data from more than 1,500 sources to show that the inverse size-number pattern is present in the cells of a typical man, woman and child. Overall, the researchers estimate that an adult male is made up of around 36 trillion cells, on average, while a female is composed of 28 trillion cells, and a 10-year-old child has 17 trillion cells.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bodys-bacteria-dont-outnumber-human-cells-so-much-after-all">estimates are similar to ones from prior studies</a>, including ones that looked at fewer cell and tissue types, because of the overwhelming presence of small blood cells (<em>SN: 1/8/16</em>).</p>





<p><s>I</s>t’s important to understand how many of each type of cell there is. For instance, the team found that the total number of lymphocytes in the body had been severely underestimated — instead of 500 billion, there may be as many as 2 trillion. “Lymphocytes are implicated in all sorts of defense against disease,” Hatton says, and understanding their total number is important for individuals with conditions like leukemia and HIV. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, cell number is determined by cell division, a process that, when it goes haywire, leads to cancer. Understanding basic features of cells like size and number, Hatton says, “could help us understand abnormalities.”</p>



<p>Even though it’s been seen in language, ocean biomass and now human cells, the origins of the inverse size-number pattern are still a puzzle. But Hatton says its commonality “might be implying that there&#8217;s some deep, underlying mechanism that could be common to all these different things. But we&#8217;re not there yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-gyroscope-length-day-earth-physics">A laser gyroscope measured tiny variations in the lengths of days on Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some days really are longer than others. And now scientists know by precisely how much.</p>



<p>Using a laser gyroscope, scientists have measured variations in Earth’s rotation rate smaller than a millionth of a percent. The technique could help scientists understand the complex flows of water and air that cause the tiniest of tweaks to the planet’s spin.</p>



<p>Earth’s rotation isn’t perfectly steady. The planet speeds up and slows down as it twirls, making a day slightly shorter or longer by several milliseconds. Many of those variations are well understood. For example, one such variation is caused by tidal forces, created by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, that deform the planet. Scientists know how to predict those effects on Earth’s rotation. But other variations, caused by the fluctuating flows of Earth’s atmosphere and waters, are more difficult to estimate.</p>





<p>The gyroscope, known as “G” and located at the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell in Germany, is designed to measure those tiny effects. It’s what’s called a ring laser gyroscope. Within it, laser beams travel around a square-shaped ring that is 4 meters on each side. One beam circulates clockwise while another goes counterclockwise. Beams aligned with the direction of Earth’s rotation have their wavelength stretched out, while those traveling against it shrink. When combined, the two beams at slightly different wavelengths create a “beat” signal, just as two slightly out-of-tune notes do. That beat reveals the rate of Earth’s rotation, allowing G to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01286-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure the length of a day to better than a millisecond</a>, the researchers report September 18 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>.</p>



<p>Other methods for measuring the Earth’s rotation rate rely on outside references. For example, telescopes can use the locations of distant quasars — the bright cores of active galaxies — to determine how much Earth has rotated. But those techniques give results averaged over a day. G measures a rotation rate every few hours. And its measurements are made from an underground lab. No view of the outside world is needed, says physicist Ulrich Schreiber of the Technical University of Munich, “because a gyroscope measures rotation, absolute.” That is, it measures rotation not relative to some other reference but the rotation itself.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously measured Earth’s spin and tilt with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-underground-motion-sensor-germany-earth-rotation-spin-tilt">other laser gyroscopes</a>&nbsp; (<em>SN: 7/17/20</em>). But they haven’t measured the length of day to the high precision achieved by G. The gyroscope is also stable enough to operate for months on end, allowing researchers to tease out variations that occur on long timescales.</p>



<p>G’s capabilities are unique: “It is a measurement which was considered not possible with other detectors,” says physicist Angela Di Virgilio of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Pisa, Italy, who was not involved with the new study. “So it is good that they have obtained some results from this impressive instrument.”</p>



<p>Such measurements could help scientists refine their models of Earth’s air circulation and ocean currents. In the future, scientists hope to be able to measure even more elusive effects with improved ring laser gyroscopes. According to Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a rotating planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wobbling-orbit-pulsar-proves-einstein-right-again-relativity">drags spacetime along with it</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/20</em>). Ring laser gyroscopes might one day sense the twists and turns of spacetime.</p>

There is a need for increased knowledge of the neuroanatomical, humoral, immune and metabolic pathways that the brain and lung use to talk to each other. Therefore, <a class="is-external" href="https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</em></a> has launched a call for papers to bring together research on the mechanisms underlying crosstalk between the brain and the lungs as well as studies investigating the epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of lung disorders in brain-injured patients to create an open access resource for all those interested in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">Interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (experiments)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (<strong>BTSP</strong>) is a form of <strong>single-shot learning</strong> observed in hippocampal place cells in mice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015,</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan3846">2017</a>). The idea is that post-synaptic activations (“<strong>eligibility traces</strong>”) are potentiated by a <strong>dendritic plateau potential/burst </strong>(“<strong>instructive signal</strong>”) that comes up to several seconds after the first signal. This result turned out to be one of the most reproducible findings of recent systems neuroscience, being replicable across labs and across stimulation protocols (via single-cell electrophysiology (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015</a>) but also via optogenetic induction (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1670">O’Hare et al., 2022</a>)). Many different labs are working in this interesting field, and here are a few recent papers on this topic.</p>



<p><strong>A role for CaMKII in BTSP</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.18.537377">Xiao et al. (2023)</a> from the Magee lab report on a “critical role for CaMKII” in BTSP. “CaMKII” is known as a promotor fragment that is specific for excitatory neurons, but CaMKII is more than that – CaMKII is a calcium-dependent kinase (but see the recent paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06465-y">Tullis et al. (2023)</a>) with important functions for plasticity. After phosphorylation, CaMKII remains in this activated state for several seconds and is therefore a candidate actor for BTSP, which acts on a timescale of several seconds as well. I learnt from this paper’s introduction that there is a CaMKII sensor based on FRET which revealed a shorter decay time for CaMKII’s phosphorylated state when it carried a specific mutation in CaMKII.</p>



<p>The authors take advantage of an established mouse line with this specific mutation, which resulted in deficits of memory and synaptic plasticity. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.18.537377">Xiao et al.</a> found, using in vivo patch clamp, that <strong>BTSP was prevented or reduced in these mutated mice </strong>(Fig. 3), suggesting an indeed critical role of CaMKII for the induction of BTSP.</p>



<p>As a side-finding, the authors describe that intrinsic burst propensities of CA1 neurons were quite different for mutants and wildtypes (unfortunately, they only show few example traces of such bursts), and they follow up on this result by characterizing the intrinsic properties in slices.<br />A question that came up and was partially addressed by the authors are the possible side-effects of chronically mutated CaMKII on the entire development and on other brain regions or also the hippocampus before the start of the experiment. However, the main finding of the manuscript (prevention of BTSP in CaMKII-mutated mice) seems to be solid despite these non-avoidable confounds. Of course, the study does not address how exactly CaMKII is involved in BTSP. The way to address this question will probably require using fluorescent reporters of CaMKII activity and very tedious dissection of molecular signaling pathways.</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring of place cell induction via BTSP with calcium imaging</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05378-6">Grienberger and Magee (2022)</a> conducted a simple and elegant study using calcium imaging that confirms and connects previous ideas on hippocampal plasticity and BTSP.<br />It had been known since a long time that hippocampal place cells are more abundant around more important locations, for example, reward locations. Here, the authors observe the transition from similar representation of all locations towards preferred representation of reward location using calcium imaging. They find evidence that this transition is induced by BTSP. To this end, they<strong> identify putative BTSP burst events in single neurons from calcium imaging data</strong> and track the activities of these neurons before and after such burst events. Moreover, they use optogenetics to show that <strong>input from entorhinal cortex (EC3) is required</strong> for the transformation of equal to reward-preferring representation of space. This finding is in line with the existing ideas about EC3 projections to provide the instructive signal that triggers bursts in apical dendrites and BTSP in CA1 neurons.</p>



<p>One of the most critical parts of this study is the identification of bursts to induce place fields using calcium imaging (in previous studies, this was usually done by in vivo whole-cell recordings). There is some uncertainty about the identification of these induction events (see the “CA1 place cell identification” subsection in the Methods section; check out a more recent preprint by the same lab, which uses much more complex criteria to detect BTSP events from calcium imaging; see the Methods subsection “BTSP Analysis” from &nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.01.526663">Vaidya et al. (2023)</a>). It would be very interesting to thoroughly study &#8211; for example with simultaneous calcium imaging and single-cell electrophysiology in vivo -, which calcium events correspond to BTSP/burst events and which calcium events correspond to “regular” spiking. However, this seems technically too challenging, and the more ad-hoc methods to identify such events in this study seem fully adequate for the question addressed. P.S. If you find this paper interesting, check out the publicly available reviewer reports.</p>



<p><strong>Voltage imaging of BTSP with optogenetic perturbations</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al. (2023)</a> use an impressive combination of voltage imaging and optogenetics techniques in vivo to study BTSP. Let me cite the abstract to give an idea about the methodological craziness of this study: “We combined genetically targeted <strong>voltage imaging</strong> with targeted <strong>optogenetic activation</strong> and <strong>silencing</strong> <strong>of pre- and post-synaptic</strong> neurons to study the mechanisms underlying hippocampal behavioral timescale plasticity.” Optogenetic induction of place cells in hippocampus has been done before, but not combined with voltage imaging. This together with simultaneous silencing of specific projections sounds like a completely crazy project. Several interesting findings: Excitability of pyramidal neurons (as measured with combined optogenetic activation and voltage imaging) did not increase upon BTSP. CA2/3 to CA1 inputs were potentiated upon BTSP (optogenetic activation of, although only contralateral, CA2/3 with a fiber during voltage imaging of CA1 neurons). And the activity of CA2/3 cells projecting to CA1 was required for BTSP (optogenetic silencing of projection-specific CA2/3 neurons while voltage imaging in CA1).</p>



<p>Overall, I would have loved to read more about these experiments and their interpretation.<br /><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05378-6">Grienberger and Magee (2022)</a> showed that (ipsilateral) EC3 input is necessary for BTSP, while <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al. (2023)</a> showed that (contralateral) CA2/3 input is required. The idea is that both CA2/3 (for the eligibility trace) and EC3 input (for the instructive signal) are required, and both results are consistent with the standard theory of BTSP. It is only a bit surprising that even the contralateral CA2/3 input, as reported by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035">Fan et al.</a> was sufficient. In their study, the contralateral side was inhibited to enable fiber placement at CA2/3 and voltage imaging in CA1. This must be kept in mind because the authors, to access CA1 with 1P voltage imaging, also removed the central part of the external capsule; I wonder whether this removed part of the corpus callosum does not contain some of these contralateral projections.</p>



<p><strong>A plasticity rule in cortex reminiscent of BTSP</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.29.547097">Caya-Bissonnette et al. (2023)</a> from Jean-Claude Béïque’s lab in Ottawa used slice physiology and modeling to show that <strong>a variant of BTSP exists in layer 5 pyramidal cells of cortex</strong> (S1) in mice. I have to admit that the often very long and complicated sentences in the Results section and the slightly overcrowded figures make it a tough paper to read, but it is worth it.</p>



<p>The authors use <strong>pre- and post-synaptic stimulation pairing paradigms</strong> as they were used extensively since the 1990s – but with the crucial difference that pre- and post-synaptic events were not separated by milliseconds but <strong>by 0.5-1.0&nbsp;s</strong>. Using this approach, they found a potentiation of synapses that did not depend on the temporal order of pre/post stimulation. Therefore, they call this plasticity rule “associative”. The authors furthermore show that the <strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong> (ER, reminiscent of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1670">O’Hare et al. (2022)</a>) and several related calcium signaling pathways are involved in the latent “eligibility trace” that holds the memory of first stimulation before the second stimulation arrives, by extending the decay time constant of calcium (Fig. 4). The decay time is not extended by much, but maybe this slight increase is enough to induce plasticity.</p>



<p>Altogether, this is a very interesting study focusing on slice physiology. On one side, this is a limitation since the paper claims to have found a cortical variant of hippocampal BTSP, an effect that was primarily convincing because it had been shown in behaving animals. Therefore, one should critically inspect the choices of the plasticity protocol. For example, I noticed that the authors used a 10&#215;20 Hz stimulation that seemed to me maybe a bit too strong and repetitive a stimulation and does not resemble typical BTSP events in vivo; moreover, during BTSP events, bursting and the associated plateau potentials were shown to be involved in the <em>post</em>-synaptic not the <em>pre</em>-synaptic cell in vivo (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015)</a>. Maybe I missed it, but I did not find this aspect discussed in the paper.</p>



<p>On the other side, the study is, despite this limitation, very interesting since it demonstrates how powerful slice physiology can be and how much we miss by only focusing on processes accessible in vivo. Moreover, it shows under which condition <strong>a classical STDP protocol can be transformed into a longer-timescale “BTSP”</strong> (Fig. 1F). To my knowledge, a plasticity rule with such long delays has not been convincingly demonstrated in cortex before, neither in slices nor in vivo. It may be a stretch to call the observed effect “BTSP”, drawing the analogy to the results seen in hippocampus in vivo, thereby gradually diluting the meaning of &#8220;BTSP&#8221;. However, this is just naming conventions &#8211; the science in the paper is interesting.</p>



<p>That’s it from my side about interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannibal-pirate-spiders-web-arachnid">Some cannibal pirate spiders trick their cousins into ‘walking the plank’</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Costa Rican pirate spider lives up to the family name: It tricks closely related orb weaver spiders into &#8220;walking the plank,” right to their doom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world’s many pirate spiders exploit a very particular food source — other spiders. But while most pirate spiders invade the webs of other arachnids, <em>Gelanor siquirres </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347223001665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dupes potential prey into building a web right into a trap</a>, researchers report in an upcoming <em>Animal Behaviour</em>.</p>



<p>Like any respectable pirate, pirate spiders have an extensive bag of tricks. Some species delicately strum the threads of other spiders’ webs to convince the arachnids they’ve caught an insect, only to strike when the web owner comes to collect its prey. Others mimic on a web the signature rhythms of a different spider’s courtship dance, luring would-be suitors to their deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>On a trip several years ago to a biological reserve in Costa Rica, researchers were the first to witness a hunt by a little-known species called <em>G. siquirres</em>. It cleverly exploits the way other spiders make their webs to get a meal, the team realized.</p>



<p>At nightfall in the steamy lowland rainforests of Costa Rica, orb weavers let loose “floating lines” — single strands of silk that blow in the breeze until the free end sticks on another surface, such as a tree branch. The orb weaver then scurries across to secure the second anchor point, and this first moored line serves as the foundation for the web.</p>



<p>But when&nbsp;<em>G. siquirres&nbsp;</em>strikes, the orb weaver does not scuttle across this bridge line to some welcoming vegetation. Instead, it walks into a trap; <em>G. siquirres </em>has already cast its own silk lines, not with the intention of building a web, but to intercept that of the orb weaver.</p>



<p>During their trip, arachnologist Laura Segura-Hernández and colleagues came upon a perplexing scene: An unusual configuration of multiple strands of silk converged at a single leaf. The group also noticed another spider’s floating line caught on one of those strands. Then, as the floating line’s owner — a juvenile orb weaver — scuttled across, a pirate spider emerged from behind its leaf hideout and crept down toward the intersection.</p>



<p>Probably feeling vibrations from the approaching pirate spider, the orb weaver attached a dragline — the arachnid’s version of a bungee cord — and flung itself off its bridge line. The pirate spider was close on its heels, pursuing from its own dragline.</p>



<p>“They’re hanging there, fighting,” says Segura-Hernández, who recently finished her Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. It was a dramatic scene, she says, like two swashbuckling pirates exchanging blows while swinging from the rigging. The encounter ended with a surprisingly swift attack from the pirate that instantly immobilized its prey.</p>



<p>The hunting strategy comes as a total surprise, says Gustavo Hormiga, a biologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who helped name and describe <em>G. siquirres </em>in 2016. Exploiting how other spiders build their webs is “actually pretty sophisticated,” he says. “I don’t know of anything like that in any [other] spider group.”</p>



<p>This new study helps bring <em>G. siquirres </em>to life<em>, </em>Hormiga says. Until now, the spider was known to science through only a dead specimen collected in 1994<em>.</em></p>



<p>The finding also underscores the need for old-school natural historians, Hormiga says, the kind of scientists who wander out at night with a head lamp to see what there is to find. “For many of us, this is really what brought us into science,” he says. “Not pipetting. Just being out there.”</p>

<p>The economist behind a controversial study showing attractive female students got lower grades after classes moved online during the pandemic has been acquitted of research misconduct, according to a report from his former institution.</p>



<p>But the researcher, Adrian Mehic, did not get off without reproof: Even if the work kept to the letter of the law, it may still have had &#8220;unethical consequences,&#8221; Erik Renström, vice-chancellor of Lund University in Sweden, wrote in the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/outcomeletter-1.pdf">June 8 report</a> (in Swedish).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2022.110782">the study</a>, a jury made up largely of final-year high schoolers rated the looks of university students based on pictures taken from social media accounts. The ratings were then linked to other publicly available data about the students, including academic performance. The findings, published in the journal <em>Economics Letters</em> in August 2022, made <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/teachers-discriminate-against-unattractive-females-remote-learning-study-suggests">headlines</a> <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/research-links-good-looks-good-grades-3970160">across</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11409063/Attractive-female-students-no-longer-earned-higher-grades-classes-moved-online-COVID-19.html">the</a> <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/attractive-female-students-lower-grades-online-classes-584450.html">globe</a>.</p>



<p>But the students had not consented to the research, nor were they informed about it. The revelation unleashed &#8220;<a href="https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2022-10-31/uppmarksammad-snygghetsstudie-skapar-kritikstorm-pa-universitetet">a storm of criticism at the university</a>,&#8221; according to local media.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127873"></span>



<p>Some study participants <a href="https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/studenters-utseende-bedomdes-i-studie/">expressed shock and discomfort</a> at having had their attractiveness rated without their knowledge. Others complained the raw data had not been properly anonymized, alleging they were able to identify themselves in <a href="https://www.lundagard.se/2022/11/01/snygghetsstudie-inte-anonym-student-identifierade-sig-sjalv-pa-tre-minuter/">just three minutes</a> giving them access to their beauty ratings.</p>



<p>In October, Mehic, then a PhD student at Lund University, was reported to the school&#8217;s ethics committee for &#8220;suspected deviation from good research practice,&#8221; according to the report. The charges focused on how Mehic collected and handled personal data and whether he should have obtained ethics approval for his study and consent from the participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do understand that beauty is a sometimes controversial topic,&#8221; Mehic, who is now an assistant professor at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm, told Retraction Watch by email. &#8220;However, the subjects have voluntarily decided to share their data online. This data may be used by others for certain purposes, including commercial (social media outlets are well-known to sell data to companies), or research.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lund University asked the national Ethics Review Appeals Board to decide whether the study would have needed ethics approval. In February, the board found the personal data collected in the study were not of such sensitive nature as to require such review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school also requested an external expert, Jane Reichel of Stockholm University, to review the case. She concluded in March that the study had not deviated from good research practice, was consistent with European <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">data-protection rules</a> and had followed the ethics standards of the journal that published the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The university decides that Adrian Mehic [and his supervisors] were not guilty of deviating from good research practice,&#8221; the report concluded.</p>



<p>The document does level some criticism against the researcher, however, noting that he could easily have notified the participants that he was conducting the study. Moreover, the report stated:</p>



<p><em><em>It may also reasonably be considered as an invasion of personal integrity to have one&#8217;s looks rated the way it was done in the study. The execution of the study might thereby have had unethical consequences even if the letter of the law has been followed. For this, the execution of the study deserves criticism.</em></em></p>



<p>Asked about this point, Mehic said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is a lot of research that can make people uncomfortable, e.g. animal studies. The Scandinavian countries also allow researchers to use detailed administrative data on income, debt, mental health, medicine use, and so on. Probably, not everyone is okay with this, but the public use of such data is enshrined in our Constitution (at least in Sweden). At the end of the day, it’s a question about balance between integrity and scientific progress.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Anders Ahlberg, director of graduate studies at the faculty of engineering at Lund University, was one of the people who reported the study to the school&#8217;s ethics committee. He told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I did find it interesting that the study was both acquitted and criticized. There seem to be some wiggle room between what is formally deemed unethical and what may be allowed but still is considered inappropriate.</p>



<p>My impression of the ruling is that there was less focus on the intent of the underlying philosophy behind the European code for research integrity (ALLEA norms concerning reliability, honesty, respect and accountability), and more focus on legal technicalities (various aspects and limitations of GDPR).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that he found it “strange” that photos and stored ratings of study participants&#8217; attractiveness are &#8220;not considered sensitive personal information or psychologically harmful (lack of respect). The students should have been asked for consent prior to the study.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to a June 14 press release from Lund University, the&nbsp;Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct has also <a href="https://www.lusem.lu.se/news/the-beauty-study-follow-up-and-closure">cleared the study</a> of &#8220;all the previous charges,&#8221; noting that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>An expert for the board has concluded that no mistakes have been made regarding, for example, the issue of consent, dissemination of information, respect for research subjects and data handling. All this together thus concludes that the research study by Adrian Mehic was done in a completely correct way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-detection-lasers-atoms">Scientists have two ways to spot gravitational waves. Here are some other ideas</a></h4>

              
                <p>Until recently, gravitational waves could have been a figment of Einstein’s imagination. Before they were detected, these ripples in spacetime existed only in the physicist’s general theory of relativity, as far as scientists knew.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have not one but two ways to detect the waves. And they’re on the hunt for more. The study of gravitational waves is booming, says astrophysicist Karan Jani of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “This is just remarkable. No field I can think of in fundamental physics has seen progress this fast.”</p>





<p>Just as light comes in a spectrum, or a variety of wavelengths, so do gravitational waves. Different wavelengths point to different types of cosmic origins and require different flavors of detectors.</p>



<p>Gravitational waves with wavelengths of a few thousand kilometers — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction?mode=magazine&amp;context=1679">those detected by LIGO</a> in the United States and its partners Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — come mostly from merging pairs of black holes 10 or so times the mass of the sun, or from collisions of dense cosmic nuggets called neutron stars (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). These detectors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-searching-sources-gravitational-waves">could also spot waves</a> from certain types of supernovas — exploding stars — and from rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>In contrast, immense ripples that span light-years are thought to be created by orbiting pairs of whopper black holes with masses billions of times that of the sun. In June, scientists reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">the first strong evidence for these types of waves</a> by turning the entire galaxy into a detector, watching how the waves tweaked the timing of regular blinks from pulsars scattered throughout the Milky Way (<em>SN: 6/28/23</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>With the equivalent of both small ripples and major tsunamis in hand, physicists now hope to plunge into a vast, cosmic ocean of gravitational waves of all sorts of sizes. These ripples could reveal new details about the secret lives of exotic objects such as black holes and unknown facets of the cosmos.</p>



<p>“There’s still a lot of gaps in our coverage of the gravitational wave spectrum,” says physicist Jason Hogan of Stanford University. But it makes sense to cover all the bases, he says. “Who knows what else we might find?”</p>



<p>This quest to capture the full complement of the universe’s gravitational waves could take observatories out into deep space or the moon, to the atomic realm and elsewhere.</p>



<p>Here’s a sampling of some of the frontiers scientists are eyeing in search of new types of waves.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go to deep space</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-022-00041-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laser Interferometer Space Antenna</a>, or LISA, sounds implausible at first. A trio of spacecraft, arranged in a triangle with 2.5-million-kilometer sides, would beam lasers to one another while cartwheeling in an orbit around the sun. But the European Space Agency mission, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/satellite-trio-will-hunt-gravitational-waves-space">planned for the mid-2030s</a>, is no mere fantasy (<em>SN: 6/20/17</em>). It is many scientists’ best hope for breaking into new realms of gravitational waves.</p>



<p>“LISA is a mind-blowing experiment,” says theoretical physicist Diego Blas Temiño of Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and&nbsp;Institut de Física d&#8217;Altes Energies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="526" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1.jpg" alt="Illustration showing three spacecraft connected by red lasers orbiting the sun. Colliding supermassive black holes in a distant galaxy also emit gravitational waves in the background." class="wp-image-3131203" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-495x383.jpg 495w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-582x450.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline1-240x186.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131203">The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, will be made up of a trio of spacecraft orbiting the sun (illustrated in foreground). LISA will observe gravitational waves from orbiting supermassive black holes in distant galaxies (illustrated in background).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131203">Simon Barke/University of Florida (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a gravitational wave passes by, LISA would detect the stretching and squeezing of the sides of the triangle, based on how the laser beams interfere with each other at the triangle’s corners. A proof-of-concept experiment with a single spacecraft, LISA Pathfinder, flew in 2015 and demonstrated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/space-based-probe-passes-tests-gravitational-wave-detection">the feasibility of the technique</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/16</em>).</p>



<p>Generally, to catch longer wavelengths of gravitational waves, you need a bigger detector. LISA would let scientists see wavelengths millions of kilometers long. That means LISA could detect orbiting black holes that would be enormous, but moderately so — millions of times the mass of the sun instead of billions.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go to the moon</h4>



<p>With NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis program</a> aiming at a return to the moon, scientists are looking to Earth’s neighbor for inspiration (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>). A proposed experiment called the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, or LILA, would put a gravitational wave detector on the moon.</p>



<p>Without the jostling of human activity and other earthly jitters, gravitational waves should be easier to pick out on the moon. “It’s almost like a spiritual quietness,” Jani says. “If you want to listen to the sounds of the universe, these is no place better in the solar system than our moon.”</p>



<p>Like LISA, LILA would have three stations beaming lasers in a triangle, though the sides of this one would be about 10 kilometers long. It could catch wavelengths tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers long. That would fill in a gap between the wavelengths measured by the space-based LISA and the Earth-based LIGO.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2.jpg" alt="An illustration shows three lasers in a triangle formation around a crateron the moon's surface." class="wp-image-3131204" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131204">The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, LILA, is a proposed gravitational wave detector on the moon. Thanks to the moon’s paltry atmosphere, LILA’s triangle of lasers (illustrated) wouldn’t need to be enclosed in vacuum tubes, unlike similar observatories on Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131204">Vanderbilt Lunar Labs/Vanderbilt University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Because orbiting objects like black holes speed up as they get closer to merging, over time they emit gravitational waves with shorter and shorter wavelengths. That means LILA could watch black holes close in on one another during the weeks before they merge, giving scientists a heads-up that a collision is about to go down. Then, once the wavelengths get short enough, earthly observatories like LIGO would pick up the signal, catching the moment of impact.</p>



<p>A different moon-based option would use lunar laser ranging — a technique by which scientists measure the distance from Earth to the moon with lasers, thanks to reflectors placed on the moon’s surface during previous moon landings.</p>



<p>The method <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.064021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could detect waves</a> jostling the Earth and the moon, with wavelengths in between those seen by pulsar timing methods and LISA, Blas Temiño and a colleague reported in <em>Physical Review D </em>in 2022. But that technique would require improved reflectors on the moon — another reason to go back.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go atomic</h4>



<p>LISA, LIGO and other laser observatories measure the stretching and squeezing of gravitational waves by monitoring how laser beams interfere after traversing their detectors’ long arms. But a proposed technique goes a different route.</p>



<p>Rather than looking for slight changes in the lengths of detector arms as gravitational waves pass, this new technique keeps an eye on the distance between two clouds of atoms. The quantum properties of atoms mean that they act like waves that can interfere with themselves. If a gravitational wave passes through, it changes the distance between the atom clouds. Scientists can tease out that change in distance based on that quantum interference.</p>



<p>The technique could reveal gravitational waves with wavelengths between those detectable by LIGO and LISA, Hogan says. He’s part of an effort to build a prototype detector, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abf719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called MAGIS-100</a>, at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3.jpg" alt="Photo of part of the MAGIS-100 prototype" class="wp-image-3131205" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline3-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131205">A new type of gravitational wave detector could be based on clouds of atoms.

<p>Atom interferometers have never been used to measure gravitational waves, though they can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gravity-sensor-atoms-quantum-physics-underground">sense Earth’s gravity</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-gravity-experiment-atoms-general-relativity-einstein">test fundamental physics rules</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/22</em>; <em>SN: 10/28/20</em>). The idea is “totally futuristic,” Blas Temiño says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go back in time</h4>



<p>Another effort aims to pinpoint gravitational waves from the earliest moments of the universe. Such waves would have been produced during inflation, the moments after the Big Bang when the universe ballooned in size. These waves would have longer wavelengths than ever seen before — as long as 10<sup>21</sup> kilometers, or 1 sextillion kilometers.</p>



<p>But the hunt got off to a false start in 2014, when scientists with the BICEP2 experiment proclaimed the detection of gravitational waves imprinted in swirling patterns on the oldest light in the universe, the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-erases-evidence-gravity-wave-detection">claim was later overturned</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>An effort called <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMB-Stage 4</a> will continue the search, with plans for multiple new telescopes that would scour the universe’s oldest light for signs of the waves — this time, hopefully, without any missteps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="343" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4.jpg" alt="cosmic microwave background based on data from the Planck satellite" class="wp-image-3131206" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090523_ec_gravitational-waves_inline4-330x166.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131206">Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (data from the Planck satellite shown) could reveal gravitational waves stirred up just after the Big Bang.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131206">Planck Collaboration/ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go for the unknown</h4>



<p>For most types of gravitational waves that scientists have set their sights on, they know a bit about what to expect. Known objects — like black holes or neutron stars — can create those waves.</p>



<p>But for gravitational waves with the shortest wavelengths, perhaps just centimeters long, “the story is different,” says theoretical physicist Valerie Domcke of CERN near Geneva. “We have no known source … that would actually give us [these] gravitational waves of a large enough amplitude that we could realistically detect them.”</p>



<p>Still, physicists want to check if the tiny waves are out there. These ripples could be produced by violent events early in the universe’s history such as phase transitions, in which the cosmos converts from one state to another, akin to water condensing from steam into liquid. Another possibility is tiny, primordial black holes, too small to be formed by standard means, which might have been born in the early universe. Physics in these regimes is so poorly understood, “even looking for [gravitational waves] and not finding them would tell us something,” Domcke says.</p>



<p>These gravitational waves are so mysterious that their detection techniques are also up in the air. But the wavelengths are small enough that they could be seen with high-precision, laboratory-scale experiments, rather than enormous detectors.</p>



<p>Scientists might even be able to repurpose data from experiments designed with other goals in mind. When gravitational waves encounter electromagnetic fields, the ripples can behave in ways similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-light-axion-particle-search-event-horizon">hypothetical subatomic particles called axions</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/22</em>). So experiments searching for those particles <a></a>might also reveal mini gravitational waves.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The gamut of gravitational waves</h3>



<p>Gravitational waves come in a spectrum of shorter and longer wavelengths. Each wavelength range is generated by different sources. Pulsars and exploding stars, or supernovas, generate some short wavelength ripples. Other waves are produced by pairs of neutron stars, or by pairs of stellar mass black holes, with masses less than 100 times that of the sun. Still longer wavelengths are generated by pairs of supermassive black holes.</p>



<p>Different wavelengths can be spotted using different types of detectors, including ground-based detectors such as LIGO, space-based detectors such as LISA, and measurements of blips from dead stars called pulsars. Especially long wavelengths may be detected by studying the light released shortly after the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background. Other detector types (not pictured) could fill in the gaps.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A new view</h4>



<p>Catching gravitational waves is like paddling against the tide: tough going, but worth it for the scenic views. “Gravitational waves are really, really hard to detect,” Hogan says. It took decades of work before LIGO spotted its first swells, and the same is true of the pulsar timing technique. But astronomers immediately began reaping the rewards. “It’s a whole new view of the universe,” Hogan says.</p>



<p>Already, gravitational waves have helped <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">confirm Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a>, discover <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">a new class of black holes</a> of moderately sized masses and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">unmask the fireworks</a> that happen when two ultradense objects called neutron stars collide (<em>SN: 2/11/16; SN: 9/2/20; SN: 10/16/17</em>).</p>



<p>And it’s still early days for gravitational wave detection. Scientists can only guess at what future detectors will expose. “There’s way more to discover,” Hogan says. “It’s bound to be interesting.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063099951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Deepest Map</a><br><em>Laura Trethewey</em><br><em>Harper Wave, $32</em></p>



<p>In 2019, the multimillionaire and explorer Victor Vescovo made headlines when he became the first person to visit the deepest parts of all five of Earth’s oceans. But arguably the real star of the expedition was marine geologist Cassie Bongiovanni, the lead ocean mapper who ensured Vescovo piloted his submersible to the actual deepest depths.</p>



<p>Today, only 25 percent of the seafloor is well mapped. When Vescovo set out to score his record, the exact deepest location in each ocean was unknown. Bongiovanni, Vescovo and their crew had to chart these regions in detail before each dive.</p>





<p>“Traditionally, captains never cared about the seafloor as long as it stayed far enough away from the hulls of their ships,” journalist Laura Trethewey writes in <em>The Deepest Map</em>. The book explores humankind’s quest to map the seafloor, framed around Bongiovanni’s adventures.</p>



<p>Seafloor topography has been a big concern for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-how-military-funding-shaped-science-oceanography">militaries patrolling Neptunian frontiers with nuclear submarines</a> and companies facilitating intercontinental communication via subsea cables (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 28</em>). In recent decades, seafloor data have become crucial to the deep-sea mining industries searching for metals needed to produce green technology.</p>



<p>Satellites have revealed many of the knobs and crevices visible in the deep blue of Google Maps. But with that relatively coarse information, entire mountains can be missed. To see the seafloor in high resolution requires a sophisticated sonar system aboard a big ship that sends sound signals from the sea surface into the abyss. </p>



<p>Mappers like Bongiovanni calculate depth from the time it takes for the signal to travel down and bounce back to the surface. These state-of-the-art sonar systems transform “the satellite-predicted blur into a sharp three-dimensional terrain of ripples, cracks and tears in the seafloor,” Trethewey writes. “The seafloor is ‘heard,’ rather than seen.”</p>



<p>Through Trethewey’s tale, she twines stories of tagging along with scientists and ocean mappers. That includes her inaugural adventure at sea, which a crew member noted was “pretty rough for a first-timer,” as he and Trethewey clung to a doorframe in near gale force winds. On this cruise aboard research vessel E/V<em> Nautilus</em>, which was surveying a poorly mapped stretch of California’s coast, Trethewey (and readers) are introduced to the art and science of seafloor mapping. On this day, Trethewey learned that mapping is especially difficult — and sometimes impossible — when the ocean is angry.</p>



<p>Trethewey’s insightful writing helps readers understand just why mapping the ocean — even in shallow coastal waters — is crucial to so many endeavors. She visits a remote Inuit village on the western bank of Canada’s Hudson Bay, where she joins hunters who map ever-changing coastlines for their own safety. Later, she scuba dives with archaeologists in Florida who use underwater maps to explore remnants of early human history that have been submerged for thousands of years.</p>



<p>A distant, possibly unreachable goal envisions creating a complete map of the entire seafloor by the end of this decade, an effort known as <a href="https://seabed2030.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seabed 2030</a>. Because the oceans are vast and replete with remote and dangerous places that people simply can’t or shouldn’t go, this effort will almost certainly require autonomous surface vehicles armed with sonar. Such devices are already probing the depths and sending back data. </p>



<p>Staring at computer screens in a sun-filled conference room, Trethewey watches as a drone outfitted with cameras, environmental sensors and a sonar system maps a bit of seafloor off California as she sips her coffee. “The future of ocean mapping weirdly felt a lot like checking social media or doing anything else on your phone these days,” she wryly observes.</p>



<p>Trethewey’s book is about more than just mapping the oceans. It’s also about what can go wrong when explorers explore. It’s hard to read <em>The Deepest Map</em> without being reminded of the recent implosion of the Titan submersible in the North Atlantic that killed everyone on board in June. Indeed, Trethewey describes how, during Vescovo’s first solo dive, his colleagues endured 25 minutes of apprehension-turned-alarm when they didn’t hear from him.</p>



<p>She also reminds us how easily exploration can turn into exploitation. In the not-so-distant past, Europeans “discovered” the so-called New World and mapped it, Trethewey writes. Exploitation followed. Scientists and environmentalists alike are now concerned that a full, detailed map of the ocean floor might lead to the destruction of delicate, mostly unknown habitats if deep-sea miners are allowed to extract metals. </p>





<p>Trethewey envisions a different outcome. Seabed 2030’s mapping effort may help people see that “the weird, wonderful deep-sea world is not a blank space, another frontier to use up and throw away,” and should be safeguarded for scientists “to uncover our past and protect our future.”</p>

<p>In the midst of a tumultuous year, the journal <em>Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications</em>, a Sage title, is retracting 21 papers after an investigation identified signs of “compromised” peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">delisted</a> the journal from its Web of Science index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">in March</a> for failing to meet editorial quality criteria. Founding editor Biren Prasad, who managed the journal since 1992, also retired earlier this year, and the publisher took over management of peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s online presence also needs attention: Neither of the associate editors listed on its <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/CER">website</a> have been involved for many years, both told Retraction Watch – and one has threatened to sue the journal if she isn’t removed.</p>



<span id="more-127865"></span>



<p>The investigation that led to the 21 retractions began after Clarivate notified Sage about quality issues in multiple papers, a spokesperson for the publisher told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation “revealed peer review that didn’t meet the standards set by Sage for publication and the potential involvement of a paper mill,” the spokesperson said. More papers may be retracted as the investigation continues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions were announced in a single <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1063293X231200990">notice</a> posted on September 10. It stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage found that the peer-review process for these articles was compromised and contains indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>As the peer-review process has not met Sage’s expectations of high quality and ethical peer-review, the publisher cannot uphold the integrity of the research. In line with COPE guidelines and Sage policies, these articles are retracted.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The language of the notice is nearly identical to another notice about a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/21/sage-retracting-three-dozen-articles-for-compromised-peer-review/">batch of 37 retractions</a> from another Sage engineering journal in July, also for compromised peer review. The two sets of retractions are not related, the spokesperson said, but “both cases reflect wider issues we are facing as an industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the nearly two dozen papers retracted from <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>, only one had been flagged on PubPeer. “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1063293X211010542">An efficient approach for brain tumor detection and segmentation in MR brain images using random forest classifier</a>,” which appeared in 2021, contained “tortured phrases,” sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8474723A4A94F23D35F7F095835956#1">commented in 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such phrases “typically result from an attempt to avoid plagiarism detection using a paraphrasing software,” he wrote. For example, the authors used the phrases “amiable tumor” and “bogus positive” rather than the commonly used “benign tumor” and “false positive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Meenal Thayumanavan, listed as an associate professor at Kongunadu College of Engineering and Technology in India, did not respond to our request for comment on the retraction or PubPeer post.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to the two associate editors listed at the top of <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/CER">editorial board</a> for more information about what led to the retractions. Both told us they were no longer involved with the journal, and hadn’t been for many years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alice Agogino, an emeritus professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;ve asked many times years ago to be taken off the CERA editorial board. I have not been involved in this journal in over 2 decades. I do not review articles. I do not attend editorial board meetings, nor have I had any correspondence on this.</p>



<p>I just sent email threatening&nbsp; legal action if this is not changed soon on their website. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other people listed as editors are no longer involved as well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mark Fox, a professor of industrial engineering and computer science at the University of Toronto in Canada, said he was not aware he was listed as an associate editor of the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have had zero interaction with Concurrent Engineering for many years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Agogino said she had been involved with the journal when it began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>At the start of the journal I reviewed papers and helped define this new field. It had a legitimate start. As my research changed directions, I asked to step down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Four other researchers Agogino knows who are also listed on the website told her they “had not been contacted in over a decade,” she said. “No editorial review meetings, nada.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked about the status of the website and editorial management of the journal, the Sage spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sage has been in contact with the Editorial Board with the intention of clarifying status and will be reflecting changes to the board on the website as soon as possible. Furthermore, we have now brought management of peer review for the journal in-house under the leadership of a new Managing Editor.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Prasad, listed as the founding editor on <em>Concurrent Engineering</em>’s website, told us he had retired earlier this year, but had managed the journal and owned the editorial rights since starting it in 1992.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stood by his management of the journal and its peer review process:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When I was managing the editorial office, I was very fair and honest in seeking independent reviews from at least 4-5 professional reviewers on each paper. In each and every paper, we sought out 4-5 independent reviews, (subject matters experts carefully),&nbsp; and only when I was satisfied that those (at least 4-5) returned reviews were genuine and professionally performed, I moved on to accept or reject each and every paper.</p>



<p>Since all those reviewers were independent reviewers (having the expertise in subject matters), who performed their written evaluations, I trusted them. Those 4-5 independent reviewers were randomly selected by me using SAGE Track Reviewers Database, I have no reasons to doubt any of the (reviewers) haven’t performed their professional duties fairly with great integrity.</p>



<p>As far as I could see, there was nothing wrong on our part in accurately and professionally processing those papers for CERA Journal? [sic] No compromises were ever made by me in my life-time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also mentioned a software tool called “the UADT system,” that Sage began using in 2022, which seems to have analyzed submissions and reviews for potentially suspicious activity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For instance, the UADT computer system generated results were mostly based on choice of non-institutional email-addresses used in correspondences (like Gmail or Yahoo email address) and IP addresses used during manuscript-submission time. It is reasonable to suspect such manuscript submissions perhaps may be belonging for [sic] a Paper Mills category, but rejecting all those submissions as unauthentic, at the outset, purely based on a set of partial users’ data (on authors and reviewers), I considered wrong and unprofessional.</p>



<p>As such, when I was managing the Journal, we further investigated and analyzed the UADT data manually to see if those reviews were professionally done or not and were genuine or fabricated. Only after ascertaining that the reviews were genuine and when there was no doubt about any collaborations between authors and reviewers, that might have taken place I accepted those papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was not involved in the investigation that led to the retractions, he said, and learned about them from our email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel sorry for the authors of those retracted papers,” he said. “As far as I could see, I have made no compromises in ensuring the professionalisms [sic] and carrying our [sic] my professional duties towards CERA to the best of my ability and knowledge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-complex-vocal-skills-problem-solvers">Birds with more complex vocal skills are better problem-solvers</a></h4>

              
                <p>By now, it’s no secret that the phrase “bird brain” should be a compliment, not an insult. Some of our feathered friends are capable of complex cognitive tasks, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">tool use</a> (<em>SN: 2/10/23</em>). Among the brainiest feats that birds are capable of is vocal learning, or the ability to learn to mimic sounds and use them to communicate. In birds, this leads to beautiful calls and songs; in humans, it leads to language.</p>



<p>The best avian vocal learners, such as crows and parrots, also tend to be considered the most intelligent birds. So it’s natural to think that the two traits could be linked. But studies with smart birds have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219300168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found conflicting evidence</a>. Although vocal learning may be linked with greater cognitive capacity in some species, the opposite relationship seems to hold true in others.</p>





<p>Now, a massive analysis of 214 birds from 23 species shows that there is indeed a link between <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh3428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal learning and at least one advanced cognitive ability</a> — problem-solving. The study, described in the Sept. 15 <em>Science,</em> is the first to analyze multiple bird species instead of just one.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Birds with more complex vocal skills are better at problem-solving | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI2-AfLzgJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">More than 200 birds from 23 species were given different cognitive tests to gauge their intelligence. One of the problem-solving tasks asked birds to pull a cork lid off a glass flask to access a tasty treat (bottom left). Comparing these tests with birds’ ability to learn songs and calls showed that the better vocal learners are also better at problem-solving.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To compare species, biologist Jean-Nicolas Audet of the Rockefeller University in New York City and colleagues had to devise a way to assess all the birds’ vocal learning and cognitive abilities.</p>



<p>For vocal learning, the team scoured the scientific literature to find how many songs and calls a particular species could learn, whether it could learn vocalizations throughout its life or just for a set developmental period and whether it could mimic other bird species. “Our novel way of measuring vocal complexity integrates those three features together,” Audet says.</p>



<p>The researchers next developed cognitive tests that could be adapted for different birds. A test built for a tiny house wren (<em>Troglodytes aedon</em>), for instance, might not work for a bulky mourning dove (<em>Zenaida macroura</em>). Audet and research assistant Mélanie Couture ultimately presented birds with seven cognitive tasks over six days.</p>



<p>Four of the tasks tested problem-solving ability. For example, one task involved pulling a cork lid off a flask to access food inside. The other three tasks assessed learning and self-control, other hallmarks of advanced cognition.</p>



<p>The team then analyzed whether the bird species with more complex vocal learning abilities, such as bigger song repertoires, mimicry and lifelong learning, also performed better on their intelligence tests.</p>



<p>Problem-solving, but not learning or self-control, is strongly associated with more complex vocal learning in birds, the researchers found. “The more advanced vocal learning ability, the more advanced problem-solving skills,” says study coauthor Erich Jarvis, a biologist at Rockefeller University.</p>



<p>Take the tufted titmouse (<em>Baeolophus bicolor</em>). This species learns around 63 vocalizations and can learn throughout its life. It completed the problem-solving tasks faster than the brown-headed cowbird (<em>M</em><em>olothrus ater</em>), which learns only about nine vocalizations within a set developmental window.</p>

Couture</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new finding is a “very convincing, positive result,” says William Searcy, a biologist at the University of Miami <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219300168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who studies birdsong</a>. Audet’s team also found a link between complex vocal learning, better problem-solving ability and bigger brains relative to body size. That could partially explain the result, Searcy says. A bigger brain is likely necessary to excel at both vocal learning and problem-solving.</p>



<p>The researchers saved the brains of some of the birds, so they next hope to search for the genes underlying the linked traits. That work could have implications for scientists’ understanding of how human language evolved. “There is a chance that we will discover genes related to problem-solving and vocal learning that are possibly also used in humans for those same behaviors,” Audet says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-28-instability-surprise-physics">Scientists finally detected oxygen-28. Its instability surprised them</a></h4>

              
                <p>A “magic number” of physics might not be so magic after all.</p>



<p>Using a powerful particle accelerator, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06352-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spotted an elusive variant of oxygen</a> for the first time. The isotope, oxygen-28, was predicted to be stable thanks to its eight protons and 20 neutrons — “magic” numbers associated with extra stability in atomic nuclei. But the first observations of oxygen-28, reported in the Aug. 31 <em>Nature</em>, reveal that it is more ephemeral than enduring: Its nuclei crumble after about a zeptosecond (or 0.000000000000000000001 seconds).</p>





<p>The finding “was a big surprise,” says physicist Rituparna&nbsp;Kanungo of Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Canada who was not involved in the study. “We do have several state-of-the-art theories that tried to predict and explain what oxygen-28 should look like,” Kanungo says, but “none of them is able to explain [the observations].”</p>



<p>Atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons, each of which are thought to occupy their own “shells” — discrete energy levels that are separated by large energy gaps. Atomic nuclei with full outer shells are bound extra tightly, making them very stable. Shells fill up when they hit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/magic-number-34">two, eight, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126</a> subatomic particles (<em>SN: 10/9/13)</em>.</p>



<p>Atoms of a particular element have a set number of protons but can have varying numbers of neutrons. For instance, the air we breathe contains the isotope oxygen-16, which has eight protons and eight neutrons. This makes it “doubly magic” and extraordinarily stable. Oxygen-28, doubly magic with its 20 neutrons and eight protons, was expected to be stable too.</p>



<p>Finding the isotope took a combination of brute force and experimental elegance. Physicist Yosuke Kondo of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and colleagues used a particle accelerator to smash calcium-48 atoms against a beryllium target. This fragmented the calcium-48 atoms into lighter isotopes, including fluorine-29. Throwing the fluorine-29 against a liquid hydrogen target knocked off a single proton, producing oxygen-28.</p>



<p>Contrary to expectations, the oxygen-28 fell apart almost immediately. Like a bucket filled with too many balls, its overstuffed nucleus overflowed, sloughing off four neutrons and leaving oxygen-24 behind. By detecting these decay products simultaneously, the scientists showed that they’d made oxygen-28.</p>



<p>Oxygen-28’s surprising instability hints that there’s something missing from scientists’ current theories about the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei. “I think this is going to probably trigger a lot of theoretical developments,” Kanungo says. “That’s pointing again to this very highly challenging task of understanding completely the strongest force of nature.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doctors-live-python-parasite-brain">Doctors found a live python parasite in a woman’s brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The woman’s mysterious symptoms started in her stomach.</p>



<p>Weeks of abdominal pain and diarrhea led to night sweats and a dry cough. Then, doctors found lesions on her lungs, liver and spleen. An infection, perhaps. But tests for bacteria, fungi, a human parasite and even autoimmune disease all came up negative.</p>



<p>Three weeks later, the woman was in the hospital with a fever and cough. CT scans revealed a clue that was telling, in retrospect: Some of her lung lesions appeared to be migrating. A second clue came months later, when the woman became forgetful and depressed. “She had a very astute GP who thought, ‘Something&#8217;s not right here, I better do an MRI of the brain,’” says Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious disease physician at the Australian National University and the Canberra Hospital.</p>



<p>That brain scan turned up a ghostly glow in her frontal lobe. It could have been cancer, an abscess or another affliction, Senanayake says. “No one thought it was going to be a worm.”</p>

Hossain <em>et al</em>/<em>Emerging Infectious Diseases </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>During a biopsy of the woman’s brain, her neurosurgeon spotted a suspicious stringlike structure and plucked it out with forceps. It was pinkish-red, about half the length of a pencil — and still alive.</p>



<p>“It was definitely one of those ‘wow’ moments,” Senanayake says. “A worm in the brain!” But the doctors also felt relieved. It meant they had a diagnosis, he says. The team finally would know how to treat its patient.</p>





<p>The worm, <em>Ophidascaris robertsi, </em>was <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/9/23-0351_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a nematode whose main host is a snake</a>, Senanayake and his colleagues report in the September<em> Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. The woman, who lives in New South Wales, Australia, is the first documented case of an infection in humans.</p>



<p>“The live wriggling worm was … what got everyone so interested,” Senanayake says, “but there’s a more important side to it.” <em>O. robertsi</em> is a parasite that jumped from wild animals to a human. As human and animal populations overlap, he says, “we’re starting to see more and more of these spillover infections.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Humans can be accidental hosts for other animals’ parasites</h4>



<p>The parasite that doctors found in the woman’s brain was far from its usual home. These worms typically shuttle between snakes and small mammals. Adult worms live inside carpet pythons (<em>Morelia spilota</em>), which shed worm eggs in their feces. Rats or possums, for example, can ingest the eggs, which grow into larvae that burrow into flesh. Pythons then eat the infected animals, and the cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans and most other animals exist outside this loop ­— though in 2019, scientists reported <a href="https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1136/vetreccr-2019-000821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one case of <em>O. robertsi</em> in a koala</a>. It’s not clear exactly how the woman in Senanayake’s study became infected, but doctors suspect she may have accidentally consumed worm eggs camouflaged in some edible plants. She lived near a lake inhabited by carpet pythons and would often collect native warrigal greens, which people commonly use for salads or stir-fries.</p>



<p>The eggs probably hatched in her body, spawning larvae that wandered to her organs, causing damage along the way. <em>O. robertsi </em>worms “do not have teeth, but they do migrate through tissue, destroying it,” says Meera Nair, an infectious disease scientist at the University of California, Riverside who studies hookworms and other parasitic worms. The python parasite secretes substances that can dissolve proteins and tissues.</p>



<p>Those lesions doctors saw on the woman’s CT scans were probably due to migrating larvae and the body’s resulting inflammation, Nair says. She thinks it’s almost certain the worm was to blame for the woman’s sudden neurological symptoms.</p>



<p>Senanayake’s team couldn’t find any previous examples of <em>O. robertsi </em>invading other animals’ brains. But other worms do.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Parasitic worms that live in cats and dogs can also infect people</h4>



<p>Different species of roundworms <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-mystery-reveals-new-host-rat-lungworm-parasite">can live inside rats</a> and raccoons and even people’s pets (<em>SN: 7/30/18</em>).</p>





<p>These parasites can infect people and worm their way into the brain — and such infections have occurred in people living in the United States, says Jill Weatherhead, an infectious disease doctor and parasitologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. <em>Toxocara </em>worms parasitize cats and dogs, which may poop in backyards, sandboxes or public parks, spreading eggs where children play. “This is why veterinarians encourage deworming,” she says.</p>



<p>If kids munch on contaminated sand, larvae can hatch in their bodies like they would in a dog or cat. But in people, the larvae won’t end up in the intestines and develop into adults. Instead, they’ll get stuck in other tissues.</p>



<p>Like <em>O. robertsi</em> worms<em>, Toxocara </em>larvae can rattle the stomach and inflame the organs. Doctors have reported cases where the worms meandered up to a person’s eye. “Even though we are accidental hosts,” Weatherhead says, the parasite “can still cause significant disease in humans.”</p>

<p>Though human cases of brain-burrowing roundworms are rare, infections in general may be relatively common. One study estimated that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/2/206/4103318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 1 in 20 people in the United States</a> have been exposed to <em>Toxocara</em>.</p>



<p>But the true number is hard to pinpoint, Weatherhead and her colleagues wrote August 23 in the<em> Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal</em>. Their analysis of <em>Toxocara</em> cases at a children’s hospital in Texas suggested that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37625080/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kids living in low-income areas were more likely to be infected</a> — particularly in areas with stray dogs and cats.</p>



<p>“We shouldn’t be fearful,” Weatherhead says, but it’s important to focus on prevention, especially as humans encroach on other animals’ habitats.</p>



<p>Senanayake agrees: “If you handle vegetation or wildlife, just make sure you wash your hands,” he says. “And if you&#8217;re cooking and consuming vegetation, make sure you cook it well, just to reduce the chance of one of these unusual infections.”</p>



<p>He remembers one unusual case about 20 years ago of a parasite in a young man who swallowed a slug and developed an unusual form of meningitis. Like that man, the woman with the worm will be hard to forget. “Finding a live parasite in the brain is something … you don’t necessarily expect to encounter in your career,” Senanayake says.</p>



<p>After surgery, doctors treated the woman with antiparasitic medications, and her symptoms have since improved. When told about the worm, she was “obviously not thrilled,” he says. But like her doctors, she was relieved to finally have a pathway to treatment.</p>

<p>For the past eight years, an education researcher in Spain has been waging an unsuccessful battle – including legal action – to quash a retraction she argues should never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515000718?via%3Dihub">Her paper</a>, about the use of digital tools in early childhood education, was pulled by <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>just months after it was published in 2015. According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515001414">retraction notice</a>, the article was submitted for publication while it was still under review at another journal, violating editorial policies against duplicate submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to the researcher, <a href="https://produccioncientifica.usal.es/investigadores/56264/detalle">Elena Ramírez Orellana</a> of the University of Salamanca, her paper had already been rejected by the first journal before it was sent to the other. She had the documents to prove it, she said, but that didn’t matter.</p>



<span id="more-127860"></span>



<p>&#8220;We have never been able to reverse the status of the article,&#8221; she told Retraction Watch by email, adding that she had taken the case to court. &#8220;What I have learned throughout this process is that evidence related to scientific evaluation is worth far less than private conversations between editors.&#8221;</p>



<p>It all began in 2012, when Ramírez Orellana and her colleagues submitted their manuscript to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Culture+and+Education%2FCultura+y+Educaci%C3%B3n"><em>Culture and Education/Cultura y Educación</em></a>, a bilingual journal published at the time by Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje and later by Taylor &amp; Francis. The paper was rejected based on two reviews, one positive and one negative. The authors appealed, Ramírez Orellana said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We requested a third referee and the journal agreed. However, the status of the paper, which was rejected, never changed. In December 2012, we reminded the editors of the issue of the third referee, and they said OK, there had been a misunderstanding and they would look into it. The status of the paper remained the same, rejected. We never received any further communication about the third referee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In support of her claims, Ramírez Orellana shared extensive documentation with Retraction Watch, including <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rejected-Cultura-y-Educacion-2012.pdf">screenshots from the editorial management platform</a> (in Spanish).</p>



<p>Two years passed. Then, in December 2014, the researchers submitted their manuscript to <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>, assuming it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere at <em>Culture and Education</em>. They had added &#8220;new tables and figures, new methodology, new references,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana said. They also had rewritten it in English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after <em>Computers &amp; Education</em> published the paper, titled &#8220;Analysis of classroom practices with an ICT resource in early childhood education,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana fired off a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-proposito-del-articulo-CE-16428-50834.pdf">fateful email</a> (in Spanish) telling <em>Culture and Education</em> it could stop looking for a third reviewer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will never regret it enough,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I was really angry about the way our work had been treated in <em>Culture and Education</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her message, in turn, caused then-editor of <em>Culture and Education</em> Liliana Tolchinsky to email <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>. According to Ramírez Orellana, Tolchinsky’s email read, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am contacting you in relation to the paper &#8220;Analysis of Classroom Practices with an ICT Resource in Early Childhood Education&#8221; by Elena Ramírez, Jorge Martín -Domínguez, Begoña Orgaz and Isabel Cañedo that was recently accepted for publication in Computers &amp; Education. I regret to inform you that the above mentioned paper was submitted to your journal in December 2014 while it was under review in Cultura y Educación /Culture and Education a bilingual Journal published by Taylor and Francis. The authors did not communicate to Cultura y Educación that they were submitting the paper to another journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s when <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>decided to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We kept trying to reverse the decision, but it was impossible,&#8221; Ramírez Orellana said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She hired lawyers who contacted Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje. On Oct. 30, 2015, the foundation’s director of publications told the editors of <em>Computers &amp; Education </em>in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/email.pdf">an email</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an in-depth assessment of the article’s situation, and after having consulted with all parts involved (authors, Editor of Cultura y Educación and Board of Trustees of Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje), who are all in agreement with the content of this communication, the journal Cultura y Educación considers the above mentioned article rejected prior to the date in which it was first submitted to Computers &amp; Education.</p>



<p>In view of this consideration on behalf of our journal, the policy regarding dual submissions would not have been violated. We thus courteously invite you to reconsider your decision of retracting the article from your publication.</p>



<p>All parts involved would also like to offer our apologies for any inconveniences.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>Computers &amp; Education</em>, Chin-Chung Tsai of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei, who was among the recipients of the email, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson from Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors of the article retracted from Computers &amp; Education submitted the manuscript to the journal, Culture &amp; Education, published by T&amp;F, in April 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manuscript submitted to Culture &amp; Education was rejected by the journal in June 2012. We were informed by the Editor of Culture &amp; Education that the authors appealed the decision to reject, and the manuscript was sent to an additional reviewer in 2013. The authors submitted the manuscript – in English – to Computers &amp; Education in December 2014.&nbsp; It was subsequently peer-reviewed and accepted in March 2015.&nbsp; Following acceptance by Computers &amp; Education, the authors contacted the editor of Culture &amp; Education to withdraw their manuscript, and the Editor of Culture &amp; Education contacted the Editor of Computers &amp; Education to alert them to the dual submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the policy of Computers &amp; Education that manuscripts submitted to the journal are not under consideration elsewhere, and the editor decided to retract the article following the information on the dual submissions received from Culture &amp; Education.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson did not respond to a question about why the journal had not acted on the 2015 email from Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.</p>



<p>In 2016, Ramírez Orellana said, she filed a lawsuit against Tolchinsky, Begoña Gros Salvat, another editor at <em>Culture and Education</em>, and Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>So far, the results have always been against me, but I am continuing with it because I hope to eventually take the case to the European courts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje declined to comment. Neither Tolchinsky nor Gros Salvat responded to our emails.</p>



<p>Update, 9/18/23, 1100 UTC: In an email sent after our story, Miguel del Río, director of publications at Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje, confirmed to us that the manuscript had not been &#8220;correctly flagged as pending&#8221; in OJS, the editorial management system the journal used at the time, after it was reopened for a third review. As a consequence, its status continued to show as &#8220;rejected.&#8221; And when Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje entered into a publishing partnership with Taylor &amp; Francis in 2014, the manuscript was not transferred to the new editorial management system.</p>



<p>After sending the Oct. 30, 2015, email explaining that the article was considered rejected by&nbsp;<em>Culture and Education</em>&nbsp;before it was submitted to&nbsp;<em>Computers &amp; Education</em>, del Río said, there was nothing more the foundation could do. In a written agreement seen by Retraction Watch, Ramírez Orellana&#8217;s lawyer declared on the same day that his client and her coauthors would sue neither the foundation nor the journal. But a few months later, that&#8217;s exactly what she did, del Río said.</p>

                <p>Note: cOAlition S published the following announcement on its website on Wednesday, September 13th.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, in partnership with<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/"> Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, are delighted to announce the establishment of a multi-stakeholder working group, tasked to identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing.</p>



<p>Following an open <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/moving-away-from-apcs/">call</a> for applicants, we received over 60 high-quality applications. After a thorough review process, with a focus on ensuring that the group represents a diverse range of stakeholders who are committed to supporting a more equitable publishing business model, we are pleased to announce that the following organisations have been invited to join the group.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="437" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names-1024x437.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21584" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names-1024x437.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names-300x128.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names-768x327.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names-1536x655.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/names.png 1743w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>*Beyond article-based charges: list of working group members</p>



<p>The three co-organisers &ndash; cOAlition S (Robert Kiley), Jisc (Anna Vernon) and PLOS (Roheena Anand) &ndash; will also sit on this group and act as Chair on a rotating basis.</p>



<p><strong>About the group</strong></p>



<p> In the original call we had initially aimed to appoint up to 12 members, split roughly equally across the three stakeholder of funders, libraries/library consortia and publishers. However, given the strength of the submitted applications, our final selection resulted in three representatives from funders, five from publishers, and six from libraries/library consortia. While we acknowledge that the stakeholders are not equally represented, we firmly believe that the group is well-balanced and fully capable of delivering on its objectives.</p>



<p>We also sought to ensure global diversity in our selection process, and we are pleased to note that our group includes representatives from Asia, Latin America, as well as North America, Europe and the UK.</p>



<p>The first meeting is scheduled for the 14 September. As and when outputs are created and approved by the group, these will be openly shared.</p>



<p>We would like to conclude by thanking all those organisations who applied to join this working group. Given the breadth of experience and knowledge demonstrated in these applications, we may well reach out to some of them in the future, either to invite them to specific meetings or to request early feedback on any proposals which we will develop.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/opportunities-for-wearable-technology-in-parkinson-s-disease">Opportunities for Wearable Technology in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>A recent study in Nature has found that wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson’s disease years before clinical diagnosis</em></p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are continuing to rise in frequency. The personal and societal impact of these diseases also continues to grow, with Parkinson’s disease (PD) incidence increasing from 2.5 million people worldwide in 1990 to 6.1 million in 2016, an increase which could not wholly be explained by an ageing population. </p>

<p>Resultingly. there is a growing necessity for earlier symptom detection to provide the opportunity to slow, stop and ultimately reverse, the declining slope of neurodegeneration in PD. However, a key challenge in developing new treatments is that as the disease becomes clinically apparent, pathology is often quite advanced and difficult to reverse. Early diagnosis offers the opportunity for early intervention.</p>

<p>The prognostic capacity of wearable devices is an area of active investigation in a range of neurological conditions. Improved ability to predict disease trajectory, and early identification of impairment enable the discovery of potential early markers of PD. </p>

<p>In particular, wearable devices containing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are a promising evaluation tool for neurological symptoms, as they enable researchers to view changes in an individual’s ability to move their body. An IMU is contained within a wearable device and used to measure velocity, orientation, and gravitational force, which in turn can provide detailed information on movement. An accelerometer measures acceleration from inertia (i.e., movement from a resting baseline), and can be particularly suited to evaluating movement disorders such as PD. </p>

<p>A recent study published in Nature used data from over 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank (a national prospective study, collecting data on over half a million individuals aged 40-69 since 2006, with follow-up monitoring of their clinical status) to explore if accelerometery data was a suitable marker for prodromal PD (ie., the early signs and symptoms before a disease becomes clinically apparent). The paper also aims to establish the ability of accelerometery to discriminate between those with and without a diagnosis of PD and its specificity compared to other diagnostic markers. </p>


<p><strong>Accelerometery data as a predictor for Parkinson’s Disease</strong></p>

<p>153 participants in the study had a confirmed clinical diagnosis of PD. Using machine learning models trained on accelerometery data, the researchers found that accelerometers were the best modality to predict if an individual had a PD diagnosis, outperforming models using data on genetics, lifestyle, blood biomarkers, or prodromal clinical signs.</p>

<p>Crucially, accelerometery models also outperformed other models in their ability to distinguish prodromal PD (n = 11) up to 7 years before a diagnosis was made. Accelerometery data enabled identification of cases with greater certainty than models using data from known prodromal markers: genetics, lifestyle, blood biomarkers, prodromal clinical signs or all these modalities combined. </p>

<p>In both prodromal and clinically diagnosed cases of PD, accelerometery data indicated a reduction in daytime levels of activity compared to age and sex matched controls. This reduction began several years before a clinical diagnosis was made, and levels of activity continued to decline as the disease progressed. This reduction in acceleration both before and following diagnosis was specific to subjects affected by PD; no other disease was associated with this reduction, demonstrating its potential as a disease-specific marker. </p>


<p><strong>Implication of these findings</strong></p>

<p>Early detection of PD provides the opportunity for early intervention, for example through inviting patients to participate in clinical trials of neuroprotective treatments. Identifying those at greater risk of developing PD, and any other condition, remains a priority for preventative medicine. Accelerometery offers a minimally invasive, low burden and relatively inexpensive alternative to blood-based, genetic, or imaging biomarkers, and has the potential to be a scalable screening option for prodromal disease. Importantly, a key draw of an accelerometer is the passive collection of real-world data. The majority of us use devices containing accelerometers every day and wrist-worn health activity monitors are becoming more affordable and widely used. Accessing the data from these devices is a valuable alternative option in accelerometer-based population screening.</p>

<p>This study provides evidence that with only a week of real-world data collection an accelerometer has predictive value for several years. Short assessment periods reduce the amount of data needed, and the associated resources required to collected and process it, whilst providing sufficient data to screen large numbers of individuals with minimal participation burden. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/increasing-number-hurricane-rapidly-intensify">What’s driving an increasing number of hurricanes to rapidly intensify?</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the morning of September 5, a loosely swirling system of thunderstorms formed off the western coast of Africa. By September 6, the system had become a Category 1 storm, with maximum winds at least 130 kilometers per hour (80 miles per hour).</p>



<p>Just 24 hours later, fueled by the record-warm waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Lee whipped itself into a Category 5 monster. In that short time span, its wind speeds doubled, to 260 kilometers per hour (160 miles per hour).</p>





<p>As the world’s oceans continue to stockpile heat from global warming, stories of such rapid intensification of tropical cyclones are becoming more commonplace, and not just in the Atlantic.</p>



<p>“While all eyes are on [Hurricane Lee], <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBlake12/status/1699524831505518631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Hurricane Jova] is bombing out in the eastern Pacific</a>,” wrote Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center meteorologist Eric Blake on X, formerly called Twitter, on September 6. “This was just named 36 hours ago and has exploded into a Category 4 hurricane.”</p>



<p>These storms formed just weeks after Hurricane Idalia, which also rapidly intensified. Its wind speeds cranked up from about 120 kph to 209 kph (or 75 mph to 130 mph) in 24 hours. Shortly afterward, Idalia slammed into Florida’s Gulf Coast.</p>



<p>All of these hurricanes easily met — and some greatly exceeded — the National Hurricane Center’s definition of rapid intensification, in which a storm’s maximum sustained winds jump by at least 56 kph (35 mph) in less than a day. Such storms can leave people little time to prepare, making the hurricanes particularly dangerous to lives and property.</p>



<p>Here ‘s what to know about such rapidly intensifying storms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A warmer ocean and atmosphere can supercharge storms</h4>



<p>The key ingredients to boost a storm’s power quickly are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season">very warm ocean waters</a>, a lot of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-fueling-hurricane-florence">moisture in the atmosphere</a> and low vertical wind shear, says atmospheric scientist Philip Klotzbach of Colorado State University in Fort Collins (<em>SN: 9/28/18; SN: 9/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>Vertical wind shear is what happens when winds at different heights in the atmosphere are moving at different speeds and in different directions. Those winds can chip away at a storm as it tries to organize into a tight swirl by pulling heat and moisture away from the storm’s center and sweeping away the upper structure of the storm.</p>



<p>This year saw the onset of an El Niño phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation ocean-climate pattern, a phase that tends to bring more vertical wind shear conditions to the North Atlantic. That means that El Niño years tend to feature fewer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-prediction">Atlantic tropical storms</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/23</em>).</p>



<p>But so far in 2023, El Niño hasn’t done much to minimize hurricane formation, or dampen the storms’ power. “The first half of the season has not seen the unfavorable upper-level wind conditions in the western Atlantic that are typically observed in an El Niño year,” says Ryan Truchelut, president and chief meteorologist of WeatherTiger, a weather consulting firm based in Tallahassee, Fla. That’s true even in the Caribbean Sea, where El Niño’s shearing power tends to be strongest, Truchelut adds.</p>





<p>Generally, there’s more of a contrast in temperature between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins during an El Niño year — the weather pattern heats up the eastern tropical Pacific while the Atlantic stays relatively cool. &nbsp;But 2023 has seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">record-breaking ocean temperatures</a> in the North Atlantic Ocean and in the Gulf of Mexico (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>). While the El Niño-warmed Pacific is about 1.5 degrees Celsius above normal, parts of the Atlantic are 1 to 3 degrees C above normal.</p>



<p>“Temperature contrasts drive jets,” Trechelut says, “and the lack of this contrast is likely responsible for the missing shear.”</p>



<p>The extremely warm waters of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico set the stage — all the storms needed was a window of time with favorable wind conditions, says John Kaplan, a hurricane modeler with the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, based in Miami. &nbsp;“What it really comes down to is whether the conditions for rapid intensification are favorable for even a short period of time,” he says. “If there’s a window — even if not a very long one — the system can take advantage of it. That was the case for both Lee and Idalia.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More storms are rapidly intensifying as Earth warms</h4>



<p>It certainly <em>feels</em> like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire">most of the hurricanes in recent years</a> are rapidly intensifying (<em>SN: 8/27/20</em>). But is that a true trend? And if it is, is it linked to climate change?</p>



<p>Studies suggest that it’s not just anecdotal. In August, researchers reported that the yearly number of tropical storms around the globe that rapidly intensified just offshore (within 400 kilometers of land) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40605-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by about three a decade</a> over the last 40 years, from fewer than five per year in the 1980s to about 15 per year by 2020.</p>



<p>Open-ocean storms, spinning far out in the big blue, showed no discernible trend, the team found. But that’s perhaps not wholly reassuring, as it’s the storms closer to shore that are most threatening to coastal populations. And a 2021 study reported that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb9038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tropical cyclones have been migrating closer to the coasts</a> since 1982.</p>



<p>In 2019, another team focused on observational records of wind-speed changes over 24-hour increments. Based on those data, the researchers found that episodes of rapid intensification in tropical storms <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08471-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tripled from 1982 to 2009</a>. Using climate simulations, the team researchers determined that the rapid intensification trend was strongly linked to anthropogenic human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Truchelut notes that the same team authored a 2022 study <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34321-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that further supported an upward trend</a> over the last few decades, determining that a larger proportion of tropical cyclones are now undergoing rapid intensification at some point in their life cycle.</p>



<p>Regional and local weather patterns — such as more frequent La Niña events (the flipside of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation pattern) — “could dampen rapid intensification trends locally,” Truchelut says. “But there is strong objective evidence that anthropogenic global warming is driving increased proportions of tropical cyclones to undergo rapid intensification worldwide.”</p>



<p>Klotzbach and colleagues, meanwhile, found another fingerprint of climate change in the rapid intensification of cyclones. The researchers reported in 2022 that the increase in global sea surface temperatures correlate well with <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL095774#grl63907-bib-0020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increase in the potential intensity of tropical cyclones</a> around the world — essentially, just how strong the winds are capable of becoming — over the last 30 years. That observed increase was particularly apparent for the most monstrous storms — those whose wind speeds increased by a whopping 93 kph (57 mph) in a single day.</p>



<p>Despite the fury of Lee and Jova, their threat has largely fizzled. Hurricane Lee downgraded to a Category 3 by September 12 and curved northward; however, it’s also tripled in size, threatening Bermuda with tropical storm force winds. Hurricane Jova, meanwhile, ultimately spun harmlessly in the Pacific before weakening.</p>



<p>But with the hurricane season only half over, there’s still time for all that hot water to fuel the next big ones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakes-big-gulp-gans-egg-eater">A little snake’s big gulp may put all other snakes to shame</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hulking hunters like Burmese pythons may be famous for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/python-every-meal-thanksgiving">scarfing up deer, alligators and other enormous prey</a> (<em>SN: 11/25/15</em>). But one unassuming little African snake may take the title for most outsized meals. The nonvenomous, nearly toothless <em>Dasypeltis gansi</em> can <a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jzo.13102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open its mouth wider than any other snake of its size</a>, biologist Bruce Jayne reports August 8 in the <em>Journal of Zoology</em>.</p>



<p><em>D. gansi</em>, sometimes called the Gans’ egg-eater, swallows bird eggs whole, cracks them with its spine and ingests the contents before spitting out the shells. At the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, Jayne inspected 15 egg-eaters ranging from about 20 to about 90 centimeters long. After euthanizing the animals, he slid increasingly wide 3-D printed cylinders into their gaping maws to determine the biggest thing they could swallow.</p>

Jayne/<em>Journal of Zoology</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The biggest Gans’ egg-eater Jayne examined had a roughly 1-centimeter-wide head but could swallow a cylinder about five centimeters across. Previous data show that a petite Burmese python (<em>Python molurus bivittatus</em>) of the same length could gobble up prey just 4.4 centimeters wide. The western diamondback rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus atrox</em>) rivaled the python’s gift for gulp, but no other species came close.</p>



<p>The egg-eater can open so wide because the soft tissue between the tips of its left and right lower jaws at the “chin” is so stretchy. “In Burmese pythons, about 40 percent of that gape area is a result of the stretch of the skin between the lower jaws, but these guys edge out the pythons,” Jayne says, with about half of the Gans’ egg-eater’s gape due to soft tissue stretch.</p>





<p>This species may have evolved such an impressive stretch because, compared with prey that other snakes eat, such as rodents, “an egg is super short,” he says. “You have a limited ability to have a very long egg. But if you get your mouth wider, then you can consume these larger eggs.”</p>

<p>So far, maximum mouth size has been measured for only 13 of more than 3,500 known species of snakes. “Because the amount of stretch in the skin varies so radically in different species,” Jayne says, “it’s much more difficult to measure gape than simply take some calipers on a preserved museum specimen and measure bones.”</p>



<p>Jayne plans to keep investigating mouth sizes for a wider variety of snakes, such as those that dine on fish. Those data could reveal whether egg-eaters truly have the biggest gulp for their gullet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-male-palm-cockatoos-drumsticks">Wild male palm cockatoos rock out with custom drumsticks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like teenage Romeos toting sticker-plastered guitar cases, male palm cockatoos show that romancing a crush with a love song isn’t just about music — it’s also about style.</p>



<p>Wild palm cockatoos (<em>Probosciger aterrimus</em>) <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.1271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">craft bespoke instruments for musical mating rituals</a> according to their individual tastes, researchers report September 13 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </em>Some males were drumstick devotees, others made a mix of drumsticks and seed pod instruments, and one unorthodox male marched to the beat of his own pods — he made almost no drumsticks at all. These individual touches have more to do with personal preference than with available materials, the team found, hinting that these rockin’ cockatoos’ mates might prize creativity or individuality.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Male cockatoos keep the beat | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEDiwH2143I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video from 2017 shows wild male palm cockatoos keeping a drumbeat during mating displays. New research by the same team now shows the birds’ choice of instruments is as individualized as their musical style.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Adding distinctive touches to their instruments is not “a routine that is always the same in every animal,” says cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, who was not involved in the research. “There is some element of innovation to it.”</p>





<p>If humans were birds, we might be something like parrots. Like us and our primate cousins, parrots have big, clever brains, complex social lives and extended childhoods spent learning from their parents.</p>



<p>Unlike primates, most parrots aren’t known to use tools in the wild. And “most parrots that have been studied using tools have been studied in captivity,” Auersperg says. For instance, her team found that wild-caught Goffin’s cockatoos (<em>Cacatua goffiniana</em>) held temporarily in a research aviary, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">wielded sophisticated toolkits for foraging</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>2/10/23</em>).</p>



<p>Wild palm cockatoos are a fabulous and fascinating exception. These striking, endangered birds live in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea, and they craft and use tools not to find food, but to find a mate — a rarity that stands out even in primate company.</p>



<p>A male palm cockatoo puts on a musical mating display from trees in his territory. He <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/male-cockatoos-have-beat">sings, twirls and drums rhythmically against the tree, often using a percussion instrument</a>, a stick or seed pod, clutched in his left foot (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/28/17</em>). As part of the display, he crafts the instrument himself and the female watches as he snaps off tree branches and whittles them just so. Add in the birds’ dramatic black and red plumage and tall, spiked crests and you’ve got perhaps the closest nature can come to a rock concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those tapping displays actually have all the hallmarks of human music using instruments,” says conservation biologist Rob Heinsohn of the Australian National University in Canberra. “And the males all have their own drumming signatures. Some like to do it really slowly, some go very quickly, and then others throw in little flourishes.”</p>



<p>Heinsohn and his colleagues wanted to see if these rocker birds express their singular style through their instruments, too.</p>



<p>Over two years, the researchers wandered Australia’s Kutini-Payamu National Park and surrounding Aboriginal lands listening for the calls of displaying male cockatoos. This led the team to 70 display trees, where the scientists collected a total of 227 drumsticks and 29 seed pod instruments discarded by the birds. Like a musician smashing a guitar at the end of a concert, male cockatoos toss their instruments to the ground after a display.</p>



<p>Comparing instruments discarded by 12 individual cockatoos revealed what the researchers interpret as evidence for individual preference in their instrument designs. Drumstick length varied more from bird to bird than would be expected by random chance. Some preferred short and stubby drumsticks, while others made longer, thinner ones.</p>



<p>“Each one has developed his own idea as to what makes a special drumstick,&#8221; says Heinsohn. There are many “different ways of getting it right — of being a good artist, both in their musical performance, but also in the crafting of these tools,” he says. “I think being really individual and being creative and being out there on your own is part of what the females are looking for.”</p>





<p>While musical instruments are practically universal across human cultures, and we frequently incorporate flashy objects into our romance rituals, other animals rarely use tools for either music or mating displays. Scientists also rarely find evidence for individual creative choices among nonhuman toolmakers.</p>



<p>This makes palm cockatoos triply fascinating: With their signature styles in music and craftsmanship, these feathered flirts are a good reminder that humanity isn’t always as special as it seems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/12/interesting-papers-on-recent-neuroscience-methods/">Interesting papers on recent neuroscience methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>Find below three interesting methods papers relevant for neuroscience. All three of them are, in my opinion, worth a quick read.</p>



<p><strong>Acoustic cameras to localize ultrasound vocalization of mice</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.86126">Sterling et al. (2023)</a> from the lab of Bernhard Englitz addressed the problem how to localize ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) from rodents, in particular mice. The localization of USVs and their reliable attribution to a specific mouse can be challenging, especially when mice are interacting snout-to-snout. The authors managed to perform sound localization with a precision of less than 5 mm (91% of USVs correctly assigned). How do they achieve this?</p>



<p>The authors combined two complementary approaches. In a first approach, they used an “acoustic camera” formed by an 8&#215;8 array of 64 ultrasound microphones (<a href="https://sorama.eu/products/cam64">https://sorama.eu/products/cam64</a>). This approach provided spatially precise localization but was less reliable for high frequencies. In a second approach, they used an array of only 4 but high-quality ultrasound microphones (<a href="https://www.avisoft.com/">https://www.avisoft.com/</a>). Figure supplement 1-1 nicely compares the noise spectra of these two microphone types. The second approach was more important to detect USV events, while the “acoustic camera” approach was essential for localization of the detected events. A nice methods paper!</p>



<p><strong>Glyoxal fixation for improved antibody staining</strong></p>



<p>In this study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf7084">Konno et al. (2023)</a> from the lab of Masahiko Watanabe refined and tested an alternative protocol for immunohistochemistry (IHC), following up on a study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695709">Richter et al. (2018)</a>. The authors replaced the standard fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, PFA) by a different solution (glyoxal) and find that this modified fixation protocol enables improved diffusion of and labeling with antibodies, including antibodies against important proteins such as synaptic adhesion molecules, receptor proteins and ion channels.</p>



<p>The authors mention a few caveats in the Discussion: Glyoxal fixation improved signal for certain antibodies but not for all, without an indication why this could be the case. The sample seemed to be less than hard and fixed for glyoxal than for PFA fixation. Moreover, they report that “ultrastructural images of neurons and synapses” were more strongly compromised by glyoxal fixation compared to PFA fixation. This last comment seems interesting, since <a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695709">Richter et al. (2018)</a> in their original publication on glyoxal fixation stated that ultrastructure was better conserved in glyoxal than in PFA. I’m curious whether glyoxal might become the new standard for IHC during the next decade!</p>



<p><strong>Near-infrared co-illumination protects fluorophores</strong></p>



<p>Fluorescence occurs when fluorophore molecules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">transition into an excited state</a> and, during the relaxation process into the ground state, release a photon. This process can go awry when the molecule transitions from the excited state into a dark (triplet) state or other non-desired states where the molecule is stuck (photobleaching) or which result in chemical reactions that generate oxidative stress (phototoxicity). As an experimentalist, it is essential to find the balance between (a) as much power as necessary (to be able to observe the structures of interest) and (b) as little power as possible (to prevent bleaching and toxicity).</p>



<p>In a surprising study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01893-7">Ludvikova et al. (2023)</a> find that near-infrared (NIR) light prevents photobleaching and phototoxicity. The authors performed imaging of standard fluorescent proteins (EGFP) in cell culture using one-photon widefield microscopy with an excitation wavelength of around 470 nm. They find that co-illumination with NIR light (approx. 900 nm) reduced bleaching induced by 470 nm. It is not fully clear from the study why NIR co-illumination prevents transitioning into triplet states, but the evidence that this indeed happens seems very convincing.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how this can be generalized to different illumination intensities and patterns, e.g., to confocal or light-sheet microscopy. And it poses the intriguing question whether two-photon microscopy of green fluorophores, which typically uses a wavelength in the NIR (around 920 nm), also takes advantage of this protective effect. For two-photon microscopy, illumination already occurs at around 900 nm, so it could be that the same photons that induce fluorescence also protect from bleaching/toxicity. It seems however challenging to test this hypothesis experimentally. As a sidenote, I’m reminded of my own experiments (reported in <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">this blog post</a>) where I found that long-lived dark triplet states seemed to be less relevant at 920 nm than predicted from experiments performed at 800 nm. I’m hoping that follow-up studies will further dissect the NIR co-illumination effect and study its relevance for other imaging modalities, especially confocal and light-sheet imaging!</p>

<p>Today is a very big day for Retraction Watch and The Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit. Bear with me while I explain, starting with some history.</p>



<p>When Adam Marcus and I <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2010/08/03/why-write-a-blog-about-retractions/">launched Retraction Watch in 2010</a>, we envisioned it as a journalism blog that would break stories no one else was covering, and examine whether scientific correction mechanisms were robust. And for some time, that’s just what it was. Our traffic and visibility grew quite quickly, but the team didn’t. It was years before we even had an intern.</p>



<p>Things changed in 2014 and 2015. Three philanthropies – the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/15/retraction-watch-growing-thanks-400000-grant-macarthur-foundation/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/03/new-300000-grant-marks-the-fifth-anniversary-of-retraction-watch/">Arnold Foundation</a> (now Arnold Ventures), and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/06/thank-helmsley-charitable-trust-325000-grant-renewal-will-help-us-build-sustainable-future/">Helmsley Trust</a> – approached us with some version of “We think what you’re doing is important. How can we help?”</p>



<span id="more-127849"></span>



<p>Around that time we realized the world lacked a comprehensive database of retractions. We saw how many were missing from sources researchers used, whether PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, or others – including Crossref, more about which I will say in a moment. We were cataloging them in spreadsheets ourselves, but couldn’t keep up.</p>



<p>The three foundations all agreed to support our work, not just the journalism, but to create what became The Retraction Watch Database, officially <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty">launched in 2018</a>. Part of that funding was a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/03/helmsley-trust-helps-retraction-watch-chart-its-future-with-new-130000-grant/">grant to create a strategic plan for sustainability and growth</a>. One of the pillars of that plan was licensing the Database to organizations – commercial and nonprofit – who could use it in products that would help researchers know when what they were reading had been retracted, among other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those license fees – along with other income, particularly individual donations and a subcontract from a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) – have kept Retraction Watch and The Center for Scientific Integrity running for several years. We are deeply grateful for the support and show of confidence they represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we also always wanted to make the Database available to as many people as possible, whether or not they had access to tools that licensed it, if we could find a financial model that did not rely on such fees. (We always provided the data free of charge to scholars studying retractions and related phenomena.)</p>



<p><strong>Fast forward to today. We’re thrilled to announce that <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9">Crossref has acquired The Retraction Watch Database</a> and will make it completely open and freely available. </strong></p>



<p>For those of you unfamiliar, here’s how <a href="http://crossref.org">Crossref</a> describes itself: “Crossref makes research objects easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse. We’re a not-for-profit membership organization that exists to make scholarly communications better.” They are indeed the ideal home for the Database, and the perfect collaborator: A nonprofit organization that shares our mission and has a highly successful track record of building tools and resources that make research more efficient.</p>



<p><strong>But there’s more.</strong> As part of our agreement with them, and to recognize the clear value of what Retraction Watch has created, Crossref has paid us an acquisition fee that is roughly equivalent to half of our annual budget. They will also pay us an annual fee, initially for five years, to continue to maintain and update the database. That fee covers the salary of our research director, Alison Abritis, as well as a new deputy for Alison who starts next week.</p>



<p>That means we have achieved sustainability – the highest priority goal for any nonprofit – for the database side of our operation. And the acquisition fee provides important unrestricted reserves that allow for breathing room and the potential for growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which brings me back to the journalism side of the house. Retraction Watch has, with the exception of about a year of its 13-year-existence, been a volunteer activity for me and Adam. It will remain that way. But our new and consistent funding stream means that I will be able to devote a lot of the time that I spent working on the Database – including negotiating data use agreements – on growing Retraction Watch itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">generous grant from the WoodNext Foundation</a>, we now have two reporter-editors on staff. We know there are far more stories than two people – plus me and Adam as part-time high-level editors and directors – can tell. For a brief&nbsp; period of time while all of our grants were in place, we had as many as five salaried journalists. I’d love to get back to that level of staffing, and will be working on fundraising and bringing in more revenue in the coming months and years. If that moves you to support us now, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/support-retraction-watch/">please do</a>.</p>



<p>Thank you to Crossref, to those who have licensed our data, and to everyone who has supported us financially and otherwise over the past 13 years. We’re here for the long haul, and we’re grateful that you’ll be with us too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emma-rotor-filipino-math-teacher-wwii-weapons-fuse">Filipino math teacher Emma Rotor helped develop crucial WWII weapons tech</a></h4>

              
                <p>As an amateur historian studying Philippine-American history in Washington, D.C., I’ve long been familiar with the story of Arturo Rotor and Emma Unson Rotor.</p>



<p>The couple moved from the Philippines to Baltimore in 1941 for graduate studies, but World War II disrupted their plans. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese invaded the Philippines, occupying it for three years. The Philippine Commonwealth Government (the Philippines had not yet gained independence from the United States) escaped to Washington in May 1942; Arturo joined the government in exile soon after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Arturo, who became secretary to the Philippine president and secretary to the Commonwealth cabinet, was something of a Renaissance man. He was an accomplished medical doctor and professor, a prize-winning writer, a classically trained pianist and an orchid enthusiast. Both Rotor syndrome and an orchid variety (<em>Vanda merrillii var. rotorii</em>) are named for him. He was a man “surrounded by myth,” cultural historians Edilberto Alegre and Doreen Fernandez wrote in 1984.</p>



<p>In contrast, his wife Emma was seen as a supportive, background presence. “Emma Unson Rotor sat quietly by [then] made an occasional comment, illustrating the supportive, companionable intelligence with which she had seen master short story craftsman Dr. Arturo Rotor through his long and shining career,” Fernandez wrote in an article describing an oral history project focused on Filipino writers. In the postwar period, Arturo and Emma lived back in the Philippines. Arturo remained a public figure, active in medical and literary circles, while Emma taught math at Assumption College, a private school in Makati.</p>

<p>But Emma Rotor was not only a devoted wife and math teacher. While living in the United States, she conducted groundbreaking weapons research.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the fuze changed warfare</h4>



<p>In late 2021, I read an article by Ma. Isabel Ongpin published in the <em>Manila Times</em> claiming that <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/15/opinion/columns/dr-arturo-b-rotor-and-emma-unson-rotor-filipino-lives-worth-remembering/1818446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Rotor was involved in weapons research</a> during the war. I was astonished. “Mrs. Rotor was a teacher of higher mathematics, a subject I stayed away from, knowing my non-quantitative mind,” Ongpin wrote. “But I had her in geography, and she was great. Mrs. Rotor as a mathematician had worked in the Manhattan Project, the secret project that produced the atomic bomb.” I reached out immediately to Ongpin to ask for any reference material she might have that documented Emma Rotor’s time with the Manhattan Project. She replied that it was simply known by everyone who studied at Assumption College, where Emma taught until the 1980s.</p>



<p>After searching through archival material for several months, I found no evidence that Emma was involved in the Manhattan Project. But Emma was indeed part of another weapons research program, arguably just as consequential. She became a key member of a government division that developed an early version of the proximity fuze, the mechanism that makes a shell or bomb detonate when it gets close to its target rather than on impact.</p>



<p>Before the proximity fuze, bombs were known to be inefficient, detonating prematurely and away from their intended targets. An often mentioned and telling statistic is that it took 20,000 shells to take down one aircraft during the London Blitz. First used in June 1943 to bring down a Japanese aircraft, the proximity fuze, which relied on radar technology, was used in major battles in Europe and Asia. In June 1944, the fuze enabled the British to take down nearly 80 percent of German V-1 “buzz bombs.”&nbsp; The fuze was, according to the War Department, “one of the outstanding scientific developments of World War II” and “second only to the atomic bomb.”</p>



<p>First headed by the British in the 1930s, proximity fuze research was later largely led by the U.S. government. The National Research Defense Committee assigned the task of developing fuzes “for non-rotating (e.g., fin-stabilized) munitions such as bombs, rockets and mortar shells,” to the Ordnance Development Division at the National Bureau of Standards, or NBS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The work on rotating projectiles was assigned to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution and to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emma Rotor worked on the fuze</h4>



<p>Emma Rotor first came to the United States in October 1941, at the age of 28, a few months after Arturo moved to Baltimore to begin his studies of allergies and medical history at John Hopkins. She had planned to study physics there while on leave from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, where she was a mathematics instructor. The war interrupted those plans. She was undeterred, however, and worked briefly as stenographer at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore.</p>





<p>“Oh I was not discouraged,” she said in 1942 in an interview with the Baltimore <em>Evening Sun</em>. “Did I not see in the papers long columns of advertisements — girls wanted, no experience, good salaries? Well, I can work, can’t I?” Though cut off from their families, “we had to learn not to worry, not to think about the things we could not change,” she said. As Emma talked, the article said, “[h]er face is rich with smiles that soften the features and round out the contours.” She is telling a story that is not happy, it continued, “except in that she makes it so.”</p>



<p>In January 1944, Arturo having already joined the Philippine government in exile, Emma joined the Ordnance Development Division, led by radio engineer pioneer Harry Diamond, at NBS, now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Hired as a physicist in a “war time appointment,” she was tasked with supporting “experimental investigations connected with the development of new ordnance devices,” including the “design, construction and testing of mechanical, electrical and radio devices,” according to her appointment letter, which I tracked down with the help of independent researcher Emma Prince, based in St. Louis.</p>



<p>Keith Martin, a librarian at NIST, who I exchanged email messages with, estimates a total of 155 staff members in the division at the time, including those not involved in proximity fuze research, and about 31 in Emma’s section.</p>



<p>She was promoted in less than a year. And in March 1945, her supervisor, physicist William B. McLean, gave her an “excellent” performance rating. “Regardless of grade, Mrs. Rotor is one of the most valuable individuals in the present project,” McLean wrote.</p>



<p>During her time with NBS, which ended in 1947, Emma wrote several scientific papers or coauthored them with colleagues, including Albert G. Hoyem, a physics professor at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who later became a senior official of the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake in California. Her work on “Air travel required for release of arming cover” and on “Measurement of dynamic propeller unbalance” are cited in the 1946 summary report of the Ordnance Development Division’s work on the proximity fuze, titled “<a href="https://archive.org/details/radioproximityfu01elle/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio Proximity Fuzes for Fin-Stabilized Missiles</a>.”</p>



<p>“Evaluation of the toss technique” (which she authored with Hoyem) reports the results of tests to map out trajectories of bombs. The paper appears in a collected volume of scientific articles on “<a href="https://archive.org/details/bombrockettorped00unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb, Rocket, and Torpedo Tossing</a>” published in 1946 that also credits Emma “not only for the contributions mentioned above but also for her diligent supervision of the review and assembly of the final manuscript.” She appears to be the only woman among the authors.</p>



<p>NIST’s museum features a proximity fuze and a fin-stabilized missile that, as Martin wrote via email, “she, and others, had a hand in developing.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emma Rotor’s legacy</h4>



<p>Arturo died in 1988 and Emma in 1998. Arturo and Emma never had children of their own, but a niece, Delia Unson, and a grandniece, Ria Unson, remember Emma fondly. “Tita Emma was an amazing teacher,” Delia Unson, a retired clinical psychologist, recalls. “She could teach anyone and get them to love or at least like math. I met some of her students and found that they loved her!” Emma thought math was easy, Delia Unson says, “because you didn&#8217;t have to remember a lot. As long as one remembered the basic formulas and laws.” </p>



<p>Ria Unson remembers spending many afternoons when she was young at Emma’s house. “She was an accepting, nonjudgmental person,” Ria Unson says. A visual artist, Ria Unson has been keeping alive her memories of Emma through her art.</p>



<p>I asked Ria Unson if she thought Emma would have been comfortable with an article highlighting her role in weapons research. She paused. “I don’t think she looked for the spotlight,” Ria Unson said. “She just did what was asked.”</p>



<p>It is clear, however, that Emma didn’t talk openly with her family about this aspect of her life. A couple of family members did think briefly that she might have been part of the Manhattan Project. “Tita, did you work on the bomb?” Ria Unson recalls her father asking Emma likely at a family gathering decades ago. No, Emma replied, a faint smile. “I worked on the fuze.”</p>



<p>No one understood what she meant then, Delia Unson and Ria Unson said, until I showed them a few months ago her work on the proximity fuze. “That was so like her,” Ria Unson said, thinking of that moment at the family gathering. “She wanted people to know but didn’t want people to know.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/highest-elevation-mammal-mouse-rodent">The world’s highest-dwelling mammal isn’t the only rodent at extreme elevation</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a series of expeditions along the spine of the Andes Mountains, a team of high-climbing researchers has found mammalian life scampering through some of Earth’s harshest environments.</p>



<p>From 2020 to 2022, evolutionary biologist Jay Storz and colleagues trekked to the peaks of 21 volcanoes in South America. They’ve seen plumes of gas billowing from rocky vents, endured ferocious winds and subfreezing temperatures, and spent nights camping nearly 6,000 meters above the sea. “It&#8217;s really hard to exaggerate how inhospitable these super high elevation environments are,” says Storz, of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>





<p>The austere landscapes look like something you might see on Mars, he says — not the kind of places you’d expect to see wildlife. But for some mammals, such extreme locales are home. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.22.554215v1?ct=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple species of rodents live at or near the high-altitude peaks of Andean volcanoes</a>, well above where alpine herbs, dwarf shrubs and other plants can grow, Storz and his colleagues report in a paper posted August 23 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Finding mammalian life above the vegetation line is “pretty unique and incredible, because what do they eat?” asks Jonathan Velotta, a biologist at the University of Denver who studies how animals adapt to extreme environments. He thinks Storz’s new work could change how scientists think about where life exists. It “suggests that animals live higher than we thought was possible,” Velotta says.</p>



<p>Storz and his colleagues are no strangers to altitudinous adventures. Three years ago, the researchers reported the world-record holder for highest-dwelling mammal. They found the animal, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-american-mouse-world-highest-dwelling-mammal">a yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse</a>, on the summit of Volcán Llullaillaco at an altitude of 6,739 meters, more than three quarters the height of Mount Everest <em>(SN: 7/29/20)</em>.</p>



<p>But the scientists wondered if finding that mouse meant more mammals actually lived at extreme elevations — or if spotting it was just a fluke. The team embarked on a series of elevational surveys — the broadest ever conducted — over a wider geographic area, catching small mammals from the coastline of northern Chile to the crest of the Andean mountain chain. Researchers have performed other surveys at different high-altitude sites, Velotta says, but the areas Storz’s team explored are higher, more remote and require more specialized training and equipment. “It takes mountaineering expertise to do what they do,” Velotta says.</p>



<p>Trips can last three weeks or more, and Storz’s team packs everything they’ll need in a couple of pickup trucks. Their destinations are so remote, there’s typically no opportunity to resupply. They’ll bring food, fuel, water, ice axes, crampons, climbing rope and hundreds of live traps. The team will start catching mice at low altitudes, then work their way up, acclimatizing to higher elevations along the way. Eventually, the researchers will set up base camp at around 5,000 meters above sea level, and sometimes a second camp even higher.</p>

<p>Oxygen levels drop as elevation rises; at base camp and beyond, the researchers may be breathing about half the amount of oxygen they would at sea level. That makes it hard to sleep and hard to do science, says Guillermo D’Elía, an evolutionary biologist at Austral University of Chile. “Everything gets slower,” he says. At sea level, he can set twenty traps in 20 or 30 minutes. At altitude, it takes him about double that time.</p>



<p>Dealing with the lack of oxygen gets easier after a few days, Storz says, but the expeditions’ hardships underscore just how difficult it is to survive in cold, low oxygen conditions. “We’re experiencing the same kind of environmental challenges that our study animals are.”</p>



<p>On his team’s latest trips, the researchers found species of mice that take second through fifth place for highest elevational record for mammals.</p>



<p>Though their work focuses on small mammals, D’Elía says, there’s so much more to explore. He’s seen wandering lizards, insects, subterranean rodents called tuco-tucos and puma tracks near high-altitude hot springs. Rabbitlike viscacha hop along the volcanoes’ rocky slopes, and on one memorable trip, Storz saw a pack South American ostriches rush by. “They look so prehistoric,” Storz says, like velociraptors. Add in the volcanic vistas and you’ve got something straight out of <em>The Land Before Time</em>, he says.</p>





<p>The team’s expeditions have given him a new appreciation for the capacity of animals to survive in unimaginably harsh conditions. “Even in these hostile environments,” Storz says, “life finds a way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-atmosphere-meteor-lightning-space">Flashes in Venus’ atmosphere might be meteors, not lightning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Occasional flashes light up Venus’ shroud of clouds. Previous analyses have hinted that the bursts of light could be lightning in the hellish world’s atmosphere. But a new study suggests most of the flashes may be nothing more than the brief yet brilliant blazes of meteors.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">upcoming missions planned for Venus</a>, scientists are eager to figure out the light’s origin (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). If the flashes are lightning, the electrical phenomenon could pose risks to future probes dropping through the Venusian atmosphere or carried by balloons for extended periods in the planet’s clouds, says Claire Blaske, a planetary scientist now at Stanford University. Small meteors that burn up in the atmosphere, however, wouldn’t pose much of a danger.</p>





<p>Previous landers on Venus have often detected electromagnetic static similar to the type picked up on AM radio and caused by lightning during thunderstorms on Earth, Blaske says. And orbiters and Earth-based telescopes have discerned brief, bright flashes in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But the static and optical flashes have never been detected simultaneously, Blaske says. And, notes Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study, “it’s not clear there is the potential for lightning on Venus” given how little is known about the dynamics of its atmosphere.</p>



<p>Blaske, then at Arizona State University in Tempe, and her colleagues wondered whether meteors could be masquerading as lightning on Venus. Two surveys counted the flashes of light: one by a telescope on Arizona’s Mount Bigelow and one by instruments aboard Japan’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japanese-spacecraft-reaches-venus-five-years-late">Akatsuki orbiter</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/15</em>).</p>



<p>Given that data, there are probably <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JE007914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 10,000 and 100,000 of these flashes each year</a>, the researchers report in the September <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em><em>: </em><em>Planets.</em></p>



<p>That may seem like too many flashes to all be caused by meteors. After all, Venus is a slightly smaller cosmic target than Earth. But meteors there will be substantially brighter — and thus more noticeable — because they are traveling faster on average: The space rocks zip through Venus’ atmosphere at about 25 kilometers per second, compared with 20.3 kilometers per second for meteoroids entering Earth’s atmosphere. In part, that’s because Venus is traveling around the sun faster than Earth is.</p>



<p>Overall, these factors and others led Blaske and her colleagues to conclude that meteors could be numerous enough to account for most, if not all, of the flashes expected to occur in Venus’ atmosphere.</p>



<p>The team’s analysis “is convincing and does a nice job of establishing a plausible explanation for these flashes,” Byrne says. Future observations that simultaneously measure the flashes and electromagnetic static on Venus could help resolve the mystery. But other big questions remain. For example, it’s unknown whether Venus might experience a form of lightning, or other type of electrical discharge, in its carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere that isn’t accompanied by flashes of light but could still pose a risk to probes.</p>

For one it does not adequately convey the relation between culture and biology. It is time we admit the insufficiency of the positivist project; we should not tie our hopes of explanation too tightly to the experimental paradigms we develop to operationalize prevalent metaphors of mind (Koch, 1999; Danziger, 2008). </p><p>Joseph Henrich’s reflections on the cultural context of empirical research further suggest that the majority of our findings reflect a very small WEIRD sample of the human population. Lack of context obscures the significance and meaning of research results. Empirical psychology ought to foreground historical and cultural context so that in addition to deriving descriptive principles of mechanism, psychologists can discursively approach the phenomena as part of our broader cultural projects. </p><p>Drawing from historical and anthropological forms of analysis will allow psychology to better encapsulate how the mind emerges from and reflects back onto its particular cultural context. </p><h2>History and context can expand empirical psychology</h2><p>An interdisciplinary psychology must posit explanation at multiple levels, from description of the mechanics of receptor function to the discursive space of identity. Mixing these distinct layers of explanation would allow the mind sciences to express the phenomenological reality of the contextual setting of individual minds. <em>Anthropology</em> is designed to secure such stories and will help us describe what epistemic use psychology fulfills in a given locale. For example, psychology is used in the West to assess pathology and provide therapeutic interventions for mental suffering. </p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;It is time we admit the insufficiency of the positivist project.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>If tradition is the self-encounter of the human mind, horizon is the vantage point of knowing the relative significance of a finite position.&nbsp;<em>History</em>&nbsp;then allows for a broader understanding of the reflexive links between knowledge and practice. As Gadamer (2004) surmised, we understand the&nbsp;<em>horizon</em>&nbsp;of the questions we ask by regaining concepts from the past in a way that includes our own comprehension of them. Deployment of psychology in concordance with an historical anthropology enriches our understanding of the symbolic sphere we inhabit. According to Roger Smith (2019: 17), “Historical knowledge contributes narrative, and the understanding of narrative is fundamental to the notion of being human; human self-knowledge and action are mutually constitutive, or, belief changes a person and what a person does changes belief.”&nbsp;</p><p>We also know from history that many causes are best characterized as chaotic or through complexity theory due uncertainty, the interdependency of variables, and the contingent nature of agency (Gaddis, 2002). The historical method of developing narratives seems to be crucial to our imaginative appraisals of truth and knowledge and should be considered in its own regard as a shaping influence upon the nature of belief and explanation in psychology. Observation, imaginative sense-making, and perspective-taking are themselves sources of knowledge rather than artifacts in the scientific process (Osbeck, 2019).</p><p>Models should allow for variability, design limitations, and failure rates. Heuristics should be understood as pragmatic applications that we substitute for deductive knowledge (Wimsatt, 1976). Our theories should be so robust and valid that failure of replication does not threaten the foundation of the field. To counteract these crises, psychologists can develop familiarity with levels of analysis above and below the brain and the person. In this way, we can develop generative models which are open to inter-field integration.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Making psychology a more reflexive human science would bestow a sense of scope and context.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>It is time empirical psychology adds historical and anthropological methodology so that in addition to descriptive principles of mechanism and verificationism a new generation of psychologists will approach the mind with a view to more discursive, contextualized, and empathetic explanation. Some community psychology is already moving in this direction, but we also need laboratory and theoretical research to adopt this approach. Making psychology a more reflexive human science would bestow a sense of scope and context and allow for more effective communication with humanists and natural scientists.&nbsp;</p><p>Exciting frontier work that integrates types of explanation are being undertaken in the study of affect, pain management, and the gut-brain axis. Such work expands and investigates the embeddedness and multilevel integration of mind and body. Focusing on such phenomena has the potential to unify subjective/mental and objective/material aspects of mind because it concerns the precise relations between bodily mechanisms and enculturated conscious experience. Using anthropology, we can see healing as the pragmatic goal of such work in the historical context of a shift from dualism to monism. Through a more thorough understanding of our mythological frames, we can better understand the motivations of the unique form of shared understanding that is psychological explanation.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/793053287/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/793053287/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f08%2fGabriel-OUPBlog-Image-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/793053287/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/rising-seas-eroding-beaches-and-fewer-fish-in-africa/">Rising seas, eroding beaches, and fewer fish in Africa</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/antonina-a-sixth-century-military-wife/">Antonina: a sixth-century military wife</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/09/the-turn-to-domestic-accountability-in-the-shadow-of-international-criminal-tribunals/">The turn to domestic accountability in the shadow of international criminal tribunals</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>
