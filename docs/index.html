<p>The authors of a paper on how motivation influences&nbsp; intelligence test scores have retracted their paper following the retraction of a 50-year-old study included in their analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part meta-analysis and part longitudinal study, “Role of test motivation in intelligence testing” appeared in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>in 2011. The meta-analysis portion included a 1978 paper by Stephen Breuning, a child psychologist who was the subject of 1987 report from the National Institute of Mental Health that found he “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly” engaged in research misconduct and fabricated results in 10 NIMH funded articles.</p>



<p>As we reported earlier this year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/20/stephen-breuning-nimh-misconduct-retraction/">six of Breuning’s papers have been retracted</a>, including one last December. That article, published in 1978 in the<em> Journal of School Psychology</em>, found record albums, sporting event tickets, portable radios, and other incentives boosted scores on IQ tests.</p>



<span id="more-131956"></span>



<p>The 1978 paper wasn’t part of the NIMH investigation, but came about “due to concerns about the integrity of the data reported and other issues identified within the NIMH Final Report that clearly established a pattern of ongoing scientific misconduct,” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">the retraction notice</a> read.</p>



<p>The authors of the 2011 <em>PNAS </em>study became aware of the retraction in January 2025, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508040122">the retraction notice</a>, which is dated May 1. “Reanalyzing the data without the retracted study … does substantively change the results of the meta-analysis,” the notice, signed by study coauthors <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth">Angela Lee Duckworth</a>, <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/about/directory/Patrick-Quinn-quinnp.html">Patrick D. Quinn</a>, and <a href="https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/donald-lynam/">Donald R. Lynam</a>, stated. The effect size was reduced but remained statistically significant.</p>



<p>“However—and most important—while in our 2011 publication, only one of four tests indicated publication bias, there is now strong evidence of publication bias for all four tests,” the authors continued. When adjusting for publication bias, the result was no longer statistically significant, they stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second portion of their paper, the longitudinal study, was not affected. “Although the results of Study 2 are not in need of correction, given the extensive changes to the findings in Study 1, we have decided to retract the article,” the authors stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction follows an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2502439122">expression of concern</a> on the article, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/24/pnas-expression-concern-iq-breuning-duckworth-nimh-misconduct/">we reported in February</a>. The paper has been cited 215 times, four of which were after the expression of concern, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Research psychologist Russell Warne had been studying Breuning’s work, and, as we reported in our earlier story, had reached out to Duckworth and <em>PNAS </em>about the inclusion of Breuning’s data. “A retraction is more than I expected,” Warne told us this week. “I hope that the journal allows them to resubmit a corrected version. The 2011 article was a legitimate investigation into an important scientific question, and I would hate to see Dr. Duckworth&#8217;s research permanently sidelined because she and her coauthors were the victim of scientific fraud.”</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that David Robert Grimes and Mariana Ribeiro will join the Retraction Watch team as Sleuths in Residence starting June 1.</p>



<p>Earlier this year we announced the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/02/introducing-the-retraction-watch-sleuth-in-residence-program/">Sleuth in Residence Program</a>, an opportunity for active sleuths to have a secure and paid position while working closely with our research team on specific projects, and with our journalism team to publish their findings. Our goal is to build capacity in this space to emphasize the value of compensating and protecting the critical work of sleuths.</p>



<p>We’re pleased to be able to bring on two Sleuths in Residence as part of this effort.</p>

<p>Mariana Ribeiro is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Brazil’s National Cancer Institute (INCA), where she leads the development of the Institute’s scientific integrity framework, focusing on governance and educational initiatives. She has almost 10 years of experience in retraction studies. She holds a degree in biomedical sciences from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in Brazil, and a Ph.D. in science education from the Institute of Medical Biochemistry Leopoldo de Meis (IBqM/UFRJ). Her M.Sc. and Ph.D. research focused on retractions, science communication and policy, supported by datasets collected from the Retraction Watch and Retraction Database. Her interests include the relationship between <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-023-00446-0">retractions and the reward system of science</a>, as well as new models of scholarly communication, the <a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201947906">relationship between science and the public</a>, and the social responsibility of scientists.</p>



<p>“The Sleuths in Residence program brings a longtime goal into reality for us,” said Ivan Oransky, Retraction Watch cofounder and executive director of the Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent organization for Retraction Watch. “We have long relied on the important work of sleuths in our reporting to hold researchers, editors, journals and publishers accountable for maintaining the integrity of scientific research. Sleuths are typically unpaid and work at great personal risk. We are proud to bring David and Mariana on board as our first Sleuths in Residence.”</p>



<p>The Sleuths in Residence are one-year positions. The program is funded by a generous donation from George Tidmarsh.</p>

<p>Investigative journalist Charles Piller’s latest book, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Doctored/Charles-Piller/9781668031247"><em>Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s</em></a>, came out in February. It details the work of Matthew Schrag, a neurologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., and other sleuths who uncovered evidence of problems in hundreds of research papers about the neurologic condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most reviews and coverage have been positive, Piller said. But some Alzheimer’s researchers have criticized the book in reviews published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831830"><em>JAMA</em></a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00112-7/fulltext"><em>The Lancet Neurology</em></a>, and the website <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066">Alzforum</a>, which hosts news and commentary on Alzheimer’s research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Piller and Schrag say they respect that others are entitled to their opinions, but expressed concern that some of these reviews contain inaccuracies that downplay their findings. And the journals and Alzforum have refused to publish responses they submitted or make corrections they requested.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131931"></span>



<p>In one instance, an editor at <em>Lancet Neurology</em> refused to correct what Schrag claims are obvious errors in a review — including a mistaken but easily checked claim about citations — telling him the author of the article disagreed with “their interpretation” and rejected the need to fix his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the criticisms allege Piller’s book overplays the importance of the research misconduct that has undermined the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/11/amyloid-hypothesis-alzheimers-research-lecanemab-aduhelm/">amyloid hypothesis</a> of Alzheimer’s pathology, and called into question newly approved drugs targeting amyloid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s been this notion there’s a cabal around the amyloid hypothesis,” Schrag said. “This type of censorship gives some credibility to that.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/04/undisclosed-conflicts-lightning-fast-peer-review-one-alzheimers-journals-role-in-a-failed-drug/">ran an excerpt</a> of the book in early February and our Ivan Oransky <a href="https://charlespiller.com/books/">called it</a> “required reading for aspiring scientists, policymakers, and anyone who will one day be touched by a devastating disease – which is all of us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831830"><em>JAMA </em>review</a> was the first of the critical appraisals to appear. Its authors claim the book details four instances of research misconduct in the field, when the sleuths found issues in hundreds of papers from dozens of researchers, Schrag said. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Letter-JAMA-2025-FINALIZED.docx.pdf">He and Piller submitted a response</a>, which the journal declined to publish “because of the many submissions we receive and our space limitations in the Letters section,” according to emails we’ve seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jen Zeis, JAMA Network’s communications and engagement director, told us the journal “cannot confirm or deny the status of any content that we haven’t published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another inaccuracy Schrag and Piller identified in the critical reviews is the impact of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533">2006 <em>Nature</em> paper</a> in which <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease">Schrag found</a> apparently manipulated images. The authors <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-plan-retract-landmark-alzheimers-paper-containing-doctored-images">retracted</a> the article last year, but it remains the fifth-most-cited retracted paper, by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">our count</a>, with 2,384 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066">Alzforum</a>, John Hardy of University College London wrote the retracted paper “had no great influence in our field.” Hardy described himself as “a named member of this cabal” supporting the amyloid hypothesis in Piller’s book. He and his colleagues “never cited this work in our review of the amyloid hypothesis, nor did the other major reviews,” he wrote. Another Alzheimer’s researcher, Bart de Strooper, cited it “only” in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3028">critical review</a>, Hardy claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that citation record isn’t true, Schrag said. “It&#8217;s not clear to me why so much effort would be placed on the claim to have never cited this article, when it is so easy [to] debunk,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dear-Colleagues-letter-for-AlzForumMSSfinal.docx.pdf">Schrag wrote in a response</a> submitted to Alzforum. He included screenshots of Google Scholar pages showing multiple other papers in which Hardy and de Strooper had cited the 2006 <em>Nature</em> paper. Web of Science corroborates those results, showing Hardy has cited the work four times, including in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306007239">a 2006 <em>Neuron</em> essay</a> and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01249-0">2021 review in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em></a>, and de Strooper has cited the paper 10 times.</p>



<p>Hardy has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many other Alzheimer’s researchers chimed in with criticism of Piller and his book following Hardy’s post on Alzforum, which appeared in <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066">a discussion thread</a> for the <em>JAMA</em> article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Piller said he’s used to criticism, and usually doesn’t get involved in arguments because he believes his work can stand on its own, but this case was different. “Many of the comments were untrue and they were mischaracterizations of the book, and many of them included ad hominem attacks on me personally,” he told us. If he and Schrag didn’t respond, he said, he felt like “it was essentially acceding to their arguments.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as with <em>JAMA,</em> when Piller and Schrag attempted to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charles-Piller-comments-re-critics-of-Doctored.pdf">submit responses</a> to the thread, the editors declined to publish them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your argument has been promoted for months and continues to be widely available in your book and in various media reviews,” Gabrielle Strobel, Alzforum’s executive editor, wrote in an email to Piller. “We see nothing new in your comment, and have closed the conversation.” Strobel did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Piller noted that Hardy and other researchers who commented in the thread serve on Alzforum’s <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/about-us/scientific-advisory-board">scientific advisory board</a>. “When they let their advisors criticize me and won’t let any response come through, it seems strange,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At one point, Alzforum promoted the thread as a “debate,” Schrag said, but its editors wouldn’t let him and Piller respond. “Is this what leaders of the field want debate to look like?” Schrag said. “You only have a voice if you espouse the popular opinion?”</p>



<p>Hardy had initially written his Alzforum post as a book review for <em>Nature</em>, but the journal declined to publish it, he wrote in his Alzforum post. A spokesperson for <em>Nature</em> told us when the editors commissioned the review, “we were unaware that Professor Hardy was a target of criticism in the book.” They decided not to publish the review after learning of his role during the editing process, as “the review may have been perceived by our readers to have a potential bias that could compromise the assessment.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00112-7/fulltext"><em>The Lancet Neurology</em></a> later published another version of Hardy’s critique. Schrag wrote to the journal to request corrections to four “provably false” claims in it, including about how de Strooper had cited the 2006 <em>Nature</em> paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our Book Reviews are opinion pieces, in which authors are invited to freely express their views,” editor Elena Becker-Barroso responded. “I have shared your concerns with Professor Hardy, who disagrees with your interpretation and does not see the need for Correction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked Becker-Barroso for comment on the decision not to correct the article, she asked us where in the text the inaccuracies Schrag identified had appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Please note the journal promotes scientific debate and we encourage authors to freely express their opinion in this sort of articles,” she wrote. “In which way should we correct Dr Hardy’s opinion?”</p>



<p>The experience is “very much more of the same” as his attempts to correct other problems in the scientific literature, Schrag told us. “You get the distinct impression that there’s very little concern about getting the facts right, at least in this case.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authors of a 2006 paper have retracted their article following an extensive correction in January – and a Retraction Watch story noting the correction missed at least one additional issue with the work.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0604044103">Death-receptor activation halts clathrin-dependent endocytosis</a>,” published in July 2006 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, has been cited 99 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Most of the authors were affiliated with the biotech company Genentech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/25/exclusive-extensive-correction-genentech-pnas-update/">we previously reported</a>, commenters on PubPeer raised issues about possible image duplications, spurring the authors to review the work. The January correction addressed about two dozen instances of image splicing and duplication in five of the paper’s figures. The notice stated the authors repeated the experiments for a manuscript <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619217v1">posted on bioRxiv</a> in October 2024. “The new data confirms the original results, reaffirming the experimental conclusions,” the authors wrote in the correction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131916"></span>



<p>Biologist and scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a> identified another image duplication in the paper, which he reviewed at our request. Prashant Nair from the <em>PNAS </em>news office told us at the time it was “inadvertently omitted,” and the journal would update the correction notice to include the duplication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But on May 15, the article was retracted instead. The <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2510913122">retraction notice</a> reiterates the “additional potential duplication” had been “previously identified and submitted for correction by the authors, but inadvertently omitted from the January 3, 2025, correction note.” The statement, attributed to the authors, concludes, “At this time, we believe that retraction, rather than further correction, is the most prudent course of action.”</p>



<p>Nair confirmed the authors decided to retract the article, as did a representative from Genentech. “We confirm that the authors believed retraction to be the most prudent course of action, and on that basis, requested retraction of the paper,” said Karen Ring, Genentech senior manager for science communications, public affairs and access. Both Nair and Ring said they had nothing further to add beyond the retraction notice.</p>



<p>“Compared to many cases in which I am involved, the authors and the journal have acted somewhat swiftly and ultimately correctly,” Sanders said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also suggested that corrections should be subject to scrutiny.&nbsp; “With an alarming frequency, initial corrections prove to be either inadequate (as in this example) or actually deceptive (as in many other examples),” he said. “Corrections should be monitored by sleuths as closely as the original articles.”</p>

<p>While doing a literature review earlier this spring, a human factors researcher came across a paper he had peer-reviewed. One problem: He had reviewed it – and recommended against publishing – for a different journal not long before the publication date of the paper he was now looking at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the published paper and documents shared with us, it appears the authors submitted the same manuscript to the journals <em>Applied Sciences </em>and <em>Virtual Reality</em> within 11 days of each other, and withdrew one version when the other was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And after we reached out to the authors, the lead author told us they plan to withdraw the published version next week – which the editor of the journal had called for in April but its publisher, MDPI, had not yet decided to do.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131910"></span>



<p>The journal <em>Applied Sciences </em>published the paper, “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/5/2123">Correlations between SSQ Scores and ECG Data during Virtual Reality Walking by Display Type</a>,” on March 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Both the first author of the paper, <a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/2157536?utm_source=mdpi.com&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=avatar_name">Mi-Hyun Choi</a>, and the senior author, <a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/1205025?utm_source=mdpi.com&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=avatar_name">Jin Seung Choi</a>, are professors at Konkuk University in Seoul, South Korea.</p>



<p>The reviewer, who asked us to remain anonymous, received the manuscript from editors at <em>Virtual Reality</em> on January 22. That manuscript had a submission date of January 2, less than two weeks before the authors submitted it to <em>Applied Sciences.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I reviewed this human-subject study and noticed, curiously, that there was no ethics statement on the paper detailing whether there had been any ethics approval,” he said, noting at the time he raised these concerns to the editor in chief of <em>Virtual Reality</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the published version, the authors state the protocol was approved by the university’s Institutional Review Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the review report we saw, the reviewer wrote the manuscript couldn’t be published in its current form because it didn’t properly cite prior research on the topic, lacked a novel thesis and lacked statistical rigor.</p>



<p>“In isolation, each of these omissions could warrant a minor revision, however, the manuscript is quite scant on detail and unfortunately reads more like a conference paper or a short-and-sweet-paper,” he wrote on Jan. 23, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But after he raised these concerns to the editor-in-chief, he didn’t see the paper again, he told us. Then, he was informed the authors withdrew it from consideration on March 5 — the day after, it turns out, <em>Applied Sciences</em> published its version.</p>



<p>In emails we have seen from this April, the reviewer brought the dual submission to the attention of both journals. In response, Rob Macredie, the editor-in-chief for <em>Virtual Reality,</em> noted the authors stated in their cover letter to the journal that the paper was “currently not under review, nor it will [sic] be submitted to another journal while under consideration for <em>Virtual Reality</em>.”</p>



<p>Later that month, Giulio Cerulo, the editor in chief of <em>Applied Sciences</em>, told the reviewer the double submission was a “clear violation of the ethical standards and, in my opinion, it should lead to a retraction of the published article.”</p>



<p>But when we followed up with <em>Applied Sciences,</em> an MDPI title, they said they were still investigating the paper. Jisuk Kang, the publishing manager at MDPI, said in an email the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) “retraction guidelines do not support the retraction of a published article based solely on dual submission, if the integrity of the data remains intact.” Kang noted the journal was still reviewing the paper and if the investigation uncovered misconduct, “further action will be taken as appropriate.”</p>



<p><a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/handling-concurrent-and-duplicate-submissions">COPE considers</a> dual and multiple submissions “unethical practices in academic publishing,” but the organization doesn’t recommend a&nbsp; course of action once the papers are already published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/case/consequence-dual-submission">similar case submitted to COPE</a>, the members said the organization would “always advocate educational rather than punitive action” and suggested editors publish an editorial “on the ethics of dual submissions.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Jin Seung Choi first told us earlier this month the dual submission was “not appropriate,” and he said it was a “simple oversight” by the authors. He also said he would not support the retraction of the paper, as it contains “no plagiarism, misconduct, or issues concerning research originality.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Although it was my mistake, I think it would not have happened if the submission system had been able to recognize in advance that it was under review by another journal,” he told us.</p>



<p>After we followed up to confirm his affiliation this week, Jin Seung Choi told us he would withdraw the paper after meeting with his co-authors next week. “I do not want the problem to spread any further,” he wrote.</p>



<p>The reviewer told us he suspected “the authors either misrepresented themselves or acted maliciously” and were familiar with the submission process for journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper has been cited once by a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/20/9494">paper in the same journal</a>, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>
