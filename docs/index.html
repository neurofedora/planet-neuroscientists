<p>One of the winners of the 2024 Kavli Prize in nanoscience has threatened to sue a longtime critic, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a cease and desist letter, a lawyer representing <a href="https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/people/chad-mirkin/">Chad Mirkin</a>, a chemist and director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern University in Chicago, accused Raphaël Lévy, a professor of physics at the Université Paris Sorbonne Nord, of making “patently false and defamatory” statements about Mirkin’s research.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cease-and-Desist-to-R.-Levy-5_15_20241348054-clean.pdf">demand</a> primarily concerns a letter to the editor Lévy submitted in April to <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> regarding an article Mirkin co-authored, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306973121">Multimodal neuro-nanotechnology: Challenging the existing paradigm in glioblastoma therapy</a>,” which appeared in the journal in February. </p>



<span id="more-129661"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lévy and Mirkin, who was awarded one quarter of this year’s <a href="https://www.kavliprize.org/prizes/nanoscience/2024">Kavli Prize in nanoscience</a> for his work on spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), have a <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c73ed8f96a00c023285fb7">long history</a>. In 2018, they <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/rna-detection-tool-debate-flares-up-at-acs-meeting--64756">clashed at a meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society, where Mirkin called Lévy a “scientific terrorist.” Lévy has begun an <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7993122">effort to replicate</a> one of Mirkin’s significant papers as part of the <a href="https://nanobubbles.hypotheses.org/">NanoBubbles project</a>, which “focuses on how, when and why science fails to correct itself,” according to its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Lévy’s <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12746734">letter to <em>PNAS</em></a>, which the journal declined to publish, he wrote Mirkin’s article’s “presentation of SNAs as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics’ is misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> article had mentioned a clinical trial of an experimental cancer drug from <a href="https://invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/startups/exicure.html">Exicure</a>, a company Mirkin <a href="https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/invo-spotlights/featured-innovators/chad-mirkin.html">co-founded in 2011</a> to develop SNAs for diagnosing and treating disease, claiming the treatment showed a “33% overall response rate at the highest dosage,” Lévy wrote. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No reference is provided but the figure appears to come from an interim report presented by the company (press release and presentation at a conference (<a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_3/A257.2">10</a>)). The 33% are in fact 2 patients from a sub-group of 6 patients.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03684785">clinical trial</a> was stopped for administrative reasons, Lévy noted. Exicure <a href="https://investors.exicuretx.com/news/news-details/2021/Exicure-Inc.-Announces-Results-of-Internal-Investigation-and-Implementation-of-Strategic-Measures-to-Reduce-Cash-Burn-and-Prioritize-Pipeline-Focus/default.aspx">announced</a> in late 2021 it would wind down the trial. At the same time, the company disclosed the results of an internal investigation that found Grant Corbett, the former leader of its neuroscience group, had “misreported” preclinical efficacy data about another experimental drug in public presentations and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its most recent disclosure, Exicure “has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company” but is now “exploring strategic alternatives” after restructuring and suspending its clinical and development work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lévy’s letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Public and private funders of scientific research in academia and start-up companies have to make choices about which biomedical technologies or innovative therapies they sponsor. The scientific literature plays a critical role in informing those decisions and must therefore be balanced and accurate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One month after Lévy submitted his letter to <em>PNAS</em>, he received an email from Mirkin, seen by Retraction Watch, accusing him of making “factually false and damaging” statements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You will be hearing from my lawyer next week regarding the defamation and the serious legal consequences for it,” Mirkin wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cease and desist letter followed on May 15. Lévy’s communications with <em>PNAS</em>, “falsely disparage [Mirkin] and charge him with having a lack of integrity in his profession as a research scientist,” Mirkin’s lawyer wrote. The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are putting you on notice that in the event you do not retract the false statements made to PNAS and cease to disseminate further false statements of and concerning Dr. Mirkin to any third parties or the public generally, Dr. Mirkin will take all appropriate action to obtain relief against you for resulting injuries to his good name and reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the “patently false and defamatory” statement the letter attributes to Lévy does not appear in his letter in <em>PNAS</em>, and he said he did not write those words. Here’s the quotation from the cease and desist letter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The published article [authored by Mirkin and others] includes uncited data that is misleading due to its small number of participants and the fact that the clinical trial (NCT03684785) was discontinued due of (sic.) a fraud case which found Mirkin’s previous company (Exicure) liable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Mirkin nor his lawyer, Phillip J. Zisook of the Chicago firm Schoenberg Finkel Beederman Bell Glazer, has responded to our queries about the source of the quotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The letter also accuses Lévy of wanting “to cause injury to Mirkin’s professional reputation through fabricating and disseminating false statements.” Zisook wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Because your false statements disparage Dr. Mirkin in his professional capacity as a research scientist, they will be found to support actions for defamation per se and false light invasion of privacy in a lawsuit against you.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter is “quite astonishing,” Lévy said, containing false assertions and posing “an extremely serious attack on my academic freedom and on academic freedom in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zisook’s letter mentions a research misconduct investigation into Lévy at the University of Liverpool, where he worked until 2020, when he left voluntarily for his current position. The investigation – into allegations Lévy downloaded papers from Sci-Hub and harassed other scientists – was closed after the initial assessment for “insufficient grounds to pursue the complaint,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, the letter alludes to complaints against Lévy at his current institution. These were retaliatory complaints after he reported a case of scientific misconduct, Lévy said. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/31/journal-pulls-papers-by-embattled-scientist-at-national-research-center-in-france/">covered that case</a>, which has resulted in three retractions so far. The investigations against Lévy have concluded without charges, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the letter, Lévy sent Zisook and Mirkin a copy of his submission to <em>PNAS</em> and asked them to withdraw the cease and desist demand, as the quoted sentences “were very different from what I wrote.” It’s unclear where the passage came from. He also wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>​​In my opinion, the correct way to determine whether this letter should be published or not by PNAS is through editorial evaluation including eventually peer review. Most people would certainly agree that legal threats should not interfere with that process…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zisook refused to withdraw the cease and desist demand. He wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It was not just premised upon a particular statement in the article you recently forwarded to me but rather a persistent campaign to selectively use information and misrepresentations to actively defame Dr. Mirkin, including your recent communications with PNAS which clearly left them with the false impressions described in our Cease and Desist Letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PNAS</em> rejected Lévy’s letter on June 17. A representative for the journal declined to comment on the decision, “due to the confidential nature of the peer review process.”</p>

<p>A paper finding kids did worse in school following the Flint water crisis is “severely flawed and unreliable,” according to critics who were deeply involved in exposing the crisis.</p>



<p>The paper has now earned an addendum from the authors, but the critics say it should be retracted.</p>



<p>The authors of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4737">article</a> investigated whether the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">water crisis</a> in Flint – a period when the drinking water in the Michigan city was contaminated with lead – affected the academic capability of children living there. The authors concluded children in Flint did worse in math after the crisis and more needed special education than before the episode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article was published in <em>Science Advances </em>in March and referenced by major news outlets like<em> </em><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/flint-michigan-water-crisis-ten-years-after"><em>ProPublica</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/13/flint-children-school-academic-setbacks/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p>



<span id="more-129627"></span>



<p>Soon after, <a href="https://envsci.rutgers.edu/profiles/Siddhartha_Roy.html">Siddhartha Roy</a>, an assistant professor of environmental science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and his colleagues sent an email to Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the <em>Science </em>family of journals, expressing <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EA620BE7EDEB55DF0B1581368C2747">concerns about the analysis</a>. In particular, they noted a “confounding” change in the state testing standards at the time of the crisis in Flint that the authors did not account for in their paper. Roy and his colleagues also wrote that the article did not properly acknowledge previous research, and may have lacked the necessary ethical approval. </p>



<p>The article “reinforces false narratives about the nature of the lead exposure and cause(s) of changing educational performance,” they said in the email seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roy and <a href="https://www.webapps.cee.vt.edu/index.php?category=people&amp;pagetype=bio&amp;do=getprofile&amp;user=edwards.html">Marc Edwards</a>, a distinguished professor of environmental engineering at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/19/after-we-tried-to-correct-claims-about-deadly-water-filters-in-flint-we-were-accused-of-scientific-misconduct-and-that-was-just-the-beginning/">helped expose the water crisis</a> by collecting citywide data with residents that showed elevated lead in water and federal Safe Drinking Water Act violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards and Roy’s group advised the editorial team to launch an investigation based on their concerns. “[I]f found to be legitimate,” they wrote, “we ask that the article be retracted. At a minimum, an expression of concern should be appended immediately while an investigation is underway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, Laura Remis, an editor at <em>Science Advances,</em> said the journal had asked the authors to respond to the concerns and requested they submit an addendum to their article with annotated data source and code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the email seen by Retraction Watch, Remis said the authors’ response was sufficient and “we stand behind the conclusions of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to claims the paper was unreliable, the authors wrote they “dispute this in the strongest possible terms.”</p>



<p>The study’s analysis of math and reading achievement was “invalid” as it compared different years of Michigan state testing when the standards changed significantly, Roy’s team said. The state’s department of education noted that the tests introduced in 2015 are “very different” and should not be compared to the prior 2014 standard. In response, the authors said their analysis compares only relative performance on tests and does not rely on raw comparisons of different years of data.</p>



<p>In contrast to other peer-reviewed articles, this study also “fails to contextualize actual blood lead levels in Flint children,” Roy’s team said – an omission which ​​creates an impression that the primary adverse health effect from the crisis was lead exposure, which the data in the article doesn’t support. Remis’email said the <em>Science</em> editor did not find merit in this point, so did not ask the authors to respond to this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, the article “selectively cites and misrepresents evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes” during this crisis, Roy’s team said. The authors said they believe this concern comes from “a misinterpretation of the text.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While we trust this research project must have required [institutional review board] IRB clearance,” Roy’s team said&nbsp; “the specific IRB approval code and authorization agency are not mentioned anywhere in the article or supplementary information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors said: “The University of Michigan IRB determined that our study used only deidentified data that could be [sic] linked to specific individuals and was therefore not regulated by the IRB. All personally-identifiable information was handled and access [sic] by Michigan Department of Education and the Center for Educational Performance and Information.&#8221;</p>



<p>Edwards said they would like to request the raw data from the Michigan Department of Education to redo the analysis themselves, but the cost is prohibitive:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We’ve already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars exposing the [water crisis], and have now years of our lives and hundreds of thousands more, debunking crap science papers about the crisis, so we are doing a cost benefit analysis as to whether it is worth spending another $6000 to possibly correct yet another result that is possibly false. The reality is that because it was already been trumpeted in the media, and many powerful people do not want to see it refuted, even if we exposed the result as crap (and the authors admitted it), it would have little effect to correct the record or perception.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/sam-trejo">Sam Trejo</a>, an assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, in New Jersey, and lead author of the paper, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our authorship team took Roy’s concerns seriously, and we appreciated the opportunity for engagement with our research. Ultimately, we concluded that the points they raised did not threaten any of the paper&#8217;s findings. Our team provided Science Advances with a detailed response to Roy&#8217;s concerns, and the journal was satisfied with our response. More specifically, the Science Advances editorial staff did not believe it was necessary or appropriate for us to issue a correction or erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, the authors issued the addendum – published as an “eLetter” at the very bottom of the article page – explaining their analysis of Michigan’s test scores as well as including a “replication package” to allow others to reproduce their analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addendum “is a way of just blowing off our legitimate criticism, allowing the authors to have the last word, without ever giving us the first word, or airing dirty laundry,” Edwards told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am surprised that they are calling it an ‘Addendum’ and not an ‘Erratum’ or even a ‘Correction,’” Roy said. “While I am glad the authors were forced to acknowledge that a statewide test change occurred and coincided with the water switch in Flint, they severely downplay its implications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards said he finds the larger context of this paper fascinating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research that claims to find something horrible in Flint, seems to get published easily, and is picked up and amplified in the media. Whereas papers that point out problems with those analysis, or shows that the narrative is exaggerated, or might even be harming the people it claims to try and help, has a hard time getting published. The best example of that, is [Roy’s] paper, questioning whether we should continue lying to Flint children, and telling them they were brain damaged by an unprecedented harmful lead exposure event, when all the data shows it never happened. They never stop to think, that the harm of this false story (via a nocebo effect), might overweigh the alleged benefits, for the very people they claim to be helping.</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) Conference is the largest annual dementia research conference in the UK, held this year in Liverpool. Women in Neuroscience UK were invited as an exhibitor and </strong></span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>also </strong></span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>asked to host a lunchtime workshop to discuss the path to equity - major visibility for our cause! Rebecca Parker discusses WiNUK&apos;s experience here.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After months of prepping and weeks of stressing (and also a late-night panic session reviewing the presentation in a hotel lobby), it is safe to say that a lot of time, effort and passion was poured into this project, which made a huge impact across the event, opening up the discussions on a path to equity in neuroscience!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hosting our first in-person workshop was a large, and important, step forward for WiNUK. From our virtual launch event 1.5 years ago, to running a session in an auditorium of around 200 people, and with many more joining online, there was no mistaking how far our volunteer-led organisation had come. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Our workshop addressed the gender disparities prevalent in dementia research through statistics, advice sharing and interactive audience Q&amp;A. Firstly, drawing from a global survey, conducted in collaboration with the International Society to Advance Alzheimer’s Research and Treatment (ISTAART), Lizzie led the session by shedding light on the systemic challenges faced by women, particularly in senior positions. Shockingly, 80% of women in roles above the postdoctoral level reported experiencing sexism, with less than 25% of women across career stages finding institutional support helpful. These statistics underscored the urgency of addressing gender biases and sexism in scientific academia. This aspect of our session aimed to validate the experiences of female researchers in the audience and help raise awareness about these pervasive issues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The second half of our session was dedicated to an interactive Q&amp;A, with a fantastic panel of women in dementia research -  Professor Fiona Ducotterd, Professor Afia B Ali and Dr Kamar Ameen-Ali - who provided invaluable insights into the nuanced manifestations of gender bias.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Ameen-Ali poignantly remarked, &quot;Gender bias isn’t as explicit as it used to be; it’s a lot more implicit now, which makes it harder to talk about and easier for people to invalidate.&quot; This observation highlighted the subtler forms of discrimination that persist in professional settings; these may be no less harmful, but are in many ways harder to tackle. This part of the session aimed to help audience members to further recognise these issues, some for the first time.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Stemming from an audience question regarding how to deal with “mansplaining”, Professor Fiona Ducotterd emphasised the importance of individual internal strength and agency in navigating these dynamics. She shared her empowering opinion on dealing with difficult situations by initially assuming good intent. How people communicate does vary and things don’t always start with a bad intention, but managing your response is beneficial for coping, regardless of the intent.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lastly, we tackled well-documented, traditional stereotypes imposed predominantly on women in the professional world; from being labelled &quot;too strong” or “outspoken&quot; for having an opinion, to being deemed &quot;too ambitious” or “too naïve&quot; for taking risks and leading with authority. These stereotypes reflect an outdated rulebook for women that we are more than happy to discard. At WiNUK, we celebrate the uniqueness of every individual and encourage you all to embrace your strengths to reach your ambitions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Our workshop not only highlighted the challenges faced by women in dementia research, but also provided actionable advice towards success in the current climate. These discussions touched on the importance of personal resilience, mentoring programs, and advocating for transparent promotion criteria. We also covered strategies for creating more inclusive workplaces to support women and other minoritised identities, including regular training on diversity and inclusion and accessible reporting mechanisms for bias and discrimination. Despite addressing these difficult issues, we aimed to maintain a balanced tone by focusing on positive and actionable points for improvement, inspiring attendees to take proactive steps in their careers and workplaces.</span></span></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Ever wondered how computer science and neuroscience might fit hand in hand? With our AI, Tech and Computation event coming up next week, Swati Rajwal describes her journey, as a computer scientist, into the world of neuroscience and how her skillset has been instrumental in advancing a huge range of projects!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have always been intrigued by the complexities of the human brain and the technological intricacies of computer science. The intersection of these two fields is where I found my passion and it led me to a wonderful role as a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge&apos;s Engineering Department. Here, I&apos;d like to share how my background in computer science has been instrumental in advancing my work in neuroscience.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Background &amp; Career Path</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My earliest memory of using a computer dates back to visiting my dad&apos;s office as a 9-year-old and using the Windows Paint app to draw houses. Amazed by the capabilities of a computer to execute my commands, I knew this would grow to become my career of interest. And so, after finishing my bachelor’s in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, I started working as a Software Engineer. A few years later, I took my interest further by pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. During my Masters, I realised the ubiquitous nature of my skills as a computer scientist through various academic endeavours such as an R&amp;D internship at Accenture, a collaboration with Mayo Clinic practitioners (</span></span><u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10283091/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">paper</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">), a research project at Saïd Business School and many others. I might not have the subject knowledge (e.g., medicine), but give me a dataset large enough and a machine on which to run it, and I shall move the world (rephrasing Archimedes here)!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>Academic Journey at Cambridge</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After my Masters, I joined Cambridge University and started with a project investigating statistical learning in chronic back pain and endogenous pain regulation. The role demanded not only a deep understanding of neuroscience, but also strong computational skills. Leveraging my experience in computer science, and with a team consisting of a neuroscience expert and other members, we were able to design and execute a </span></span><u><a href="https://www.psychopy.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">PsychoPy</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> task </span></span><u><a href=" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027006005772?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">(article)</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, published on </span></span><u><a href="https://pavlovia.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pavlovia</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> platform, as an open source software that efficiently recorded pain and clinical data. Although there is an intuitive builder interface (drag-and-drop based) to create tasks, one needs to have knowledge of Python and Javascript programming languages, along with Git-based software version control to incorporate features and debug any issues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another core aspect of my research involved processing large sets of data using Python and RSTAN (a software package for statistical modeling), based on (for instance) </span></span><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">multi-armed bandit algorithm</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. This kind of data analysis is fundamental in neuroscience research, where understanding patterns and anomalies could lead to breakthroughs in understanding, for instance, pain mechanisms. A significant part of my role was contributing to a grant application for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The application was successful, awarding our team substantial computational resources: 1,216,800 CPU (Central Processing Unit) hours and 1,000 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) hours. CPUs and GPUs are essential for processing large amounts of data quickly, with GPUs providing additional power for tasks involving graphics and simulations. This substantial grant enhanced our lab&apos;s capacity to conduct complex simulations and data analyses, accelerating our research and enabling more ambitious projects. This achievement was not just a testament to the quality of our proposed research but also highlighted the critical role of computational expertise in justifying the requirement of securing resources for scientific experiments.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The skills I gained throughout these years in computer science—data analysis, algorithm design, and system integration—proved to be incredibly valuable in my research at Cambridge. They enabled me to contribute effectively to my team&apos;s research goals, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Moreover, these skills facilitated collaboration with other scientists and helped in articulating complex ideas more comprehensively during team meetings and in drafting research manuscripts. This synthesis of computer science and neuroscience is not just about enhancing research capabilities; it&apos;s also about improving patient outcomes. The models and systems I have worked on at Cambridge are geared towards understanding, and eventually mitigating, pain—a goal that stands to significantly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from chronic conditions.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>What&apos;s Next?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">To all the women in neuroscience, contemplating a similar integration of skills, I encourage you to embrace the possibilities that such interdisciplinary knowledge can bring. The fusion of computer science and neuroscience is a vivid example of how diverse skills can lead to greater innovation and impactful outcomes in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This narrative not only reflects my professional journey, but also demonstrates the profound impact that expertise in a seemingly unrelated field can have on another. As I advance in my academic career, my goal would be to enhance my computational skills further and leverage them to build open-source software that promotes equitable healthcare, in collaboration with domain experts. It is a call to all aspiring scientists to look beyond traditional boundaries and explore how their unique skills can contribute to broader scientific advancements.</span></span></p>

<p>A journal has retracted a letter to the editor and removed the online version from its website “because legal concerns were raised to the Publisher,” according to the notice. The retracted letter had referred to multiple journals as “predatory.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted letter, “A threat to scientific integrity,” appeared in the <em>British Dental Journal </em>in August 2023. The author, <a href="https://dentistry.ed.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/niall-mcguinness">Niall McGuinness</a>, director of the MClinDent / DClinDent programme in orthodontics at the Edinburgh Dental Institute, criticized a May 2023 opinion article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-5848-z">What does the Dentists Act say about orthodontic treatment choice?</a>” for the articles it cited.</p>



<p>In particular, McGuinness called out citations to publications in journals “of questionable probity in regard to publication ethics &#8211; &#8216;predatory&#8217; journals as defined by Jeffrey Beall, of the University of Colorado,” according to an archived version seen by Retraction Watch. He listed four journals cited in the article, including one from the publisher Frontiers and another from MDPI, which appeared on Beall’s list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A representative from Frontiers told us they had no correspondence with BDJ or Springer Nature regarding this letter. An MDPI representative said the same.</p>



<p><a href="https://orthotropics.com/dr-michael-j-trenouth-bsc-bds-mds-phd/dr-michael-trenouth/">Michael Trenouth</a>, a retired orthodontist and corresponding author of the original opinion article, didn’t respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The letter was up until at least October 2023, and was cited in “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6396-2">Identifying Predatory Journals</a>” another letter to the editor published in <em>BDJ</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometime later, McGuinness’ letter was removed from the website and overwritten with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6165-2">retraction notice</a>, which isn’t dated. According to <a href="https://publicationethics.org/sites/default/files/retraction-guidelines-cope.pdf">retraction guidelines</a> from the Committee on Publication Ethics, an article should be removed from online publication in “extremely limited cases” if it’s “clearly defamatory, violates personal privacy, is the subject of a court order, or might pose a serious health risk to the general public.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides mentioning the “legal concerns” that led to the paper’s retraction, the notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The <em>British Dental Journal</em> takes no position with respect to the contents of this letter and this retraction is in agreement with the author of this letter.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McGuinness declined our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a representative from Springer, which publishes the journal, said: “We took the concerns raised very seriously and, with the agreement of the author, concluded that retraction and removal of the letter from the journal website was the most appropriate and responsible action to take.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labeling publishers as “predatory” often gets pushback. In 2021, a Frontiers<em> </em>editor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/authors-object-after-springer-nature-journal-cedes-to-publisher-frontiers-demand-for-retraction/">objected to</a> a <em>Scientometrics</em> study naming the publisher’s journals as predatory, and the paper was retracted. That year, an article in <em>Research Evaluation</em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/08/article-that-assessed-mdpi-journals-as-predatory-retracted-and-replaced/">calling MDPI journals</a> predatory was retracted and replaced with a less critical version, saying its analysis instead “suggest[s] they may be predatory journals.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-levels-fraud-indictment-cuny-scientist-who-helped-alzheimer-s-drug-developer">recent criminal indictment</a> of a medical school professor and former scientific advisor to Cassava Sciences on fraud charges for manipulating images in scientific papers and applications for federal funding is a “rare” outcome for such alleged actions that “sends a very, very powerful message.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s according to lawyers who have worked on research misconduct cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/ori-investigations/">investigations by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity</a> and other government watchdogs find scientists manipulated data in grant applications to the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, few are charged with “major fraud against the United States,” as was <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/hoau-yan-wang">Hoau-yan Wang</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129620"></span>



<p>Wang, a professor of medicine at the City University of New York School of Medicine, has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWang%252c%2bHoau-Yan">seven</a> papers retracted, some involving work for Cassava, which is developing a drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease.</p>



<p>CUNY investigated 31 allegations of research misconduct against Wang and found “long-standing and egregious misconduct in data management and record-keeping” by the researcher. Wang did not provide primary data related to any of the allegations, according to an <a href="https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.adl3444/full/cuny_wang_final_report-1698701360173.pdf">investigation report</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/co-developer-cassava-s-potential-alzheimer-s-drug-cited-egregious-misconduct">published by <em>Science</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice “rarely” files criminal indictments against scientists for faking data, said <a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/people/b/mark-barnes">Mark Barnes</a>, a partner at the Boston firm Ropes &amp; Gray, who added such charges come only when the agency is “really convinced that there has been intentional bad behavior by a scientist squandering public money.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2005, <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/case-summary-eric-t-poehlman">Eric T. Poehlman</a>, a former researcher at the University of Vermont, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/former-scientist-at-u-of-vermont-to-plead-guilty-to-vast-research-fraud/">pleaded guilty</a> to charges brought by the U.S. attorney’s office in Burlington, who alleged Poehlman received nearly $3 million in grants from the NIH and U.S. Department of Agriculture based on applications containing fake data. Anesthesiologist <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-medical-madoff-anesthestesiologist-faked-data/">Scott Reuben</a> in 2010 was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/ma/news/2010/June/Reuben%20Scott%20Sentencing%20PR.html">sentenced to six months</a> in prison, plus three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay fines and restitution after pleading guilty to health care fraud on charges he published studies with falsified research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, a judge sentenced <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/07/01/aids-vaccine-fraudster-sentenced-to-nearly-5-years-in-prison-and-pay-back-7-million/">Dong-Pyou Han</a>, an AIDS vaccine researcher, to nearly five years in prison and ordered him to repay $7 million in grant money to the NIH. The following year, physicist <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/12/23/u-s-govt-physicist-sentenced-18-months-prison-fraud/">Sean Darin Kinion</a>, formerly of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for faking quantum computing work and ordered to repay the government more than $3 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other cases, the federal government pursues civil action under the False Claims Act to recover grant money paid to the institutions where the scientists worked. In FCA cases, “the government thinks that the institutional processes or systems have completely failed,” and the institution “either knew or should have known about the behavior and didn’t do anything,” said Barnes, who has held high-level research administration positions at multiple institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Purdue University in Indiana <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/28/purdue-agrees-to-pay-feds-back-737000-for-grant-submissions-with-fake-data/">agreed to pay</a> $737,000 in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/cancer-researcher-banned-from-federal-funding-for-faking-data-in-nearly-400-images-in-16-grant-applications/">case of Alice C. Chang</a>, who ORI found faked data in 16 grant applications. Other large settlements include <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/03/25/duke-settles-case-alleging-data-doctoring-for-112-5-million/">$112.5 million from Duke University</a> in 2019, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/27/harvard-teaching-hospital-pay-10-million-settle-research-misconduct-allegations/">$10 million from Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a> for the Piero Anversa case in 2017, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/14/columbia-has-settled-a-fraud-case-for-9-5m-heres-why-thats-important/">$9.5 million from Columbia University</a> in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the indictment, Wang allegedly fabricated Western blots included in Cassava’s grant applications that resulted in $16 million of NIH funding from 2017-2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cassava issued a <a href="https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-issues-statement-former-science-advisor">statement</a> on Wang’s indictment that said his work under these grants was “related to the early development phases of the Company’s drug candidate and diagnostic test and how these were intended to work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. Wang and his former public university medical school have had no involvement in the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trials of simufilam,” Cassava’s experimental Alzheimer’s treatment, the company statement said. Cassava is cooperating with ongoing investigations by the DOJ and Securities and Exchange Commission, the company has <a href="https://www.cassavasciences.com/node/17056/html">disclosed</a>. Wang did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attorneys from the main DOJ fraud section are prosecuting Wang’s case, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington field office is investigating it, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/professor-charged-operating-multimillion-dollar-grant-fraud-scheme">DOJ’s press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rgoldsteinlaw.com/scientific-and-research-misconduct">Richard Goldstein</a>, an attorney in Boston who has worked for the government and now represents scientists involved in research misconduct cases, noted the involvement of the DOJ’s main office in D.C., rather than the regional U.S. attorney’s offices that have pursued other cases with less money at stake, fewer instances of fraud, and less clear involvement of the accused scientist. The main fraud division’s handling of the case “puts it into a category of major crimes that makes it similar to other major financial fraud cases,” he said. “This is getting attention at the highest levels of our government.”</p>



<p>The indictment “indicates the seriousness with which the government takes these allegations,” Goldstein said. “It is also indicative of the magnitude of the alleged crimes here, which appear to be very extensive and involve both a public university, a private company, stock issues, and repeated, longstanding acts of alleged fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cohenseglias.com/attorney/julie-grohovsky/">Julie Grohovsky</a>, a partner at Cohen Seglias Pallas Greenhall &amp; Furman in Washington, D.C., who represents whistleblowers and previously worked as a federal prosecutor, noted that criminal cases require a higher burden of proof than civil cases – beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wang’s case, “they seem to have strong evidence of intent (the pharmaceutical money connection) and the length of the scheme, and fairly large damages for these kinds of cases,” Grohovsky said, so they decided to pursue criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I also think some of the run of the mill grant fraud cases could have more sympathetic defendants,” she said, such as researchers who argue they were just trying to apply through a complicated government system. “But this guy is not sympathetic because of his industry connections and the amount of money allegedly stolen.” </p>



<p>Also, Grohovsky said, “the government likes to bring criminal cases where they think they can send a message to other potential fraudsters that they are watching.”</p>



<p>Wang’s indictment “sends a very, very powerful message,” Goldstein said, that scientists should be careful when submitting grant applications. “It suggests that deliberate manipulation of Western blots which result in federal funding can result in a criminal indictment.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="192" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129615"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Thomas Ameyaw-Brobbey</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A former assistant professor of international relations at Yibin University in Sichuan, China, said he was fired from his job and “forced” to retract a paper on COVID-19 because the article did not “paint a good picture of the Chinese government.”</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.jois.eu/?715,en_retraction-a-lost-chance-for-what-covid-19-and-its-repercussions-on-global-public-opinion-of-china%E2%80%99s-development-model-and-international-leadership">2021 paper</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOnGHtEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Thomas Ameyaw-Brobbey</a>, now an adjunct lecturer at Accra Business School in Ghana and an adjunct research fellow at the Ghana Armed Forces Command and Staff College, discussed the negative effects of the pandemic on the global public opinion of Chinese leadership and how the outbreak fostered&nbsp; an “unfavorable image” of China.</p>



<p>After the article appeared in the <em>Journal of International Studies</em>, authorities at Yibin University held several meetings with Ameyaw-Brobbey asking him to explain the paper and why he used a dataset of public opinion in the United States that was “likely to be biased towards China,” he said.</p>



<span id="more-129614"></span>



<p>Ameyaw-Brobbey used data from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/about/">Pew Research Center</a> which, according to their website, is a “nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.” Pew specifically measured opinions relating to the subject under investigation in the paper, Ameyaw-Brobbey said. In one of the meetings with Yibin officials, they asked why he did not use a Japanese public opinion survey instead.</p>



<p>Yibin “forced” him to retract his paper, and he cooperated with the journal for retraction, Ameyaw-Brobbey said. The paper was retracted in December 2021. The journal has not posted a retraction notice – which <a href="https://publicationethics.org/sites/default/files/retraction-guidelines-cope.pdf">goes against guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics</a> – but the PDF of the article is watermarked “retracted.” The journal&nbsp; is published by Poland’s Centre of Sociological Research. The editor in chief, Jurij Bilan, did not respond to our request for comment through phone or email.</p>



<p>“Although the paper had no scientific problem and the journal duly recognized that the paper satisfied all scientific requirements, the Chinese university, basing on political reason, claimed the paper did not glorify China and did not paint a good picture of Chinese government,” Ameyaw-Brobbey told Retraction Watch. “The paper unnecessarily became a victim of Chinese censorship and lack of academic freedom.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ameyaw-Brobbey said he was fired without reason from his position at Yibin University in December 2021. His full notice of termination letter, seen by Retraction Watch, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>According to the &#8220;Foreign Staff Employment Contract with Yibin University&#8221;, after discussion, our university has decided to terminate the employment contract with you. Hereby inform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yibin University did not respond to our requests for comment through phone, email or their online chatbot service.</p>



<p>“It doesn&#8217;t hurt me anymore at this time when I remember or talk about it,” Ameyaw-Brobbey said on his decision to speak out three years later. “However, the incident deeply affected my emotional and mental status during the period. I struggled to sleep at night and the episodes and meeting proceedings always relapsed in my sleep.”</p>

<p>The president of the Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT) has corrected two of his papers and is set to correct another amid allegations of duplication – sometimes inelegantly referred to as “self-plagiarism” – despite a university committee clearing him of misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Employees at the university have accused president Masahiro Yoshimoto of duplication between 11 sets of his published papers – implicating 34 papers in total. </p>



<p>The employees submitted the allegations to the institution last October, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VhRVL1ky2TEucC1JwSz4dLLDbKBzzsB/view?usp=sharing">backing their claims</a> with an analysis by plagiarism detection software iThenticate. Two of these employees spoke to Retraction Watch on condition of anonymity, fearing a loss of support from their colleagues if they spoke publicly. Their concerns triggered an investigation at KIT, which cleared Yoshimoto of misconduct in January. However, the whistleblowers still believe the papers should be retracted. </p>



<span id="more-129583"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The latest correction concerns a 2005 paper from<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1143/JJAP.44.L1161/pdf"> a Japanese journal</a> announcing the development of a novel semiconductor alloy. Just one year later, a second – now corrected – paper claiming to have achieved the same feat “for the first time” was published in the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.200669596"><em>physica status solidi (a)</em></a>, with three overlapping authors from the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This April, <em>physica status solidi (a)</em> issued a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.202400245">lengthy correction</a> for the paper. The journal added the earlier publication to the reference list, as well as copyright information for the two figures which were reproduced from the original paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The correction also removed language in the article describing the work being done “for the first time”, and altered a line in the introduction stating “to our best knowledge there were no literature papers about [the topic]” to “there were few literature papers about [the topic]&#8230; except our recent one”. But the correction ended by stating the paper ultimately “provides new information” on the subject.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That shouldn’t be a correction, that should be a retraction,” said one of the KIT employees in a call with Retraction Watch. “Because it is plagiarism, it is apparent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When they approached Stefan Hildebrandt, the editor of <em>physica status solidi A</em>, he said the editors of the journal and Wiley’s research integrity team had investigated the similarities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GA5bQCjd0D-sFI37zwbp0EmZ294qYjhW/view?usp=sharing">Hildebrandt’s email</a>, the Japanese journal permits authors to reuse any original figures, tables or parts of their own article provided the authors follow the copyright policy of the journal, which includes citing the original article as a reference, and adding copyright text along with the reproduced content – all information that appears in the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hildebrandt wrote the outcome “was mutually agreed upon by the various parties involved” and the correction “addresses concerns regarding potentially redundant publications in a case where no copyright violation was found.” In response to our questions about why the paper was corrected and not retracted, a spokesperson for Wiley, the journal’s publisher, reiterated Hildebrandt’s previous statement and added that the correction brings “the article into alignment with the copyright policy [of the Japanese journal].”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last July, before KIT’s investigation, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.35848/1347-4065/ace86b">another journal published a correction</a> to Yoshimoto’s work for a similar reason. The correction – for <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1143/jjap.46.l764">a 2007 paper</a> in the <em>Japanese Journal of Applied Physics</em> – added references to reproduced data from <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.2731170">another 2007 paper</a> published by the same three authors, including Yoshimoto. The correction stated the work nevertheless “highlighted a critical new insight” which was absent in the previous paper. The editors of the journals have not responded to our questions in time for publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the anonymous employees, a third correction will be published for <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsms1963/51/9/51_9_989/_article/-char/ja/">this 2002 paper</a>. The editors of the journal did not respond to confirm the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Yoshimoto was put forward last year as the only candidate to succeed the university’s former president, Kiyotaka Morisako, the anonymous employees say younger colleagues alerted them to the duplication concerns because they felt their new leader’s behavior was not fair. </p>



<p>When the group formalized these allegations in October, Morisako formed an investigation committee to look into the claims. In January this year, the committee concluded that the allegations did not constitute misconduct. Yoshimoto, who has not responded to requests for comment, became KIT president in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a translation of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lotU9B60nUVlZkpxUFvT9Io2xLVfL_9B/view?usp=sharing">the verdict</a>, the committee found the papers that appeared to be duplicates in fact “contained different knowledge and novelty” from the earlier papers. The committee also determined Yoshimoto and his co-authors had not duplicated, since they had made appropriate citations and the similarities were within an acceptable range. </p>



<p>The investigation’s findings are not publicly available. The anonymous employees have tried to obtain the full report from university officials and Japan’s ministry of education, but have so far been unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public verdict lacked “any rigorous explanation,” the employees said. “This lack of transparency and accountability raises suspicions and underscores the urgent need for public attention and further investigation.”</p>



<p>“This is an extraordinary situation in which a university tries to cover up research misconduct without disclosing the situation,” the anonymous employees wrote in an email. “The impact of this situation on the trust of our research community cannot be overstated.”</p>

<p>A prolific <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">hijacked journal</a> has managed to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/18/journal-hijackers-still-infiltrate-scopus-despite-its-efforts/">breach the defenses</a> of <a href="https://www.scopus.com">Scopus</a>, one of the world&#8217;s leading academic databases. This time, the target is the award-winning journal <a href="https://www.communitypractitioner.co.uk/">Community Practitioner</a>, the official publication of the UK-based organization Unite-CPHVA.</p>



<p>On July 7, 2023, <a href="https://x.com/mohd_alamr/status/1677072144432349187">I reported via 𝕏</a> that the journal&#8217;s homepage in Scopus had been compromised and was redirecting users to a <a href="https://commprac.com">fraudulent website</a> masquerading as the legitimate publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this revelation, the journal&#8217;s editorial team <a href="https://x.com/CommPrac">remained unresponsive</a>, neglecting to issue any warnings to authors about the deceptive clone. In December 2023, Scopus took action, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/28/elseviers-scopus-deletes-journal-links-following-revelations-of-hijacked-indexed-journals/">removing links to the homepage of the publication in an effort to combat hijacking</a>.</p>



<span id="more-129544"></span>



<p>While the legitimate <em>Community Practitioner</em> is a subscription-based journal focused on medicine and nursing, the clone website falsely claims it has been an open-access publication since January 2020, and offers subscriptions to past issues by contacting “the editor.” It also advertises the ability to publish articles across all research fields, a stark departure from the scope of the legitimate title.</p>

<p>The telltale signs of these inauthentic articles are evident: inconsistent volume, issue, and page numbers compared to the legitimate publication. Some also bear DOIs from <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>, a service the authentic <em>Community Practitioner </em>doesn’t use.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfkXosKbaOkAsk8woe7jzI1N3YbwTGfmGTRkWEeKiV5s9vhFMD2vTjgiuH44greWgouVFCvMmORPDAC_Zf8JgK3FiDadfz_8f_8RQ5kpagO_EgsSNaSG3-O-0guyhytocukcXfLVAV3JMRMJBUCr5DKARCDSFl9cwsj5YiWEMWl_gMzC9IbEg?key=zALyetv1QREAVgykkofpKw" alt="C:\Users\Mohammed\Desktop\2024-06-08_022320.jpg"/></figure>



<p>The consequences of this infiltration are far-reaching. Authors of these fraudulent articles may have unjustly benefited from their misleading indexing in Scopus, potentially securing academic promotions, employment, and credentials under false pretenses. The reputation of the legitimate journal has been tarnished, with its CiteScore metric compromised due to the influx of low- or zero-cited inauthentic articles since 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd98ooYdCA0GLLubQMhUUuMDmC5lJdUM845ZBg1RL1xZuy0STuAP1Qq-VoL-TxgOZJ2FbR7qomRBBdwkKezR8Tpy3tXp9MOVYPQ0uRi17zprKVnUThexxeohY1PsoyYsFscU68elsr4BgO2W_4godI-b1_ZBQ0j-ARhDCMHCg?key=zALyetv1QREAVgykkofpKw" alt="C:\Users\Mohammed\Desktop\2024-06-09_030741.jpg"/></figure>



<p>Merely deleting the URL for the homepage of the hijacked journal  from Scopus has proven insufficient, as the fraudulent content ends up in the database, continuing to undermine its integrity. A more comprehensive strategy is needed to not only remove the visible links to fraudulent journals, but also to prevent their content from infiltrating indexing databases.</p>

It is however clear that astrocytes sense many input molecules; there is a consensus that calcium might be a key player for intracellular signaling in astrocytes; and there are quite opposing views about the most relevant output pathways of astrocytes. In the following, I will discuss four recent papers on how astrocytes interact with neurons (and with blood vessels).</p>



<p><strong>Norepinephrine Signals Through Astrocytes To Modulate Synapses</strong></p>



<p>Do neuromodulators like noradrenaline act directly upon neurons, or are these effects mediated by, for example, astrocytes? In reality, it is not black or white, but an increasing number of scientists have acknowledged the potential big role played by astrocytes as intermediates (see e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01448-8">Murphy-Royal et al. (2023)</a>). In this study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.21.595135">Lefton et al. (2024)</a> from the <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/papouinlab/">Papouin lab</a> use slice physiology to carefully dissect such a signaling pathway from neuromodulators to astrocytes to neurons.</p>



<p>It is rare to see such consistent and convincing evidence for a complex neuromodulation signaling pathway as it is presented in a paper. To drive home the main messages, the authors apply many controls and redundant approaches from pharmacology, optogenetics. They use three different tools for astrocyte silencing (iBarks, CaleX and thapsigargin), conditional and region-specific knockouts and two-photon imaging to confirm their ideas. I think the paper is definitely worth the read. The main conclusion is that noradrenaline release in hippocampus silences pre-synapses of the CA3 -&gt; CA1 pathway (the so-called Schaffer collaterals). This presynaptic effect is convincingly shown with several lines of evidence. The demonstrated mode of action of this pathway is the following: noradrenaline binds to alpha1-receptors of hippocampal astrocytes. Those astrocytes release ATP, which is metabolized to adenosine. Adenosine in turn binds to the adenosine A1-receptor that has been shown to locate at the CA3 -&gt; CA1 presynapses, finally resulting in silencing of these synapses. Together, this cascade results in long-lasting synaptic depression on the timescale of minutes. Quite impressive work!</p>

<p>There are a few caveats to consider when interpreting the study. First, most of the work was done with a noradrenline concentration of 20 uM in the bath. This is relatively high, especially given previous work that showed somewhat opposite effects for sub-uM concentrations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa159">Bacon et al., 2020</a>). One can speculate that the physiological effect of the pathway found by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.21.595135">Lefton et al.</a> may therefore be weaker and, instead of fully silencing the presynaptic effects, rather tone down their relative importance compared to other inputs. The observed effect and signaling cascade is, however, interesting by itself.</p>



<p>Second, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.21.595135">Lefton et al.</a> convincingly show that the presynapses are depressed after noradrenaline release. This finding is also accurately reflected in the title. However, in some places, the finding is reframed as an “update of weights” in a non-Hebbian fashion, and “reshaping of connectivity”. This description is not wrong, but a bit misleading because these terms suggest an important role for memory and long-term potentiation, which is not how I would interpret the results. But this is just a minor detail.</p>



<p>Thinking about these results, I’m wondering how specific the effect is on the investigated CA3 -&gt; CA1 synapses. It is an appealing idea to think that, e.g., synapses from entorhinal cortex (EC) onto CA1 might be less affected by this signaling pathway. This way, noradrenaline could be used to specifically reduce inputs from CA3 vs. inputs from EC. An obvious next step for a follow-up study would be to investigate the distribution of A1 receptors on different synapses, and the effect of noradrenaline via astrocytes on other projections to CA1.</p>



<p>Altogether, despite the caveats, this is really a nice paper, and it clearly shows the raw power of slice work when it is performed systematically and thoroughly. This work is particularly interesting as a companion paper describes a very similar pathway with noradrenaline, astrocytes and adenosine to silence not only neurons but also behavior (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.595576">Chen et al., 2024</a>).</p>



<p><strong>A spatial threshold for calcium surge</strong></p>



<p>Our own work has recently shown that astrocytic somata conditionally integrate calcium signals from their distal processes, and we have shown that the noradrenergic system is sufficient to trigger such a somatic integration (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01612-8">Rupprecht et al., 2024</a>). In this conceptually related paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.18.549563">Lines et al. (2023)</a> from the <a href="https://www.araquelab.com/">Araque lab</a> similarly describe conditional somatic activation of astrocytes, which they term somatic “calcium surges”. However, they use distal calcium signals rather than noradrenaline levels to explain whether these somatic calcium surges do occur or not.</p>



<p>Their main finding is a “spatial threshold”, i.e., a threshold of a minimum fraction of distal astrocytic processes that need to be activated in order to lead to somatic calcium surges. This is an interesting finding which they validate both in vivo and in slices in somatosensory cortex. The authors quantify that activation of &gt;23% of the arborization results in a somatic calcium surge. Although I like the attempt to be quantitative and makes the results easier to compare to other conditions, I believe that the precise value of this threshold is a bit over-emphasized in the paper. I believe that this specific value could change quite a bit with different imaging conditions, with different analysis tools, or when assessing the calcium signals volumetrically in 3D instead of in a 2D imaging plane. However, I still like the overall approach, and I think it is quite complimentary to our approach focusing on noradrenaline as the key factor to control somatic integration. In the end, these two processes – noradrenaline signaling and activation of processes – are not mutually exclusive, but two processes are not only correlated with each other but that are also very likely to causally affect each other.</p>



<p>Figure 6 of the paper makes an additional step by establishing a connection between somatic calcium surges and gliotransmission and subsequent slow-inward currents in neurons. This connection is potentially of very big interest; however, I don’t think that the authors do themselves a favor by addressing this question in a short single figure at the end of an otherwise solid paper. But other readers might have a different perspective on that. In any case, I can only recommend checking out this interesting study!</p>



<p><strong>How GABA and glutamate activate astrocytes</strong></p>



<p>It is well-known that activation of neuronal glutamatergic or GABAergic synapses also activates astrocytes. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07311-5">Cahill et al. (2024)</a> from the <a href="https://kiraposkanzerlab.org/">Poskanzer lab</a> investigated this relationship systematically in slices using localized uncaging of glutamate and GABA. In particular the application or uncaging of glutamate lead to quite strong activation of astrocytic processes and somata. Very interesting experiments. The authors find that events locally evoked by GABA or Glu release propagate within &#8211; and across &#8211; astrocytes. This finding is, at least for me, quite unexpected, and I hope that it will be confirmed in future studies.</p>



<p>In addition, I believe that these experiments and results would be really useful to better understand somatic activation of astrocytes. Does simple stimulation with glutamate also result in somatic activation (in the spirit of &#8220;centripetal propagation&#8221; or &#8220;somatic calcium surges&#8221;), as one would expect from the analysis of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.18.549563">Lines et al. (2023</a>); or would it require the additional input from noradrenaline, as our results (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01612-8">Rupprecht et al., 2024</a>) seem to suggest? A &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; interesting question that could be addressed with this dataset.</p>



<p><strong>Astrocytic calcium and blood vessel dilations</strong></p>



<p>It is well-known that astrocytes and in particular their end-feet interact with blood vessels. However, there has been a longstanding debate about the nature of these interactions. A big confound is that the observables (blood vessel dilations and astrocytic endfeet activation) might be connected via correlative rather than causal processes. For example, both actions might take place upon noradrenaline release but could be triggered independently by two separate signaling pathways without interaction directly.</p>



<p>In this fascinating paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.28.601145">Lind and Volterra (2024)</a> try to disentangle these processes by looking specifically at moments when the observed animals do not move. In this &#8220;rest&#8221; state, all these processes are less correlated with each other, enabling a better understanding of the natural sequence of events. In brief, the authors find that calcium signals in astrocytic endfeet seem to control whether a vessel dilation spreads across compartments or not. These analyses were enabled by imaging blood vessel dilation and astrocytic endfeet calcium in a 3D volume using two-photon microscopy in behaving mice. Great work!</p>
