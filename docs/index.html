<p>The first step to dealing with a negative emotion is to identify it. If you’re feeling irritated, restless or guilty, the most effective way to start feeling better will be different in each case. The trouble is, if your sense of your own emotions is not that fine-grained – if you feel just “bad” or “upset” – you may struggle to identify the cause of your distress, making it tricky to self-regulate your emotions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Plenty of studies have linked a poor ability to differentiate between negative emotions (known as “low Negative Emotion Differentiation” or “low NED” for short) to depression. But this work has mostly been conducted at a single point in time (i.e. having a “cross-sectional” design), making it impossible to tell whether difficulties with emotional differentiation cause depression or vice versa. The research has also overwhelmingly involved adults, and yet it is adolescence that is most marked by low NED (even more than in early childhood) and depression. This mismatch in the literature motivated Lisa Starr at the University of Rochester and her colleagues to conduct a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-35689-001">longitudinal study on adolescents</a>, published recently in <i>Emotion</i>. They looked not only at teenagers’ NED and depressive symptoms over time, but also their experience of minor daily hassles and more serious stressful life events. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37593"></span></p>
<p>The team studied 233 healthy American boys and girls aged between 14 and 17. They first interviewed the adolescents for depression and exposure to discrete stressful events (such as serious problems at school or parental separation) over the past 12 months. Then four times a day for the next seven days, the teens used a smartphone questionnaire to describe their current mood using a choice of 12 negative emotion words and 5 positive emotion words (these responses allowed the researchers to score the teens’ ability to distinguish their negative emotions). The phone surveys also allowed the teens to note any daily hassles (such as an argument with a parent or a parking ticket) they’d experienced during the preceding five hours, including rating their severity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Eighteen months later, the same teen participants were again assessed for levels of depression and also exposure to stressful life events during this period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the adolescents who during the week-long survey period were relatively poor at differentiating between negative (but not positive) emotions were also more likely to suffer a transiently depressed mood after a minor hassle. Eighteen months on, they also had higher levels of depressive symptoms – but only if their exposure to stressful life events during that period had been high.</p>
<p>The finding that low NED on its own, without stress, did not predict depression over time is a “critical finding”, the researchers write. They add that it is “to our knowledge, unique to the literature”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why might an inability to distinguish between negative emotions function as a risk factor for depression only in the context of high levels of stress? “People with difficulties discriminating between and labelling [negative emotions] may fail to orient to the causes and consequences of their emotional responses to stressors, leaving them less prepared to effectively down-regulate [negative emotions],” the researchers write. Such deficits in emotion regulation may in turn “make the emotional aftermath of stressors more difficult to manage and lead to the development of depressive symptoms,” they added. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Adolescents experience all kinds of changes, both in their neurobiology and in their social relationships, which put pressure on their emotional functioning. At the start of this study, 15 per cent of the sample had clinically significant symptoms of depression and 4 per cent met the formal psychiatric criteria for a diagnosis of depression. At the second time point, when any depressive symptoms over the past 1.5 years were considered, these rates had jumped to 37 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. If, as the new findings suggest, low NED in combination with stress is a risk factor for depression, this suggests a particularly effective way to address depression in adolescence might be via a process known as “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/09/twitter-study-confirms-the-power-of-affect-labelling-emotions-are-calmed-by-putting-them-into-words/">affect labelling</a>”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This process involves teaching people to understand and recognise a broader range of emotions (usually negative ones). It has been shown to lessen the intensity of negative emotions and encourage appropriate responses – and the researchers suggest, given their new data, that it may also protect against the development of depression. “Moreover, our finding that NED interacts with environmental stress to predict depression suggests it is especially important to target interventions at high-risk, stress-exposed youth,” they conclude.</p>

<strong>Can psychology help make running more enjoyable?</strong> Our presenter <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com">Christian Jarrett</a> speaks to several experts about various strategies including “cognitive reappraisal” and the benefits of taking part in organised runs. He also hears how some of us are genetically disposed to find running less enjoyable than others, and why that isn’t an excuse for giving up.</p>

Self-report measures are a staple of psychiatry, neuroscience, and all branches of psychology (clinical, cognitive, perceptual, personality, social, etc.). Symptom scales, confidence ratings, performance monitoring, metacognitive efficiency (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6390881/" target="_blank" title="'indexes an individual’s metacognitive capacity with respect to a particular level of task performance' {Carpenter et al. 2019}">meta-d'/d'</a>), vividness ratings, preference/likeability judgements, and affect ratings are all examples. Even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0330-19.2019" target="_blank" title="Mnemonic introspection in macaques is dependent on superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not orbitofrontal cortex">monkeys</a> have an introspective side!<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 1</sup></b></span><br /><br />In the <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank" title="The Shock of the Unknown in Aphantasia: Learning that Visual Imagery Exists">last post</a> we learned about a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a>, the inability to generate visual images. Although the focus has been on visual imagery, many people with aphantasia cannot form “mental images” of any sensory experience. Earworms, those pesky songs that get stuck in your head, are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia/comments/6n1c5x/curious_about_earworms/" target="_blank">not a nuisance</a> for some individuals with aphantasia (but many others <a href="https://jamiebrightmore.com/other/aphantasia/" target="_blank">do get them</a>). Touch, smell, and taste are even less studied <span class="st">—</span> mental imagery of these senses is generally more muted, if it occurs at all (even in the fully phantasic).<br /><br />The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1973.tb01322.x" target="_blank">Marks 1973</a>)<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> is the instrument used to identify people with poor to non-existent visual imagery (i.e., aphantasia). For each item on the VVIQ, the subject is asked to “try to form a visual image, and consider your experience carefully.  For any image that you do experience, rate how vivid it is using the five-point scale described below.  If you do not have a visual image, rate vividness as ‘1’.  Only use ‘5’ for images that are truly as lively and vivid as real seeing.” By its very nature, it's a subjective measure that relies on introspection. <br /><br />But how well do we <i>really</i> know the quality of our private visual imagery? <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/" target="_blank">Eric Schwitzgebel</a> has argued that it's really <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2002/00000009/f0020005/1286" target="_blank">quite poor</a>:<sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>3</b></span></sup> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“...it is observed that although people give widely variable reports about their own experiences of visual imagery, differences in report do not systematically correlate with differences on tests of skills that [presumably] require visual imagery, such as mental rotation, visual creativity, and visual memory.”</blockquote><br />And it turns out that many of these cognitive skills do <b><i>not</i></b> require visual imagery. A recent study found that participants with aphantasia were slower to perform a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/mental-rotation.html" target="_blank">mental rotation task</a> (relative to controls), but they were more accurate (<a href="https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2700106" target="_blank">Pounder et al., 2018</a>). The test asked participants to determine whether a pair of objects is identical, or mirror images of each other. Response times generally increase as a function of the angular difference in the orientations of the two objects. The overall slowing and accuracy advantage in those with aphantasia held across all levels of difficulty, so these participants must be using a different strategy than those without aphantasia.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-29fzIUKZAg0/XTTuzCVGLoI/AAAAAAAAM5Q/vCHMgerX9AoUhen5VwJ8KN2v_lwKa3O-gCLcBGAs/s1600/shepard-metzler71.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="190" data-original-width="720" height="105" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-29fzIUKZAg0/XTTuzCVGLoI/AAAAAAAAM5Q/vCHMgerX9AoUhen5VwJ8KN2v_lwKa3O-gCLcBGAs/s400/shepard-metzler71.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span>from <b><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701" target="_blank">Shepard and Metzler (1971)</a></b></span></div><br /><br />Another study found that people with aphantasia were surprisingly good at reproducing the details of a complex visual scene from memory (<a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?mtpage=poster_detail&amp;id=11244" target="_blank">Bainbridge et al., 2019</a>).<sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>4</b></span></sup><br /><br />What test <b><i>does</i></b> require visual imagery? The phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_rivalry" target="_blank">binocular rivalry</a> involves the presentation of two different images to each eye using specialized methods or simple 3D glasses. Instead of forming a unified percept, the images presented to the left and right eye seem to alternate. Thus, binocular rivalry involves <a href="http://www.binocularrivalryonline.com/" target="_blank">perceptual switching</a>. The figure below was taken from the informative video of <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/2030/how-to-create-and-use-binocular-rivalry" target="_blank">Carmel and colleagues (2010)</a> in <a href="https://www.jove.com/about/" target="_blank"><i>JoVE</i></a>.

The key trick is that participants were cued to <i><b>imagine</b></i> one of two images for 6 seconds. Then they performed a vividness rating, followed by a brief presentation of the binocular rivalry display. Finally, the subjects had to report which color they saw.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>- click for larger view -</span></span></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jOo77nE4TcM/XTPbyz5qQ_I/AAAAAAAAM44/YfbJkpriSlI28vTa8aE6U0gnPaSIMvnSQCLcBGAs/s1600/binocular%2Brivalry%2Bin%2Baphantasia.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="492" data-original-width="1320" height="148" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jOo77nE4TcM/XTPbyz5qQ_I/AAAAAAAAM44/YfbJkpriSlI28vTa8aE6U0gnPaSIMvnSQCLcBGAs/s400/binocular%2Brivalry%2Bin%2Baphantasia.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span>Fig. 1 (<b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581" target="_blank">Keogh &amp; Pearson, 2018</a></b>).</span></div><br /><br />The study population included 15 self-identified aphantasics recruited via Facebook, direct contact with the investigators, or referral from <a href="http://sites.exeter.ac.uk/eyesmind/" target="_blank">Professor Adam Zeman</a>, and 209 control participants recruited from the general population.

As a group, the individuals with aphantasia did not show priming that was greater than chance. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2E, results from this test were not completely diagnostic.

Correlations for the n=209 controls in the present paper were not reported, however. This would be quite informative, since the earlier study had a much lower number of participants (n=20).<br /><br />What does this mean? I would say that binocular rivalry priming can be a useful “objective” measure of aphantasia, but it's not necessarily diagnostic at an individual level. <br /><br /><br /><b>Related Posts</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html">The Shock of the Unknown in Aphantasia: Learning that Visual Imagery Exists </a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/05/imagine-these-experiments-in-aphantasia.html">Imagine These Experiments in Aphantasia</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0330-19.2019" target="_blank"><i>Mnemonic <b>introspection</b> in macaques is dependent on superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not orbitofrontal cortex</i></a>. <br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> The VVIQ is not without its <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-29151-001" target="_blank" title="The VVIQ as a psychometric test of individual differences in visual imagery vividness: A critical quantitative review and plea for direction">detractors</a>...<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3</sup></b></span> Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenRolf/status/1146003002811125764" target="_blank">Rolf Degan</a> for bringing this paper to my attention.<br /><br /><sup><span style="color: purple;"><b>4</b></span></sup> Also see this reddit thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia/comments/bfg5ru/sketching_from_memory/" target="_blank">Sketching from memory</a>.<br /><br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />Bainbridge WA, Pounder Z, Eardley A, Baker CI (2019). <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?mtpage=poster_detail&amp;id=11244" target="_blank"> Characterizing aphantasia through memory drawings of real-world images</a>. <i>Cognitive Neuroscience Society Annual Meeting</i>. <br /><br />Keogh R, Pearson J.

We don’t know how another person perceives the outside world: the color of the ocean, the sound of the waves, the smell of the seaside, the exact temperature of the water. Even more obscure is how someone else <i><b>imagines</b></i> the world in the absence of external stimuli. Most people are able to generate an internal “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/" target="_blank" title="mental representation">representation</a>”<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> of a beach — to deploy imagery — when asked, “picture yourself at a relaxing beach.” We can “see” the beach in our mind’s eye even when we’re not really there.

An upcoming post will discuss a couple of cool new experiments.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><span><b>ADDENDUM (July 21 2019)</b>: the follow-up post is finally here!</span></span><br /><b><span><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/07/is-there-objective-test-for-aphantasia.html"><span style="color: purple;">Is there an objective test for Aphantasia?</span></a></span></b><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> This is a loaded term that I won’t explain – or debate – right now. <br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2026509.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" title="Reduction, Qualia, and the Direct Introspection of Brain States, by Paul Churchland">Some</a> <a href="http://cogprints.org/254/1/quinqual.htm" target="_blank" title="Quining Qualia, by Dan Dennett">people</a> don’t believe that qualia exist (as such), but I won’t elaborate on that, either.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3</sup></b></span> I don’t hang out on Reddit, and my Twitter usage has declined.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>4</sup></b></span> Or at least, they've existed for quite some time.<br /><br /><br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="https://aphantasia.com/aphantasia-index">Aphantasia Index</a><br /><br /><a href="http://sites.exeter.ac.uk/eyesmind/" target="_blank">The Eye's Mind</a><br /><br /><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/03/bonus-episode-whats-it-like-to-have-no-minds-eye/" target="_blank">Bonus Episode: What It's Like to Have no Mind's Eye</a>, a recent entry of BPS Research Digest.

This week I came across a brain stimulation device called Humm that promises to improve your cognitive function and memory if you stick it to your forehead.

There are several broadly similar devices on the market, which make use of the principle of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) - passing a current through the head (the front of the head, generally) in order to modulate brain activity.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/07/Comp-Bio-Image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>At <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, one of our driving motivations is to provide services and support to our community of authors, editors, reviewers and readers. Transparency and reproducibility in peer review and reporting of results are two key aspects of that mission, and we are very pleased to announce a pilot on the journal that aims to support both of these aspects of publishing.</p>
<p>Our Managing Editor, Gary Beardmore, and Editor in Chief, Jason Papin, have been working with the <a href="https://reproduciblebiomodels.org/">Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modelling</a>. Through this collaboration we will soon be able to offer expert technical peer review specifically checking that submitted systems biology or physiology-based models run according to the results presented in the manuscript submitted to the journal. The peer review will be delivered in addition to our usual scientific assessment of the manuscript, and for the duration of the pilot it will be optional for authors to take part. The expert peer reviewers will be eligible for inclusion in our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/">collaboration </a>with ORCID to get credit for the review work that they complete. Furthermore, as for all manuscripts published at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, authors will have the option to make the expert review open – alongside the other reports on the manuscript – in our <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">published peer review</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to monitor the pilot and to report back on the results next year. The aim is for the review process to be completed in the usual time frame for manuscripts at the journal, and for authors to feel that it provided them with additional guidance regarding the reporting of their models. Overall, we hope that this pilot will contribute to making it easier for interested readers to reproduce and build on models published in the journal – supporting the science going forward.</p>

<p>Poor sleepers may be hoping that with the gradual liberalisation of marijuana laws around the world, a new drug to help them sleep will soon become legally available. Bad news, then, from a new diary study, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-30981-001">published in Health Psychology</a>, of people who take cannabis as a sleep aid. While the drug seemed to improve some aspects of sleep, it also led people to feel more tired the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37561"></span></p>
<p>Most past work on the effects of marijuana on sleep has compared those who use the drug with those who abstain, which doesn’t reveal much about how an individual’s experiences change with marijuana use. So Patricia Goodhines and colleagues at Syracuse University examined how 83 university students’ sleep was affected on days when they did and didn’t take the drug over a two-week period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Each day, the students filled in questionnaires asking how often they had used marijuana or alcohol the previous day, and their reasons for taking the drug (such as “because it makes a social gathering more fun” or “to help sleep”). Participants also rated the quality and duration of their sleep that night, and how fatigued they felt during the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team found that 29 of the students used cannabis specifically as a sleep aid on at least one night of the 14-day study period (the highest frequency was 13 nights). Using the drug was related to longer duration of sleep and less time spent awake during the night, suggesting that there are some elements of sleep that cannabis may improve. But importantly, the drug didn’t help participants get to sleep any faster or improve their perceived quality of sleep – and worse, it actually increased their levels of fatigue the following day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Alcohol use, on the other hand, had no positive or negative effects on sleep. But in this case, the study was severely underpowered: only 6 participants reported using alcohol as a sleeping aid, preventing the researchers from drawing any real conclusions.</p>
<p>The researchers write that their results “highlight daytime fatigue as a potential adverse short-term outcome of cannabis sleep aid use, despite its proximal sleep-related benefits”. The study period was too short to look at the longer-term consequences of cannabis use on sleep, but this is an area that is ripe for future research. It’s possible that fatigue produced by cannabis could lead participants to take more of the drug in an attempt to sleep better, for example, resulting in a vicious cycle.</p>

<h2>All over the world, women live longer than men.</h2>
<p>In Australia in 2016, the median age at death was 85.0 years for women and 78.9 years for men. The gender gap grows with age, among centenarians worldwide, women outnumber men nine to one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4994139/">female advantage</a> is not restricted to humans as in other species, from honeybees to orca whales to rodents, females outlive males.</p>
<h2>The longevity gender gap has always ebbed and flowed.</h2>
<p>Mortality before modernity was influenced by wars, infection and death during childbirth. In nineteenth century Europe, life expectancy was less than forty years and the longevity of men and women was generally very similar.</p>
<p>High female mortality due to pregnancy and childbirth corresponded to a high male mortality from causes related to work, accidental injury or war (both sexes succumbed to infection and disease in equal numbers.)</p>
<p>The greatest gap was seen during in the middle decades of the twentieth century. For example, in the UK in the 1970s, life expectancy between men and women was about seven years apart. In the early years of the twentieth century, men smoked and drank, went to war and worked in physically stressful jobs. The men who died at middle age during the 70s were the ‘carriers’ of an excess mortality determined by their misspent youth.</p>
<h2>The longevity gender gap is beginning to close</h2>
<p>Teenagers and young men are three times more likely than young women to die by accidents (usually in a car), suicide, drowning and violence. These rates ensure that by age twenty-five, more women are alive than men.</p>
<p>In middle age, men are still more likely to die in car accidents or from suicide, but illnesses related to smoking, alcohol and poor diet start to emerge, with death from heart disease being the main cause of the gender gap.</p>
<p>For men, the risk of heart disease begins in their forties.</p>
<p>For women, it doesn’t start to increase until after menopause. By late life, men are more likely than women to die from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Of course, women are not immortal, and we lead the statistics in death from dementia, chronic lower respiratory (lung) disease, cerebrovascular disease, influenza and pneumonia.</p>
<h2>Each generation ‘carries’ their lifestyle load of risk forward.</h2>
<p>The past few decades have seen the gap close. Harvard scientist <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248446318_Why_Women_Live_Longer_Than_Men">Thomas Perls</a>, who heads up NECS and the Long Life Family Study, suggests it’s primarily the reduction in male mortality, as opposed to the increase in female mortality, that closes the gap.</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, the higher a nation’s level of social and economic development, the greater the life expectancy for both men and women and the greater the convergence in the two figures.</p></blockquote>
<p>The life experiences and circumstances of women now in their eighties and nineties have been different from those of their daughters and granddaughters. Each generation ‘carries’ their lifestyle load of risk forward.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if girls and boys born today reach ‘equality’ in mortality.</p>
<h2>The influence of biological sex on lifespan</h2>
<p>The secret to longevity is actually quite simple. Avoid dying young!</p>
<p>So, do women live longer because we pay closer attention to Blue Zones lifestyle advice or because we make more visits to the doctor thereby avoiding an early death?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>As mentioned, elderly women often spend their extra few years of life in poor health, and female non-human species generally outlive their male counterparts, so it’s doubtful whether we can attribute healthy lifestyle practices for the gender gap.</p>
<h2>Female longevity theories include…</h2>
<h3>X Chromosomes.</h3>
<p>Clearly, men and women differ genetically, and one theory posits that the female ‘backup’ X chromosome provides a survival advantage. Men, in contrast, have only one X chromosome, so they cannot rely on a backup if a gene is defective.</p>
<h3>Mitochondria.</h3>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22863313">theory</a> implicates mitochondria, which exist in almost all animal cells, and convert our food into the energy that powers the body. Genetic variation in mitochondria reliably predicts life expectancy in males, but not in females. We receive copies of genes from both parents, except for mitochondrial genes that come only from our mother. It’s possible natural selection, which is evolution’s ‘quality control process’, only screens the quality of mitochondrial genes in females, so the mutations related to ageing are carried by males.</p>
<h3>Grandmothers!</h3>
<p>Finally, longevity in women might to be advantageous for a rather warm and fuzzy reason: grandmothers!</p>
<p>Menopausal orcas contribute to the survival of young whales by guiding the pod to hunting grounds, and a similar theory proposes human matriarchs confer the same survival benefits through the practice known as ‘alloparenting’.</p>
<p>The cute but contentious ‘grandmother hypothesis’ was first proposed in the 1980s, when anthropologists Kristen Hawkes spent time with the Hadza hunter–gather communities in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Hawkes noticed when grandmothers were involved in supporting their daughters by babysitting and gathering food, the grandchildren and the entire tribe were healthier and lived longer.</p>
<p>Hawkes took this idea one step further and claimed that grandmothers provide the foundation for human social connection, pair bonding and evolution of bigger brains. Hawkes has since watered down her original hypothesis based on mathematical modelling of human populations, but still claims</p>
<blockquote><p>Grandmothers make us human.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The influence of reproductive history on the lifespan</h2>
<p>Your reproductive history includes the length of time from menarche to menopause, number of pregnancies, your age at your first and last pregnancies, and duration of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>This history reflects the cumulative exposure to sex hormones and your exposure to parenting.</p>
<h3>The older you are when give birth to your last child, the longer you’ll live.</h3>
<p>This phenomenon was first noticed in centenarian women — a remarkable number of them had babies late in life.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270889/">LLFS</a>, women who gave birth to a child after the age of forty have four times greater odds of reaching 100 compared to women who have their last child before the age of forty.</p>
<p>And women who have their last child after the age of thirty-three years have twice the odds of exceptional longevity compared to women who had their last child before age twenty-nine.</p>
<h3>The age at which you give birth to your first baby matters too.</h3>
<p>Time and time again, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616300983">studies</a> have found women who give birth in their teens experience worse health as they age, and they die younger than women who delay their first pregnancy. Socioeconomic status contributes to this statistic.</p>
<p>For example, teenage mothers are more likely to have grown up in disadvantaged households than women who delay their first pregnancy, and by virtue of raising a child from a young age, they’re less likely to stay in education, and more likely to continue the cycle of disadvantage.</p>
<h3>The optimal number of children is two or three</h3>
<p>Over the years, there have been conflicting reports on whether the number of children you have influences lifespan. It turns out that the relationship between motherhood and mortality follows a J-shaped curve.</p>
<p>If, like me, you’re partial to a glass of red wine, you may be familiar with the ‘J-shaped’ curve for alcohol consumption and health, whereby a glass or two of wine a day is more beneficial for health than nothing, or drinking to excess. Like glasses of wine, having two or three children is better for your health and longevity than remaining childless, or giving birth to four or more.</p>
<h3>Space your children out by two to three years</h3>
<p>Finally, having short birth intervals between your children (less than eighteen months apart or having twins or triplets) is linked to worse health, increased prescriptions for antidepressants (hardly a surprise), and earlier death compared to parents who space their children out by two to three years.</p>
<p><a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/68/10/958">Researchers</a> state the ‘emotional, psychological and social strains of raising multiple children’ does the damage.</p>
<p>I concur: the stresses and strains of having two boys under two with no extended family on hand quickly took its toll on my mental health. I only hope the fact I snuck my two in just after the magic age of 33 will somehow counterbalance the strain!</p>
<h3>Children reduce life expectancy in dads too!</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the J-shaped relationship between health and number of children, and birth spacing is also present for fathers. The more children men have, the higher their risk of death from alcohol-related disease, heart disease and accidents. While it might be tempting to say children drive men (and women) to drink (or justify their glasses of wine), there’s no evidence the relationship between your children and your health is causal<em>, </em>rather, a correlation exists.</p>
<h2>Like an apple a day, oestrogen protects and keeps the doctor away</h2>
<p>It remains to be seen whether ovarian hormones such as oestrogen and pregnancy <em>per se</em> contribute to longevity.</p>
<p>Certainly, there is data showing that having babies and breastfeeding them protect against cancers, especially breast and ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>The protective effect is strongest if you have children before the age of 30 and breastfeed them for a year or more. We think protection is due to reduced exposure to monthly fluctuations of oestrogen and progesterone, rather than overall exposure.</p>
<h2>Does HRT increase or decrease lifespan?</h2>
<p>For women who make the decision to take HRT, the results of eighteen years of follow-up on HRT trials should provide reassurance.</p>
<p>A report published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2653735"><em>JAMA</em> in 2017</a> found:</p>
<blockquote><p>No long-term increase in all-cause mortality or mortality from specific causes, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, among women who received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five to seven years.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and improved cognition if you start using HRT within the critical window (i.e. beginning when menopausal symptoms begin, not years later).</p>
<p>Earlier age at menarche, later age at last pregnancy and use of the pill also protect against cognitive decline in later life.</p>
<p>It’s important to note all this data on reproductive history, hormonal status and longevity are crunched from large population-based studies, often from Scandinavian countries where the government keeps particularly detailed health records. For example, the birth-spacing finding came from Norway where researchers were able to gather complete health histories for all women and men ever born and living in the country after 1935. Similarly, the data on family size comes from the Swedish population register for all people born and living in the country between 1932 and 1960.</p>
<h2>Family planning for longevity — is that even a thing?</h2>
<p>We have a tendency to turn ‘research’ into ‘me-search’ and view the data through our own life lens.</p>
<p>So, it’s important to keep in mind the benefits and harms I’m discussing are based on averages across large populations, and not always directly applicable to each of us.</p>
<p>Eliminating risks merely tips the scale in your favour.</p>
<p>Thomas Perls agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>This does not mean women should wait to have children at older ages in order to improve their own chances of living longer. The age at last childbirth can be a rate-of-aging indicator. The natural ability to have a child at an older age likely indicates that a woman’s reproductive system is aging slowly, and therefore so is the rest of her body.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you’re in your teens or twenties, it’s probably unwise to apply data on longevity to your future family planning.</p>

<p><strong>When did you get to know about <em>BMC Materials</em>? And what made you decide to join the journal?</strong></p>
<p>I learned about <a href="https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=other&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=BSCN_2_DD_BMCMat_Blog_Jul" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Materials</em></a> in October 2018 when <a href="https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board/editor-profiles?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=other&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=BSCN_2_DD_BMCMat_Blog_Jul" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Harriet Manning</a>, Editor at BMC, set up the journal. After extensive survey and careful speculation, Dr. Manning determined that six major fields of materials would be incorporated into the scope of <em>BMC Materials</em>.  She also asked experts from the six fields to recommend researchers who can lead and voluntarily serve the new journal. It was really a great honor for me to receive the invitation from Harriet. After several pleasant rounds of emails and phone calls, I joined the <a href="https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=other&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=BSCN_2_DD_BMCMat_Blog_Jul" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">editorial board of <em>BMC Materials</em></a> and now focus on biological and biomedical materials. I am a science researcher mainly engaged in the field of biomedical materials, which happens to be one of the six major fields within the scope of <em>BMC Materials</em>. I sincerely hope that the journal can bridge the fields of biology, medicine and materials science, helping clinicians to familiarize themselves with materials science and materials researchers with medicine.</p>
<p><strong>As a Section Editor of the journal, do you have any plans for the job?</strong></p>
<p>I am really grateful for the opportunity to serve the authors and readers of <em>BMC Materials</em> as well as for the trust of the BMC Editorial Board and peer experts. As a Section Editor of <em>BMC Materials</em> particularly in charge of the biological and biomedical materials field, which is both challenging and fulfilling, I would commit myself to the following aspects.</p>
<p>(1) In such a new era for publishing and journals, which features information explosion and non-stop emergence of well- known databases, how can we attract authors and readers to our journal? We will try to ensure that every biological and biomedical materials paper published in the journal represents a small breakthrough in the field. We will also publish commissioned commentaries from clinicians in the field, hoping that each topic can inspire new ideas for research and product development in clinical medical materials. We care more about the inspiration that researchers can get from our publications rather than the mere number of readers.</p>
<p>(2) In such a highly subdivided field as materials science with plenty of well established journals, how can we accurately position <em>BMC Materials</em>? Materials science is a huge research field, within which star materials alternate over time.  High exposure of the star materials is a common practice for journals to attract readers and enhance their impact. However, <a href="https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=other&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=BSCN_2_DD_BMCMat_Blog_Jul" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Materials</em></a>, particularly the biological and biomedical materials section, considers new materials and methods oriented by practical clinical problems equally with the so called hot materials. Special collections concerning specific diseases will also be launched. Researchers will be invited to propose treatments from different perspectives such as biology and materials. We intend to encourage in-depth discussion around biological and biomedical materials based on specific practical challenges.</p>
<p>(3) After submission, manuscripts will be subjected to assessment for scientific merit and quality. A fast and transparent review process is beneficial to both the authors and the journal itself. International experts in the relevant field will be invited to give an overall comment on the manuscripts. Comprehensive exploration and rich data will be a plus but not mandatory. We are more concerned about whether a problem is explained and solved by biomaterials methods rather than  comprehensive exploration and shining data. We will do our best to ensure that researchers can find illumination in every paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will do our best to ensure that researchers can find illumination in every paper.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Compared with other journals in the field, especially established ones, what are the differences in positioning of <em>BMC Materials</em>?</strong></p>
<p>As is mentioned above, we expect <em>BMC Materials</em> to be more focused on its distinctive scope, particularly in the long run. Readers should get in-depth understanding of the field by reading the research and corresponding commentaries. Details of the publishing plan will be clarified by discussion with the whole editorial team. We will work hard on every research contribution and its relevant application for better integration, thus truly setting up bridges among different disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>What field are you particularly interested in and what progress has been made in it recently? What topics do you expect to see in <em>BMC Materials</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Within the scope of <em>BMC Materials</em>, I am more enthusiastic about the field of biomedical materials. With the development of medical science and technology, different therapeutic strategies keep emerging, in which biomedical methods, especially the continuous innovation of nanocarriers, tissue regeneration, new polymers and other advanced technologies, play the leading roles. Therefore, basic research aimed at using innovative and practical biomedical materials to solve clinical problems are more likely to be considered by the journal.  We hope that the journal can be inspirational for readers, encouraging for researchers and informative for clinical doctors.</p>
<p><strong>Could you please introduce your vision for <em>BMC Materials</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The future is full of uncertainties and challenges. I do expect to see innovative fusion of multiple disciplines —— every single paper is of value, so are commentaries from different perspectives. That is how our journal will bring new ideas and perception in materials science to its readers.</p>
<p><strong>What suggestions do you have for young researchers and authors who would like to submit their paper to an open access journal?</strong></p>
<p>Open access is important for sharing research results and increasing international visibility. As long as the publication fee can be covered by the funding, it is entirely reasonable to give priority to open access journals. In addition, we should be fully prepared for different voices, whether they are positive or negative.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-propos-de-la-tribune-nofakescience/">A propos de la tribune NoFakeScience</a></h4>

<p>Récemment, une <a href="https://www.lopinion.fr/edition/politique/science-ne-saurait-avoir-parti-pris-l-appel-250-scientifiques-aux-192812">tribune</a> a été publiée par le collectif NoFakeScience visant à alerter les médias sur leur traitement de l’information scientifique, en particulier de présenter les consensus scientifiques en tant que tels et non comme de simples opinions parmi d’autres. Intention louable, et sujet en effet très important. Pourtant, cette tribune a été vertement critiquée à la fois par des scientifiques et des journalistes scientifiques. Pourquoi ?</p>
<p>Certains ont cru y voir la main de lobbys industriels, tant le choix des « consensus scientifiques » est (en majeure partie) aligné avec les intérêts de ces groupes. Je ne connais pas personnellement les signataires, mais au vu de la liste il me semble plausible que les signataires soient sincères. Les journalistes flairent souvent le conflit d’intérêt, déformation professionnelle peut-être. Mais l’intérêt personnel n’est pas la seule (ni même la principale) motivation humaine, ni la seule source de biais cognitif. Il est à mon sens plus pertinent en l’occurrence d’y voir des biais philosophiques (j’y reviendrai). Quoi qu’il en soit, je veux ici commenter le texte lui-même en essayant d’éviter le procès d’intention.</p>
<p><strong>Le choix des « consensus »</strong></p>
<p>L’intention affichée, malgré quelques naïvetés philosophiques sur la « méthode scientifique », est louable et résumée dans cette phrase : « l’état de nos connaissances ne saurait être un supermarché dans lequel on pourrait ne choisir que ce qui nous convient et laisser en rayon ce qui contredit nos opinions. ». Malheureusement, c’est précisément ce que l’on peut reprocher à la liste qui suit de 6 « consensus scientifiques », que je reproduis ici verbatim :</p>
<ol>
<li><em>La balance bénéfice/risque des principaux vaccins est sans appel en faveur de la vaccination.</em></li>
<li><em>Il n’existe aucune preuve de l’efficacité propre des produits homéopathiques.</em></li>
<li><em>Aux expositions professionnelles et alimentaires courantes, les différentes instances chargées d’évaluer le risque lié à l’usage de glyphosate considèrent comme improbable qu’il présente un risque cancérigène pour l’homme.</em></li>
<li><em>Le fait qu’un organisme soit génétiquement modifié (OGM) ne présente pas en soi de risque pour la santé.</em></li>
<li><em>Le changement climatique est réel et d’origine principalement humaine.</em></li>
<li><em>L’énergie nucléaire est une technologie à faible émission de CO2 et peut contribuer à la lutte contre le changement climatique.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>A supposer qu’il s’agisse bien de consensus scientifiques (j’y reviens ci-dessous), il y a ici indéniablement un choix qui est fait dans cette présentation. Certains faits bien établis ont été « laissés en rayon », comme par exemple : les pesticides posent un très grave problème pour la biodiversité et de manière générale l’écosystème dont nous dépendons ; le nucléaire pose de sérieux problèmes de dissémination, accidents, déchets radioactifs. Ces remarques sont-elles « hors sujet », comme j’ai pu le lire dans les réactions du collectif ? Non, si l’on revient à la motivation même de la tribune, à savoir ne pas choisir uniquement ce qui nous convient. Bien sûr, il fallait bien faire un choix, ne serait-ce que pour la lisibilité. C’est là que j’en viens au biais philosophique. Ce choix parmi les faits établis est-il aléatoire ? Ce qui saute aux yeux, et qui n’a pas manqué d’être remarqué par les détracteurs de cette tribune, c’est que ces faits (sauf éventuellement le point (5)) vont globalement dans le sens de la glorification du progrès technique. Si l’on avait choisi à la place : les pesticides menacent les écosystèmes naturels ; les OGMs introduisent une relation de dépendance entre les agriculteurs et les multinationales ; les technologies nucléaires actuelles produisent des accidents catastrophiques ; nul doute que le message de la tribune aurait été modifié. Il y a donc une position philosophique qui se dégage nettement dans ce choix, à savoir une confiance <em>a priori</em> dans le progrès technique, que l’on retrouve par exemple chez des intellectuels comme Steven Pinker – dont le moins que l’on puisse dire est qu’il ne fait pas consensus.</p>
<p>Je vais maintenant commenter plus en détails ces points. Sur ces 6 points, j’estime que 3 points peuvent être légitimement qualifiés de consensus scientifiques (1, 2 et 5), mais que les 3 autres prétentions de consensus sont au mieux fallacieuses, au pire fausses.</p>
<p><strong>L’homéopathie</strong></p>
<p>Je commence par la question qui me semble la plus simple, à savoir l’efficacité de l’homéopathie (point 2), pour la contraster avec les autres. Contrairement aux autres points, il s’agit d’un problème scientifiquement assez simple, et qui à mon sens a été mal présenté. On entend souvent « l’effet de l’homéopathie est placebo ». C’est une formulation qui porte à confusion (il faut reconnaitre que la littérature scientifique est elle-même un peu confuse sur ce point). Tester l’efficacité propre de l’homéopathie est relativement simple. Lors de la consultation, on substitue aux granules homéopathiques des granules de sucre d’aspect identique. Cette substitution est faite de manière aléatoire dans la moitié des patients, à leur insu mais également à l’insu de l’homéopathe (ce qu’on appelle « en double aveugle »). Lorsque l’on suit leurs symptômes, on constate qu’il n’y a pas de différence entre les deux groupes. Le traitement homéopathique n’a donc pas d’effet propre. Pire que cela, ce serait un effet toxique. Comme le traitement de substitution s’appelle techniquement un « placebo » (terme un peu abusif), on rapporte que l’homéopathie n’est pas mieux qu’un placebo. Mais dans l’expérience que je viens de décrire, à aucun moment on a montré que l’homéopathie (ou la granule de sucre) a un « effet placebo » (au sens où la croyance en l’efficacité a un effet thérapeutique), ou un quelconque effet. On a simplement montré que l’efficacité ne pourrait pas être pire sans être toxique. Ce malentendu, me semble-t-il, est à l’origine de nombreuses réactions sur le mode : même s’il n’y a pas de substance active, pourquoi ne pas inciter les gens qui y croient à prendre de l’homéopathie, puisque l’effet placebo ça marche ?</p>
<p>Etant donnée la croyance répandue et fausse que l’homéopathie est efficace, il semblerait utile en effet comme le demande la tribune de mieux communiquer l’information scientifique. Cependant, il ne me semble pas en l’occurrence que les médias aient prétendu le contraire de ce que la tribune répète, à savoir qu’il n’y a « <em>aucune preuve de l’efficacité propre ». </em>Le problème, donc, ne semble pas tant être dans la communication de la parole scientifique, mais dans le crédit que les gens lui accordent (y compris les hommes politiques, visiblement), ce qui n’est pas exactement le même débat. La formulation employée dans la tribune ne clarifie pas tellement le sujet. Ce n’est pas exactement qu’il n’y a « aucune preuve ». Plutôt, l’efficacité a été testée de multiples fois, par des méthodes qui auraient dû révéler un effet de l’homéopathie s’il existait, ce qui n’a pas été le cas. Cela signifie que s’il existe un effet de l’homéopathie, il doit être extrêmement faible. Mettre cela sur le même plan que, par exemple, le glyphosate (voir ci-dessous), n’aide pas à clarifier la situation.</p>
<p>Je passe rapidement sur les vaccins, cas légèrement plus complexe mais du même ordre. Je note simplement qu’encore une fois, il n’est pas évident que le diagnostic porté par la tribune soit le bon, à savoir que le problème est que le consensus scientifique n’est pas présenté comme tel par les médias. Il me semble au contraire que les anti-vaccins sont tout à fait au courant qu’il y a un consensus, simplement ils pensent que les résultats des études sont contaminés par des conflits intérêts. S’il s’agit bien de cela, alors réaffirmer l’autorité de l’expert n’est pas la solution, c’est peut-être même contre-productif. Il s’agirait plutôt par exemple d’expliquer et/ou de renforcer l’indépendance des scientifiques menant ces études.</p>
<p><strong>Le nucléaire</strong></p>
<p>J’en viens maintenant aux points plus problématiques. Je commence par le nucléaire, qui est le plus simple à expliquer. La tribune rappelle justement que le nucléaire produit peu de CO2. C’est en effet un consensus scientifique. Pourquoi choisir de mettre en avant celui-ci ? Sans doute la tribune fait-elle implicitement référence aux sondages montrant qu’une partie importante de la population croit le contraire, ce qui est en effet inquiétant. Mais est-ce le fait des médias ? A ma connaissance, ce n’est pas le cas. Le Point rapporte un sondage récent en ces termes : « Selon un sondage BVA, une large majorité de Français pense que le nucléaire contribue à l'émission de gaz à effet de serre. Sa part est pourtant minime ». Au passage, le journal a déformé les résultats du sondage, comme expliqué <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/c64ss6/r%C3%A9chauffement_les_fran%C3%A7ais_naccusent_pas_le/">ici</a>. En lisant ce <a href="https://staticswww.bva-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Les-Fran%C3%A7ais-et-le-nucl%C3%A9aire-Un-sondage-BVA-pour-Orano-1.pdf">sondage</a>, on apprend (p6) que les deux principaux reproches faits au nucléaire sont, non la production de CO2, mais la production de déchets et le risque d’accident. Ces deux autres faits consensuels ne sont cependant pas repris par le journal. Pourquoi alors se plaindre spécifiquement que les médias omettraient d’insister sur la faible empreinte carbone du nucléaire ?</p>
<p>J’en viens à la deuxième partie du point (6), le nucléaire « peut contribuer à la lutte contre le changement climatique ». On n’est plus ici du tout dans le consensus scientifique, mais dans le choix politique, qui doit faire intervenir toute la complexité du sujet, qui a été justement « laissée en rayon ». Si l’on considère que le risque d’accident nucléaire, ou de dissémination, est inacceptable, alors non le nucléaire ne peut pas contribuer à la lutte contre le changement climatique. Oui mais est-ce que le nucléaire « peut », en tant qu’option envisageable à pondérer avec ses risques, contribuer à cette lutte ? Il ne me semble pas que ce soit une question évidente non plus, pour lequel il y aurait un consensus scientifique. L’uranium est une ressource non renouvelable. Les <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/global-uranium-supply-ensured-long-term-new-report-shows">estimations optimistes</a>  (agence internationale de l’énergie atomique) considèrent que les réserves couvrent 100 ans de consommation actuelle. Une <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713004579">estimation plus récente</a> (voir le <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.3617.pdf">preprint ici</a>), moins optimiste, considère que les réserves ne peuvent pas en réalité être exploitées en totalité et que des problèmes d’approvisionnement commenceront à se poser dès 10 à 20 ans. Je ne suis pas en mesure d’arbitrer entre ces estimations (qui ne me semblent d’ailleurs pas forcément contradictoires), mais on peut simplement faire remarquer que si l’enjeu est de remplacer les énergies fossiles, par exemple en basculant l’automobile sur le réseau électrique, alors il n’est pas du tout évident que le nucléaire puisse y faire face. Les 10 à 100 ans de réserves d’uranium correspondent à la consommation actuelle, qui représente environ 5% de l’énergie consommée, et donc il n’est pas évident que cette part puisse réellement devenir plus significative. Il y a d’autres technologies nucléaires qui pourraient permettre de résoudre ce problème d’approvisionnement, mais pour cela il faudrait les mettre au point et les implémenter, ce qui prend du temps. Il faut aussi, pour être juste, comparer le nucléaire aux alternatives, comme par exemple le photovoltaïque, qui pose aussi un problème de ressources rares. Le nucléaire peut-il contribuer à la lutte contre le changement climatique ? Franchement, je ne sais pas : c’est un sujet complexe et à ma connaissance il n’y a pas de consensus. Affirmer que c’est un consensus scientifique est donc au mieux fallacieux (le consensus c’est qu’on peut y réfléchir, ce qui ne veut rien dire), au pire faux.</p>
<p><strong>Le glyphosate</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>La tribune propose également deux « consensus scientifiques » sur des sujets complexes et multifactoriels, que sont les pesticides et les OGMs. Je ne suis expert ni du glyphosate, ni des OGMs, mais cela ne semble pas non plus être le cas de la quasi-totalité des signataires. Personnellement, j’aurais un peu plus d’humilité sur ces sujets. Je fais donc quelques remarques en tant que scientifique non expert mais néanmoins capable de saisir quelques subtilités méthodologiques.</p>
<p>Concernant le glyphosate, la formulation de la tribune est extrêmement fallacieuse : « Aux expositions professionnelles et alimentaires courantes », le glyphosate ne présente probablement pas de risque cancérigène pour l’homme. Par cette formulation, on pourrait croire qu’on parle ici d’études épidémiologiques sur des expositions réelles. Or ce n’est pas le cas, l’une des raisons étant que c’est méthodologiquement difficile, étant donné que tout le monde est exposé à des pesticides divers sans en connaître la quantité ni la formulation. Ce à quoi fait référence la tribune, ce sont des tests en laboratoire de toxicité de la molécule glyphosate, et non des formulations effectivement commercialisées, aux doses correspondant aux doses présumées dans des « expositions professionnelles et alimentaires courantes ». Cette nuance est bien rapportée dans le <a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/corporate_publications/files/efsaexplainsglyphosate151112fr.pdf">document de l’autorité européenne de sécurité des aliments</a> cité par la tribune, dans une section justement intitulée « Pourquoi certains scientifiques disent-ils que le glyphosate est cancérogène? ». Peut-on, au vu de ce titre, parler de consensus scientifique ? On y apprend notamment que « certaines formulations contenant notamment du glyphosate présentent une toxicité plus élevée que celle présentée par l'ingrédient actif, probablement en raison de la présence de coformulants » - soulignons que cela ne veut pas dire nécessairement que c’est le coformulant qui est toxique (interprétation réductionniste), mais possiblement qu’il amplifie ou agit en combinaison avec la substance active. Or si l’on s’intéresse effectivement aux « expositions professionnelles et alimentaires courantes » comme le fait la tribune, c’est bien aux formulations commerciales qu’il faut s’intéresser. Le <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/SUBCHIM2015sa0093.pdf">rapport récent de l’agence française</a> ANSES conclut de même : « le niveau de preuve de la génotoxicité du glyphosate chez l’animal peut être considéré comme relativement limité, en revanche des éléments complémentaires devront être fournis en ce qui concerne les préparations contenant du glyphosate », et elle propose que « la classification en catégorie 2 [Substances suspectées d'être cancérogènes pour l'homme] peut se discuter ». Ce n’est certainement pas ce que laisse penser la tribune, par l’usage du mot « improbable ».</p>
<p>Il est intéressant de contraster ce point et celui sur l’homéopathie. Dans ce dernier cas, il n’y a aucune preuve de l’efficacité de l’homéopathie. Concernant le glyphosate, on n’a pas les éléments pour conclure de manière claire à sa toxicité. Mais on parle ici de deux affirmations tout à fait différentes. Dans le cas de l’homéopathie, on a effectué les tests nécessaires, ceux-ci auraient dû démontrer l’effet de l’homéopathie s’il existait, or aucun effet n’a été mesuré. Dans le cas des pesticides, on est face à une question qui est méthodologiquement beaucoup plus difficile. Ce n’est pas que l’effet des pesticides est tellement faible qu’il est indétectable. Comme le rappelle une <a href="https://presse.inserm.fr/pesticides-effets-sur-la-sante-une-expertise-collective-de-linserm/8463/">expertise récente de l’INSERM</a>, « Les experts rappellent que «ne pas être en mesure de conclure ne veut pas dire obligatoirement qu’il n’y a pas de risque». Ce n’est pas ce que j’appellerai un consensus scientifique sur l’absence de risque.</p>
<p>Sans doute, des résultats d’études en laboratoire du glyphosate (notamment sur des animaux, avec des doses non comparables) ont été mal relayées par les médias. Je suppose que c’est ce qui a motivé les auteurs de cette tribune. Mais que la preuve soit fausse n’implique pas que le théorème est faux. Sur la toxicité des pesticides tels qu’ils sont utilisés commercialement, il est abusif de prétendre qu’il y a un consensus scientifique net, et cela est admis par les instances règlementaires comme l’EFSA (« Pourquoi certains scientifiques disent-ils que le glyphosate est cancérogène ? »).</p>
<p>On aurait pu en revanche parler d’autres aspects plus consensuels comme le risque pour la biodiversité, mais cet aspect a été « laissé en rayon ».</p>
<p><strong>Les OGMs</strong></p>
<p>Je termine sur les OGMs. On apprend dans cette tribune qu’un OGM « ne présente pas en soi de risque pour la santé ». Voici une assertion assez étrange. Un OGM est un organisme dont on a modifié le génome, et qui donc n’existe pas à l’état naturel. Les conséquences de cette modification sont donc peut-être anodines, ou peut-être pas. Il n’est pas évident a priori d’anticiper les conséquences pour l’organisme, sa descendance éventuelle et davantage encore pour l’écosystème. Qu’est-ce que les auteurs ont-ils bien voulu dire par « ne présente pas en soi de risque » ? La position par défaut devrait au contraire être la méfiance, et non pas : a priori pas de problème.</p>
<p>Peut-être – je spécule – les auteurs pensaient-ils : il y a bien des mutations naturelles du génome chez les animaux, d’élevage par exemple, que l’on sélectionne, et pourtant on ne s’inquiète pas des dangers potentiels de ces mutations. Changer le génome artificiellement ou spontanément, c’est pareil. Non, ce n’est pas pareil. Les mutations naturelles sont généralement (je simplifie) introduites graduellement, progressivement sélectionnées, n’affectent pas tous les gènes de manière égale et indépendante. Insérer le gène d’une méduse fluorescente dans un lapin, ça ne se produit pas spontanément. Cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que le lapin sera toxique, mais enfin on ne peut pas dire que ce soit comparable à sélectionner les vaches qui donnent le plus de lait.</p>
<p>On aurait pu dire, sans doute, qu’à l’heure actuelle on n’a pas détecté d’effet toxique des OGMs alimentaires mis sur le marché. Mais l’idée qu’un OGM « ne présente pas en soi de risque pour la santé » n’est pas un consensus scientifique dans la mesure où cette phrase ne veut rien dire. Encore une fois, il y a un choix éditorial qui a été fait ici, d’un « consensus scientifique » qui n’en est pas un, et ce choix n’est pas neutre. On aurait aussi bien pu dire : un OGM n’est pas en soi inoffensif, ce qui aurait donné une toute autre coloration à la tribune. Ici, le choix va clairement dans le sens de « il faut faire confiance au progrès technique ».</p>
<p>Le grand public n’est pas confronté à des OGMs « en soi » (qu’est-ce que c’est ?), mais à des OGMs produits dans un certain contexte socio-économique, à savoir par des multinationales, ce qui contribue (non sans raison) à la méfiance. On ne peut pas balayer d’un revers de main la question du conflit d’intérêt lorsque les tests de toxicité sont effectués ou financés par les principaux intéressés. Par ailleurs, dès lors que l’on prend en compte le contexte socioéconomique et politique dans lequel les innovations techniques se déploient, on doit nécessairement envisager ces innovations au-delà de leur aspect purement technique. Les OGMs posent par exemple le problème de la brevetabilité du vivant.</p>
<p>La tribune reconnait presque ce point : « la science n’a pas réponse à tout ». Malheureusement, il semble que ce que les auteurs voulaient dire, c’est : « la science n’a pas <em>encore</em> réponse à tout », puisqu’ils argument ainsi : « Il existe des questions qui n’ont pas conduit à un consensus clair, voire qui restent sans réponse. ». Surtout, il existe des questions qui ne sont tout simplement pas de nature scientifique – ou alors scientifiques au sens très large, incluant l’ensemble des sciences sociales, et encore, il faudrait inclure la philosophie.</p>
<p><strong>Quelques remarques finales</strong></p>
<p>Comme je l’ai écrit dans l’introduction, je pense que les auteurs de cette tribune sont sincères (même si elle ne va pas manquer d’être récupérée). Je comprends leur exaspération et leur inquiétude vis-à-vis du traitement de l’information scientifique par les médias (j’y reviens ci-dessous). Néanmoins, ils commettent à mon sens dans cette tribune certaines erreurs fondamentales, qui semblent relever d’un biais philosophique en faveur des vertus du « progrès » (comme en son temps Claude Allègre, qui considérait toute critique du progrès technique comme obscurantiste). La première erreur, que j’ai essayé de commenter en détails, est que certaines questions très complexes et multifactorielles sont présentées abusivement comme consensuelles, à savoir les OGMs, le nucléaire et les pesticides. Je ne suis personnellement pas opposé à ces trois choses par principe, néanmoins il me semble qu’elles posent de sérieux problèmes qui doivent être débattus démocratiquement, et non par simple arbitrage technique. On me répondra peut-être que pour cela, il est nécessaire de disposer d’une information scientifique fiable. Absolument, et c’est pourquoi sélectionner dans cette information uniquement les bienfaits ou absences de risque et les présenter abusivement comme des consensus scientifiques ne fait qu’introduire de la confusion.</p>
<p>Cela jette malheureusement le doute sur les autres points (homéopathie, vaccins, climat) qui sont présentés sur le même plan. J’en viens donc à la seconde erreur, erreur stratégique ou peut-être erreur de diagnostic. Posons-nous la question : pourquoi les gens croient-ils des choses fausses ? Est-ce parce que les médias relaient ces choses fausses ? Il se trouve que beaucoup de gens (en gros, la moitié) <a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/Medias/la-confiance-dans-les-medias-chute-fortement-9-choses-a-retenir-du-barometre-annuel-de-la-croix-3844082">ne font pas confiance aux média</a>. Dans ce contexte, donner aux médias la responsabilité d’apporter la bonne parole (car il est en effet question dans cette tribune d’autorité scientifique plus que de méthode scientifique) semble discutable. On apprend notamment que la majorité des gens pensent que les journalistes ne sont pas indépendants. Cela semble en effet assez factuel : la quasi-totalité des médias appartiennent à de très grands groupes ou à de puissants hommes d’affaires, et sont financés par la publicité. La confiance en la parole politique est au plus bas. Cette méfiance n’est pas illégitime non plus. Il y a donc un contexte de méfiance généralisée de la parole institutionnelle. Dans ce contexte, il n’est pas clair que relayer plus explicitement la parole officielle scientifique va porter les fruits espérés.</p>
<p>Pourquoi les gens croient-ils dans des théories conspirationnistes, voire des « fake news » ? Les réponses habituellement avancées sont généralement sur le mode de la condescendance (les gens sont mal éduqués), sur fond de réseaux sociaux. Il y a pourtant une possibilité évidente qu’il faudrait prendre au sérieux : parce que les conspirations, ça existe et tout le monde le sait. Oui, une grande entreprise d’automobile peut délibérément <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Volkswagen">truquer les tests règlementaires</a> pour pouvoir écouler ses voitures polluantes. Oui, une grande entreprise agroalimentaire peut <a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/monsanto-a-fiche-politiques-et-journalistes-selon-leur-position-sur-les-pesticides-3897729">ficher des journalistes</a> et hommes politiques considérés comme néfastes à ses intérêts. La méfiance n’est pas illégitime.</p>
<p>Il est certain que présenter comme consensus scientifiques des choses qui pour moitié ne le sont pas ne va pas aider à rétablir la confiance. D’ailleurs, faut-il rétablir la confiance ou plutôt créer les conditions de la confiance ? Pour ce qui est des scientifiques, le statut de fonctionnaire contribue à garantir l’indépendance par rapport au pouvoir, et il est inquiétant que celui-ci soit remis en cause ; de même l’intensification de la mise en compétition des chercheurs sur des appels d’offre est inquiétante. Pour ce qui est des journalistes, premièrement il faudrait qu’il y en ait. Le journalisme traverse une crise existentielle, et dans ces conditions il semble illusoire de demander aux journalistes (lesquels ?) de mieux faire leur travail. Dans la plupart des médias, le traitement de la science consiste à rapporter des communiqués de presse d’universités ou d’organismes de recherche (quand ce n’est pas simplement relayer d’autres médias sans vérifier), or ceux-ci portent sur des études ponctuelles et non un savoir consolidé (précisément ce qui manque à cette tribune). Ces communiqués, de plus en plus, font dans le sensationnalisme sous la pression politique, qui tend à transformer les universités en marques. Pour améliorer cela du côté des médias, il faudrait un réel travail de journalisme, ce qui suppose des journalistes, notamment scientifiques, pas si évident dans le contexte actuel (quelques médias, rares, le font). Deuxièmement il faudrait idéalement renforcer l’indépendance des journalistes, ce qui n’est pas évident non plus dans le modèle économique actuel. Le problème de l’information scientifique du grand public est un problème lui aussi complexe qui ne peut s’envisager en faisant abstraction du système économique et politique dans lequel la production et la diffusion des connaissances s’inscrivent. C'est, plus largement, un problème de démocratie. C’est peut-être à cela qu’il faut réfléchir.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/07/18/technical-considerations-for-arxiv-compliance-with-plan-s/">Technical Considerations for arXiv Compliance with Plan S</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>By Erick Peirson, arXiv Lead System Architect</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We acknowledge the importance of <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, and are committed to continue to monitor the developments and assess how we can best support our users in compliance with open access mandates. However, at this time arXiv is not compliant with many of the recommended requirements, as well as some of the mandatory requirements. We currently do not have a timeline for adding the required features yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post summarizes my best understanding of the technical considerations surrounding arXiv compliance with Plan S, based on the revised Principles and Implementation guidance document (</span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). This is adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/undercaffeinatd/status/1134435870847750145">my Twitter thread on 31 May, 2019</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background</span></h1>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/02/04/arxivs-feedback-on-the-guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/">arXiv’s official response to the first draft guidance for Plan S</a> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">Current implementation guidance from cOAlitionS</a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/rationale-for-the-revisions/">Rationale for revisions to Plan S guidance from <span style="font-weight: 400;">cOAlitionS</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is encouraging to see cOAlitionS committing to working with domain experts like <a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a>, <a href="http://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/">DOAR</a>, and others on compliance. A shortcoming of the first draft was that it appeared to lack the kind of nuance and practical considerations that come from domain knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upshot, from my perspective:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This draft is a big improvement on the first draft of the Plan S guidance; far clearer, and far more achievable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is nearly compliant with </span><b>mandatory requirements already</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we can use help from partners, funders, and developers to close the gap.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is not compliant with many of the <strong>r</strong></span><b>ecommended requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; we can use help to make progress in these areas, as well.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-450"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remainder of this post focuses on <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">Part III Section 2.1 (Requirements for Open Access repositories)</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandatory criteria</span></h2>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The repository must be registered in the Directory of Open Access Repositories.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv is currently listed in DOAR: </span><a href="http://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/repository/18"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/repository/18</span></a></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Use of PIDs for the deposited versions of the publications (with versioning, for example in case of revisions), such as DOI (preferable), URN, or Handle.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv has a robust URN scheme widely adopted for citation purposes: </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier</span></a></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“High quality article level metadata in standard interoperable non-proprietary format, under a CC0 public domain dedication.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
As described in our API Terms of Use, arXiv metadata are made available for re-use under CC0: </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou</span></a></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Metadata] must include information on the DOI  (or other PID) both of the original publication and the deposited version, on the version deposited (AAM/VoR), and on the Open Access status and the license…”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arXiv makes distribution license information available on the abstract page for each e-print, and in metadata retrieved programmatically via our APIs.</span></p>
<p><b>X</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Metadata must include complete and reliable information on funding provided by cOAlitionS funders.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arXiv currently lacks a facility for tracking funding information in reliable and maintainable fashion. We invite external organizations and individuals to help us to develop the tools to do this; please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Continuous availability (uptime at least 99.7%, not taking into account scheduled downtime for maintenance or upgrades).”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv’s availability exceeds 99.9%, so this is not an issue for us. However, I find it peculiar that cOAlitionS got this far down into the weeds.</span></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helpdesk: as a minimum an email address (functional mailbox) has to be provided.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv has dedicated full-time staff to support users, reachable via </span><a href="mailto:help@arxiv.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help@arxiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. See </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/contact"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/help/contact</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>?</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helpdesk …a response time of no more than one business day must be ensured.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
We’re back to the ambiguity of earlier drafts. 100% of cases? While same-day responses are the norm, arXiv will need funding for additional staff to guarantee 100% compliance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strongly recommended additional criteria</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is heartening to see an indication that #cOAlitionS recognizes that not all repos will have the resources to implement everything their hearts desire. This is a welcome improvement to the guidance.</span></p>
<p><b>X</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Manuscript submission system that supports both individual author uploads and bulk uploads of manuscripts (AAM or VoR) by publishers.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv needs funding and/or developer-power to support build-out of a robust, scalable submission API. We invite external organizations and individuals to help us to develop the tools to do this; please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>X</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Full text stored in a machine-readable community standard format such as JATS XML.”<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still a bit vague, but better than before. Makes it clear that machine-readable + non-proprietary are the salient points. Here is another area where arXiv needs help, preferably in the form of developer support. Please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>X</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Support for PID for authors (e.g., ORCID), funders, funding programmes and grants, institutions, and other relevant entities.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
We do support linking ORCIDs to arXiv user accounts for search purposes. See </span><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/05/16/orcid-doi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/05/16/orcid-doi/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  arXiv needs help from external contributors and funders to provide better support (including ORCIDs for users that aren’t “owners” of e-prints). Please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>X</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Openly accessible data on citations according to the standards by the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).”<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This falls a bit outside the core arXiv mission, so is a lower priority. However, we have done foundational work on extracting references from arXiv e-prints, and external contributors could make a big impact on making these shareable and interoperable. Please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open API to allow others (including machines) to access the content.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv is a leader in adoption of OAI-PMH (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/oa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/help/oa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and is pushing forward on a modernized JSON API.</span></p>
<p><b>✓</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OpenAIRE compliance of the metadata.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
arXiv currently meets the “minimal participation requisites,” but OpenAIRE has provided additional guidance concerning improvements to arXiv metadata. External contributors could help with this. Please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>?</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quality assurance processes to link full-text deposits with authoritative bibliographic metadata from third party systems, e.g., PubMed, CrossrefOrg, or Scopus where feasible.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
We do currently harvest DOIs and journal reference information from publisher feeds, and use that information to update the corresponding records in e-print metadata. However, this system does not work very well, and won’t scale. This is another area where external contributors could have a big impact. Please see our </span><a href="https://github.com/orgs/arXiv/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community projects list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p>
<p>A: I was trained as a chemist but grew up programming, so bioinformatics was an obvious match for me. I started in the group of Søren Brunak, where I did my training including Ph.D. and then spent six years at EMBL in the group of Peer Bork before starting my own group at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research in 2009.</p>
<p>Q: How many years have you been an editor on PLOS CB?</p>
<p>A: I’ve been associate editor on PLOS CB for 11 years.</p>
<p>Q: Why is PLOS CB important to you and the community</p>
<p>A: PLOS CB plays an important role in bridging the gap between the more algorithm-focused bioinformatics journals and the traditional biological journals, which rarely publish studies that do not have a wet-lab component.</p>
<p>Q: What is your area of study and why is it important?</p>
<p>A: My group has a strong focus on tool development, primarily related to biological networks and biomedical text mining. Network representations of the current biological knowledge and available data, including what is buried in the literature, is increasingly important for interpreting new omics data.</p>
<p>Q: What first drew you into the field?</p>
<p>A: With an interest in molecular biology and many years of programming experience, it was really a no-brainer to go into bioinformatics back when the first fully sequenced genomes became available.</p>
<p>Q: What are you most looking forward to while attending ISMB?</p>
<p>A: The most interesting sessions to me are the NetBio COSI and special session on text mining, which I am involved in organizing. Besides that, the poster sessions are always a highlight for me.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any trends in your field right now?</p>
<p>A: Deep learning is obviously a major trend in text mining. Other than that, the move towards open licenses on databases and tools continues to be strong.</p>
<p>Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?</p>
<p>A: In my experience sharing the tools we make already before publishing them is highly advantageous. If you already have a user base before submitting a manuscript, it only becomes easier to publish your work. Editors can see that it is worthwhile publishing, most bugs will have been sorted out before peer review, and the publication is more likely to get cited as soon as it comes out.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, the nature of romantic relationships usually changes over time. An early period of intense attraction tends to develop into a less fiery, deeper attachment bond. According to evolutionary arguments, the early stage, which typically lasts a few years, gives the pair the time and proximity that’s required for developing a deeper nurturing, supportive – and predictable – relationship. While this type of attachment is important for rearing children, and for ongoing wellbeing, it’s not necessarily great news for passion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Though passion can still be experienced in the later stages, it tends to decline, on average,” note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21952-001">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychology</em>. They go on, however, to report that there is a group of people who experience higher sustained levels of both supportive warmth and nurturance <i>and</i> eroticism than is typical in relationships – only, they don’t get both from the same partner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37549"></span></p>
<p>Rhonda Balzarini at York University, Canada and colleagues conducted the first empirical test of differences between eroticism and nurturance among participants who were in either a monogamous or a polyamorous relationship. Someone in a polyamorous relationship typically has a primary partner (they usually live with this person who is often their spouse and the co-parent of their children if they have any) and also, with the consent of that person, a secondary romantic partner. Relationships with secondary partners tend to last for at least a few years, allowing for some nurturance, as well as sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited their polyamorous participants – more than one thousand of them – from Facebook and Reddit groups dedicated to polyamory discussions. These individuals had been with their primary partner for an average of seven years, and with their secondary partner for two. They completed questionnaires that asked about levels of nurturance (to what extent they felt a strong sense of security, love, warmth, etc) and eroticism (including their felt levels of desire and lust, and sexual excitement) in each relationship, how close they felt to each partner, and also their levels of sexual satisfaction. The team also collected similar data on over two thousand monogamous people, who had been in an exclusive relationship for an average of 17 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers had predicted, the polyamorists enjoyed more nurturance from their primary than from their secondary, partners, on average, and gave higher eroticism ratings to their secondary relationships. Overall, their eroticism ratings were higher than for the monogamists. More surprisingly, their nurturance ratings for their primary relationship were higher than those reported by the monogamists. These differences held even when the researchers controlled for the differences in relationship length between the two groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There were also some differences in sexual satisfaction and closeness. Among the monogamous participants, eroticism and nurturance were both positively associated with sexual satisfaction and closeness. For the polyamorists, nurturance was similarly linked to feelings of closeness in both their relationships, but eroticism was only associated with sexual satisfaction and closeness in their secondary relationships,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“These findings have broad research implications for the study of romantic relationships,” the researchers write. “The belief that monogamy is superior to other relationship orientations is a fundamental and often unquestioned assumption underlying contemporary theories of the development of romantic relationships and intimacy.” And yet, they go on: “The findings suggest that polyamory may provide a unique opportunity for individuals to experience both eroticism and nurturance simultaneously.”</p>
<p>There are various caveats, however. An important one is that, when it comes to the nurturance data, someone who tolerates their partner having an ongoing relationship with somebody else is arguably likely to be a more supportive individual in the first place – and/or it’s likely that a deeper attachment is required for a primary partnership to be sustained during polyamory. The results can’t be seen to imply than any couple could decide to take on secondary partners and expect to enjoy the benefits reported by the polyamorists in this study.</p>
<p>Still, the research does highlight some possible benefits of being polyamorous, at least for some people. The researchers would now like to see work exploring whether relying on different partners to meet nurturance and erotic needs, rather than just one, could enhance life satisfaction and personal wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</center><p>We have been working on including the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> simulator in <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> for a
while now. The build process that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> uses has certain peculiarities that
make it a little harder to build.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in the technical details, while the main <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>
core is built using the standard <code>./configure; make ; make install</code>
process that cleanly differentiates the "build" and "install" phases, the
Python bits are built as a "post-install hook". That is to say, they are built
after the other bits in the "install" step instead of the "build" step. This
implies that the build is not quite straightforward and must be slightly
tweaked to ensure that the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/">Fedora packaging guidelines</a> are met.</p>
<p>After discussing things on this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/238">Github issue</a>, the developers,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nrnhines">@nrnhines</a> (Michael Hines) and <a class="reference external" href="https://ramcdougal.com/">@ramcdougal</a> (Robert A McDougal) helped me understand the
complexities of the build process and get it done. They have also mentioned
that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> is now moving to a <a class="reference external" href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> based build system and should be simpler
to work with in the future. <a class="reference external" href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> is generally nicer for projects that include
different languages and build systems.</p>
<p>After a few hours of work, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> is now ready to use in <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>. It is
built with Python 3, and does not currently provide IV and MPI bits. These will
be worked upon later. Since <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC">MUSIC</a> is not yet in <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> does not
support <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC">MUSIC</a> either currently. This is also a <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/28">work in progress</a>.</p>
<p>I have tested the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> build on my machine with a few example simulations
and it works well, but this cannot be considered exhaustive testing of the
package. If you have a <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> system, please test <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a> and let us know if
you notice any issues. Here's how.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-set-up-a-fedora-installation">
<h2>Step 1: Set up a Fedora installation</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is based on <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>, so the simplest way to use it is to install a
Fedora Workstation using the live images available on <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">https://getfedora.org</a>.
You can either install it on a system or use a virtual machine if you wish.
<a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> includes lots of other software for neuroscience also. You can
learn more in our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/software/">documentation</a>.  <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>, in
general, provides lots of other software too. You can search them using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/s/">Fedora Packages web application</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-install-neuron">
<h2>Step 2: Install NEURON</h2>
<p>I would recommend updating your system before proceeding using <code>dnf</code> in a
terminal:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">sudo dnf update --refresh
</pre>
<p>Then, you can install <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>. It is currently in the testing repositories, so
they will need to be enabled for the command:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">sudo dnf --enablerepo<span class="o">=</span>updates-testing install neuron python3-neuron
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-test-it-out">
<h2>Step 3: Test it out</h2>
<p>Test it out with your models. Hopefully, everything will work fine. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>
documentation is here for those that would like to tinker with it too:

</div>
</center><p>This step is optional, especially if everything works fine. If you experience
any issues, please do get in touch with us. You can either contact us directly
using one of our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/">communication channels</a>, or you
can <strong>give karma</strong> to the update on <a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org">Bodhi</a>. The latter is preferred.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org">Bodhi</a> is the system <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> uses for pushing updates to users. In a nutshell:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a new version of software is released</li>
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> maintainer updates the <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> package.</li>
<li>the maintainer submits the new <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> package to <a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org">Bodhi</a></li>
<li>the package remains in the <code>updates-testing</code> repositories while users
test it out and provide feedback.</li>
<li>if the update receives positive feedback (positive karma), it is
automatically pushed to the <code>updates</code> repository for all users to
receive the new version.</li>
<li>if the update receives negative feedback, the new version is not sent out to
users and the maintainer must fix the reported issues and submit a new
version of the package for testing again.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow applies to all <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> packages, thus ensuring that there's
plenty of time for issues to be flagged before the software reaches users.  So,
if you have a few minutes to spare, please help us by testing these packages
out. The updates for Fedora 29 and Fedora 30 are both here:

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Over the last half century Western European countries have enjoyed a large increase in gender equality. There is a long way to go, but some statistics are striking: for instance, in Germany the employment rate for women has increased from 48 per cent in 1980 to 73 per cent in 2014. Psychologists are interested in whether, and how, these kind of societal-level changes filter down and affect children’s conceptions of gender.</p>
<p>To find out, a team at the University of Münster and Osnabrück University, led by Bettina Lamm, has compared the way that young German children in 1977 drew a human figure with the way that age-matched German children in 2015 drew a figure. The results, published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0978-5">Sex Roles</a>, suggest two parallel changes: girls in 2015 more often chose to draw a female figure than girls in 1977; at the same time, the children tested in 2015 depicted female figures as more distinctly feminine than the children in the 1970s.</p>
<p>“Societal changes over the last four decades in West Germany have clearly generated two trends,” the researchers said. “… growing status equality between the genders on the one hand, and increasing gender differentiation, on the other.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37505"></span></p>
<p>There were 208 boys and girls in the sample from 1977 and 168 in the contemporary sample, with no significant age differences between the two – across both groups, the average age was 6-7 years, and just over 50 per cent were female. Both groups were recruited from comparable West German cities with “well-developed educational systems” and all children spoke German at home.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and in 2015 the children were tested in school. They were given a blank piece of paper and a pencil and the same instruction to “draw a picture of a person as well as you can” with no time limit. The researchers then coded all the drawings for whether they were male or female and how many gender stereotypical details they included, in terms of things like hairstyle, clothing and jewellery.</p>
<p>In 1977, the overwhelming majority of the children’s drawings were of men (70 per cent vs. 18 per cent female, with the gender of the remainder not identifiable), with just 34 per cent of the girls choosing to draw a human figure of their own gender. In 2015, this had changed dramatically – now overall more of the drawn figures were female (47 per cent) than male (40 per cent), with the remainder not clearly identifiable as one gender or the other, and 85 per cent of the girls chose to draw their own gender.</p>
<p>In terms of gender differentiation, the female figures drawn in 2015 were more overtly feminised in stereotypical fashion via their clothing and accessories than they were in 1977 (conversely there was a trend, statistically non-significant, for the male figures to appear less overtly masculinised – perhaps, the researchers speculated, because of the school context in which boys may have been reluctant to draw stereotypically masculine accessories such as guns, out of fear of disapproval due to male attributes becoming “less valued or socially accepted”).</p>
<p>Overall, Lamm and her colleagues said the parallel trends apparent in the drawings would appear to reflect on the one hand the rise in gender equality in German society (thus girls’ being happier to draw female figures thanks to their greater perception of enhanced female self-esteem), and on the other hand, girls drawing more distinctly feminine figures, due to the growing recognition and consensus in education and childcare more generally that “gender justice demands an awareness of dissimilarities between boys and girls without limiting opportunities for either gender.”</p>

It’s surprisingly hard to tell.</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/exerciseGeri-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Frailty: costs and prevention</strong></h3>
<p>There are increasing concerns regarding the pressure on UK and US healthcare systems associated with the rapidly increasing number of frail older adults. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/62/7/722/581897" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frailty</a> – identified by impaired mobility, loss of balance, muscle strength, and endurance – is associated with increased risk of hospital admission, increased duration of stay, and a need for home care. Unplanned hospital admissions, including of frail older adults, <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Reducing-emergency-admissions.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> the NHS &gt;£13 billion, and the US healthcare economy &gt;$1.1 trillion per year.</p>
<p>Physical activity, even minimal amounts, is associated with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01957.x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">numerous protective benefits</a> such as reducing the risk of developing diabetes, stroke, hip fractures, improving mental well-being and delaying physical deterioration in older adults. Evidence suggests that targeted interventions to improve balance and muscle strength can help reduce the <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007146.pub3/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risk of falls</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608603426?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hospital admission</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The goal of our review</strong></h3>
<p>The objective of <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1196-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our review</a> was to build on existing work by focusing exclusively on randomized controlled trials aimed at improving physical symptoms of frailty in older adults, in order to allow for greater ease of comparison across studies. In the review, we describe the active components of the interventions to try and identify what works well, for whom, and under what conditions. This might sound like a relatively straightforward task.</p>
<h3><strong>It was not easy</strong></h3>
<p>We repeatedly came up against methodological issues that compromised our ability to make more definite recommendations and conclusions.</p>
<p>First and foremost was the lack of consensus on the definition of frailty or how best to assess it. We found that participants who were pre-frail, frail, and non-frail were often put into the same group and the intervention success was decided on the group as a whole, rather than the sum of its parts. This means we cannot know with any certainty if the intervention worked as well for those who were severely frail versus those who were less so.</p>
<p>Second, behavior change theories have shown predictive and explanatory power for increasing physical activity, and have been used to develop maintenance plans for continued activity; however, there was little evidence that the interventions used in the studies we found were grounded on any formalized behavior change theory.</p>
<blockquote><p>The limitations we faced in this review are common problems across many long-term health population research fields.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, most studies were relatively brief in delivery and very few had longer-term follow-up to examine if behavior change was being maintained. Given the growing demand for service provision on the one hand and the budget cuts across health and social care in the UK on the other, interventions must be able to demonstrate benefits that prove to be cost effective in the long term. So while it appears that physical activity may prevent/reduce physical signs of frailty in the short term, it needs to be maintained and integrated into normal daily life for the benefits to be felt both by the individual and by the health and social care services.</p>
<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>It may surprise some to learn that the limitations we faced in this review are common problems across many long-term health population research fields. Increasingly, there have been growing calls for core measures to be introduced and implemented by healthcare professionals, researchers, and funders. This has proven successful in other conditions such as diabetes and some cancers, and could be helpful in frailty assessment as well.</p>
<p>Other action we can take is to ensure that the future interventions we design are fit for purpose, are grounded in theory, and can promise to deliver real long-term health benefits in terms of frailty prevention or symptom reduction.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>There’s a huge amount of research into how people differ in their ability to learn things deliberately and “explicitly”, such as memorising a list of words or instructions, for example. Far less studied is “implicit learning”. Ask a five-year-old to explain the grammatical rules of their language and they’ll likely have no clue where to start. And yet, they do know them – or at least, well enough to form coherent sentences. This kind of unconscious acquisition of abstract knowledge is an example of “implicit” learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Implicit learning may be especially important for young children, but adults depend on it, too. It “is recognised as a core system that underlies learning in multiple domains, including language, music and even learning about the statistical structure of our environments,” note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719301313?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new paper</a>, published in <i>Cognition</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37510"></span></p>
<p>It’s been assumed that, as an evolutionarily primitive strategy for learning, there’s probably little difference between people in implicit learning ability. But, given that this is such a core system, with wide-ranging implications for our functioning in everyday life, there’s been astoundingly little research into whether this is in fact the case, or into how stable it might be across different kinds of relevant task. The new study fills some of these gaps, with a series of striking findings that have implications for our understanding of intelligence, as well as for who might be best-matched to what type of job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Priya Kalra at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues gave 64 healthy young adults four types of tasks that required implicit learning. One involved detecting an artificial grammar (after studying a series of letter strings that all adhered to undisclosed grammatical rules, the participants had to judge which strings among a new set were “grammatical” and which were not.) The second task required them to learn whether a particular group of images was going to trigger one outcome, or another (and they were given feedback to help them to learn). For the third task, they had to predict where a circle was going to appear on a screen, based on prior experience, during which the circle sometimes appeared in a predictable sequence of positions and sometimes did not. Finally, they had to learn visual categories implicitly: with the help of feedback, they had to classify abstract visual stimuli into one of two categories. (Explicit learning could have fed into some of these tasks, but the researchers made efforts to investigate, and take into account, its contribution for each individual.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One week later, the participants returned to complete different versions of all these tasks, as well as tests of working memory, explicit learning (they had to deliberately learn a list of words) and IQ.</p>
<p>For three of the four implicit learning tasks, the researchers found a “medium” level relationship between a participant’s initial performance and how well they did a week later. This suggests stability in implicit learning ability. The exception was the artificial grammar task; the researchers think it’s possible that explicit learning “contaminated” implicit learning in this task at the second time-point.</p>
<p>The team also found that how good a participant was at implicit learning bore no relation to their IQ or working memory results. It seems, then, to be driven by independent neural processes to those that underpin explicit learning, which <i>is</i> linked to IQ.</p>
<p>This finding fits with earlier work that has tied explicit and implicit learning to different brain regions and networks. (The hippocampus is important for explicit but not implicit earning, for example, whereas damage to the basal ganglia and cerebellum impair implicit, but not explicit, learning.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new results have implications for theories that intelligence depends upon a single fundamental factor, such as processing speed, the researchers write. “These data … provide evidence for the existence of a completely uncorrelated cognitive ability,” they added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings also imply that someone might feasibly be smart, as measured by an IQ test, but poorer at implicit learning than someone else with a significantly lower IQ score. For some real-world tasks, such as identifying only barely discernible hints of a tumour in a medical scan, a strength at implicit learning could be a big advantage, the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their findings also prompt a host of other important questions: Will the findings from this study also show up across a wider variety of tasks, and over longer time gaps between testing? Can implicit learning mechanisms be trained? How might explicit learning help or hinder implicit learning and subsequent performance? Earlier work led by Amy Finn, the senior author of this new study, has certainly suggested that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101806">a focus on explicit learning processes can “get in the way” of implicit learning</a>. It’ll be fascinating to see the results of follow-up research in this field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The device showed that harbor seals routinely reduced blood flow to their blubber, thereby slowing oxygen consumption, around 15 seconds before diving into water. This indicates the seals have conscious control over their dive reflex (previously thought to be a purely automatic response). </span></p>

The authors compared the flight characteristics of solo and paired pigeons making a 7km flight, and found that paired individuals had improved homing accuracy (which reduced the flight distance and time); the cost of this accuracy was an increase in speed and wingbeat frequency compared to solo fliers. The fact that pigeons are willing to pay this energetic premium underscores the importance of flocking together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Lucy Taylor adds: “The results of this study were completely unexpected. Energy is the currency of life so it’s astonishing that the birds are prepared to pay a substantial energetic cost to fly together.”</span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>When responding to science denialism (or, for that matter, any sort of false or harmful information), such as claims that vaccines are ineffective and harmful, it can be difficult to establish the right strategy. Because of the fast-paced way in which information spreads these days, there is a risk that responding to a given inaccurate claim can give it further oxygen, leading the falsehood to reach more people who are vulnerable to being misled, and so forth. There’s also the possibility of the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/">backfire effect</a>” – people who already endorse the false claims reacting to the debunking information by digging into their beliefs <i>further</i> (though there’s now <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/maybe-theres-some-hope-for-fact-checking-after-all.html">evidence</a> such fears were overhyped, and that the backfire effect may not be a regular occurrence overall).</p>
<p>To better understand when science-denialism debunking does and doesn’t work, Philipp Schmid and Cornelia Betsch, both of the University of Erfurt in Germany, ran a series of studies that involved online respondents being exposed to various sorts of science debates. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">results</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>, offer some useful insights about how to best stem the tide of science denialism.</p>
<p><span id="more-37496"></span></p>
<p>As the authors explain, there are two primary tactics used to rebut science denialism (and to argue in general): “An advocate can aim to overwhelm the opposing position by providing support only for her own view or she can aim to refute the opposing position by attacking its plausibility and explaining why it is wrong.” This is called a topic rebuttal. The other tactic is known as a technique rebuttal: The debunker can highlight the common techniques used by science deniers and show how a given argument fits in. For example, the claim that vaccines aren’t 100 per cent safe reflects a so-called “impossible expectation”, since no medical procedure is 100 per cent safe.</p>
<p>This chart from the study nicely lays out the differences between topic and technique rebuttals, with some examples:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_37497" style="width: 1936px;"><img alt="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.10.24.png" class=" size-full wp-image-37497 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="37497" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.10.24" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png" data-orig-size="1936,1034" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/07/10/researchers-conducted-six-studies-to-investigate-how-best-to-challenge-science-deniers/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11-10-24/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.10.24.png?w=845" />via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">Schmid &amp; Betsch, 2019</a></figure>
<p>The researchers ran six online experiments on almost 1,200 participants dealing with vaccines and climate change, in which they gauged success based on participants’ behavioural intentions and attitudes (either getting vaccinated or taking action to fight climate change, depending on the study, and attitudes towards those activities) before and after listening to, or reading a debate with, a science denier. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions where a science advocate was or wasn’t present to respond to the misinformation, and where the advocate used topic rebuttals, technique rebuttals, or both.</p>
<p>This figure runs down some of the key results:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_37498" style="width: 1420px;"><img alt="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.12.00.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37498" data-attachment-id="37498" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2019-07-10 at 11.12.00" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png" data-orig-size="1420,1124" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/07/10/researchers-conducted-six-studies-to-investigate-how-best-to-challenge-science-deniers/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11-12-00/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screenshot-2019-07-10-at-11.12.00.png?w=845" />via <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4">Schmid &amp; Betsch, 2019</a></figure>
<p>Most importantly, “The results show that public discussions with a science denier have a damaging effect on the audience, as revealed by negative changes in attitudes and intentions [toward vaccination/ tackling climate change].” This negative effect was still present, though it was mitigated, even when a debunking advocate was absent. The researchers’ advice based on this rather disheartening outcome was that “advocates who take part in debates should not expect too much for their efforts — but that it’s still important to at least rebut science denialists when they show up or write in public forums.</p>
<p>Topic and technique rebuttals had the same mitigating effect and there was no evidence that using a combination of the two provided any additive benefit. On a positive note, the researchers found no significant evidence of a backfire effect in this context.</p>
<p>There are some important caveats here: This is an online study that didn’t track real-world behaviour, but rather self-reported attitudes and behavioural <i>intent</i>. As the authors themselves note, longitudinal studies looking at actual behaviour would be useful. But society is early on in understanding, in a scientific way, how persuasion works in this sort of context, and an investigation like this provides some firm early building blocks. Perhaps most importantly, it provides solid evidence that, from the point of view of concerned science advocates, if the choice is to show up to a debate with a science denialist or stay home, showing up is likely the better course of action – the only exception being if the advocate has the power to prevent the debate from occurring at all by abstaining.</p>
<p>But overall, people should temper their expectations about the efficacy of this sort of debunking: the authors argue that “facing deniers in public debates can be only one building block in the concerted effort to fight misinformation. Other recent approaches try to fight misinformation by pre-emptively providing laypeople with the ability to identify false information themselves.” At the risk of slipping into cliches about teaching a man to fish, it does feel like early, robust education on critical thinking and evaluating evidence could be more effective than trying to dislodge false beliefs one by one later on in life.</p>

<p>A newborn baby knows almost nothing about the world it comes into. To make sense of the onslaught of incoming sensory information, she or he must start to notice meaningful patterns and categorise them: that particular combination of visual data signifies a “face”, for example, while that noise is a “voice”. As the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12877">new paper</a> in <i>Developmental Science</i> point out, “without this fundamental categorisation function, our nervous systems would be overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of our experience.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It had been thought that infants form these categories using information from just one sense, whichever is the most relevant. Following this account, the category of “faces” results from an accumulation of visual information about what faces <i>look</i> like. However, an intriguing new study, involving four-month-old infants and their mothers’ smelly t-shirts, suggests that babies’ early acquisition of the faces category is a truly multi-sensory process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37483"></span></p>
<p>Arnaud Leleu at the University of Burgundy, France, led the research involving 18 baby girls and boys aged four months. Before the testing started, the babies’ mothers wore the same T-shirt for three nights in a row, keeping it in a hermetically sealed bag at all other times. They and their infants were then taken into a quiet, odour-free lab space where the babies were shown a series of images. Some were of faces against natural backgrounds, while the majority featured animals, plants and manufactured objects. Each image was presented for only 167 milliseconds (less than a quarter of a second), meaning that perception had to happen at a glance.</p>
<p>Some of the time, the babies had their mother’s odorous T-shirt placed on their upper chest. (The T-shirt was folded so that the maximally-smelly underarm, breast and neck regions were closest to their nostrils.) Other times, they had a clean, unworn T-shirt placed near their noses. Throughout the experiment, the researchers used EEG (electroencephalography, which measures electrical activity via electrodes on the scalp) to monitor how the babies’ brains responded to the images.</p>
<p>The results were clear: the babies’ face-related brain activity in response to the images of faces was significantly greater when they could smell their mother’s well-used T-shirt at the same time, compared with when their mother’s odour was not present – suggesting that the odours strengthened their recognition of faces. The results provide strong support for the idea that multi-sensory, rather than single-sense, inputs drive our acquisition of categories, the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Some earlier research findings lend support to this idea, in relation to faces, at least. Whenever you look at a face, neurons in a region of the visual cortex called the fusiform gyrus respond with a burst of activity (leading researchers to label this the “fusiform face area”). However, in 2009 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005987">a study</a> showed that the smell of body odour, without any visual input, can also trigger activity in the fusiform gyrus. A region that had traditionally been thought to be responsive only to visual data is clearly receptive to other sensory signals when they indicate that a face is likely to be in the visual scene.</p>
<p>It makes sense that babies use odours to help them to spot faces, the researchers add. Odours are less fleeting than many visual stimuli, and of course body odours tend to co-occur with the appearance of a face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new work prompts many questions. Do babies rely more on smell than adults in their rapid recognition of faces? Does it matter to babies if the odour is their mother’s, or could it be someone else’s? (Only maternal odour was used in this study.) Which constituents of the body odour are most important for the effect? Do babies use smell to help them to form other “visual” categories? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also make this important point about the way that infant research is usually conducted: “Given that much evidence about visual categorization in infancy, and about virtually every neurocognitive process, has been obtained through testing infants seated on their parents’ lap, future studies should examine whether and how such parental sensory context, including body odour, mediates infants’ processing abilities.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Conference-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h4>One major event in the world calendar of rheumatology</h4>
<p>Scientists, patients, rheumatologists and other health professionals met at the IFEMA Centre to discuss recent advances in research and care in the diagnosis and treatment of RMDs. Sunny Madrid is a popular destination for rheumatologists having hosted EULAR on three out of the last seven editions of the conference. Despite the routine focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other topics have shone in recent years, including co-morbidities, patient engagement, and digitalisation in diagnostics and care.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11113" style="width: 257px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11113" height="329" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-returns-to-Madrid-225x300.jpg" width="247" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR returns to Madrid</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<h4>Memorable talks attended</h4>
<p>Checkpoint inhibitors, compounds that improve survival in multiple cancers, concurrently increase numbers of adverse immune events. These <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/76/10/1747" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">include incidences of rheumatoid arthritis</a> as soon as one month after the start of treatment. <a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/david-stephen-pisetsky-md-phd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Pisetsky</a> and <a href="http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Medizinische-Klinik-und-Poliklinik-IV/de/Ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/oberaerzte/Schulze-Koops_Hendrik/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Henrik Schulze-Koops</a> discussed the impact of these medications on B and T immune cells, respectively. Both debated whether these treatments might be uncovering latent forms of rheumatism in patients through modulation of various immune subtypes. Beth Helmink followed up by explaining the importance of the microbiome in mediating checkpoint treatment, as exemplified by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0238-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faecal transplants in immuno-deficient mice significantly boosting cancer treatment success</a>.</p>
<p>Comorbidities with RMDs were once again at the center of attention at this year’s EULAR. Despite increased awareness of comorbidities amongst rheumatologists, some reported to me that a lack of communication between specialist clinicians and scarcity of resources prevent adequate treatment of multiple conditions. This critical issue was covered in <em>BMC Rheumatology’s </em>recently published Thematic Series “<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Comorbidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comorbidities in rheumatic diseases – from clinical to translational approaches</a>”.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11115" style="width: 381px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11115" height="247" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-village-300x200.jpg" width="371" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR village for exhibitions and posters.(Courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/EULAR_Press" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EULAR Press Office</a>)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>One impressive example of these comorbidities was reported by <a href="https://www.univaq.it/rubrica.php?id=395&amp;perstecnamm=on" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Piero Ruscitti</a> whose team found that remission in patients with RA was associated with an 80% drop in the incidence of negative cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>“Cannabis for the joints?” is how <a href="http://www.iasp-pain.org/AboutIASP/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serge Perrot</a> concluded his benefit-risk analysis of treating arthritis with cannabinoids, thus generating a wave of smiles amongst delegates. Alongside <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/davidfinn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Finn</a> and <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/expertiseguide/life-sciences/dr-stephen-alexander.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Alexander</a>, they established a discussion on the history, science, and ethics of cannabis given the current grey-zone clinicians face. Current knowledge indicates that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that medical cannabis is a viable treatment for rheumatism, although use in pain, insomnia, and anxiety may be reasonably considered on a patient-by-patient basis.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging trends in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders</strong></p>
<p>Interactive poster tours were a new addition to EULAR 2019, whereby selected presenters were given three minutes to introduce their poster in front of a screen and 20+ delegates with some time afterwards for questions. I attended as many as I could, and I was particularly impressed by the advances in musculoskeletal imaging methods. Chaired by <a href="http://www.haematologie-onkologie-bonn.de/doctor/dr-med-mudr-valentin-schaefer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Valentin Schafer</a> and <a href="https://www.rheumazentrum-ruhrgebiet.de/home/wir/ansprechpartner.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xenofon Baraliakos</a>, advancements in technologies such as machine learning and algorithms to better diagnose rheumatic conditions were well explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11116" style="width: 372px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11116" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Presenter-300x224.jpg" width="362" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A presenter uses the new interactive poster format to illustrate their work for an on-looking crowd</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It is in this context that both <a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a><em> &amp; </em><a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> will run a cross-journal collection on advances and challenges in imaging musculoskeletal disorders until the end of 2019.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient engagement in research and development was definitely a recurring theme throughout this conference</p></blockquote>
<p>Digitalization has additionally enabled more effective communication between health care professionals and patients. For example, Susanne Karlfeldt (Karolinska Institute, Sweden) spoke of Stockholm City Council’s development of personalized, e-health solutions for patients. She outlined how mobile/web applications and regular communication between clinical, patient consultants, and patients can streamline consultation periods and improve patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>Patient engagement in research and development was a recurring theme throughout this conference. One of EULAR’s main activities and related advocacy in coming years will be to increase participation in its work with patients of RMDs. The push to ensure that research and clinical practice is geared towards the needs of patients, as well as involving them more, is something that EULAR and the general scientific community is beginning to consider more seriously. This even more evident by the sessions dedicated to People with Arthritis and Rheumatism in Europe (PARE), which featured a mix of researchers, rheumatologists, and patient advocacy groups such as <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arthritis Foundation</a> and<a href="https://oafifoundation.com/en/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Osteoarthritis Foundation International</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect conditions for exchanges of knowledge and ideas</strong></p>
<p>The open interactions between the different partners that comprise EULAR/PReS – scientists, health professionals &amp; patients – was great to see. I believe that this exchange of ideas could, and should, be applied more to other research fields, including my own background of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Space was also given to a series of sessions for individual groups. One of the most productive is the <a href="https://emeunet.eular.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EMEUNET</a> (Emerging EUlar NETwork) working group, who provide both educational and entertaining events for the young-at-heart involved in rheumatology.</p>
<p>Weather and hospitality conditions were ideal in Madrid for EULAR 2019, and it is easy to see why the rheumatology community keeps coming back again and again. <em>BMC </em>will attend EULAR 2020 in Frankfurt (3 – 6 June), something this field and journals can look forward to in anticipation.</p>

<p>The UK population continues to grow, while nursing numbers have remained static for several decades. Compounding matters, The King’s Fund and Nuffield Trust have <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/the-nhs-workforce-in-numbers%236-how-did-we-get-to-this-situation">reported</a> a 25 per cent increase in nurses and midwives leaving the NHS from 2012 to 2018, from 27,300 to 34,100. In short, in the UK, we now have far fewer nurses relative to the general population than we used to.</p>
<p>What does this mean for patients’ care experience? The situation sounds bad, but how bad? Common sense would suggest that patients will experience poorer care when nurses are overstretched, and there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to support that interpretation. But there are also positive stories, and claims about greater efficiency compensating for fewer staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/early/2019/03/27/bmjqs-2018-008948.full.pdf">study</a> in <i>BMJ Quality &amp; Safety</i> provides direct observational evidence suggesting that lower nurse-patient ratios really do result in poorer health-care interactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37461"></span></p>
<p>Jackie Bridges at the University of Southampton and her colleagues observed how patient-staff interactions varied across six NHS physical healthcare wards in England depending on the ratio of nursing and healthcare assistants to patients. In total, the researchers carefully rated 238 hours of care, which included over 3000 interactions between 270 patients and healthcare staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, 10 per cent of those interactions were rated as negative – specifically “negative restrictive”, such as patients being moved without warning or sworn at; and “negative protective”, such as patients having to wait for medication. Crucially, the researchers found that the odds of a negative interaction increased significantly as the number of patients per registered nurse increased.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lower numbers of registered nurses working on a ward were associated with more negative interactions regardless of whether or not healthcare assistants (support staff without a nursing qualification) had been brought in to make up the numbers. Having more healthcare assistants on shift only helped if there were enough registered nurses to supervise them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As this was a purely observational study, rather than experimental, some caution is required, as the authors note: “a causal inference [about staffing levels] cannot be directly made”. Nevertheless, this is such a helpful piece of research, that’s clearly consistent what nurses have been saying for years: that they need enough of them on shift to be able to ensure that patient care is high quality.</p>
<p>This isn’t to “do down” healthcare assistants, who are undervalued enough, but it is highlighting the importance of good quality supervision. It also doesn’t mean that nurses go round looking over the shoulders of their more junior colleagues, but is consistent with the argument that patient-carer interactions will be more universally positive when there are sufficient nursing staff to deal with queries, show more junior staff what to do, talk through dilemmas, model excellent patient care, and acknowledge difficult feelings that caring roles can bring up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study reminded me of the time I’ve spent working in mental health wards, a job which was adrenaline-fuelled and unpredictable but which I loved, and where I worked with brilliant nursing colleagues who were often rushed off their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Media coverage of care quality in the NHS often blames individuals, and especially nursing staff, for failures. Poor care is never excusable or acceptable, but it is important to recognise that there are perfect storms of working condition which make it more likely. Negative cultures in organisations, lack of staff resources, destructive leadership, can all play their part.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150407084231/http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">The Francis Report</a>, published in 2013, highlighted the devastating effects of a lack of compassionate care and the need to have cultures where people feel they can speak out about poor care, and where compassionate care is supported. Much has been done since to <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/05/five-myths-compassionate-leadership">champion compassionate leadership and compassionate care</a>, but this new study shows how, in the aftermath of austerity and with not enough staff to go round, it’s harder for these principles to be put into practice. For any of us – nurses included – if we are stressed, tired, under emotional pressure and not given enough time, we tend to behave less nicely. It’s not news that <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Darley-JersualemJericho.pdf">a lack of time has a negative impact on caring behaviours</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s been much about staff wellbeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/nhs-forced-prioritise-staff-wellbeing-tackle-escalating-crisis">in the papers recently</a>, with initiatives to offer mindfulness, yoga, exercise classes and the like. Interventions on an individual level can be hugely helpful and useful to know about. At the same time, it’s not good enough to offer interventions to reduce unnecessary stress caused by an uncaring system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>High quality compassionate care in hospital settings requires sufficient nurses to deliver the care and to supervise their junior colleagues. Anything less is setting up staff to fail and setting up patients for a greater likelihood of negative care. Nurses need to be cared for too, by their employer and by their colleagues, and a bare minimum is making sure there are enough colleagues on shift for it to feel safe. This new research adds to a body of evidence that takes the blame off the nurse and squarely places the responsibility on the system to do better.</p>
