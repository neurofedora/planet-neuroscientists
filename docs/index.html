              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybees-italy-steal-pollen-bumblebees">Some honeybees in Italy regularly steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees rely on plant pollen as a protein-packed food source. And some are even willing to steal from other bees to get it.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing has been seen before, in the United States. But now, researchers in Italy have also observed honeybees <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-023-01049-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatching pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a>. The observations, published December 21 in <em>Apidologie</em>, are among the most extensive documentation of bee-on-bee larceny to date.</p>



<p>On a summer trip in 2019 to Mount Antola, in the northern Italian region of Liguria, independent naturalists Tiziano Londei and Giuliana Marzi, both based in Milan, recorded video of what they thought were honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) trying to push bumblebees off the flower of a woolly thistle (<em>Cirsium eriophorum</em>). A closer look at the video, however, revealed that this wasn’t a case of competitive harassment — it was a full-blown robbery. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Watch a honeybee steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mPE17Qci1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thieving honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) snags pollen off the body of a red-tailed bumblebee (<em>Bombus lapidarius</em>). Because honeybees aren&#8217;t good at collecting pollen from woolly thistle, the bumblebees — which get pollen stuck on their hairy bodies — appear to be too good a target to pass up. This behavior, previously seen in several areas in the United States, has now been observed in Italy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As red-tailed bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em> <em>lapidarius</em>) scrounged around the flowers for nectar and pollen, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollen-hitches-ride-bees-all-right-spots">pollen grains stuck to their hairy bodies</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/17</em>). Londei and Marzi witnessed honeybees shamelessly snagging this pollen for themselves. The thieves tended to target male bumblebees slightly more than females, as the males appeared less bothered by the pilfering (though even females didn’t react aggressively).</p>



<p>“Honeybees are well-known as pollen pigs,” says Avery Russell, a biologist at Missouri State University in Springfield who was not involved in the study. So stealing pollen from the bodies of bumblebees, he says,&nbsp;&#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like a far stretch.”</p>



<p>To see how common the criminality is, the researchers went back to the scene twice in the following three years and also observed bees at two other sites about 25 kilometers away. Honeybees at these other sites were not seen stealing from bumblebees, but bees at the first site continued their larcenous ways year after year. For instance, honeybees collected pollen from only three of the 31 flowers the researchers observed in 2021, but stole from 28 of the available 66 bumblebees.</p>



<p>Scrutinizing the differences between these sites, the researchers suspect honeybees resort to theft in areas where pollen is hard for them to get from flowers (the honeybees struggled to collect pollen from the woolly thistle), but where there are plenty of other bees around.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing by honeybees has previously been observed only in North America, first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25083029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Kansas</a> and then later in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25084015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-kansas-entomological-society/volume-78/issue-2/0406.15.1/Quantifying-a-Rare-Event--Pollen-Theft-by-Honey-Bees/10.2317/0406.15.1.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>. Discovering the behavior in Italy suggests this may be a global crime spree. Russell says it would be nice to next learn whether pollen theft negatively impacts bumblebees, or the flowers they pollinate. He’s also curious if other bee species ever steal pollen, too. “We do notice that in the hive, bumblebees will nibble on each other&#8217;s pollen baskets,” he says.</p>

The application of microfluidics in the biomedical field covers many different aspects, including sensing, cell manipulation and micropumping. These devices also serve as tissue/organ culture platforms. The concept of organ-on-a-chip allows such complex systems to be reproduced in a smaller and simpler platform, holding massive potential for the study of intercellular communications as well as an alternative to animal models. Micropumps find applications as drug delivery systems, as well as being a fundamental component of microfluidic devices. These are but a few examples of the potential these technologies hold in the biomedical field.</p>

<p>Two assistant professors at universities in the United States are coauthors of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/10/926">a review</a> that appears to have been advertised for sale by the Indian paper mill iTrilon, a Retraction Watch investigation has found.</p>



<p>One of the professors, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-yuguang-ph-d/bio-20503555">Yuguang Liu</a> of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is also guest editor of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors/special_issues/GFBCFF9AIQ">MDPI special issue</a> in the journal <em>Biosensors</em> in which the review was published last year. The other professor, <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/directory/faculty/ajeet-kaushik.php">Ajeet Kaushik</a> of Florida Polytechnic University, in Lakeland, sits on the <a href="https://archive.fo/a1LuB">editorial boards of<em> Biosensors</em></a> and several other titles from MDPI, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature and other publishers.</p>



<p>An MDPI representative said Liu, who declined an interview request, had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the paper. Meanwhile, Kaushik acknowledged his work on the article had sprung from a LinkedIn message from a researcher in India who, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>, has been offering co-authorship in return for help getting his articles published.</p>



<p>“This is sad,” Kaushik told us by email, adding that he had not seen “any red flags” when he agreed to collaborate on the review. </p>

<p>“I contributed to this review article as an ethical co-author,” he said. “I am making it clear that my role in this article does not have any involvement of money or other exchange offers.”</p>



<p>The paper’s link to iTrilon became apparent during a six-month Retraction Watch investigation for <em>Science</em> that found <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">paper mills had taken to bribing journal editors</a> to ensure publication of their articles. Based in Chennai, iTrilon sells authorship of “readymade” scientific papers and gets them published through a network of editors with whom it claims to be working. The company’s <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">website</a> was taken down following our story.</p>



<p>As we reported in a companion piece to the <em>Science</em> article, papers advertised last year by iTrilon <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">buoyed the research output</a> of <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a>, a professor and dean at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, Spain. Lorenzo acknowledged paying the company.</p>



<p>The review in <em>Biosensors</em> is one of the six papers Lorenzo coauthored in 2023 that could be linked to iTrilon. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Colorectal-diagnostics-review.jpeg">matching ad</a> was posted in July and referred to a “review article” about “diagnostics for colorectal cancer,” to be submitted to a journal “indexed in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science” with an impact factor above 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These details are all consistent with the review, “Current Status and Emerging Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening and Diagnostics,” which was submitted to <em>Biosensors</em> on August 29.</p>



<p>But Giulia Stefenelli, chair of the scientific board of MDPI, said the publisher was not investigating the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is important to note that establishing a direct link between the articles and the content advertised by the cited platform is not an easy process. The titles of the articles and the number of authors do not immediately correlate with the published material. Should we receive further evidence that clearly distinguishes the relationship to the publications unequivocally, we will proceed to initiate an official investigation,” Stefenelli told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Liu, who is a corresponding author of the review, did not agree to an interview. But she said in an email that she was “unaware” of the iTrilon ad matching the paper and that “I don’t think it’s related to my paper or the special issue on MDPI.”</p>



<p>We were unable to find contact information for the review’s first author, <a href="https://archive.fo/k1ctn">Shreya Singh Beniwal</a> of Lady Hardinge Medical College, in New Delhi. Beniwal was also first author of <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">a research article</a> coauthored by Lorenzo, which unequivocally matched a previous <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">ad from iTrilon</a> and has now been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the authors came to collaborate on the review is only partly clear. A LinkedIn message from last spring reveals <a href="https://archive.fo/ktZCO">ArunSundar MohanaSundaram</a>, an assistant professor at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, in Chennai, and co-corresponding author of the review, had been proffering author slots on manuscripts to researchers who could help get them published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m ready to offer ‘co authorship’ if you could review the work and support me as an EDITOR in reputed journals,” MohanaSundaram, who has coauthored several papers advertised for sale by iTrilon, wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arunsundar-contacting-researchers-on-linkedin-2.jpg">the message</a>, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>. He did not respond to repeated emails.</p>



<p>MohanaSundaram, Lorenzo and Beniwal came up with the idea for the review article, according to the statement on author contributions.</p>



<p>Kaushik said he had not heard of iTrilon until we reached out to him. But he acknowledged being contacted by MohanaSundaram:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes, I was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-message-from-Arunsundar-to-Ajeet-Kaushik.png">approached by Dr. Arun on LinkedIn</a> but at the beginning of this REVIEW ARTICLE. Then this paper moved forward by email exchanges. The similarity Index was acceptable, and all figures were either self-designed or with the permission. So, I did not see any red flags. I was involved in this article due to my credentials in the field of biosensors and nanomedicine.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kaushik added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please note, that I am a young scholar and working hard to make a good name based on clean and ethical research. I generally want to help, but such incidents are centaily aletrs, and I will be more careful and reserv in the future [sic]. </p>



<p>Presently, I am seeing some of the approaches (so-called shortcuts) to get easy or sponsored publications. BUT, I do not like and support such approaches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both Mayo Clinic and MDPI emphasized that Liu had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the manuscript.</p>



<p>“The paper’s scientific review, revision, and submission process was handled by an Assistant Editor, Mila Opacic, not Dr. Liu,” Andrea Kalmanovitz, director of Communications &#8211; Media Relations at Mayo Clinic, said in an email. She did not reply to follow-up questions about how Liu had come into contact with far-flung authors linked to paper-mill articles.</p>



<p>According to Stefenelli at MDPI:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The article was accepted by the Section editor-in-chief of &#8220;Nano- and Micro-Technologies in Biosensors,&#8221; to which the Special issue belongs, Prof. Michael Thompson. In accordance with MDPI editorial procedure, Guest Editors are completely excluded from the peer-review process and decision-making stages for articles submitted by themselves and their colleagues. The MDPI procedure seeks for an independent assessment by a member of the Editorial Board for all cases of conflict of interest (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17">https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

                <p>Access to raw scientific data enhances understanding, enables replication and reanalysis, and increases trust in published research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vitality and utility of research data has made Open Data a central tenet of Open Science, second only to publishing under an Open Access license. For that reason, governments, funders, and publishers increasingly recommend <em>or even require</em> data sharing, and readers have come to view Open Data as a hallmark of quality research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purpose-built data repositories are the most effective, stable, and discoverable way to share research data&mdash;which means more attention and impact for research. In fact, articles that link to data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">25% higher citation rate</a> than articles that do not share data, or share only in Supporting Information files.</p>



<p>Repositories also make it easier to claim academic credit for data collection and curation, by assigning a unique identifier, like a DOI, and enabling authors to link their <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;m using my own data or someone else&rsquo;s, having access to the data in a repository means that I know which version to use and refer to. This has been really useful as I don&rsquo;t waste time looking through files and folders on my own computer as I can just click on the DOI and go straight to the data. This also means I don&rsquo;t have to bother anyone else to get the data or spend time magnifying graphs and approximating the values of the data points in order to reuse someone else&rsquo;s findings (yes I really did this with an article published back in the 1980s!)&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/palm-plant-flowers-fruits-underground">This first-of-its-kind palm plant flowers and fruits entirely underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Palm trees are often associated with Hollywood Boulevard and tropical resorts, but their relatives in the palm family Arecaceae can come in many different shapes and sizes. And one shuns the limelight to an almost absurd degree — the new-to-science <em>Pinanga subterranea </em>palm grows its flowers and fruit entirely underground.</p>



<p>“We knew immediately that it’s a really odd palm,” says Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a botanist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Richmond, England.</p>



<p>Malaysian botanist Paul Chai first noticed the palm growing in Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, on the island of Borneo, in the late 1990s. However, Kuhnhäuser says, Chai lost all his photographic evidence for the enigmatic plant during flooding in Kuching, the capital of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. In 2018, Chai told Kuhnhäuser and other botanists visiting Borneo about the lost palm over breakfast. The team embarked on a multiday trek to reach the sanctuary and found, to their surprise, that the underground palm was actually abundant.</p>



<p>Growing anything other than roots underground is rare, but examples can be found across the plant kingdom. South-central Africa is home to an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/suffrutex-grasslands-in-southcentral-angola-belowground-biomass-root-structure-soil-characteristics-and-vegetation-dynamics-of-the-underground-forests-of-africa/90BDAA37B8FE9518441FBC997F1803B8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“underground forest”</a> where many plants flower aboveground but grow woody material below; a Bornean pitcher plant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pitcher-plant-underground-new-species-carnivorous">buries its traps</a> under the soil (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>). In fact, plants across 33 different families have been found to conceal flowers or fruits underground, but burying both is exceedingly rare. Besides the underground palm, “there&#8217;s only one other plant in the world that does this,” Kuhnhäuser says, “and that&#8217;s some tiny orchid genus called <em>Rhizanthella</em> in Australia.”</p>



<p>Just because the palm is new to science doesn’t mean no one knew it existed. “Several local people, especially Indigenous ones, knew the palm,” says Cibele de Cássia Silva, a botanist at the University of Campinas in Brazil who was not involved with the research. The local people not only had names for it, but some dig up and eat the inconspicuous palm’s fruit as a snack. For Cássia Silva and Kuhnhäuser, this highlights the importance of not only engaging with Indigenous knowledge but also including that knowledge in scientific papers.</p>

<p>The biology of the palm is also fascinating. Getting flowers pollinated and seeds dispersed is often vital for plants, so how does a plant pull it off underground? The palm may rely at least partially on self-pollination, and Cássia Silva suspects that beetles may be able to move pollen between plants even belowground. The researchers also saw wild pigs digging up its fruits, which means the animals could help the palm spread its seeds through feces. The team <a href="https://kew.iro.bl.uk/concern/articles/de820e60-4c53-44d8-921e-d95f554181d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the plant</a> in the fittingly named journal <em>Palms</em> in June 2023 and reported on <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.10393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unique biology</a> around the same time in <em>Plants, People, Planet</em>.</p>



<p>Kuhnhäuser’s Kew colleague Sidonie Bellot is now working on unraveling the relationships between the underground palm and its relatives, which will help reveal the steps the palm took to reach its subterranean lifestyle; many of its relatives live close to the ground anyway, so going all the way under may not have been that large of a leap.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Mohammad Tayaraninajaran will talk about his paper &quot;A probabilistic meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm for image multi-level thresholding&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which
causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged many countries. To curb the
effect of the pandemic requires the development of low-cost and rapid tools for detecting
and diagnosing the patients. In this regard, chest X-ray scan images provide a reliable
way of detecting the patients. One limitation, however, is the need for experts to analyse
the images and identify the cases which can be a burden, when a large number of images are
to be processed. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract rapidly, from the
X-ray images, the regions in which there exist indications of COVID-19 infection. To
identify the regions, image segmentation is required which is performed in this paper with
a novel optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm uses probabilistic
representation for the solutions. To improve the optimization process, we propose a
diversity preserving operator. For multi-level image thresholding via optimization
algorithms, different fitness functions have been proposed in the literature. In the
proposed method in this paper, we use three fitness functions to benefit from the
advantages of all. A fitness swapping scheme is proposed which swaps between the fitness
functions in the optimization process. Also, a diversity preserving operator is proposed
in this paper which compares the individuals and reinitializes the similar ones to inject
diversity in the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of COVID-19
benchmark images and experimental analysis suggest better performance for the proposed
algorithm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periwinkle-snail-live-birth-evolution-reproduction">These snails give live birth, and it’s the babies that may do the labor</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oddball minority of animals that don’t lay eggs includes a tough little snail called a rough periwinkle.</p>



<p>Unlike mammals giving birth to kittens and fawns and helpless little humans, this tidal-zone snail has switched to live birth relatively recently.&nbsp;Its newcomer version of birthing offspring into the world without an eggshell is…. different: These periwinkle moms give birth multiple times a day. And unlike humans, it’s probably not the mom but the babies who do the hard labor.</p>



<p>Egg-laying periwinkle relatives have a jelly gland that creates a goo-protected mass of eggs outside the mom’s body. But in <em>Littorina saxatilis</em>, the gland has evolved into a make-do womb, or brood pouch<em>.</em> Eggs still form there, but stay inside mom’s body until after they hatch, says evolutionary ecologist Kerstin Johannesson of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.</p>



<p>Mom can have up to a few hundred embryos at various stages of maturation in the gland. When birthing the mature ones, “if she starts to push, also the ones that are not ready will probably come out,” Johannesson says. As a long-time observer of the snails, she doubts that the moms push at all. The little periwinkles may crawl out of their mother’s body and into the world on their own.</p>



<p>When ready to leave the mob in the brood pouch, each baby snail first scrapes a hole in its own transparent eggshell-like covering, “like a hatching bird,” Johannesson says. Then babies must find the exit from mom’s body. “How they find it, we do not know,” she says, “but maybe they can feel the smell of fresh saltwater coming from the outside through the hole.”</p>



<p>The live birth of these snails fascinates Johannesson and others because the species probably developed the ability in the last 100,000 years or so. That’s just an evolutionary eyeblink, really.</p>



<p>When comparing rough periwinkles with two close sister species (<em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. compressa</em>)<em>, </em>the only reliable visible difference that shows they are separate species is the quirk of live birth.</p>



<p>It was glass German Christmas ornaments that helped evolutionary biologist Sean Stankowski clarify just how strong a species barrier separates live bearers from egg-laying sisters. The glass ornaments, made to be filled with chocolates and dangled on a holiday tree, worked well as passion chambers for pairs of snails, one partner from a live-bearer species and one from an egg-layer. (Considering mollusks in general, this had the kink of pairing males with females rather than the normal two hermaphrodites lining up for mutual sperm delivery.)</p>



<p>In the glass ornaments, some of the pairs mated. But Stankowski, of the University of Sussex in England, and colleagues found no viable offspring, a sign the partners are separate species, in this case with strong separation. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hybrids-reveal-barriers-successful-mating-between-species">Ability to make babies is one way to think about defining a species</a>, but far from the only way (<em>SN: 10/31/17</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ornaments were just a tiny part of some seven years of intense research, mostly genetic exploration, that let Stankowski, Johannesson and colleagues explore how an egg-laying lineage gave rise to such a consequential change as live birth. &nbsp;Both <em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. saxatilis</em> live in the drown-dry craziness of rocky tidal zones, but the egg-layers stay mostly in northern Europe and Russia. The live-birth species, however, has spread farther around Europe and added the northern Atlantic coast of North America to its range. Because <em>L. saxatilis</em> hitchhikes well, it now lives in San Francisco Bay and the canals of Venice.</p>



<p>Yet live birth doesn’t look as if it came from some big dramatic genetic change. Instead, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences built up bit by bit</a>, from changes in some 50 regions in the snail’s genes. None of these seems more influential than any of the others, the team reports January 5 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Giving the eggs more protection might explain the species’ success, the researchers say, even though the newborns emerge from their moms looking vulnerable and only half a millimeter long. You can feel them between your fingers “like grains of sand,” says Johannesson. “They simply creep out of the mother’s pocket, and quite often you can see them crawling around on her shell.” Mom may not help her offspring emerge, but she can provide their first breakfast: diatoms and bacteria ready to be scraped off her shell. Nom-nom!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire editorial board of a sociology journal has resigned after they say that the publisher, Springer Nature, installed new editors-in-chief without consulting the board &#8212; but Springer Nature says they tried unsuccessfully to engage the board on planning going back at least five years.</p>



<p>In December 2023, senior editors of the journal, <em>Theory and Society</em>, learned Springer Nature “had opted for a ‘completely different view’ of the journal going forward,” according to a message shared on a listserv for the American Sociological Association and published on the <a href="https://scatter.wordpress.com/2024/01/10/questions-for-the-new-theory-society-editorial-board/">blog Scatterplot</a>. The 10 senior editors subsequently resigned, they told their colleagues, but didn’t offer additional details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 4, the journal’s corresponding editors also resigned, according to a resignation letter shared with the sociology listserv. The corresponding editors cited Springer Nature’s decision to replace Janet Gouldner, the former executive editor (and widow of the journal’s founding editor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/obituaries/alvin-gouldner-60-a-radical-sociologist-dies-of-heart-attack.html">Alvin Gouldner</a>), without consulting the rest of the editorial board. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128611"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Springer Nature’s unyielding position on this was a clear violation of our profession’s academic norms and standards and was fundamentally at odds with the spirit of the journal. Given our long service and dedication to the journal, we were extremely disappointed that at no point in the publisher’s effort to install a new Executive Editor was a single one of the Senior Editors (nor, to our knowledge, any of the Corresponding Editors) consulted regarding their vision for the future of the journal. Additionally, their attempts to have input into the process of selecting new leadership for the journal were repeatedly rebuffed. We are unaware of any other publisher handling its relationship with an editorial board in such a dismissive fashion.</p>



<p>For us, this is not only about Theory and Society, but more broadly, the precedent of for-profit owners of academic journals unilaterally installing their selected editors. At stake here is how much control we academics are willing to give to for-profit publishers who have so much influence over our professional trajectories on the one hand and rely on our uncompensated labor on the other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mass resignation is the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a>, as academic researchers increasingly see themselves at odds with for-profit journal publishing companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Krauss, Publishing Director for Humanities, Social, Behavioural and Health Sciences at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have spent a number of years assessing the journal, including the authors’ experience of the journal, and considering whether its scope reflects changes in the discipline.&nbsp; Feedback from researchers suggested that the field was becoming more interdisciplinary, although the scope of the journal remained unchanged.&nbsp; We also received a sustained volume of correspondence from submitting authors over this time which expressed deep concerns regarding turnaround times for their submissions. We concluded that it was necessary to reduce turnaround times and to develop the journal to better serve our authors and the wider research community.</p>



<p>The decision to appoint a new Editor in Chief was not made lightly or without consultation. We recognise and are grateful for the many years of distinguished leadership of the journal by Dr Janet Gouldner, who had held the post since 1981. Discussions with Dr Gouldner regarding the need to find a successor, including whether one could be found from within the then Senior Editors, took place over several years but were unsuccessful. We also raised the issue of succession planning with five of the senior editors in 2019 in person, but they were unwilling to enter into discussions on the subject. Regretfully, eventually a decision had to be made to press ahead with appointing a successor with an editorial vision that reflected our shared goals for the journal.</p>



<p>We began working with the new Editors-in-Chief to recruit a new Editorial team after we received a letter of resignation from the previous Corresponding Editors. We are looking to internationalise and diversify the editorial board pool over the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The two new editors in chief, Kevin McCaffree, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Texas in Denton, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_H._Turner">Jonathan Turner</a> of the University of California, Riverside, have published a “<a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11186/updates/26605018">Statement of Goals for Theory and Society</a>,” subtitled “The Troubled State of Sociology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In it, they wrote that “a monoculture of critical approaches utterly dominate” their discipline, “and, though often well-intentioned, this monoculture is undermining sociology’s professional legitimacy.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is an unacceptable state of affairs and calls for a theory journal devoted to scientific sociological theorizing. Theorizing in sociology has always been eclectic, and we will continue this tradition, but what’s needed is a platform to unify these perspectives into a broad but disciplined scientific perspective. Theory and Society is now one of these platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new editors also promised “drastically shorter turnaround times for submitted papers,” special issues, and new article formats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many sociologists criticized the statement on X (formerly named Twitter):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh look the journal was taken over by people who want to push back against ideological research via their own very specific ideological view of science.<br><br>Even from a practical perspective this thing stinks. Good luck making those changes with no support.<a href="https://t.co/H8MmHBYaLL">https://t.co/H8MmHBYaLL</a></p>&mdash; Dr. Tom Mueller (@JTomMueller) <a href="https://twitter.com/JTomMueller/status/1745244803531497875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One called the change in leadership a “coup”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The coup at Theory &amp; Society is complete. After the ed board resigned, the 2 editors handpicked by Springer installed a new board entirely comprised of cognitive scientists, social psychologists, org sociologists, sociobiologists, b school profs, &amp; folks into evolutionary theory <a href="https://t.co/1sEewWJz7C">pic.twitter.com/1sEewWJz7C</a></p>&mdash; Zachary Levenson (@grundrza) <a href="https://twitter.com/grundrza/status/1745260866155499874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>“Everyone knows that the review times were a bit crazy,” <a href="https://x.com/bhbradlow/status/1744369940025446902?s=20">wrote another sociologist</a>, “but that is surely no justification for this attack on intellectual independence by a for-profit publisher. This is a major loss.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2024/01/12/jonathan-turner-is-the-new-co-editor-of-theory-and-society-and-his-latest-diatribe-wont-surprise-you-at-all/">a blog post</a>, a sociologist at the University of Maryland described a recent paper by Turner as “a White-male-grievance monument to laziness and entitlement.”</p>



<p>“For both the way Springer handled it, and because of Turner’s attitude and the journal’s stated mission, I won’t be submitting to or reviewing for the journal (which, granted, I have yet to ever do, anyway), and suggest others follow suit,” Philip N. Cohen wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">McCaffree told Retraction Watch he’d been invited to interview for the position. He said he was told “that turnaround times needed to be shortened and that the publishing vision needed to be more scientific, less political and more interdisciplinary.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then we just got to work. The decision to remove the old board was made before I was asked to interview.</p>



<p>We do want to see the field improve along the lines suggested above, but that&#8217;s it. We don&#8217;t have any deeper agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, with any widescale shift in a journal&#8217;s board and direction, some people will be upset. Others will be intrigued and motivated. But, frankly, Jon and I do not answer for Springer;&nbsp; their decision to change direction was theirs to make and – also – had the old board not resigned in a huff, we would have been happy to have many of them continue to serve.&nbsp; But, they did resign, and we respect that decision. Our only focus now is on finding and platforming the best sociological theory we can find.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turner told us he’d also been invited to edit the journal. He expected to “keep at least some of the board to sustain that part of the journal&#8217;s long-term tradition but add new members to reflect our desire to broaden the scope of theoretical approaches appearing in the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher, Turner said, “simply eliminated some [of] the board at the very time we were beginning to ask some to remain.” He and McCaffree have tried to bring some former board members back on, and recruit new members “that have a critical perspective,” he said, but they have refused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides assembling a new board, the incoming editors-in-chief are focused on going through a backlog of submissions, some over a year old, Turner said, to decide whether to send them out for review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turner said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I remain surprised and saddened about the reaction of the board that consisted of many fine scholars. I don&#8217;t quite see why they are so upset but I cannot do much to change their minds in what appears to be an attempt, I guess, to punish Springer. For Kevin and me, we just need to keep the journal going as editors; and, at least on my part, I am simply ignoring the controversy and hope that when our first issues come out, everyone will see that the journal is meeting its mission to publish theories relevant to understanding the organization of human societies.</p>

<p>Zulfiqar Habib, dean of computer science at COMSATS University Islamabad, in Pakistan, was appalled when he discovered part of a former PhD student’s dissertation had been published in a scientific journal.</p>



<p>After all, the former student, Kurshid Asghar, had been dead for more than a year by the time the manuscript was submitted to <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, a Hindawi title. And Habib knew none of Asghar’s coauthors had contributed to the research, which Habib had supervised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was both shocking and unbelievable,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-128607"></span>



<p>Habib decided to share his concerns with Roberto Di Pietro, chief editor of <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, in which <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/4270776/">the paper</a> had appeared in September 2021. What followed was a strange and opaque investigation, which Wiley, Hindawi’s parent company, now says had “some limitations” and is being revisited following Retraction Watch’s inquiry.</p>



<p>In a December 2021 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.pdf">email</a> to Di Pietro, Habib wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>May I have your attention on a very serious issue about academic fraud. A group of people has illegally published a research paper in your esteemed journal by stealing a chapter of PhD thesis … This paper is copied from Chapter 6 of PhD Thesis of Dr. Khurshid Asghar after his death without the consent and knowledge of his PhD supervisor (Dr. Zulfiqar Habib) and co-supervisor (Dr. Muhammad Hussain).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A research integrity specialist at Hindawi wrote back to inform Habib that, according to the authors, Asghar had shared his work with them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>And while Dr Asghar wrote the original draft, they contributed to the article by editing this original draft with Dr Asghar prior to submission and then answering the reviewers comments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors were willing to add Habib to the author list, the Hindawi specialist said. But Habib demurred. Instead, he asked to see “documentary evidence” proving the authors weren’t just trying to “hide academic fraud and justify plagiarism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In subsequent emails, the specialist told Habib the authors had submitted documentation for their claims but Habib couldn’t see it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… as you are not conducting an official investigation into this allegation of research misconduct, we cannot share the evidence provided by the authors with you without the consent of all parties. We cannot obtain Dr Asghar&#8217;s consent and he is a party within the documentation provided.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Di Pietro chimed in to note that he found Zulfiqar’s point of view “quite reasonable” and suggested starting “an appropriate level of investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in June 2022, Hindawi shut down the case. As the research integrity specialist wrote in an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2.pdf">email</a> to Habib:</p>



<p><em>We have received notification that you have contacted COMSATS University Islamabad to request a formal investigation into the authorship of the article:</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi, Khurshed Asghar, Umar Draz, Amjad Ali, Madallah Alruwaili, Yousef Alhwaiti, Saad Alanazi, M. M. Kamruzzaman, &#8220;Image Splicing-Based Forgery Detection Using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Edge Weighted Local Binary Patterns&#8221;, Security and Communication Networks, vol. 2021, Article ID 4270776, 10 pages, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4270776</p>



<p>We have received the report from the committee formed to investigate this issue in which it was found that the article by Siddiqi et al. did not plagiarise other works. Given the outcome of the investigation, we are now closing this complaint.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>COMSATS University Islamabad did not reply to requests for comment. Nor did <a href="https://sa.linkedin.com/in/dr-muhammad-hameed-siddiqi-8317021b">Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi</a>, the paper’s first author, nor <a href="https://www.uosahiwal.edu.pk/depart-hod/information-technology">Umar Draz</a>, its corresponding author. </p>



<p>But in an email, a spokesperson for Wiley told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of some limitations with the initial investigation and have re-opened the case. We will be reaching out to the parties involved to outline next steps and to ensure that an appropriate outcome is reached as promptly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They later added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We revisited the case as a result of this inquiry, and have decided to reopen it.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-largest-shark-fossil-long-body">Megalodon, the largest shark ever, may have been a long, slender giant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The largest shark discovered to date — the monstrous <em>Otodus megalodon </em>— may have been a sleek, long-bodied leviathan.</p>



<p>A fresh look at the extinct predator’s fossilized remains suggests <a href="https://doi.org/10.26879/1345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its body was many meters longer and possibly more slender than previous reconstructions</a>, researchers report January 22 in <em>Palaeontologia Electronica</em>. The findings may offer better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">insights into the biology and lifestyle</a> of megalodon, including how fast it swam or what it ate (<em>SN: 6/27/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reconstructing what ancient, extinct animals looked like when they were alive is challenging, even when complete fossilized remains are available. But reconstructing megalodon is much harder. Like all sharks, the giant had a cartilaginous skeleton that preserves poorly relative to bone. It is mostly known from teeth and many meters of fossilized, cartilaginous vertebrae, with the rest of the skeleton remaining a mystery.</p>



<p>Traditionally, modern great white sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) have been used as a model for megalodon’s body shape. That’s because great whites are the largest predatory sharks alive today and great whites and megalodons are categorized in somewhat closely related families.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 reconstruction</a> that extrapolated from great whites caught the attention of Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and his colleagues. That study based its reconstruction on the cartilaginous vertebral column of purported megalodon remains housed in a Belgian museum. Adding together all the vertebrae end-to-end revealed a body length of over 11 meters. But Shimada and his colleagues noticed that older work on that same specimen from the 1990s had calculated the entire animal’s length as about 9 meters. That work was based on the diameters of the vertebrae and how those scale with size in great white sharks, which tops out at around 6 meters long.&nbsp;But the 2022 study still assumed megalodon was more or less great white-shaped, Shimada and his colleagues argue.</p>



<p>In their reassessment of the Belgian megalodon specimen’s vertebral column and the 2022 reconstruction, Shimada and his team question relying on the shape of great white sharks to build our view of megalodon. Megalodon’s vertebral column is relatively thin compared with the sturdier vertebrae that support the beefy brawn of great whites, makos and other modern relatives, the team notes. The researchers offer a new interpretation: Because such a small vertebral column would make more sense in a longer, leaner body shape, megalodon may have been built more like a bus than a van.&nbsp;Overall, it may have been an even bigger predator than researchers thought, Shimada says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study was “a major learning moment for both myself and many other scientists in that we need to take a broader perspective when reconstructing extinct animals, especially megalodon,” says coauthor Phillip Sternes, an organismal biologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>A slender body may mean that megalodon wasn’t as powerful a swimmer as great whites are. This matches recent research from Shimada and his colleagues on the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2023.2211597?src=recsys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of a megalodon scale</a> that suggested the shark was a slow cruiser capable of short bursts of speed.&nbsp;This shift in body shape may hint at how it ate or how much it ate, says paleontologist Dana Ehret of the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, who was not involved in either work.</p>



<p>“When working with extinct species, especially ones that don&#8217;t have any close living relatives today, we do our best by estimating what they may have looked like or how they behaved but it is never exact,” he says.</p>



<p>The new study takes an interesting approach, says vertebrate paleontologist Michael Gottfried, but the researchers still rely on great white sharks as a model in some ways, like on patterns of the size of vertebrae in different parts of the shark’s body. Gottfried and his colleagues were the researchers who measured and reconstructed the Belgian specimen as roughly 9 meters long in the 1990s. He says he isn’t sure how accurately the vertebrae can be added up to a total length, because many of the vertebrae are incomplete or fragmentary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, we are still speculating on body form and many other aspects of megalodon,” says Gottfried, of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Additional fossil material from the head and fins would be crucial for understanding how the giant shark looked.</p>

<p><strong>Happy leap second!</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/happy-leap-second"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 12, 1974</p>



<p>A “leap second” has been invented … to keep time signals used by navigators in step with the actual motion of the Earth. The latest leap second was celebrated New Year’s Eve at the stroke of midnight Greenwich Mean Time, when around the world … radio stations added an extra “beep” to their hourly time signals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Time is running out for the leap second. In 2022, metrologists <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to abandon the timekeeping quirk</a> by 2035. Unlike the leap year, which occurs every four years, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/leap-second-helps-us-reality-time">the leap second is deployed</a> whenever clocks need adjusting due to variations in Earth’s spin causing slight changes in the length of a day. Global officials have inserted a leap second 27 times since 1972. But satellites and other tech that rely on the precise time kept by atomic clocks <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leap-or-not-leap">can glitch when the clocks are adjusted</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/06, p. 248</em>). Scientists have suggested using a leap minute instead, which would require atomic clocks be reset once every 50 years or so.</p>

<p>New findings from a survey of psychology researchers show <a href="https://osf.io/pv7e2">nearly half of the respondents have encountered unethical authorship practices</a> in studies they have been involved in.</p>



<p>Researchers in Belgium surveyed more than 800 people involved in psychological research about their experiences with gift and ghost authorship, as well as the use of explicit authorship guidelines at their institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost half said they had witnessed gift authorship on more than one occasion – in other words, the respondents saw someone listed as an author when they had made little or no contribution to a paper. Ghost authorship –  excluding someone from a paper when they have made a significant contribution – was far less common, with fewer than one in five of the respondents reporting that they had dealt with the phenomenon. Since the authors used a convenience sample, the data show signs of authorship misconduct in psychology, but don’t tell the whole story. </p>



<span id="more-128594"></span>



<p>Gert Storms, a professor of psychology and educational sciences at KU Leuven, and an author of the paper, which was posted to the OSF Preprints server on December 11, says the science community pays little attention to inappropriate authorship compared with other misconduct, and the questionable practice goes largely unchecked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms says the manuscript of the survey’s results has been desk rejected three times. One editor cited concerns about informed consent. For that reason, the authors decided not to share the data openly, they said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These findings should be known,” Storms says. “I’m not concerned about getting it published in a way that gives me ‘a new publication with my name on it’. At my age, I just don’t care for that. It is the message.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms himself has witnessed several instances of undeserving bylines. Early in his career, somebody was given a byline on a paper Storms published even though they had made no contribution to the paper apart from applying for grant money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the survey did not ask respondents why they believed the authorship misconduct occurred, Storms says the practice is advantageous for the perpetrators. “It will affect research to a large extent because it determines how much research money and grants people get, who gets hired, who is kicked out of the race and so on,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift authorship in particular helps researchers accumulate publications to their name – crucial to academic recognition for those pressured by the ‘publish or perish’ culture in academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I see CVs where people have one paper every eight or nine days, what should one think about this?” Storms says.&nbsp; “Who has an idea that is worth putting on paper, and who contributes substantially to things that can be published every eight or nine days? That is simply impossible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other research on questionable authorship practices indicates a much higher prevalence of gift and ghost authorship in the biomedical field compared with psychology. One study of biomedical researchers reported 75% of respondents had <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32958486/">experienced the addition of an undeserving author</a> to a paper they had worked on. The same survey found that more than 30% of respondents had encountered a ghost author – a practice that may be more frequent in a field with regular industry collaboration, Storms says. In some fields, “it&#8217;s simply better for the credibility of the findings that [some authors] are not mentioned,” he says. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Authorship criteria vary between institutions. The <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/standards-disclosures">American Psychological Association’s authorship standards</a> state that “substantial scientific contributions” warrant authorship of a paper; the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines</a>, which are widely adopted by scientific journals, recommend authors should also draft or revise the work, in addition to having contributed substantially to the paper, among other criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Defining what is a substantial contribution can lead to debate,” says Steven De Peuter, a staff member of the Research Coordination Office at KU Leuven and an author of the paper. A recent study has <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198117">shown researchers often don’t agree</a> with what is enough of a contribution to deserve authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new survey, each respondent was asked a series of questions about a paper they had recently published. When authorship guidelines – such as those developed by the APA or ICMJE – were not used to decide who should be an author on the paper, respondents were more likely to think that the decision was unfair. Likewise, if the respondents’ research setting did not encourage any authorship guidelines, they were more likely to believe the final authorship decisions weren’t a fair reflection of contribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the main point is that people need to be willing to discuss what the criteria are,” De Peuter says. “That also helps incredibly to establish an atmosphere of fairness and openness.” He also notes that authorship disputes often are a symptom of a pre-existing conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines that require writing for authorship tend to exclude members of the research group&nbsp; with less tangible roles. For example, under ICMJE guidelines, “if I&#8217;m just a brilliant engineer who figured out how to get my machine to do the new trick, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily qualify me for authorship,” says Alex Holcombe, a professor of psychology at the University of Sydney and expert in authorship issues. “We&#8217;re stuck in a system that is not set up for indicating who did what.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contributorship – a system that categorizes each person’s contributions to a paper – is a more transparent approach, Holcombe argues. He backs the classification system CRediT, or the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">Contributor Roles Taxonomy</a>, which includes roles such as software and visualization, as well as the more traditional roles of writing,conceptualization and funding acquisition. Thousands of journals have already adopted the system, but it exists alongside the traditional system of authorship and is not yet routine across the research landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorship misconduct has been relatively overlooked compared with other types of research misconduct, Storms says. In the 1980s, William Bevan, then president of the American Psychological Association, said decisions about authorship, like those about sex, should “have a degree of intimacy about them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have the impression that the same attitude is still present in psychology,” Storms says. “And that&#8217;s really a shame.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-photo-galaxy-eht">Astronomers have snapped a new photo of the black hole in galaxy M87</a></h4>

              
                <p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-2" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-2"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-3" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-3">Heads up space</span></span> fans: A new picture of the supermassive black hole lurking in the galaxy M87 just dropped.</p>



<p>The new image looks a lot like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the previous, headline-grabbing shot</a> revealed in 2019 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). The main difference is that the brightest spot around the black hole <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/01/aa47932-23/aa47932-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted counterclockwise by about 30 degrees</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>. This is probably due to material sloshing around in the black hole’s accretion disk as it gets consumed.</p>



<p>But other aspects have not changed. A bright ring and the black hole’s shadow appear almost exactly the same size as before. This helps confirm that M87’s black hole is the type predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity and not some more exotic or unexpected variety, says astrophysicist Lia Medeiros of Princeton University.</p>



<p>“In science, it&#8217;s always really important to do the same or similar experiments multiple times,” Medeiros says. It helps “make sure you&#8217;re not fooling yourself, and that your results are reproducible.”</p>



<p>Medeiros is part of an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, which used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">a network of radio telescopes around the globe</a> to zoom in on M87’s heart, about 55 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Previously, all images from the EHT — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">those of the supermassive black hole in our own galaxy’s center</a> — used data taken in 2017 or earlier (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). The new picture is the first to incorporate observations from 2018.</p>

<p>In the interim, the EHT team added another telescope to their collection: the Greenland Telescope in northwestern Greenland. Because the technique the researchers use, known as interferometry, grows better with more facilities, the new image contains previously inaccessible details about M87’s behemoth black hole, which the researchers will dig into later.</p>



<p>Future images using data taken in years after 2018 will help physicists learn more about the complex interactions between <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">the black hole’s magnetic field</a> and the plasma spinning around it (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>

<p>The new finding comes from the MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa, which carefully monitored 13 millisecond pulsars in a dense cluster of stars 40,000 light years from Earth. These pulsars are a type of neutron star that quickly spin, rotating in fractions of a second, while sending out powerful beams of radiation like a cosmic lighthouse.</p>



<p>For some pulsars, those beams flash past our planet with a regularity that rivals an atomic clock. By hunting for tiny variations in the beams’ arrival on Earth, researchers can deduce the existence of anything perturbing the pulsar’s motion.</p>



<p>The ticks of one particular pulsar, known as PSR J0514−4002E, revealed that it has an invisible companion <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg3005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing between about 2.1 and 2.7&nbsp;times the mass of the sun</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 19 <em>Science</em>. That potentially makes it too heavy to be a neutron star, astronomer Ewan Barr of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and colleagues say. Neutron stars are thought to collapse into black holes once <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">they reach around two to three times the sun’s mass</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/22</em>). But because nobody knows exactly where that dividing line rests, nor precisely what happens once this limit is reached, the researchers can’t definitively say what this object is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers have discovered a handful of similar entities before, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object">one found using the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors</a> in 2020 (<em>SN: 6/23/20</em>). Barr and colleagues speculate that this new object formed when two lighter neutron stars crashed together. By studying the pulsar ticks more closely, the researchers hope to determine the hidden entity’s true nature and use it to probe matter in similarly extreme objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disease-microbes-inject-proteins-cells">How disease-causing microbes load their tiny syringes to prep an attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Swallow the wrong microbe, and you might end up in the hospital with a needle or two in your arm — and plenty of itty-bitty bacterial needles poking at you from the inside. That’s because many bacteria that make us sick use microscopic, syringelike structures to inject our cells with proteins that wreak havoc from the inside. Now, researchers have shown how these microbes load their nanoscale needles with proteins.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-4" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-4">Tracking individual proteins</span> as they jittered around inside living bacteria revealed the microbes use a shuttle bus–like system to load their syringes: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01545-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttle proteins travel random paths within the microbes’ interiors</a>, grabbing cargo destined for injection as they go and dropping it off at the syringes, scientists report January 3 in <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. Knowing how these bacterial needles work could help scientists learn how to disrupt them — or commandeer them for medical applications, like using bacterial needles to inject cancer cells with targeted drugs while leaving healthy tissue unscathed.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-5" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-5">Shuttling proteins to</span> the syringe is “a really novel molecular mechanism that was not known before,” says microbiologist Andreas Diepold of the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg, Germany.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-6" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-6">Under the microscope,</span> the syringelike structures, called a type-III secretion system, look like hollow needles just wide enough for a single unfolded protein to slither through, Diepold says. A microbe’s entire surface might be covered in such needles, giving the bacterium the look of a sinister little pincushion. Scientists know the protein structure of these nanoscale needles quite well. But “we don’t know the basic question of how they recruit whatever is injected,” he says.</p>

Schraidt <em>et al</em>/<em>PLOS Pathogens</em> 2010</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Previous studies suggested that a ring of proteins at the base of the secretion system, where it attaches to the bacterial cell membrane, might act something like a sorting platform that grabs target proteins and loads them into the syringe. But that work wasn’t done in living cells, says microbial geneticist Kelly Hughes of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Other studies in live cells, including recent work by Diepold and his colleagues, hinted that the components of the sorting platform might not stay put at the bases of the syringes. Instead, they might wander around the gel-like jumble of fluids, proteins and other biological bits enclosed within a bacterium’s cell membrane, picking up and dropping off target proteins as they go — like shuttle buses.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-9" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-9">The new study</span> put the shuttle-bus idea to the test by using fluorescence microscopy to track the movement of individual sorting platform proteins in <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em>, a stomach bug that lurks in undercooked pork. Maps of the proteins’ paths show them wandering random, zigzag paths through the cells. And experiments with mutant <em>Y.</em> <em>enterocolitica </em>that lack injectable proteins revealed that the shuttle-bus proteins move more quickly in the mutants — without any injectable targets to bind to, the shuttle-bus proteins don’t get weighed down by cargo and can diffuse faster through the cells. This showed that the sorting platform proteins don’t just wander; they also pick up passengers along the way.</p>



<p>“What I loved about this paper was that it was all set in vivo,” in living cells, Hughes says. “You get these beautiful pictures. And you know, a picture&#8217;s worth a thousand words.”</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-11" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-11">Unraveling more of</span> the outstanding mysteries surrounding these microscale needles will make it easier for scientists to throw a wrench in these machines,&nbsp;or to tinker with them. This type of secretion system, one of a handful of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-molecular-syringe-cells-microscopy">different types of needles bacteria have at their disposal</a>, is widespread across different species of bacteria, Diepold says, so they’re good targets for new types of antibacterial drugs (<em>SN: 3/30/22</em>).</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-12" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-12">They’re also promising</span> tools for medicine and biotech, Hughes says. But as much as they look like medical syringes, bacterial syringes work differently — and scientists still don’t know exactly how bacteria push proteins through their needles. It’s also unclear how the proteins that load up the needles recognize their targets. “We want to understand the riddle of how these systems work,” Diepold says. “We want to understand which solutions evolution came up with to allow bacteria to infect us.”</p>

<p>Last year, a professor and dean at a university in Spain suddenly began publishing papers with a multitude of far-flung researchers. His coauthors, until then exclusively national, now came from places like India, China, Nepal, South Korea, Georgia, Austria, and the United States.</p>



<p>How these unlikely collaborations began is not entirely clear. But a six-month Retraction Watch investigation, part of which is published here as a companion piece to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.zrjehzt">a longer article</a> appearing today in <em>Science</em>, suggests an unsavory possibility: The dean, <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a> of the faculty of health sciences at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, bought his way onto the papers – something he partly admits.</p>



<p>At least six of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240108094859/https:/scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=RJ_3_sYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">the seven journal articles</a> Lorenzo published last year had been previously advertised for sale by the Indian paper mill <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">iTrilon</a>. Based in Chennai, this underhand operation sells authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals,” according to a WhatsApp message its scientific director, <a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww">Sarath Ranganathan</a>, sent to prospective clients last summer. Ranganathan also claimed to have connections at journals that allowed him, in many cases, to guarantee acceptance of the manuscripts he would send their way.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128588"></span>



<p>With academics across the globe under constant pressure to publish, paper mills have flourished, offering clients an easy, if unethical, way to pad their publication lists. Heightened media attention has followed. One of the most prominent cases to come to light is that of Spanish chemist Rafael Luque, a <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=aAjK-qAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">prolific and highly cited</a> researcher, who last year was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">suspended without pay</a> for 13 years by the University of Córdoba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During our investigation for <em>Science</em>, which focused on how paper mills have infiltrated the academic publishing industry, evidence emerged suggesting Lorenzo was a frequent customer of these shady middlemen, whose articles are often plagiarized or contain fake data. Among Lorenzo’s coauthors on the iTrilon papers were several journal editors and other university professors.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The first time Lorenzo’s name appeared alongside international coauthors was July 20, 2023, on <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">a study</a> exploring whether a compound derived from citrus fruits might protect against Alzheimer’s disease. Two weeks earlier, a young researcher visiting his parents in India had received a WhatsApp message from iTrilon. The paper mill touted an “original research article” that had already been accepted and would be published shortly in the non-indexed journal <em>Life Neuroscience</em>. Several author slots were available for anywhere between $290 and $400, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">according to the ad</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-zadey">Siddhesh Zadey</a>, now a PhD student at Columbia University, was intrigued. Posing as a naïve medical student, he inquired about the fifth author slot on the article and was told it was on “hold for another client.”</p>



<p>When the paper appeared online two weeks later, the fifth author was Lorenzo, who is also president of his university’s bioethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reached by phone in October, Lorenzo said as far as he recalled, he had offered his services to a company that was “looking for collaborators, mainly translators and reviewers,” on LinkedIn. Asked if the company’s name was iTrilon, he said, “Yes, I guess so.”</p>



<p>For the Alzheimer’s paper, which described a series of experiments in rats, Lorenzo said he did “the revision and edition [sic].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He acknowledged making a payment in relation to the manuscript, but said he believed it was meant to cover the journal’s article-processing charges (APC). As stated on <a href="https://archive.fo/I32CM"><em>Life Neuroscience</em>’s website</a>, however, articles submitted in 2023 and 2024 “will not be subject to” such charges.</p>



<p>A professor of neuroscience at a university in the United States said Lorenzo’s paper contained “several warning flags,” such as a lack of “critical experimental details,” “elementary” statistical errors, and unlikely histograms that always showed “a perfect monotonic decrease or increase” across experimental conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is highly improbable,” said the expert, who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the case.</p>



<p>Nasrollah Moradikor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016053222/https:/georgianeuroscience.com/nasrollah-moradikor/">International Center for Neuroscience Research</a>, in Tbilisi, Georgia, the paper’s corresponding author and a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016050925/https:/neuroscirn.org/editorial/">high-level editor</a> at <em>Life Neuroscience,</em> did not agree to be interviewed. He has published other studies in the past that contain the same type of basic errors and improbable results, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4087/4/1/6">one in the MDPI title <em>NeuroSci</em></a><em>,</em> according to the neuroscience expert.</p>



<p>Another one of Lorenzo’s coauthors – Indranath Chatterjee, a professor of computer science at Tongmyong University, in South Korea, and also an editor at <em>Life Neuroscience</em> – denied knowledge of any advertising for the paper. As reported in <em>Science</em>, Chatterjee gave a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seminar-chatterjee-moradikor-itrilon.jpg">talk last autumn</a> on scientific publishing organized by iTrilon and the International Center for Neuroscience Research.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lorenzo did not reply to follow-up emails this year asking about his other iTrilon papers, which include:</p>

</ul>



<p>Among the dean’s coauthors on two of the advertised papers is <a href="https://archive.fo/7L44K">Paula Lamo Anuarbe</a>, an associate professor at the International University of La Rioja, also in Spain. Lamo did not reply to repeated requests for comment, but an administrator at her institution was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-10-05/spanish-university-administrator-and-colleagues-linked-to-factory-producing-fraudulent-scientific-studies.html">linked to paper mills</a> last year.</p>



<p><a href="https://drarifulhaque.com/">Ariful Haque</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at Yan&#8217;an Hospital Affiliated to Kunming Medical University, in China, who coauthored the paper on bioinks, said he and the other authors were “a team that works together and is concerned about global public health challenges.”</p>



<p>“I have not come across any adverts by iTrilon or any other organization for the selling of authorship in journals,” added Haque, who is an associate editor of Cell Press’ <em>Heliyon Surgery</em>, an assistant editor of Elsevier’s<em> Journal of Orthopaedics</em>, and an editor of Elsevier’s <em>Medical Reports</em>. “I want to clarify that I am strongly against collaboration with paper mills or unethical authoring techniques.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, one of Haque and Lorenzo’s coauthors, <a href="https://archive.fo/ktZCO">ArunSundar MohanaSundaram</a> of Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, the city were iTrilon is based, appears to be using authorship as a bargaining chip to boost his chances of getting published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last May, the month before Zadey was contacted by iTrilon, MohanaSundaram sent him a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arunsundar-contacting-researchers-on-linkedin-2.jpg">message on LinkedIn</a> requesting Zadey’s “valuable support as an EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER” for “almost completed” papers on neuroscience and public health. (Zadey is not a member of any editorial boards.)</p>



<p>“I’m ready to offer ‘co authorship’ if you could review the work and support me as an EDITOR in reputed journals,” MohanaSundaram wrote. “Or maybe through bearing APC charges for papers, if you could support also I will offer authorship.”</p>



<p>MohanaSundaram did not respond to repeated emails, and it is unclear why he targeted Zadey. But a paper from last year of which MohanaSundaram and Lorenzo appear as coauthors, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405857223000633#sec7">Female house surgeon stabbed to death: High time for a multi-pronged action plan to prevent and manage violence against Health care workers</a>,” relied on <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lansea/article/PIIS2772-3682(22)00080-4/fulltext">work</a> Zadey and a colleague had published earlier in <em>The Lancet Regional Health – Southeast Asia.</em></p>



<p>“They used our work but they don’t cite us,” Zadey said. “Clearly this practice of trading authorships is costing researchers like me who put in the work because these folks won’t care about reading enough or citing appropriately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zadey didn’t find an iTrilon ad matching the article about the stabbed surgeon, but he said it may have been posted before he joined iTrilon’s WhatsApp group at the end of June last year. “The authors, the journal, the topic, and most importantly the way it’s written, it fits right into everything else that I’ve seen.”</p>



<p>Update, 1/19/24, 1345 UTC: Giulia Stefenelli, chair of the scientific board of MDPI, which published two of the papers in question, told us the publisher understands &#8220;the gravity of the concerns,&#8221; but: &#8220;At this time, there is no ethics investigation related to the articles mentioned. We appreciate your diligence and invite you to provide us with any other evidence or information that would support an official investigation. It is important to note that establishing a direct link between the articles and the content advertised by the cited platform is not an easy process. The titles of the articles and the number of authors do not immediately correlate with the published material. Should we receive further evidence that clearly distinguishes the relationship to the publications unequivocally, we will proceed to initiate an official investigation. I have included MDPI&#8217;s ethics department in this communication to raise awareness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last spring, the <em>Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science</em> published a provocative paper stating that left-handed mothers in Singapore treat their LGBTQ+ children better than do right-handed moms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Except the paper, “<a href="https://journaljesbs.com/index.php/JESBS/article/view/1216">Left-Handed Mothers and LGBTQ+ Child Acceptance in Singapore: Exploring the Link through Early Life Rejection,</a>” was fake, a sting, designed to cast shade on anti-gay science proliferating in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data were fabricated, and so were the authors, Jin Rabak and Hen Guai Lan. Their purported employer, Simisai University? A bogus institution with a name concocted for laughs: in Singaporean English, “simisai” means “what the shit.” </p>



<span id="more-128553"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Retraction Watch has covered many <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/07/25/may-sting-another-journal-prank-good-overlook/">sting operations</a>. Most of them involve a scientist <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/27/a-closer-look-at-the-chocolate-with-high-cocoa-content-hoax/">submitting fake data</a> for publication so they can expose predatory journals that host junk science to collect publication fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the person behind the sting, Teo Yu Sheng, is a Singaporean activist who founded a website and company called Heckin’ Unicorn that celebrates queerness. Inspired by comedian John Oliver’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/john-oliver-fake-health-care-sharing-ministry-1234782577/">fake church</a>, Teo created a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10453038">fake paper</a> he <a href="https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/anti-lgbtq-fake-science-is-spreading-in-singapore">hoped would help discredit bad-faith arguments</a> from American conservatives that Singaporeans were using to advocate for a ban on same-sex parenting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two papers <a href="https://thembeforeus.com/study-studies-same-sex-parenting/">cited</a> in these arguments had been published in the <em>Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science</em>. So Teo, a self-described “science nerd,” hatched a plan.</p>



<p>“I was just reading up on all of the things that people were citing as evidence that queerness is wrong or bad,” he told Retraction Watch. And then he got the idea to submit a fake paper to the journal, “Just to prove that it&#8217;s just bullshit, that anyone can send random shit and it&#8217;s gonna get published.”</p>



<p>Teo says he wrote the manuscript in three days. After edits from friends, he sent it to the journal on March 5, according to emails obtained by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine days and a $140 fee later, the journal published the article with minimal changes and no questions about the data, methodology or the authors’ background. The only significant change: the journal had revised the paper’s submission date from March 5 to January 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teo was furious:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to publish anything without caring whether it&#8217;s true or not, but it&#8217;s another thing to actively lie. They said that they received it in January. Unless they have a time machine, that’s just impossible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M. B. Mondal, the journal’s publisher, said the date change was a “typo-error by the proof editor.” She says that the journal retracted the article several months later on October 16, 2023:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We became aware of the problem of the fake paper from different internet forums/blogs around the last week of September 2023. Exact date I can not remember. After careful review by the expert committee, the article was retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mondal declined to elaborate on what “careful review” meant. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper is no longer available on the journal’s website, and its abstract has been replaced with the sentence, “This article is Retracted.” </p>



<p>However, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87096F90F125A71845BC34EF14BA64#">flagged</a> the article’s retraction in December, at which point the abstract read, “This article is under investigation.” When asked what the journal was investigating two months after the retraction, Mondal also declined to comment. (The journal’s publisher, ScienceDomain International, has previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/16/hydroxychloroquine-push-scooters-and-covid-19-a-journal-gets-stung-and-swiftly-retracts/">come under scrutiny</a> for publishing suspect science.)</p>



<p>Teo learned the paper had been retracted from the PubPeer notification; the journal had not communicated with him about the retraction. He published videos and a <a href="https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/anti-lgbtq-fake-science-is-spreading-in-singapore">lengthy article</a> in September describing his fake paper and its problems, as well as discussing why the articles he sought to undermine were also scientifically flawed. He admitted that he has no formal scientific training, but was taught how to analyze scientific papers in school.</p>



<p>Teo says his lack of expertise make the journal’s flimsy standards all the more damning: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It took <em>nine</em> days to get it published. It took me on and off about a year to research and write down why the science was wrong. So that gives you a sense of how quick it is to turn out rubbish and get it published, and how much more difficult it is to go through the details and explain why something doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s significantly more difficult to debunk false information than it is to create conspiracy theories of fake scientific evidence or knowledge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-tun-oxidation-suspended-animation">Here’s how tardigrades go into suspended animation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers have discovered a molecular sensor that tells tardigrades it’s time to toughen up.</p>



<p>The tiny eight-legged animals, also known as water bears or moss piglets, are nearly invincible when dormant. When times get tough, the microscopic invertebrates curl into a ball called a tun. They pull in their legs, jettison water, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-bears-glass-all-full">turn their insides to glass</a>, and slow their metabolism to imperceptible levels (<em>SN: 12/16/15</em>). In that state, tardigrades are able to withstand completely drying out, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-space-travel-survival-humans">trips into space, X-rays </a>and other extreme insults, but aren’t entirely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-survival-shot-gun-crash-landing-planet">bulletproof</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/22; SN: 6/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Tardigrades aren’t extremophiles, they’re extremo-tolerant,” says Derrick Kolling, a chemist at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va.</p>



<p>Chemical changes called oxidation to the amino acid cysteine <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trigger the tun state</a>, Kolling and colleagues discovered. Reversing that oxidation process brings tardigrades out of dormancy, the team reports January 17 in <em>PLOS One</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have long wondered what prompts tardigrades’ entry and emergence from the tun state, says Hans Ramløv, a comparative physiologist at Roskilde University in Denmark who was not involved in the study. Knowing that cysteine oxidation is the key is “inspirational,” but also, “it is a little bit irritating for myself, because I have always claimed that the transformation was passive, and now I can see that it is definitely not passive.”</p>



<p>The finding helps explain some aspects of water bear biology, and perhaps that of other organisms that go into suspended animation, when metabolism drops to nothing and the animals are essentially dead, Ramløv says. For instance, tardigrades have very high metabolism when they emerge from dormancy. That may be because they are actively reversing cysteine oxidation and repairing damage caused by oxidation, he says. But a fundamental question remains. “It obviously does not explain how you can stop metabolism and die and restart metabolism and live.”</p>



<p>The project came about “on a whim,” Kolling says. “We were curious about tardigrades. They&#8217;ve been in the news quite a bit.” So he told his lab, “tardigrades are easy to get. Let&#8217;s get some and let&#8217;s put them in an instrument we have here.” That instrument was an EPR spectrometer. Scientists use it to study atoms and molecules that have unpaired electrons.</p>



<p>Using the instrument, Kolling and colleagues saw that as <em>Hypsibius exemplaris</em> tardigrades entered the tun state, levels of superoxides shot up. Superoxides are molecules of oxygen that have had an electron added, leaving one electron unpaired and ready to react with other atoms and molecules. The unstable chemicals, sometimes called reactive oxygen species or free radicals, can damage proteins and other components of cells.</p>



<p>But superoxides can also be used to send signals, says Leslie Hicks, a chemist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her lab teamed with Kolling’s to decipher what was happening to the tardigrades. One of the researchers’ first steps was to expose tardigrades to a type of stress they wouldn’t normally encounter.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s throw hydrogen peroxide at the bears and see if they can form tuns as a result of that stress,” Hicks recalls telling her colleagues. The team tested various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, a powerful oxidizing chemical. Sure enough, the tardigrades went into tun mode in dilute hydrogen peroxide. Removing the hydrogen peroxide woke the water bears up again. That told the researchers that oxidation was an important signal for entering and leaving dormancy.</p>



<p>Drilling down further, Hicks and colleagues examined oxidation of cysteine, one of the amino acids that make up proteins in living things. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide or other unstable chemicals can cause chemical changes to cysteine, some reversible and some not. In turn, those changes can alter the structure and enzyme activity of proteins.</p>



<p>Blocking cysteine oxidation prevented tardigrades from forming tuns triggered by exposure to high levels of salt or sugar, the team found. Blocking cysteine oxidation also wiped out the tardigrades’ ability to survive freezing, although the resilient little animals don’t form tuns when frozen. That suggests that cysteine oxidation may be an important player in all the water bears’ survival mechanisms, Hicks says.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t test drying, says Kazuharu Arakawa, a systems biologist at Keio University in Fujisawa, Japan, not involved in the study. He’s curious to find out whether other species of tardigrades that can tolerate drying without forming tuns also rely on oxidation. Oxidation may be important for other species unrelated to tardigrades, too, Arakawa says. For instance, other researchers have shown that oxidation is important for some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567724923000892?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midges to survive drying out</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-museum-exhibit-survival-environment">A new exhibit invites you into the ‘Secret World of Elephants’</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of years, over a dozen species of proboscideans, the group that includes mammoths, mastodons and elephants, roamed landscapes as varied as Arctic tundra and African savannas. Then, around 11,700 years ago, as the last ice age waned and human hunting picked up, this number dwindled to just three: the Asian elephant, the African forest elephant and the African savanna elephant — all of which are now endangered.</p>



<p>Losing elephants comes with a far-reaching and underappreciated impact, warns “<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/secret-world-elephants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret World of Elephants</a>.” The exhibit, now on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, explores that impact, as well as what modern science is revealing about elephant minds and bodies.</p>



<p>As ecosystem engineers, modern elephants transform their environments. Because these herbivores are so big, they eat a lot, poop a lot and travel far to graze, dispersing mounds of viable seeds far and wide. The beasts also trample fields, making room for a diversity of plants, and dig enormous water holes that other animals use too. In North American grasslands, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-mammoths-competed-other-animals-and-lost">the departure of mammoths</a> and other large herbivores homogenized the land, covering rich landscapes with slow-growing plants and invasive weeds (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 22</em>), says curator Ross MacPhee, a mammalogist at the museum.</p>



<p>The loss is cultural too. Though the exhibit is small, it’s packed with displays focusing on how elephants shape — or have been incorporated into — our lives. The animals appear in early cave drawings and in religious stories. (This connection hasn’t always benefited elephants, though, as humans have trained them as war steeds and circus performers.)</p>



<p>The exhibit aims to rekindle our connection with elephants by emphasizing that they, too, are smart and social creatures. They can recognize themselves in mirrors, a potential sign of self-awareness, and can use tools. Videos in the exhibit show elephants playing with and comforting one another. By pressing buttons on an interactive board, visitors can also hear calls that appear to convey fear, affection and annoyance.</p>



<p>Much of the exhibit’s appeal comes from its exploration of how elephants differ from us. The animals, for instance, hear not just with their ears but also with their feet, picking up on the subtle vibrations of the ground beneath them. They also have a superior sense of smell, with more smell receptor genes than even dogs. And it’s hard to fathom that the average adult male African elephant consumes some 150 kilograms of food every day.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/secret-world-elephants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret World of Elephants</a>&#8220;</h3>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Now Open</h5>

<p>It’s amazing to see all that researchers can glean from what the animals leave behind. Chemical analyses of tusks, for instance, can reveal what an elephant ate and where it traveled during its lifetime. DNA samples, meanwhile, show unexpected evolutionary connections between elephants and animals that look nothing like them, including aardvarks and tenrecs.</p>



<p>By including grand visuals and tactile elements, the exhibit is appealing to visitors of all ages. During my visit, a group of schoolchildren admired a life-size model of an elephant and stroked a replica of the creature’s wrinkly skin. I ran my fingers along the ridges of a fossilized mammoth tooth and better understood how they served as a tool for grinding up tough grasses.</p>



<p>Overall, the exhibit sparks both curiosity and alarm. “If we don’t act quickly,” a sign states, “elephants could be gone before we ever truly get to know them.” The exhibit’s curators hope that “The Secret Lives of Elephants” inspires visitors to help stave off the animals’ extinction.</p>



<p>Supporting local nonprofits that protect elephant habitats is one way individuals can help, the exhibit suggests. Another is to abstain from purchasing ivory or other elephant products. Although it is illegal to sell ivory in the United States, the European Union and China, a thriving black market fuels rampant poaching, on such a scale that some elephants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskless-elephants-evolution-poaching">may be evolving to lose their characteristic tusks</a> (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 15</em>). </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-dogs-wag-tails-communication-evolution">Some mysteries remain about why dogs wag their tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to tail wagging among dogs, some questions still hound researchers.</p>



<p>We know that domesticated dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) use their tails to communicate — with other dogs as well as humans — and even what various types of wags mean, researchers note in a new review of the scientific literature. But <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2023.0407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t know why dogs seem to wag more</a> than other canines or even how much of it is under their control, ethologist Silvia Leonetti and colleagues report January 17 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“Among all possible animal behavior that humans experience in everyday life, domestic dog tail wagging is one of the most common,” says Leonetti, who is now at the University of Turin in Italy. “But a lot of dog behavior remains a scientific enigma.”</p>



<p>So Leonetti and her colleagues pored through previous studies to figure out what elements of tail wagging are understood and which remain mysterious. They also hypothesized about the behavior’s origins: Perhaps tail wagging placates some human need for rhythm, the researchers suggest, or maybe the behavior is a genetic tagalong, a trait tied to others that humans bred into domesticated dogs.</p>



<p>“People think wagging tail equals happy dog. But it&#8217;s actually a lot more complicated than that,” says Emily Bray, an expert in canine cognition at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not involved with the work. Understanding why dogs wag their tails is important partly from an animal welfare perspective, she says, as it could help dog owners read their pups’ cues better.</p>



<p>One main thing that researchers know about tail wagging is that it’s used predominantly for communication instead of locomotion, like a whale, or swatting away bugs, like a horse. Wagging also means different things depending on how the tail is wagged, such as its height or side-to-side movement.</p>



<p>For example, when the tail wags more to the right, the researchers say, it typically means the dog is interested in a stimulus or wants to approach something. But when it wags more to the left, it signals uncertainty or wanting to withdraw<em>. </em>When wagged low and near the legs, it’s a sign of submission or insecurity. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/wag-dog-when-left-vs-right-matters">Dogs can interpret and react differently</a> to these varied wags (<em>SN: 11/1/13).</em></p>



<p>But for such a ubiquitous behavior, questions abound. One gap is how much tail wagging is under dogs’ conscious control, the team reports. Several studies have also observed that dogs wag their tails more than other canines, particularly compared with their closest relative, the wolf (<em>C. lupus</em>) — but scientists don’t yet know why.</p>



<p>One idea is the domesticated rhythmic wagging hypothesis, Leonetti and colleagues suggest. Scientists know that humans’ brains respond positively to rhythm, and because tail wagging is a rhythmic behavior, the authors suggest it could be that humans consciously or unconsciously preferred dogs that wag more.</p>



<p>Or the domestication syndrome hypothesis could be at work. It’s an existing theory that unintended, genetically linked traits can pop up when specific traits are bred for through domestication. Perhaps, the researchers propose, the canine characteristics that humans found desirable to breed for — such as temperament — might be genetically linked to tail wagging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Tom Reimchen isn’t so sure about either hypothesis. He’s skeptical that domestic dogs do wag their tails more than other canines. More research is needed to compare tail wagging between nondomestic canine species and the epigenetic influences behind&nbsp; canids’ tail wagging, says Reimchen, of the University of Victoria in British Columbia.</p>



<p>Leonetti, who did the work while at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, Netherlands, says a multidisciplinary approach would be helpful in future tail wagging research, for example combining neurology, cognition and physiology. Because the domestication process was also an evolutionary process — one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-domestication-origin-mythology-history">humans were involved in</a> — studying dog behavior and their wags could reveal something about us too, she says (<em>SN: 9/7/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It “can shed light not only on our understanding of dog behavior, but also we’ll then understand something about human psychology.”</p>

<p>Publishing a research paper is usually cause for celebration, after what is typically years of effort. Our recent paper in which we found that unexpectedly high proportions of papers in two journals <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-023-02846-2">described at least one wrongly identified reagent</a> should have been no exception.</p>



<p>But alas. Any of our celebrations have been tempered by Springer Nature’s bizarre introduction of an unrelated figure into the paper. Here’s what has happened so far.</p>



<span id="more-128577"></span>



<p>We initially posted the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.03.526922v1">manuscript on <em>bioRxiv</em></a> in February 2023, and then submitted it to a journal. Unusually, we withdrew the manuscript after 4 rounds of revisions, as the editors required changes to our discussion of research paper mills that we did not accept. We then submitted the revised version to <em>Naunyn-Schmiedeberg&#8217;s Archives of Pharmacology</em>. The manuscript was accepted after further revisions and published online on January 9, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, on checking the published version, I was dismayed to find that Figure 1 had been replaced by an unrelated figure that we neither produced nor submitted for publication. The error was easy to spot: The correct Figure 1 compared the journal impact factors of <em>Molecular Cancer</em> and <em>Oncogene</em> from 2014-2021, while the substituted figure shows an unrelated Kaplan Meier plot. The proof returned to Springer Nature included the correct versions of all of the figures, so neither the authors nor the journal were responsible for the error.</p>



<p>I immediately wrote to Springer Nature about the error and copied the <em>NSAP</em> Editor in Chief, Roland Seifert. As I found the error on the day that the article was published, we hoped that the figure could be simply and quickly replaced. However, following email exchanges with Springer Nature representatives, it appears that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The problem here is that at the moment of online publication the paper becomes part of the scientific literature and the metadata of the publication are distributed to all relevant Abstracting+Indexing services. Though technically it would not be a problem to remove the paper from the website, we cannot do this since it is already officially published.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>To date, while the publisher has now fixed the PDF, the incorrect figure remains visible in the freely available HTML version to users who have not cleared their caches. The publication has been accessed more than 300 times. Springer Nature has yet to provide an explanation of how the figure substitution occurred.</p>



<p>Clearly, a nonsensical figure in a paper about incorrect reagents is particularly unfortunate. It is similarly unfortunate that a publisher error that probably required minutes to achieve has no similarly quick path to correction. In the meantime, the authors’, the journal’s and the editor’s reputations risk being compromised, and time is wasted on communications that could have been devoted to celebrating this paper, or writing the next one.</p>



<p>While we are probably not the only group to have experienced a figure substitution by a publisher, some such errors may have gone unnoticed, as many authors might not expect or check for publisher errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The possibility of figure replacements by publishers highlights another advantage of preprints- the correct version of Figure 1 remains online at <em>bioRxiv</em>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aging-geroscience-health-span-drugs">Is aging without illness possible?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Each morning after breakfast, Scott Broadbent takes a plastic bottle from the refrigerator in his home in Alameda, Calif., pops the top, and drinks the contents, 2.5&nbsp;ounces of milky liquid. “It has sort of a pineapple creamy flavor,” he says. “It’s really not bad.”</p>



<p>The bottle might contain ketone ester, a supplement meant to help the body burn fat instead of carbohydrates. Researchers are now testing whether it might also slow the aging process. Or Broadbent might instead be getting a placebo. He is part of a clinical trial at the nearby Buck Institute for Research on Aging to assess the supplement’s safety and side effects in older adults.</p>



<p>A retired chemist who used to work for pharmaceutical companies, Broadbent is 70 and in excellent health today, but he worries about the future. He’s not necessarily afraid of dying, but he doesn’t want to be sick and in pain as he grows older. His dad had Parkinson’s disease. Broadbent survived prostate cancer and recently developed tinnitus, which spooked him and sparked anxiety attacks. “I thought if I had to live like this the rest of my life, I don’t know if I’d want to do it,” he says.</p>



<p>Some scientists think there’s a better way. These researchers — part of a burgeoning field called “geroscience” — aren’t seeking immortality. The focus is much more pragmatic: By addressing the root causes of aging, they hope to stave off the disability and diseases that can make old age so miserable. They want to help people feel healthy for longer, compressing the years of illness that often accompany old age into a much shorter time frame. &#8220;Let’s build a medicine that would be safe enough for someone in midlife to take almost like a supplement, like a daily vitamin, but with much more profound biological effects,” says James Peyer, CEO of Cambrian Bio in New York City.</p>



<p>Just don’t call these potential medicines antiaging therapies. “That term is associated with an industry that is trying to sell products to the public to separate people from their money,” says S. Jay Olshansky, a demographer and geroscientist at the University of Illinois Chicago. The antiaging market includes everything from face creams meant to zap wrinkles to pills that promise to turn back the clock. “It’s bogus,” he says. Geroscientists instead are doing legitimate research at respected research institutions to find medicines that can slow the aging process. Many of the compounds under study show promise in mice and even humans, and some are in clinical trials.</p>



<p>Better health in old age is not just about individual benefits. By 2030, 73 million <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby boomers in the United States</a> will be 65 or older. By the same year, <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts project,</a> there will be a billion people 65 and older globally. And though people are living longer, they are not necessarily living healthier than previous generations. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An aging population</h3>



<p>Estimates suggest there will be a billion people age 65 and older globally by the year 2030, and the global figure could hit 2.5 billion by the end of the century.</p>

<p>“There’s this fear of what is this going to do to our health care system,” says Laura Niedernhofer, a geneticist and researcher studying aging at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “And it goes well beyond just health care. We don’t have the nursing homes. We don’t have the personal care staff to deal with this at all.” Drugs to help keep older adults healthy, active and independent would be a societal boon.</p>



<p>But whether developing such drugs is even possible remains to be seen. Getting the medicines to market means securing more funding, overcoming stumbling blocks related to study design and combating near constant hype.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How did geroscience begin?</h4>



<p>The advent of modern medicine and public health has more than doubled the average human life span — from about 30 in the early 1800s to more than 70 today. “This is perhaps one of the biggest things that has happened to humankind, period,” says Jamie Justice, a geroscientist who heads the health domain at the XPRIZE Foundation, which holds competitions to spur technological developments and <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/healthspan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a new prize related to aging</a> in November. “We are a lot less dead than we used to be because of where public health and modern medicine has gotten us.”</p>



<p>There’s a downside, of course. We’re living long enough to see the frailty and illness that comes with old age. Cells stop dividing, DNA degrades, the immune system falters. We become increasingly vulnerable to disease. Many of us spend our last decades beset by medical maladies — broken bones, weakness, dementia, cancer, heart disease and more. Doctors can do little more than play whack-a-mole, beating back illnesses one at a time.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists thought the gradual decline that comes with old age was unavoidable. But experiments in the 1980s and ’90s suggested that the process might not be so fixed.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8247153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one notable experiment</a>, Cynthia Kenyon, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues found that mutations in a single gene in the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/long-lived-worm-hints-genetics-aging">could double its life span</a>. Typical 13-day-old worms barely moved. “The animal is clearly in the nursing home,” Kenyon said <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_kenyon_experiments_that_hint_of_longer_lives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a 2011 TED Talk</a>. The mutant worms moved as if they were much younger, and they lived longer too.</p>



<p>For researchers interested in human health, this and similar findings from other teams led to a profound realization: Perhaps the aging process is malleable. If so, scientists might be able to develop therapies to attack the root of aging rather than simply combating the pileup of diseases.</p>



<p>By the late 2000s, “the whole perspective of the scientific community changed,” says Felipe Sierra, who was then a program officer at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md. Aging biology moved from a phase of description into a phase of molecular investigation. Sierra wanted a name to bring the field together. He landed on <em>geroscience</em>, a word he had first seen in a grant proposal by another researcher studying aging, Gordon Lithgow. “Gero-” comes from the Greek word for old man. It wasn’t difficult to convince other researchers to get on board. “Everybody listened to me because I was in charge of the money,” says Sierra, now chief scientific officer at <a href="https://hevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hevolution Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that funds geroscience research.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What compounds might fight aging?</h4>



<p>Though there are no proven therapies for people yet, geroscientists are eyeing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/healthy-old-age-may-trump-immortality">several compounds that can slow the aging process</a>, at least in worms, fruit flies and mice. Some have already been tested in humans, and many more clinical trials are under way. Which will work? “Let me see. Let me look at the crystal ball,” Sierra jokes. “Who knows?”</p>



<p>Perhaps the best studied is rapamycin, a compound first discovered in a soil sample collected in 1964 from Rapa Nui, or Easter Island. Today, people who receive organ transplants take the drug to help keep their immune systems from rejecting the foreign tissue. But rapamycin also prolongs life in yeast, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041310900374X#bib22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flies</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19587680/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mice</a>. And it’s being tested in people in clinical trials. How it counters aging isn’t entirely clear. The drug inhibits a protein complex called mechanistic target of rapamycin, mTOR for short, which plays a role in cell growth and protein synthesis. This inhibition appears to have wide-ranging effects, including reducing inflammation, clearing old and damaged cells, and altering cellular metabolism — some of the key processes that researchers think are to blame for the aging process.</p>



<p>Rapamycin isn’t the only drug to impact mTOR. Researchers at the biotech company resTORbio tested other mTOR inhibitors in elderly adults to try and improve immune function. About 250&nbsp;people participated in the clinical trial, which tested two mTOR inhibitors alone and in combination compared with a placebo. In 2018, the team reported that those who received the drugs <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29997249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had fewer infections and mounted a better response to the flu vaccin</a>e. The company tried one of those compounds in a subsequent study, though, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33977284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it failed to show an effect on self-reported respiratory illnesses</a>. resTORbio no longer exists, but the company’s chief medical officer, Joan Mannick, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00416-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t given up on mTOR inhibitors</a>. She cofounded a new company called Tornado Therapeutics, based in New York City, that is working to develop new rapamycin analogs, or “rapalogs.”</p>



<p>Another promising class of drugs targets cells that have stopped dividing but don’t die. These senescent cells release chemical signals that can trigger inflammation, disrupt tissue repair and harm neighboring cells. In some cases, these signals even prod neighbors to become senescent too.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01923-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The drugs, called senolytics</a>, aim to eliminate senescent cells by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/removing-worn-out-cells-makes-mice-live-longer-and-prosper">prompting them to commit suicide</a>. After showing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29988130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promising results in mice</a>, senolytics are now being tested in humans. More than 25 clinical trials have either been completed or are under way.</p>



<p>One of the most commonly tested senolytic regimens is a combination of two compounds: the anticancer drug dasatinib and quercetin, an antioxidant that occurs naturally in grapes, berries and other fruits and vegetables. Other research efforts plan to compare fisetin, a compound found in strawberries and apples, with a placebo to see if it has an impact on frailty and markers of inflammation in the blood.</p>



<p>Unity Biotechnology, based in San Francisco, is focused on senolytic therapies exclusively. The company’s most advanced compound, called UBX1325, targets a protein abundant in the blood vessels and retina that regulates cell death. Preliminary results from a trial in patients with diabetic macular edema, a thickening of the retina related to diabetes, suggest that the compound can improve eyesight.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12 hallmarks of aging</h3>



<p>Researchers have identified a dozen hallmarks of aging that appear capable of nudging life span — and likely health span — one way or another across a range of animals. A network of interactions among genes and their products underlies these interconnected hallmarks, and it’s that network that drugs such as rapamycin and senolytics are targeting.</p>

<p>Diet is also known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/healthy-aging-pill">profoundly affect the aging process</a>. Studies have found that the low-carb ketogenic diet, for example, can help mice live longer. But restrictive diets can be hard to follow and have side effects. Broadbent followed the ketogenic diet for a month or so, but his cholesterol levels went dramatically up. Ketone ester, the compound Broadbent might be downing each morning for the Buck Institute’s clinical trial, may mimic the longevity benefits of such diets.</p>



<p>When the body runs out of glucose to use for energy, the liver creates another source by converting fat into molecules called ketone bodies. “If we don’t eat for a day or so, we’ll start to make ketone bodies,” says John Newman, a geriatrician at the Buck Institute who is leading the trial. “And we’ll make more and more the longer that we starve in order to fuel our bodies.” These compounds are more than just fuel. They help regulate inflammation and control other cellular processes, many of them involved in the aging process. Drinking ketone esters, which quickly break down, is a way to deliver the ketone bodies without the diet.</p>



<p>Among the dozens of clinical trials testing potential gerotherapies, very few are yet assessing their ability to prevent the onslaught of diseases that come with aging. Instead, the goal is establishing safety or seeing whether a compound can nudge some biomarker in the right direction. And many of the potential treatments under study are natural compounds or existing drugs that are already off patent, which might leave drug companies hesitant to invest in future trials or to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies.</p>



<p>What’s more, as James Kirkland, a geriatrician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., points out, many of the clinical trials happening now will fail. “In fact, most will,” he says. That’s just a part of drug development.</p>



<p>For now, some companies are bolstering their chances of success by pursuing many options. Cambrian Bio, the parent company of Tornado Therapeutics, for example, is “taking a number of different shots on goal,” Peyer says. “We don’t know which drug is going to really be the first multidisease preventative.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the barriers to progress?</h4>



<p>One of the big challenges for geroscience is to figure out how to show that a compound prevents age-related diseases in people. Scientists would have to give the drug to healthy people and then track their health as they age, an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. “In mice, it takes us four years. In humans, it would take decades and tens of thousands of people,” Niedernhofer says.</p>



<p>An easier path to the clinic would be to develop these therapies as a treatment for a single disease rather than a multidisease preventive. “That’s something that the FDA is very comfortable with,” says Nathan LeBrasseur, a researcher studying aging at the Mayo Clinic. Once the drug is approved for one indication, it would be much easier to seek approval for others — and potentially widen to a preventive. “The absolute irony of all of this is, to try and advance geroscience, we’re going right back to the old way of doing things, which is one disease at a time,” Niedernhofer says. For example, Unity is developing its lead antiaging candidates as therapies for a variety of eye diseases.</p>



<p>One group of researchers, however, has developed a clever work-around. Rather than treating healthy people and waiting for them to age, the team has devised a study that will recruit people who have one age-related disease and assess whether a drug reduces the time it takes to develop another. In this case, the researchers have chosen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/old-drug-new-tricks">the diabetes drug metformin</a>. Metformin has a long safety record, and studies suggest it can <a href="https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-019-0900-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6497052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.984559/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive decline</a>. Metformin may even <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00299-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the risk of long COVID</a>. The precise mechanisms that underpin these effects aren’t entirely clear. The study, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5943638/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Targeting Aging with Metformin, or TAME,</a> will look at things such as cardiovascular events, cancer, cognitive decline, dementia and death.</p>



<p>But nearly eight years after investigators first announced the 3,000-person trial, they’re still trying to get together funding. Metformin is cheap and readily available, no longer protected by a patent, so drug companies have no incentive to develop it for aging. Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who is leading the study, has started telling people the trial will start in January. “And as long as I don’t say which year, it will be true,” he jokes.</p>



<p>Part of what holds the field back is society’s approach to medicine, says Justice, of the XPRIZE Foundation. “We have a model of medicine that prioritizes treatment of diseases,” she says. “You get one disease. You treat one disease. You restore homeostasis.” But that approach isn’t relevant for aging. Geroscientists also have to fight society’s views of aging. The mind-set is “things get old. It just happens. There’s nothing you can do, just let it go,” Justice says. “I think that is actually a fundamentally ageist view, as if people who are older don’t have a right to health.”</p>



<p>Geroscientist Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington in Seattle agrees. No one would argue that we shouldn’t develop therapies for Alzheimer’s or cancer because these diseases are a natural part of getting older. So, he asks, why would this argument hold for aging? “I don’t really see what the field is trying to do as any different than trying to cure disease,” he says. “It’s just a much more efficient and effective approach, or it’s likely to be.”</p>



<p>Kaeberlein thinks dogs, because they age much faster than people, could bridge the gap between lab studies in mice and therapy approval. “You can do longevity clinical trials in dogs that you can’t do in people,” he says. And companion animal medications are regulated much like human medications.

<p>But even if geroscientists find compounds that treat the decline that comes with aging, it’s not clear whether they will compress the period of age-related illness — that’s the goal — or simply delay it. It’s also uncertain whether such therapies might add to the average life span and, if so, how many years. John Davis, an ethicist at California State University, Fullerton, worries about how such increases might affect demographics. If the average life span jumps to 120 years, the effects aren’t too pronounced, he says. If it goes far longer, there is the potential for “really spectacular increases in population on a planet that I personally feel is already overloaded.” And then there are concerns about how longer life might impact existing inequalities. “Billionaires who live longer have more time to accumulate even more wealth,” Davis adds.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Beware the antiaging hype</h4>



<p>There’s another potential obstacle: hype.</p>



<p>No one can say with any certainty that there will be a pill to prevent aging. Yet that hasn’t stopped some companies and less scrupulous researchers from cashing in. The public’s interest in escaping aging makes overselling results enticing. In 2019, for example, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/important-information-about-young-donor-plasma-infusions-profit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA warned consumers against receiving infusions of plasma from young donors</a>, which some companies offered for $8,000 a liter. The treatment was based on promising mouse studies that gave older mice blood from younger mice, either via transfusions or by connecting the two animals’ circulatory systems. The young blood appeared to rejuvenate the older animals’ muscles, livers and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-blood-proven-good-old-brain?mode=pick&amp;context=151">brains</a>, but the benefits haven’t been proved in human patients.</p>



<p>The internet is likewise rife with supplements and even prescription medications with purported antiaging benefits. Many of the pills being touted as age-reversing miracle drugs are the same compounds geroscientists are currently testing in trials. “[Companies] start trying to sell it to the public before it’s been tested for safety and efficacy,” Olshansky says. That can make it especially difficult for consumers trying to sort fiction from fact.</p>



<p>LeBrasseur is concerned that if scientists oversell their progress, they run the risk of losing public trust. And a rush to clinical trials might lead to safety problems. “If something bad happens, that’s going to set the entire field back,” he says. “I just think we have to be patient and humble.”</p>



<p>A student of Newman’s, at the Buck Institute, asked him recently how geroscience has changed clinical practice. “The honest answer is it hasn’t at all,” he says. “We’re still building the data. We’re still running the clinical trials waiting for it to come in. And this all takes time.”</p>



<p>But Broadbent, and many others, aren’t satisfied waiting for settled science. He likes to do his own research, and ketone ester seems like a good bet. The particular product he may be drinking as part of the clinical trial is now being sold as a supplement, and he plans to continue taking it after the trial ends. “I’ll sign up right away,” he says. “I’ll be on an annual subscription.”</p>



<p>Many scientists are convinced that the geroscience revolution is coming. Until then, there’s a tried-and-true method for improving your health span. It’s the advice any doctor will give you: Eat a balanced diet, exercise, get vaccinated and avoid tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p>Ten days after retracting nine papers from several journals because they were “lacking scientific base,” a publisher says it has “parted company” with the editor of five of the titles – who had authored or co-authored the papers in question.</p>



<p>As Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/09/studies-claiming-islamic-practices-protect-against-disease-and-sexual-harassment-retracted/">reported last week</a>, Thieme International retracted the papers, by Hüseyin Çaksen of Necmettin Erbakan University in Turkey, following criticism on social media and at least one story in the Turkish press. Yesterday, a Thieme account on X (formerly Twitter) posted:</p>

<p>We asked Thieme which editor the post referred to. A spokesperson told us:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-new-battery">Artificial intelligence helped scientists create a new type of battery </a></h4>

              
                <p>In the hunt for new materials, scientists have traditionally relied on tinkering in the lab, guided by intuition, with a hefty serving of trial and error.</p>



<p>But now a new battery material has been discovered by combining two computing superpowers: artificial intelligence and supercomputing. It’s a discovery that highlights the potential for using computers to help scientists discover materials suited to specific needs, from batteries to carbon capture technologies to catalysts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calculations&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winnowed down more than 32 million candidate materials</a>&nbsp;to just 23 promising options, researchers from Microsoft and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, or PNNL, report in a paper submitted January 8 to arXiv.org. The team then synthesized and tested one of those materials and created a working battery prototype.</p>



<p>While scientists have used AI to predict materials’ properties before, previous studies typically haven’t seen that process through to producing the new material. “The nice thing about this paper is that it goes all the way from start to finish,” says computational materials scientist Shyue Ping Ong of the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The researchers targeted a coveted type of battery material: a solid electrolyte. An electrolyte is a material that transfers ions — electrically charged atoms — back and forth between a battery’s electrodes. In standard lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte is a liquid. But that comes with hazards, like batteries leaking or causing fires. Developing batteries with solid electrolytes is a major aim of materials scientists.</p>



<p>The original 32 million candidates were generated via a game of mix-and-match, substituting different elements in crystal structures of known materials. Sorting through a list this large with traditional physics calculations would have taken decades, says computational chemist Nathan Baker of Microsoft. But with machine learning techniques, which can make quick predictions based on patterns learned from known materials, the calculation produced results in just 80 hours.</p>



<p>First, the researchers used AI to filter the materials based on stability, namely, whether they could actually exist in the real world. That pared the list down to fewer than 600,000 candidates. Further AI analysis selected candidates likely to have the electrical and chemical properties necessary for batteries. Because AI models are approximate, the researchers filtered this smaller list using tried-and-tested, computationally intensive methods based on physics. They also weeded out rare, toxic or expensive materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That left the researchers with 23 candidates, five of which were already known. Researchers at PNNL picked a material that looked promising — it was related to other materials that the researchers knew how to make in the lab, and it had suitable stability and conductivity. Then they set to work synthesizing it, eventually fashioning it into a prototype battery. And it worked.</p>



<p>“That’s when we got very excited,” says materials scientist Vijay Murugesan of PNNL in Richland, Wash. Going from the synthesis stage to the functional battery took about six months. “That is superfast.”</p>



<p>The new electrolyte is similar to a known material containing lithium, yttrium and chlorine,&nbsp;&nbsp;but swaps some lithium for sodium — an advantage as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">lithium is costly and in high demand</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>).</p>



<p>Combining lithium and sodium is unconventional. “In a usual approach … we would not mix these two together,” says materials scientist Yan Zeng of Florida State University in Tallahassee, who was not involved in the research. The typical practice is to use either lithium or sodium ions as a conductor, not both. The two types of ions might be expected to compete with one another, resulting in worse performance. The unorthodox material highlights one hope for AI in research, Zeng says: “AI can sort of step out of the box.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the new work, the researchers created a series of AI models that could predict different properties of a material, based on training data from known materials. The AI architecture is a type known as a graph neural network, in which a system is represented as a graph, a mathematical structure composed of “edges” and “nodes.” This type of model is particularly suited for describing materials, as the nodes can represent atoms, and the edges can represent bonds between the elements.</p>



<p>To perform both the AI and physics-based calculations, the team used Microsoft’s Azure Quantum Elements, which provides access to a cloud-based supercomputer tailored for chemistry and materials science research.</p>



<p>The project, Baker says, is an example of a practice known in tech circles as “eating your own dog food,” in which a company uses its own product to confirm that it works. In the future, he says he hopes others will pick up the tool and use it for a variety of scientific endeavors.</p>



<p>The study is one of many efforts to use AI to discover new materials. In November, researchers from Google DeepMind used graph neural networks to predict the existence of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of stable materials</a>, they reported in the Dec. 7&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>. And in the same issue of&nbsp;<em>Nature,</em>&nbsp;Zeng and colleagues reported on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06734-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laboratory</a>&nbsp;operated by AI,&nbsp;designed to produce new materials autonomously.</p>

                <p>The latest quarterly update to the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Open Science Indicators</a> (OSIs) dataset was released in December, marking the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">one year</a> anniversary of OSIs. This release includes data for more than 29,000 additional articles, and incorporates key improvements to the OSI algorithm and dataset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-1024x620.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21851" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-1024x620.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-300x182.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-768x465.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-1536x930.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/trends_4-indicators-2048x1240.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>New to the December 2023 OSI dataset</h2>



<p>OSIs are a living dataset, part of an ongoing research project with an evolving process, and we are sharing as we go&mdash;just as we ask researchers to do. With each new release, we refine, improve, and expand. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new in the most recent quarterly update.</p>



<ul><li>In addition to data from the most recent quarter, articles published in 2018 have been added to the latest release, for coverage from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2023 (5 years, 9 months). So far, this data has been analyzed for the three original indicators only: data sharing, code sharing, and preprints.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We&rsquo;ve integrated Dimensions Fields of Research categories, so that the data is more easily segmented by research discipline.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Improvements to the algorithm have been applied to the entire corpus in this release. The new approach is more efficient. Manual steps have been eliminated, and the process moved to an external cloud server. It also removes a source of false positives whereby some articles were incorrectly identified as code-generating. As a result, in the PLOS cohort, code generation has fallen by about 15%, and the percentage of articles sharing code as a function of eligible articles has increased.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21850" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-1024x614.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-300x180.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-768x460.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-1536x921.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/code-shared-2048x1228.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Q3 2023 progress</h2>



<p>With the addition of 2018 data, we can observe an acceleration in preprint adoption among PLOS authors between 2018 and 2019, likely driven by PLOS&rsquo;s <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">integration with bioRxiv</a> in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, while the preprint rate overall held steady at 25%, the Q3 2023 results show a large relative increase of PLOS articles with preprints on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">EarthArXiv</a>, following the integration with<em> PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Water</em>, and<em> PLOS Sustainability &amp; Transformation</em> in January 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="615" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-1024x615.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21852" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-1024x615.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-300x180.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-768x461.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-1536x922.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/eartharxiv-by-year-2048x1230.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The rate of data repository use reached a new high of 30% in Q3. The rate of code sharing out of all articles published was 17%, a 1% increase from Q2 and an all-time high. Code sharing out of eligible articles only was 42%.</p>



<h2>Anticipating the March 2024 OSI update</h2>



<p>The March OSI dataset will present data from the whole of 2023, tracking six full years of progress. Looking ahead, we&rsquo;ll be <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/12/15/reflections-on-ukrn-open-research-indicators-work-so-far/">working with UKRN</a> on their open research indicators, and anticipate introducing a fifth indicator later in 2024. As always, we welcome your feedback and questions, and are especially interested in hearing about how you have applied OSI data in your work, and what additional data points you would find useful.</p>



<p></p>



<h5><strong>A note on Comparator data</strong></h5>



<p>We&rsquo;ve identified inconsistencies within the makeup of the Comparator sample for Q3 23, which make it less representative of the corpus than the rest of the Comparator data. We will address this in the next release, with a reconfiguration of the Comparator sample for the quarter.</p>

<p>You can love math, but can you math love?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Scientific Reports</em> has retracted a 2023 paper that tried to do just that by imposing a numerical model onto an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun#History_and_influence">ancient Persian love story</a> that <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/art/2017/07/romeo_and_juliet_layla_and_majnun.html#:~:text=There%20is%20just%20no%20question,%22)%20and%20other%20supernatural%20effects.">may have influenced</a> Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “A fractional order nonlinear model of the love story of Layla and Majnun,” was written by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51277-3#auth-Zulqurnain-Sabir-Aff1">Zulqurnain Sabir</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51277-3#auth-Salem_Ben-Said-Aff1">Salem Ben Said</a>, both mathematicians at United Arab Emirates University. The article has been cited three times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to the abstract: </p>



<span id="more-128550"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In this study, a fractional order mathematical model using the romantic relations of the Layla and Majnun is numerically simulated by the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation neural networks. The fractional order derivatives provide more realistic solutions as compared to integer order derivatives of the mathematical model based on the romantic relationship of the Layla and Majnun.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Gram Parsons might have said, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUr9X3mic_U">love hurts</a> – causing headaches for <em>Scientific Report</em>s, which appears to have been on autoplay for this one.</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this Article because of concerns regarding the originality and scientific validity of this work.</p>



<p>An investigation conducted after its publication confirmed that it contains material that substantially overlaps with<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51277-3#ref-CR1">1</a>. Furthermore, concerns were raised about nonsensical content. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the research presented in this work.</p>



<p>Both Authors disagree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other words, not only was the paper duplicative – a fact that could easily have been detected with some screening – it’s gobbledygook – a fact that also could easily have been detected with some peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Said, the corresponding author, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As it happens, attempts by researchers to mathematize love, including that between Layla and Majnun – are <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/chsofr/v150y2021ics0960077921004458.html">more common</a> than one might expect, especially if one expected that number to approach zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those scholars is Clint Sprott, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The retracted article cites several of Sprott’s papers on romantic modeling, including a 2016 work in <em>Nonlinear Dynamics</em> titled “<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper389.pdf">Layla and Majnun: a complex love story</a>”.</p>



<p>Sprott told us he’d been unaware of the article and retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The mathematical modeling of romantic relationships has an interesting history.</p>



<p>Originally Steve Strogatz used a simple toy model of love to motivate his students to learn about differential equations, and he included the model in his popular textbook on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos. Various people (including me) were intrigued by the idea and extended it in various ways to capture common behaviors such as chaos without taking the results too seriously. </p>



<p>Every year or so someone publishes a new extension, each getting a bit more silly than the previous. The subject is fun to think about, and the papers do get a fair bit of attention, but I don&#8217;t think they have contributed much to the advance of social psychology. At best, the application of the mathematics to romance is whimsical and metaphorical.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Rafal Marszalek, the chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, told us, through a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We became aware of concerns with this paper in September 2023 and began an investigation looking into them carefully following our established processes. This included seeking expert advice from our Editorial Board.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marszalek added the journal runs plagiarism checks on all submissions:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>However, the paper with substantial material overlap cited in the retraction notice was published after the retracted paper was submitted to the journal, which will have reduced the effectiveness of the tools used for detecting duplicated content.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/journal-policies/editorial-policies#submission-policies">submission policies</a> outline our expectations for authors regrading duplicated material, and given the investigation concluded that this paper substantially overlapped with another paper, retraction was the appropriate course of action.</p>



<p>The investigation also highlighted elements of nonsensical material in the paper, which added to the decision to retract.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Could peer reviewers – or editors, for that matter – have caught that nonsense prior to publication? Marszalek demurred:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m afraid we cannot comment on the specifics of the peer review process for this or any other paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9489708/">2022 interview</a>, Marszalek tipped readers to the possibility that his journal was unafraid to operate at the edges of perspicuity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>we have the ability to put the weirdest and yet most wonderful piece of knowledge in the hands of a curious child somewhere out there, and to inspire them to do something that will change the world one day.</p>

As we wave goodbye to 2023, let’s take a moment to reflect on the incredible year that we’ve had at Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK). From engaging events, to insightful social media posts, enlightening blogs and informative newsletters, it’s been a year of growth, learning, and connection. Here are some of our highlights:</p>

<p><strong>Growing volunteer team</strong></p>
<p>This year we recruited over 20 new people to join the WiNUK volunteer team, and many new guest blog writers too.</p>

<p>After many virtual-only group meetings, we saw our first in-person volunteer meet-ups this year – including at Cambridge’s Zoology Museum, the British Neuroscience Association Festival, and New Scientist Live. I can’t wait to meet more of you this year as we develop our first in-person WiNUK events.</p>

<p>You can view our current and alumni volunteer members over on <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/team" target="_blank" ><u>Our Team page</u></a>. Keep in touch with us on social media for upcoming role openings in the team!</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/undefined"></figure>

<p>Despite being titled Women in Neuroscience UK (in relation to where our organisation has been established), we have successfully engaged volunteers, followers and event participants, globally! It’s been amazing to see you signing up for our events from 38 different countries, and to see our worldwide following on social media grow too. Regardless of our name, we want WiNUK to be a community open to people everywhere and it’s fantastic to see you taking up our opportunities!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Six educational events</strong></p>
<p>This year we aimed to deliver monthly events during term time, with our annual record of six virtual events and 555 audience sign-ups.</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_198a2939165b4ff2b57b1c64e00ade1c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_647,h_808,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>It was great to start the year with conversations on managing stress, self-care and mental health in academia. Read more about our February event,<a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/minds-matter-rethinking-mental-health-in-academia" target="_blank" ><u> ‘Minds Matter: Let’s Talk About Mental Health’</u></a>, in our blog by Lauren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In March we learned about ‘Opportunities in Dementia Research’ from representatives of ISTAART, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the UK Dementia Research Institute. This event garnered our most global audience to date, with registrants from 25 countries.</p>

<p>Our event on ‘Alternate Careers in Neuroscience’ in April, featuring a science illustrator, neuroscience communicator for children, and dementia conference organiser, was the most popular of our events this year, with 161 registrants.</p>

<p>In May we focused on stroke, and were proud to put together an event covering the experiences of a stroke survivor, innovative stroke research, as well as valuable information from Stroke Association.</p>

<p>After the summer break, our team got back to developing virtual events, with the next focusing on ‘Inclusion and Belonging: Addressing Neurodiversity’ in November. It was a fantastically balanced event between lived experience of PhD researchers with ADHD and novel research from leading neurodiversity scientists.</p>

<p>Our final event of 2023 was ‘Decoding the Application Process’. The team are very proud of our new Events Team volunteers who hosted this one excellently, fielding fantastic questions from the audience to our panel of experts across academic career stages, as well as industry.</p>

<p>We’re still working on detailed evaluation of the feedback and impact of our 2023 events to include in WiNUK’s Annual Impact Report- keep your eyes peeled for this!</p>
<p>For any events you missed from 2023, head to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xZxubRWEr3MT0zI6ip_Bw" target="_blank" ><u>YouTube channel</u></a> to catch up.</p>

<p><strong>Social media community growth</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_b226b7f736b54ebe945f7026384dee36~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_582,h_727,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>This year our social media really took off, with 132 new posts to our Instagram, X and LinkedIn, and each of these are now at almost 1000 followers. You appreciated our virtual events being recorded to catch up with on our YouTube channel too.</p>

<p>You enjoyed our social media ‘how to’ guides on scientific papers and CVs, as well as our advice on fostering inclusive working environments, specifically on neurodiversity and gender equity.</p>

<p>Our most popular content, across all engagement metrics, included statistics on the decline in female scientists with increasing career stage seniority. I am, personally, so proud that WiNUK are initiating conversations on this important topic, to inspire better structures for support of women in neuroscience across all career stages.</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_0c5ec40ad58243e48dd24eb874606854~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_585,h_731,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>One of WiNUK’s highlights of 2023 was my takeover of the UKDRI Twitter, now X, on behalf of WiNUK for International Women’s Day in February. This was a fantastic opportunity to highlight female role models in dementia research, but also the sex and gender inequalities in dementia care, treatment and research. Our collaboration was hugely successful, uniting charities, universities and researchers in these conversations. And you don’t just have to take my word for it- on my takeover day, the engagement on UKDRI account hugely increased to 7x their average retweets and 24x their average number of replies! Thank you to the UKDRI Communications Team for trusting us with this collaboration and for continuing to support our mission.</p>

<p>In September we launched our new social media series, ‘Present your Lab Technique’, where neuroscientists opened the door to the ‘behind the scenes’ of their research, through infographics, videos and live Q&As. These monthly features have been a great source of inspiration for aspiring scientists at high school level up to experienced researchers, and we’re excited to see this project continue in 2024.</p>

<p>Do go and follow @WomeninNeuroUK on social media if you haven’t already! We’ll soon be relaunching our TikTok so keep your eyes peeled for that too!</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/undefined"></figure>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/undefined"></figure><p><strong>Guest bloggers increased their science communication experience, and inspired others</strong></p>

<p>Finally, our most popular ‘Review’ article was on <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/meritocracy-in-academia" target="_blank" ><u>‘Meritocracy in Academia’ from Lauren Wallis</u></a>, inspired by Caroline Criado-Perez’s book ‘Invisible Women’.</p>

<p>From the blogs published in the last six months of 2023, different articles came out on top: <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/phd-life-with-adhd-the-highs-and-lows" target="_blank" ><u>Katherine Mortimer’s ‘PhD with ADHD’</u></a> received 210 reads in the Reality section, of Research was <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/behind-the-visuals-of-dreaming-exploring-the-evolutionary-underpinnings-of-dreams" target="_blank" ><u>Amy Elliott’s ‘Evolutionary Underpinnings of Dreaming’</u></a>, and of Review was <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-gendered-brain-a-review" target="_blank" ><u>Carly Hood’s ‘The Gendered Brain’</u></a> based on Gina Rippon’s book.</p>

<p>From giving you ‘the confidence to believe in’ yourself, to helping you to ‘be more inclusive and reduce the amount of bias’ within your own work environment, it has been an honour to read individual accounts of how WiNUK has benefited you!</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/feedback" target="_blank" ><u>Testimonials webpage</u></a> to view some of these comments.</p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_f50db4e788dd4ea1875c12cc5b47ad66~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_628,h_785,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p><strong>Exciting collaborations</strong></p>
<p>It’s been amazing for WiNUK to form collaborations with prominent neuroscience organisations on events and social media projects this year, including UK Dementia Research Institute, Alzheimer’s Research UK and Stroke Association.</p>

<p>As WiNUK continues to grow, we’re looking to expand upon our collaborations and sponsorships in 2024. If you are a company, charity or individual who aligns with WiNUK’s mission and would be interested in working with us, please contact Lizzie at womeninneuroscience.uk@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>That’s a wrap for WiNUK in 2023, but we’re just getting started…</p>

<p>This year, our content has been designed to connect you with a welcoming community, but also to educate you in several ways. Not only in the typical sense, with speakers and our graphics often sharing knowledge on neuroscientific content, but also educating on the challenges for women with neurological conditions and sharing our recommendations for inclusive scientific workplaces, to reduce the difficult career experiences of female neuroscientists. I hope that women and girls have found WiNUK platforms to be a safe haven of support this year, where your voices have been heard and amplified. I sincerely thank our speakers and our volunteers this year for your willingness to share your thoughts and experiences to help our audience of mixed genders to all strive for better conditions for women in science.</p>

<p>Join us in 2024 for more inspiring neuroscience and careers advice, networking connections, and advocacy for inclusive science communities for all. </p>

<p>This will be a big year for WiNUK, with our first in-person event and physical merchandise coming very soon – this is all still confidential but will be hot news soon, so stay tuned to our social media and mailing list! </p>

<p>To all our WiNUK supporters, I wish you a happy and healthy 2024, filled with successes in your science, career and personal life. </p>
