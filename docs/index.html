              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-guna-panama-escape-rising-seas">How an Indigenous community in Panama is escaping rising seas</a></h4>

              
                <p>In pictures from high above, the island of Gardi Sugdub resembles a container shipyard — small, brightly colored dwellings are jammed together cheek to jowl. At ground level, the island, one of more than 350 in the San Blas archipelago off the northern coast of Panama, is hot, flat and crowded. More than 1,000 people occupy the narrow dwellings that cover virtually every bit of the 150-by-400-meter island, which is slowly being swallowed by rising seas driven by climate change.</p>



<p>This year, about 300 families from Gardi Sugdub are expected to begin moving to a new community on the mainland. The resettlement plan was initiated by the residents there more than a decade ago when they could no longer deny that the island couldn’t accommodate the growing population. Rising seas and intense storms are only making the predicament more dire.</p>





<p>Many of the older adults will opt to stay put. Some still don’t believe climate change poses a threat, but 70-year-old Pedro Lopez is not among them. Lopez, whose cousin interpreted for him during our Zoom interview, currently shares a small house with 16 family members and the family dog. He doesn’t plan to move. He knows Gardi Sugdub, translated as Crab Island, along with many others in the archipelago, is going underwater, but he believes it won’t happen within his lifetime.</p>



<p>The Indigenous Guna people have occupied these Caribbean islands since around the mid-1800s, when they abandoned the coastal jungle area near what is now the Panama-Colombia border to establish better trade and escape disease-carrying pests. Now, they are among the estimated hundreds of millions of people worldwide who by the end of the century may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-migrants-destination-cities-data-orlando">be forced to flee their land</a> because of rising sea levels (<em>SN: 5/9/20 &amp; 5/23/20, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>In the Caribbean, sea level rise <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently averages around 3 to 4 millimeters per year</a>. As global temperatures continue to rise, it is expected to hit 1 centimeter per year or more by century’s end.</p>



<p>All of the islands of the San Blas archipelago will eventually be underwater and uninhabitable, says Steven Paton, who directs the Physical Monitoring Program at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “Some may need to be abandoned very soon while others not for many decades,” he adds.</p>

<h3>Where the Guna live</h3>



<p>The Guna Yala territory includes a strip of land along Panama’s northern coast and the more than 350 nearby islands. Families on the island of Gardi Sugdub will be moving to a new mainland community, sometimes called La Barriada.</p>

<p>Anthropologist Anthony Oliver-Smith of the University of Florida in Gainesville has studied people who are forced from their homes by disasters for more than 50 years. Around the world, he says, climate change has become a major driver of displacement, with people who have limited resources facing the worst of it.</p>



<p>The impacts of climate change — flooding, rising seas and erosion — are threatening the Tuvaluans in the South Pacific, the Mi’Kmaq of Prince Edward Island in Canada and the <a href="https://www.shinnecock-nsn.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shinnecock Indian Nation of New York</a>. Half of some 1,600 remaining tribe members there still occupy a more than 300-hectare territorial homeland on Long Island surrounded by multimillion-dollar Southampton mansions.</p>



<p>The Guna relocation is being closely watched as a possible template for other threatened communities. What sets the Guna apart from many others is that they have a place to go.</p>



<h4>Rising sea levels in Guna Yala</h4>



<p>More than 30,000 Indigenous Guna inhabit the province now called Guna Yala, which includes the archipelago once known as San Blas and a strip of mainland. Most live on the islands, traveling back to the mainland to get water from the mouth of the river there, and in some cases to tend crops. Some of the islands sit several meters above average sea level, but the vast majority are uninhabited spits of land with palm trees, many only a meter or less above sea level.</p>



<p>So far, only the residents of Gardi Sugdub are included in the relocation plan.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How much is the sea rising?</h3>



<p>Measurements of the ocean surface height from satellites suggest sea levels are rising at an average rate of several millimeters per year across much of the Caribbean. Estimates for local sea level rise are limited by the availability of data from tide gauges (shown as dots).</p>



<h5>Sea level rise in North and Central America, from 1993–2020</h5>

<p>The Guna people of the islands are sustained by the biodiversity there. The sea, mangroves and nearby mainland forests provide food, medicine and building materials. The men hunt and fish to provide seafood to the best restaurants in Panama City, and agriculture remains part of the economy. Guna communities elect traditional authorities known as <em>sailas </em>(“chiefs” in Guna) and <em>argars </em>(“chief’s spokesmen”), and they hold regular meetings to address community issues.</p>



<p>In recent decades, the Guna have moved toward an economy based on tourism and providing services to outsiders. They earn money supplying food, souvenirs and cultural artifacts to tourists but allow visitors to the islands only with prior approval from the <em>sailas</em>. Outsiders are not permitted to own property or operate businesses.</p>



<p>Carlos Arenas is an international human rights lawyer and an adviser on social and climate justice issues. When he visited Gardi Sugdub in 2014 as a consultant for <a href="https://www.displacementsolutions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Displacement Solutions</a>, a nonprofit initiative focused on housing, land and property rights, he was tasked to assess the nascent relocation plans and provide recommendations. He was shocked to see the visible threat posed by the rising sea. “You cannot see much elevation,” Arenas says. “The level of exposure was extremely high, but they don’t see it necessarily that way. They have been living there for more than 170 years.”</p>



<p>Heliodora Murphy grew up on Gardi Sugdub and has watched the ocean rise higher each year. The 52-year-old grandmother doesn’t understand those who dismiss climate change in light of the growing physical evidence all around. Murphy, also speaking through an interpreter, recalls her father bringing rocks and sand from a river on the mainland to shore&nbsp;up pathways and keep their home dry.</p>

ROGERS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Arenas says that some families face a daily struggle against the ocean. They build barriers that are immediately destroyed and have to be built again.</p>



<p>Some of the stopgap measures have been counterproductive, like filling in coral reefs to expand the land area. Reefs are a natural buffer against wave action, storm surges, flooding and erosion. Destroying them has only added to the peril.</p>



<p>Today, Murphy says, storm surges carry water into her small, ground-level home. “It’s very different than in the past,” she says. “The waves are so much higher now.” About two years ago, she decided she’d move with her family. “We can’t stay here.”</p>



<h4>A history of autonomy</h4>



<p>Historically, the Guna have had a level of autonomy rare among Indigenous people. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in what is now Colombia and Panama, the Guna lived primarily near the Gulf of Urabá on the northern coast of Colombia. The two groups clashed violently, prompting the Guna to abandon the coastal border area and move north into the jungle of Panama near the Caribbean. By the mid-1800s, entire villages had relocated again, this time to the San Blas archipelago.</p>



<p>Panama declared its independence from Spain in 1821 and became a part of Gran Colombia. Throughout the 19th century, the Guna lived independently according to their customs. That changed in 1903 when Panama broke from Colombia. The new nation attempted to assimilate the people living on the archipelago.</p>



<p>But having escaped Spanish rule centuries earlier and avoided Colombian authority as well, the Guna resisted Panama’s acculturation efforts. When the Guna couldn’t achieve détente through other means, they launched an armed attack against the Panamanians in February 1925.</p>



<p>The United States, having occupied the Panama Canal Zone since 1903, had geopolitical interests in the region and threw its support behind the Guna. That support forced the Panamanian government into a negotiated peace that allowed the Guna to continue their way of life. In 1938, the Guna islands and adjacent coastline were recognized as a semiautonomous Indigenous territory, Guna Yala. The Guna have maintained control of that territory since.</p>



<h4>The Guna find a new home</h4>



<p>The Gardi Sugdub residents first broached the idea of relocation in 2010. “They basically ran out of room,” Oliver-Smith says.</p>



<p>He describes the Guna as the Indigenous people in Latin America who have been perhaps most successful in defending their cultural heritage, language and territory. They initiated the plans for resettlement and made arrangements among themselves to set aside 17 hectares of property on the mainland for these purposes. The land, within the Guna Yala territory, is near a school and health center being built by the Panamanian government.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="574" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030.jpg" alt="A far away photo of a person sitting on the end of a dock with a clutter of wooden docks and poles behind them." class="wp-image-3123436" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-680x379.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-800x446.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-330x184.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040823_climate_inline1_1030-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123436">The residents of Gardi Sugdub (the island is shown here in 2014) face overcrowding and rising seas.

<p>When Guna leaders approached the government, the Ministry of Housing initially promised to build 50&nbsp;houses on the parcel. But it remained just that — a promise — until around 2014, when the Guna began to speak publicly about their situation. News of their predicament caught the attention of Indigenous rights organizations and eventually Displacement Solutions, which turned to Arenas and Oliver-Smith to evaluate the situation and offer recommendations about the best way forward.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/groups_committees/loss_and_damage_executive_committee/application/pdf/panama-_the_peninsula_principles_in_action.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Displacement Solutions’ first report in 2014</a>, Panama’s Ministry of Housing agreed to build 300 houses, along with the hospital and school. But Arenas, who until the COVID-19 pandemic started had visited Guna Yala every year or so, says progress remained slow, causing the Guna to question Panama’s commitment to the relocation. The Guna leveraged support from international groups and members of the Panamanian government to get the project moving. “They were the originators of the idea of resettlement,” Oliver-Smith says. “And they kept it alive.”</p>



<p>Arenas estimates that roughly 200 of the 300&nbsp;houses in the new community are complete. The cost for the houses, which are being paid for by the Panamanian government, exceeds $10 million, and the Inter-American Development Bank has invested $800,000 in technical assistance. The new homes will have cement floors, bamboo walls, zinc roofs, running water and full electrification.</p>



<p>Before plans to relocate began, many Guna had already moved to cities including Panama City and Colón for school, work or simply to have more room. Arenas expects that many more people already living in mainland Panama will likely join their families in the new community. People on other Guna Yala islands will likely have to move eventually too.</p>



<p>Murphy has already picked out her two-bedroom home for her small nuclear family of seven. Two daughters moved to Panama City years ago, and she hopes to see them more. But at around 40&nbsp;square meters, the homes may not accommodate the typical multigenerational, double-digit Guna families. Lopez plans to stay on the island, letting the younger generations live in the family’s new home on the mainland.</p>

<p>To ensure that the ethnic and cultural identities they fought to preserve are not lost in the move, the Guna plan to develop programs to teach traditions and culture to the resettled generations. But even on Gardi Sugdub, younger generations seem less inclined to practice the traditional customs — like making and wearing <em>wini </em>(vibrantly colored beads worn around the arms and legs) and <em>molas </em>(intricately designed fabric dresses that have become a symbol of Guna life and resistance to colonialism). Murphy began learning the craft when she was 6&nbsp;years old. She spends two months constructing each ensemble, which she sells to tourists for $80.</p>



<p>Oliver-Smith is optimistic about the relocation plan but worries that the Panamanian government has repeated some mistakes that have doomed projects elsewhere by treating resettlement solely as a housing issue. “You don’t just pick people up and move them from point A to point B. It is a reconfiguring of a life of a people,” Oliver-Smith says. “It has political, social, economic, environmental, spiritual and cultural dimensions.”</p>



<p>As is often the case when Indigenous and rural communities relocate, Arenas says, the government failed to make the Guna equal participants in the design concept. “The Panamanian government is trying to build a Panama City neighborhood in the middle of a tropical forest,” he says. “They have not tried to save a single tree of this beautiful landscape…. They removed everything. They tried to flatten the land because it’s cheaper…. It’s also extremely hot there, and the building materials are hot.” This increases the risk of failure, he says, because the houses don’t match the environment.</p>



<p>But Murphy hopes everything will be better. The new village promises dry land and more space. And perhaps returning to the mainland the Guna occupied nearly 150 years ago will lead to a stronger connection to Guna historical culture and traditions.</p>



<p>Oliver-Smith says the Guna are facing the challenge of resettlement with an intact culture and language that he hopes will be a basis for maintaining cultural continuity. His time spent with the Guna has convinced him that, as disruptive and devastating as resettlement can be, the Guna relocating as a cohesive group are perhaps best equipped to emerge intact even if not unscathed.</p>



<p>“Carlos [Arenas] and I asked an old, retired <em>saila</em> if he thought resettlement would change the Guna,” he says. “He said, ‘No. Individuals may change out of choice, but our culture is eternal. It will never die.’ ”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baseball-home-run-climate-change">Baseball’s home run boom is due, in part, to climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>Baseball is the best sport in the world for numberphiles. There are so many stats collected that the analysis of them even has its own name: sabermetrics. Like in <em>Moneyball</em>, team managers, coaches and players use these statistics in game strategy, but the mountain of available data can also be put to other uses.</p>



<p>Researchers have now mined baseball’s number hoard to show that climate change <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0235.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused more than 500 home runs since 2010</a>, with higher air temperatures contributing to the sport’s ongoing home run heyday. The results appear April 7 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>





<p>Many factors have led to players hitting it out of the park more often in the last 40 years, from steroid use to the height of the stitches on the ball. Blog posts and news stories have also speculated about whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">climate change</a> could be increasing the number of home runs, says Christopher Callahan of Dartmouth College (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). “But nobody had quantitatively investigated it.”</p>



<p>A climate change researcher and baseball fan, Callahan decided to dig into the sport’s mound of data in his free time to answer the question. After he gave a brief presentation at Dartmouth on the topic, two researchers from different fields joined the project.</p>



<p>That collaboration produced an analysis that is methodologically sound and “does what it says,” says Madeleine Orr, a researcher of the impacts of climate change on sports at Loughborough University London, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>The theorized relationship between global warming and home runs stems from fundamental physics — the ideal gas law says as temperature goes up, air density goes down, reducing air resistance. To see if home runs were happening due to warming, Callahan and colleagues took several approaches.</p>



<p>First, the team looked for an effect at the game level. Across more than 100,000 MLB games, the researchers found that a 1-degree Celsius increase in the daily high temperature increased the number of home runs in a game by nearly 2 percent. For example, a game like the one on June 10, 2019, where the Arizona Diamondbacks and Philadelphia Phillies set the record for most home runs in a game, would be expected to have 14 home runs instead of 13 if it were 4 degrees C warmer.</p>



<p>The researchers then ran game-day temperatures through a climate model that controls for greenhouse gas emissions and found that human-caused warming led to an average of 58 more home runs each season from 2010 to 2019. The analysis also showed that the overall trend of more home runs in higher temperatures goes back to the 1960s.</p>



<p>The team followed that analysis with a look at more than 220,000 individual batted balls, made possible by the Statcast system — where high-speed cameras have tracked the trajectory and speed of every ball hit during a game since 2015. The researchers compared balls hit in almost exactly the same way on days with different temperatures, while controlling for other factors like wind speed and humidity. That analysis showed a similar increase in home runs per degree Celsius as the game-level analysis, with only lower air density due to higher temperatures left to explain higher numbers of home runs.</p>





<p>While climate change has “not been the dominant effect” causing more home runs, “if we continue to emit greenhouse gases strongly, we could see much more rapid increases in home runs” moving forward, Callahan says.</p>



<p>Some fans feel that the prevalence of home runs has made baseball duller, and it’s at least part of the reason that the MLB unveiled <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-2023-rule-changes-pitch-timer-larger-bases-shifts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several new rule changes</a> for the 2023 season, Callahan says.</p>



<p>Teams can adapt to rising temperatures by shifting day games to night games and adding domes to stadiums — the researchers found no effect of temperature on home runs for games played under a dome. But according to Orr, climate change may soon cause even more dramatic changes to America’s pastime, even with those adaptations.</p>



<p>Because the sport is susceptible to snow, storms, wildfires, flooding and heat at various points during the season, Orr says, “I don’t think, without substantial change, baseball exists in the current model” within 30 years.</p>



<p>Callahan agrees. “This sport, and all sports, are going to see major changes in ways that we cannot anticipate.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jet-pack-ultrasound-pregnant-whale-shark">‘Jet packs’ and ultrasounds could reveal secrets of pregnant whale sharks</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do you know if the world’s largest living fish is expecting babies? Not by her bulging belly, it turns out.</p>



<p>Scientists thought that an enlarged area on the undersides of female whale sharks was a sign of pregnancy. But <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2023/50/n050p125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a technique used for the first time on free-swimming animals</a> showed only skin and muscle. These humps might instead be a secondary sex characteristic on mature females, like breasts on humans, researchers report in the March 23 <em>Endangered Species Research.</em></p>





<p>The ultrasound is part of a suite of new methods including underwater “jet packs” and blood tests that scientists hope could unlock secrets about this creature’s reproduction.</p>



<p>Whale sharks (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) are classified as globally endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are only <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/19488/2365291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an estimated 100,000 to 238,000 individuals</a> left worldwide, which is more than a 50 percent decline in the last 75 years.</p>



<p>In part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whale-shark-fish-largest-omnivore-skin-meat-plants">whale sharks</a> are relatively rare, their reproductive biology is mostly a mystery (<em>SN: 8/1/22</em>). Nearly everything biologists think they know is based on the examination of one pregnant female caught by a commercial fishing boat in 1995.</p>



<p>“Protecting organisms without knowing about their biology is like trying to catch a fly with our eyes closed,” says Rui Matsumoto, a fisheries biologist with the Okinawa Churashima Foundation in Japan. The organization researches subtropical animals and plants to maintain or improve natural resources in national parks.</p>



<p>To learn more about these gentle giants, Matsumoto and shark biologist Kiyomi Murakumo of Japan’s Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium had to figure out how to keep up with them. Like superheroes in a comic book, the biologists used underwater jet packs — propellers attached to their scuba tanks — to swim alongside the fish, which average 12 meters in length and move about five kilometers per hour.</p>



<p>Then the researchers had to maneuver a 17-kilogram briefcase containing a waterproof ultrasound wand on the undersides of 22 females swimming near the Galápagos Islands and draw blood with syringes from their fins. Until this study, the ultrasound wand had never been used outside of an aquarium on free-swimming wildlife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline.jpg" alt="An underwater photo of a diver with a jet pack swimming under a whale shark performing an ultrasound on its belly." class="wp-image-3123412" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040323_br_whalesharks_inline-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123412">Fisheries biologist Rui Matsumoto uses a propeller mounted on his scuba tank to keep pace with a female whale shark to take an ultrasound of her belly.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123412">S. Pierce</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Performing these two tests on whale sharks is especially challenging, says study coauthor Simon Pierce, a whale shark ecologist with the <a href="http://www.marinemegafauna.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marine Megafauna Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that uses research to drive marine conservation.&nbsp; The fish “have some of the thickest skin of any animal — up to about 30 centimeters thick.”</p>



<p>Another challenge is the seawater itself, which can contaminate blood samples. The researchers developed a two-syringe system, where the first syringe creates a vacuum and allows the second syringe to draw only blood.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Back in the lab, the blood plasma from six of the females showed hormone levels similar to levels obtained from a captive immature female in an aquarium, indicating those wild females were not old enough to reproduce.</p>



<p>Ultrasound imagery showed egg follicles in two of the 22 female sharks, meaning those females were mature enough to reproduce but not pregnant. The biologists did not locate a pregnant whale shark.</p>



<p>Pioneering these noninvasive techniques on whale sharks has opened the door to possibly learning more about other endangered marine animals, too. Waterproof ultrasound wands mounted on a pole, Pierce says, are now being used on tiger sharks in places where the predators are drawn in by bait.</p>



<p>Rachel Graham agrees developing these underwater sampling techniques is an “astounding feat.” But the marine conservation scientist and founder of <a href="https://maralliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarAlliance</a>, a marine wildlife conservation nonprofit, doubts whether most free-ranging wild marine animals, particularly faster-swimming sharks or marine mammals, would tolerate similar tests.</p>



<p>“What makes whale sharks fairly unique … is&nbsp;that they move relatively slowly at times, have the ability to remain stationary, and they tolerate the presence of other animals — such as us — nearby,” says Graham, who has studied shark species around the world and was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Coupled with satellite tracking, the new methods, could eventually show us where whale sharks give birth, Pierce says. Little is known about whale shark pups, including whether they are born in shallow or deep water, and whether pups are born one-at-a-time or if mothers gather to give birth together. “Assuming they do have some sort of breeding or pelagic nursery area we can identify … then that obviously goes quite a long way towards conserving the population.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-yellow-crazy-ants-male-chimeras-reproduce">Invasive yellow crazy ants create male ‘chimeras’ to reproduce</a></h4>

              
                <p>Yellow crazy ants break the rules of reproduction.</p>



<p>Every male ant contains <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate populations of cells from two distinct genetic lineages</a>, making them “chimeras,” researchers report in the April 7 <em>Science</em>. Yellow crazy ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) are the first known species that requires chimerism to create fertile males.</p>



<p>It’s “an elegant response to the kinds of unusual mating systems we’ve observed in other ants,” says evolutionary geneticist Waring “Buck” Trible of Harvard University, who was not involved in the study. “We might consider this as the next evolutionary step” in ants.</p>





<p>Most animals develop from a sperm cell and an egg cell uniting into one, combining their DNA. As a creature grows, all of the subsequent cells, save for sex cells, carry two sets of DNA-bearing chromosomes, one from each parent. In other words, these somatic cells all carry the same genetic information. Sperm and egg cells contain just one set of chromosomes.</p>



<p>But in many ants, along with other insects like wasps and bees, only females have somatic cells with chromosome pairs. Males typically develop from unfertilized eggs. So their somatic cells hold just one set of chromosomes.</p>



<p>A 2007 study, however, found that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03260.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about half of the sampled male yellow crazy ants possessed two different copies of the same genes</a>, just like the species’ female worker ants. </p>



<p>But &#8220;it didn’t make any sense that all males in this species would be diploid,&#8221; or have two sets of chromosomes in each somatic cell, says evolutionary biologist Hugo Darras of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany. When this happens in other ants, the males are usually sterile, he says. &#8220;Nobody had any explanation.”</p>



<p>So Darras and colleagues collected hundreds of yellow crazy ants from across East and Southeast Asia. Analyzing females — queens and workers — revealed that royalty in this species has a genetic source. Reproductive queens came from combining sperm and egg cells from the same lineage, which the researchers dubbed R. Workers were hybrids of the two different lineages, the other being called W. In other words, workers had R/W genomes, while queens had R/R genomes.</p>



<p>Consistent with the previous study, the researchers identified R/W males. But they also found that males’ somatic cells have just one set of chromosomes, as in other ant species. Extracting DNA from individual cells showed that rather than having chromosome pairs within cells, each cell contains chromosomes from just one of the two lineages.</p>





<p>Further experiments found that the R and W cells are unevenly distributed throughout the males’ bodies. While most of the body contained majority R cells, almost 75 percent based on the sampled tissue, the ratio nearly flipped in the sperm — 65 percent were W cells.</p>

<p>Since both workers and males come from combining W sperm with R eggs, the sex depends on whether their packets of DNA, or nuclei, merge. Fusion creates a female. But failure to fuse causes the two nuclei to divide separately within the same egg, producing a male.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why this never-before-seen mode of reproduction evolved in these ants. “By refusing to fuse with the egg cell, [the sperm] might be able to increase its reproductive output,” Trible says. Female worker ants are sterile and therefore can’t pass on the W genome.</p>



<p>“We think it’s maybe an interaction between two genomes that are in conflict but sometimes cooperate,” Darras says. These distinct lineages may have evolved independently in two separate ant populations that eventually intermingled. Or they could have started with similar genes that diverged over time, he adds. “But it looks like the whole genomes are separated and don’t exchange any genetic material.”</p>



<p>This odd reproduction method could be advantageous for the ant populations, leading to the yellow crazy ant’s title as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-pants-drive-away-birds">one of the world’s worst invasive species</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/09</em>). Because fusion of R and W nuclei results only in sterile workers, the genomes can never mix and be passed to the next generation. Thus, the ants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-manage-incest-without-inbreeding">avoid any possibility of inbreeding</a>, a feature seen in other invasive ant species (<em>SN: 2/1/11</em>).</p>



<p>Chimeras have been found in other creatures, including humans, but it’s usually an accident. Yellow crazy ants are the first known species in which chimerism determines sex. But some scientists estimate there are around 20,000 ant species, and the reproductive systems of most haven’t been studied.</p>



<p>“This is a very special system,” says evolutionary biologist Guojie Zhang of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, who was not involved in the research. “The question would be how frequently this system can be observed in other ant lineages.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hair-europe-oldest-evidence-drug-use">Hair analysis reveals Europe’s oldest physical evidence of drug use</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human hair recovered in a Mediterranean island cave has yielded <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31064-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europe’s oldest direct evidence of people taking hallucinogenic drugs</a>, researchers say.</p>



<p>By around 3,000 years ago, visitors at Es Càrritx cave on Menorca — perhaps shamans who performed spiritual and healing rituals — consumed plants containing mind-altering and vision-inducing substances, say archaeologist Elisa Guerra-Doce of the University of Valladolid in Spain and colleagues.</p>



<p>Signs of human activity at the cave, including more than 200 human graves arrayed in a chamber at the entrance, were previously dated to between around 3,600 and 2,800 years ago. Researchers had also found a hoard of objects in a small pit within an inner cave chamber, including six wooden containers, each containing locks of human hair.</p>

Guerra-Doce <em>et al</em>/<em>Sci. Reports</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Chemical analyses of one container’s locks, possibly from more than one person, detected three psychoactive plant substances that had been ingested and absorbed into the hair over nearly a year, the scientists report April 6 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Two substances, atropine and scopolamine from nightshade plants, induce disorientation, hallucinations and altered physical sensations. Another, ephedrine, boosts energy and alertness. Shamans would have known how to handle and consume these potentially toxic plants safely, the investigators say.</p>





<p>Individuals intent on preserving ancient traditions hid hair and other ritually significant objects at Es Càrritx as Menorca’s growing population spurred social changes between 3,000 and 2,800 years ago, the researchers speculate. Burial rituals had included dyeing strands of hair on corpses a reddish color and later cutting off some locks to be put in containers left near graves.</p>



<p>Other hair analyses have found that Inca kids slated for sacrifice more than 500 years ago ingested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">hallucinogenic drinks </a>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mummified-incan-teen-drank-did-drugs">coca leaves and alcohol</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22; SN: 7/29/13</em>). &nbsp;And a 2005 study found chemical signs of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2005.10399820" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coca-leaf chewing in the hair of two human mummies from Chile</a> dating to around 3,000 years ago. Indirect evidence of drug use in various parts of the world, such as artistic depictions, go back further.</p>

<p>In 2017, a paper published in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em> made international headlines for the authors’ claim they had developed a way to analyze brain scans using machine learning to identify youth at risk for suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was a big, splashy finding,” said <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/verstynen-timothy.html">Timothy Verstynen</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the research. But at a neuroimaging conference soon after the publication, other researchers discussed the study “in kind of a sense of disbelief,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 91% accuracy for identifying suicidality that the researchers reported, from a sample size of just a few dozen participants, he said, “kind of went against what we as a field were starting to understand about the nature of these brain phenotype markers based off of neuroimaging data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After six years of scrutiny, during which Verstynen attempted to replicate the work but found a key problem, the authors of the 2017 paper have retracted the article. </p>



<span id="more-126852"></span>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y">Machine learning of neural representations of suicide and emotion concepts identifies suicidal youth</a>,” has been cited 134 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Altmetric, which tracks the online attention publications receive, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/28130609#score">places the article</a> in the top 5% of all the articles and other content it has tracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01581-1&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org">notice</a>, published today, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors are retracting this article after concerns were raised about the validity of their machine learning method in a Matters Arising. While revising their response to these concerns, the authors confirmed that their method was indeed flawed, which affects the conclusions of the article. Specifically, the stepwise classification method used in the article overestimated the classification accuracy of who is a suicidal ideator because the features of the classifier were tuned to that particular dataset. The authors aim to demonstrate the predictive value of machine learning applied to fMRI data for the classification of suicidal ideators using new data and analyses in an independent future publication. All authors agree to this retraction.</p>

<p>Eickhoff and some colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01085-w">published a Matters Arising in 2021</a> that formalized and expanded on his critiques of the sample size and the way the authors developed their machine learning model. The authors’ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01086-9">response</a> pushed back on the criticisms, while acknowledging the limitations of the sample size, and again stated that they “look forward to sharing the forthcoming results from our ongoing larger study.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, in 2020, Verstynen was looking for examples of prediction models to use for his students in his data science course. He remembered the 2017 paper and thought it would be worth diving into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen mentioned the idea to another researcher, Konrad Paul Kording of the University of Pennsylvania, who would later become his co-author on the <a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01560-6&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org">new Matters Arising</a> mentioned in the retraction notice. The two scientists talked about how the paper “seems like either an absolutely brilliant methodological feat, or there’s something possibly wrong with how the classification was done,” Verstynen said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kording pointed out that the authors had made their code and some of their process data available following earlier criticism, and Verstynen dug in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He reread the paper and noticed an “inconsistency” in how the authors selected the features to go into their model. “The way it was described made it seem like there was a possibility of information leakage happening in the development of the model, where information from the holdout set was leaking into the cross validation,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insidebigdata.com/2014/11/26/ask-data-scientist-data-leakage/">Information leakage</a>, meaning that the data used to train an algorithm contains some of the information the algorithm is supposed to learn to predict, is a common problem in machine learning, and can result in the algorithm not performing as well in the real world as in tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kording also tried replicating the work, but couldn’t get the same results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Initially I thought I was doing it wrong,” he said. But after a month of playing with the code, eventually he thought there might be something wrong with the paper’s methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2020, he emailed the paper’s authors about his difficulty replicating their work, and his concern about information leakage in their model. They thanked him, he said, but he didn’t hear anything further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen and Kording next reached out to <em>Nature Human Behavior</em> with their concerns, and at the editor’s recommendation submitted their Matters Arising in the summer of 2020. The authors submitted their reply, and both went through peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Verstynen and Kording got their reviews and made minor revisions, they didn’t hear anything for a while. Eventually, after they pushed the journal’s editor for a response this January, 2.5 years after submission, they learned that their Matters Arising would be published.</p>



<p>But instead of the authors’ reply being published with it, the original paper would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Eickhoff, the scientist who published the 2021 Matters Arising, told us he saw “no fundamental difference” between his concerns and the ones Verstynen and Kording articulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both commentaries, and the possibility of retraction, were under consideration at the journal at the same time, he said. The last he heard was that the article would stand along with the two critiques. He told us he was “perplexed” by the timing of the retraction. “I personally feel that keeping the article online &#8211; together with the matters arising &#8211; is preferable over a retraction.”</p>



<p>Verstynen didn’t start off trying to get the paper retracted, but simply was seeking clarification about the methods, he said. Because of the important topic, as well as the media attention and follow-up clinical trial the paper garnered, “it seemed warranted to really push to have this addressed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eickhoff and Verstynen both say that the field has evolved in the last six years to be more robust, so the retraction won’t have much effect on current methods. The paper probably couldn’t get published today, Verstynen said, but there are “probably a lot of studies” from the same time period that have similar problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verstynen said he “can’t fault the journal” for following its process to reevaluate the paper, but more openness about what was going on would be helpful for the research community. “Given how long it took the process to play out, we’re talking half the lifespan of this paper was spent with this issue known to the journal.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-thousands-volcanoes-map">Venus has almost 50 times as many volcanoes as previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hellscape of Venus is riddled with even more volcanoes than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Using radar images taken by NASA’s Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s, researchers cataloged about <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JE007753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">85,000 volcanoes strewn across the Venusian surface</a>. That’s nearly 50 times as many volcanoes as past surveys counted. Planetary scientists Rebecca Hahn and Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis debuted the map in the April <em>JGR Planets</em>.</p>



<p>Such a thorough inventory of volcanism on Venus could offer clues about the planet’s interior, such as hot spots of magma production, Byrne says. And with the recent discovery that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-venus-erupting-decades-old-nasa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus is volcanically active</a>, the map could also help pinpoint places to look for new eruptions (<em>SN: 3/15/23</em>).</p>





<p>Almost all the volcanoes that Hahn and Byrne found are less than 5 kilometers wide. About 700 are 5 to 100 kilometers across, and about 100 are wider than 100 kilometers. The team also found many tight clusters of small volcanoes called volcanic fields.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Literal hot spots</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This map of Venus shows the locations and sizes of all volcanoes visible in radar data from the Magellan spacecraft. The newfound volcanoes range in size from less than 5 kilometers wide to more than 100 kilometers across, though most are on the small side.</p>

<p>“We have a better handle of how many volcanoes are on Venus than are on Earth,” where most volcanoes are probably hidden beneath the oceans, Byrne says. But he doesn’t think the Magellan data tell the whole story of Venus’ volcanism. That spacecraft could see features as small as about 1 kilometer in diameter. Earth has “lots and lots of volcanoes that are far smaller than a kilometer across,” Byrne says. “That’s probably the case with Venus, too.”</p>





<p>We may soon find out. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s VERITAS spacecraft</a> and the European Space Agency’s EnVision mission are slated to turn their much sharper eyes on Venus’ infernal surface within the next decade or so (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). <em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/on-the-existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/">On the existential risks of artificial intelligence</a></h4>

              
                <p>The impressive progresses in machine learning have revived the
fear that humans might eventually be wiped out or enslaved by artificial superintelligences.
This is hardly a new fear. For example, this fear is the basis of most of Isaac
Asimov’s books, who imagined that robots are built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws</a> to protect humans.</p>



<p>My point
here is not to demonstrate that such events are impossible. On the contrary, my
point is that autonomous human-made entities already exist, and cause the exact
same risks that AI alarmists are talking about, except they are real. In this
context, evil AI fantasies are an anthropomorphic distraction.</p>



<p>Let me quickly dismiss some misconceptions. Does ChatGPT understand language? Of course not. Large language models are (essentially) algorithms tuned to predict the next words. But here we don’t mean “word” in the human sense. In the human sense, a word is a symbol that means something. In the computer sense, a word is a symbol, to which <em>we</em> humans attribute meaning. When ChatGPT talks about bananas, it has no idea what a banana tastes like (well, it has no idea). It has never seen a banana or tasted a banana (well, it has never seen or tasted). “Banana” is just a node in a big graph of other nodes, totally disconnected from the outside world, and in particular from what “banana” might actually refer to. This is known in cognitive science as the “symbol grounding problem”, and it is a difficult problem that LLMs do not solve. So, maybe LLMs “understand” language, but only if you are willing to define “understand” in such a way that it is not required to know what words mean.</p>



<p>Machine
learning algorithms are not biological organisms, they do not perceive, they
are not conscious, they do not have intentions in the human sense. But it doesn’t
matter. The broader worry about AI is simply that these algorithms are
generally designed so as to optimize some predefined criterion (e.g.,
prediction error), and if we give them very powerful means to do so, in
particular means that involve real actions in the world, then who knows whether
using those means might not be harmful to us? At some point, without
necessarily postulating any kind of evil mind, we humans might become means in
the achievement of some optimization criterion. We built some technical goals
into the machine, but it is very difficult to ensure that those are aligned
with human values. This is the so-called “alignment” problem.</p>



<p>Why not. We are clearly not there, but maybe, in a hypothetical future, or at least as a thought experiment. But what strikes me with the misalignment narrative is that this scenario is not at all hypothetical if you are willing to look beyond anthropomorphic evil robots. Have you really never heard of any human-made entities with their own goals, which might be misaligned with human values? Entities that are powerful and hard to control by humans?</p>



<p>There is an obvious answer if you look at the social rather than technological domain: it is the modern financialized multinational corporation. The modern corporation is a human-made organization that is designed in such a way as to maximize profit. It does not have intentions or goals in a human sense, but exactly like in the AI alignment narrative, it is simply designed in such a way that it will use all means available in order to maximize a predefined criterion, which may or may not be perfectly aligned with human values. Let’s call these companies “profit robots”.</p>



<p>To what
extent are profit robots autonomous from humans? Today’s modern large corporations
are owned not by people but in majority by institutional stakeholders, such as
mutual funds, i.e., other organizations with the same goals. As is well known,
their multinational nature makes them largely immune to the legislation of states
(hence the issues of fiscal optimization, social dumping, etc). As is also well
known, a large part of the resources of a profit robot is devoted to marketing
and advertisement, that is, in manipulating humans into buying their products.</p>



<p>Profit robots also engage in intense lobbying to bend human laws in their favor. But more to the point, the very notion of law is not the same for a profit robot as for humans. For humans, a law is something that sets boundaries on what could be done or should not be done, morally. But a profit robot is not a person. It has no moral principles. So, law is just one particular constraint, in fact a financial cost or risk – a company does not go to prison. A striking example of this is the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Dieselgate</a>”: Volkswagen (also not owned by humans) intentionally programmed their engines so that their car emissions remained hidden during the pollution tests required to authorize their cars on the US market. As far as I know, shareholders were not informed, and neither were consumers. The company autonomously decided to break the law for profit. Again, the company is not evil: it is not a person. It behaves in this non-human way because it is a robot, exactly like in the AI misalignment narrative.</p>



<p>We often hear that ultimately, it is the consumers who have power, by deciding what to buy. This is simply false. Consumers did not know that Volkswagen cheated on pollution tests. Consumers rarely know in what exact conditions the products are made, or even to what corporation the products belong. This type of crucial information is deliberately hidden. Profit robots, on the other hand, actively manipulate consumers into buying their products. What to think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>? Nobody wants products that are deliberately designed to break down prematurely, yet that is what a profit robot makes. So yes, profit robots are largely autonomous from the human community.</p>



<p>Are profit robots an existential risk for humans?
That might be a bit dramatic, but they certainly do cause very significant
risks. A particular distressing fact illustrates this. As the Arctic ice melts
because of global warming, <a href="http://science.time.com/2012/09/11/arctic-sea-ice-vanishes-and-the-oil-rigs-move-in/">oil companies get ready to drill the
newly available resources</a>. Clearly this is not in the interest of humans, but this is what a
company like Shell, who is only <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-owns-the-oil-company-Royal-Dutch-Shell">directly owned by humans in the
proportion of 6%</a>, needs
to do to pursue its goals, which as any other profit robot, is to generate
profit by whatever means.</p>



<p>So yes, there is a risk that powerful human-made entities get out of control and that their goals are misaligned with human values. This worry is reasonable because it is already realized, except not in the technological domain. It is ironic (but not so surprising) that billionaires buy into the AI misalignment narrative but fail to see that the same narrative fully applies to the companies that their wealth depends on, except it is realized.</p>



<p>The reasonable worry about AI is not that AI takes control of the world: the worry is that AI provides even more powerful means for the misaligned robots that are already out of control now. In this context, evil AI fantasies are an anthropomorphic distraction from the actual problems we have already created.</p>

<p>Hindawi and Wiley, its parent company, have identified approximately 1,200 articles with compromised peer review that the publishers will begin retracting this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jay Flynn, executive vice president and general manager of the research division at Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, wrote about the forthcoming retractions in a <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/04/guest-post-addressing-paper-mills-and-a-way-forward-for-journal-security/">blog post</a> at Scholarly Kitchen yesterday.</p>



<p>The plan to retract 1,200 articles, which the publisher expects to take a few months, follows Hindawi’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">announcement last September</a> that it would retract 511 articles across 16 journals for manipulated peer review. (We’ve <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26pub%3dHindawi">tracked 501</a> retractions from 23 Hindawi journals since the announcement.)</p>



<span id="more-126848"></span>



<p>The new batch of articles was identified as a result of the work that led to those initial retractions, a Wiley spokesperson told us in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wiley-statement.pdf">statement</a>. The papers to be retracted are concentrated in the same journals as the earlier batch, the spokesperson said, and all from special issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Special Issues in these journals were targeted by papermills and bad actors, with researcher identities manipulated (to appear as legitimate researchers) and content fabricated (to appear as legitimate content),” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other publishers have recently issued retractions en masse after identifying signs of paper mill activity. Last year, IOP Publishing <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/09/physics-publisher-retracting-nearly-500-likely-paper-mill-papers/">retracted nearly 500 articles</a>, and PLOS <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">retracted more than 100 papers</a> from its flagship journal over manipulated peer review.</p>



<p>From mid-October to mid-January, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publication</a> of Hindawi special issues, losing $9 million in revenue. Last month, the analytics company Clarivate, which assigns impact factors to journals, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">dropped 19 Hindawi journals</a> from its Web of Science index for failing to meet quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flynn’s blog post also mentioned the publisher is “designing a new retraction process that will help us, and potentially others, accelerate and deal with this new era of mass retractions fairly.” The Wiley spokesperson declined to share further details on the new process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-gas-space-anthill-galaxy">A stream of cold gas is unexpectedly feeding the far-off Anthill Galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long, cold stream of gas <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is feeding a very distant galaxy</a> like a vast bendy straw. The finding suggests a new way for galaxies to grow in the early universe, researchers report in the March 31 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Computer simulations predicted that streams of gas should connect galaxies to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">cosmic web</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). But astronomers expected that gas to be warm, making it unsuitable for star-forming fuel and galaxy growth.</p>



<p>So astronomer Bjorn Emonts and his colleagues were surprised to see a stream of cold, star-forming gas leading into the Anthill Galaxy, a massive galaxy whose light takes 12 billion years to reach Earth.</p>





<p>The team spotted the stream while mapping cold gas in the galaxy’s neighborhood using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in Chile. Emonts was particularly interested in radio wavelengths of light that carbon atoms emit when the temperature is between about -260° and -160° Celsius.</p>



<p>“People didn’t think that these streams could get so cold,” says Emonts, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.</p>



<p>But there, in the data, a frigid stream stretched at least 325,000 light-years away from the galaxy. The stream carries the mass of 70 billion suns and deposits the equivalent of about 450 suns in cold gas onto the galaxy every year, the team calculated. That’s enough to double the galaxy’s mass within a billion years.</p>



<p>Emonts thinks that no one had seen such a stream before because his team used ALMA in an unusual configuration, with its telescopes arranged as close together as possible. That gave the observatory lower resolution, but a wider field of view.</p>



<p>“People don’t normally do that,” Emonts says. “We basically defocused ALMA to the worst possible extent.”</p>



<p>If other galaxies are fed by similar structures, it could mean that early galaxies grew mostly by drinking directly from the cosmic streams, rather than by the leading hypothesis — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-galaxy-merger-occurred-shortly-after-big-bang">violent galaxy mergers</a> (<em>SN: 6/28/19</em>).</p>

<p>In 2018, the journal <em>Respiration</em> was adamant that it wouldn’t retract a 2015 paper co-authored by once-respected transplant surgeon <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/paolo-macchiarini/">Paolo Macchiarini</a>. Now, the editors at <em>Respiration</em> seem to have changed their mind.</p>



<p>Macchiarini is most well known for his controversial artificial windpipe implants. Seven out of the eight patients who had artificial windpipes implanted from Macchiarini <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">suffered complications after the surgery</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years ago, the Karolinska Institute (KI) in Sweden found that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/01/31/macchiarini-3-co-authors-found-guilty-misconduct-2015-paper/">Macchiarini and three co-authors of his were guilty of misconduct</a> in the 2015 study, and recommended that it should be pulled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thomas Nold, then the editor-in-chief of <em>Respiration</em>, previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/18/journal-holds-firm-on-decision-not-to-retract-macchiarini-paper-despite-outside-pressure/">told <em>Retraction Watch</em></a>, however, that the journal decided against retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126839"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In any retraction case we conduct our own analysis and consider all available information. In this specific case we needed to consider four other renowned institutions besides KI and the 26 authors of the article. Based on the evidence available to the journal we do not see ourselves in the position to make a judgement. We see the journal as a forum, and by publishing the different statements including KI’s report concerning the article our aim is to make the conflict completely transparent.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last month, the journal reversed course and pulled the <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/441799">2015 paper</a>, titled: “Autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells as Treatment in Refractory Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”</p>



<p>By <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMacchiarini%252c%2bPaolo">our count</a>, this brings Macchiarini up to nine retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Karolinska Institute, although the 2015 paper included an ethical permit, the underlying research did not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875">retraction notice</a>, released last month, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Karolinska Institutet found that the research “lacked any biological hypothesis based on either in vitro or in vivo (animal) data. The notebook also lacks notes on any advance discussion of the risks and benefits of the treatment, the theory on which it was based, the results of preclinical or other studies demonstrating effect, and safety; nor of any discussion that followed from the deterioration of the patient’s condition, in spite of which it was decided to continue the experimental treatment. This contravenes articles 14, 16, 17, and 21 of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki (articles 31, 21, 18, and 12 of the 2008 version).” [<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875#ref1">1</a>]</p>



<p>Upon re-evaluation of the case and in line with the Committee on Publication Ethics Guidelines for Retractions recommending that “Editors should consider retracting a publication if […] it reports unethical research” [<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/529875#ref2">2</a>], we are retracting this article.</p>



<p>Ana I. Teixeira, Adil Duru and Vanessa Lundin agree with this retraction. The remaining authors did not respond or could not be reached for comment within the timeframe given.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2018, <em>Respiration</em> published <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/489981">a response</a> to Karolinska’s report from three authors of the study including Macchiarini. It reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision is contrary to the assessment of the Central Ethical Review Board of Sweden, where an expert group analyzed the research and concluded that it does not constitute grounds to determine scientific misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Study co-author Philipp Jungebluth wrote in the 2018 response:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>​​The decision that has now been taken by the KI is purely politically motivated. The explanation for their decision is poor and the accusations they made are false and incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martin O. Bergö, vice president of Karolinska Institute, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…the journal has decided to retract the article and we support this decision. Obviously, based on the communication between our previous president and the journal, we believe the decision should have been taken sooner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Felix J.F. Herth, the current <em>Respiration</em> editor-in-chief and a medical researcher at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, has not responded to a request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geometric-patterns-salt-flats-worldwide">Here’s why the geometric patterns in salt flats worldwide look so similar</a></h4>

              
                <p>From Death Valley to Chile to Iran, similarly sized polygons of salt form in playas all over the world — and subterranean fluid flows might be the key to solving the long-standing puzzle of why.</p>



<p>Geometric shapes such as pentagons and hexagons spontaneously form in a wide range of geologic settings. Dried mud, ice and rock often crack into polygons, but these patterns tend to vary dramatically in size.</p>



<p>So why are all playas so persistently similar? <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The answer </a><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lies underground</a>, physicist Jana Lasser and colleagues propose February 24 in <em>Physical Review X. </em><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>With sophisticated mathematical models, computer simulations and experiments performed at Owens Lake in California, the team connected what they saw on the surface with what is going on beneath.</p>





<p>“Fluid flows and convection underground are uniquely able to explain why the patterns form,” says Lasser, of the Graz University of Technology in Austria.</p>



<p>This 3-D approach was key to explaining the universality of salty polygons.</p>



<p>Salt flats <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salt-flat-isnt-flat-worlds-largest-playa-sports-ridges-valleys">form in places</a> where rainfall is scarce and there’s a lot of evaporation (<em>SN: 12/5/07</em>). Groundwater seeping up to the surface evaporates, leaving a crust of salts and other minerals that had been dissolved in the water. Most striking, this process results in low ridges of concentrated salt that divide the playa into polygons: mostly hexagons with a smattering of pentagons and other geometric shapes.</p>



<p>The type of salt varies from one playa to another. Table salt, or sodium chloride, dominates in some playas, but others have more sulfite salts. And the salt crusts themselves range in thickness from a few millimeters to several meters. That variation seems to be why previous attempts to describe the playas’ patterns failed.</p>



<p>Whether the crusts are meter- or millimeter-thick, salt pans feature polygons that are 1 to 2 meters across. Previous models based on cracking, expansion and other phenomena that describe how mud and rock fracture instead produce polygons with sizes that vary according to crust thickness.</p>



<p>As groundwater evaporates from the surface, it concentrates salt in the remaining groundwater. That salty water, now denser and heavier, sinks, forcing other less dense water upward. Lasser and colleagues showed that over time, the circulation, known as convection, tends to push the descending plumes of saltier water into a network of vertical sheets. The surface above these sheets accrues more salt, so thick salt ridges grow there. Thinner crusts of salt form between, where less salty water upwells, spontaneously making the characteristic polygons shared by playas around the world.</p>

Lasser <em>et al</em>/<em>Physical Review X</em></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The equations the researchers used describe the relative salinity of the groundwater, the pressure within the fluid and the speed at which the water circulates. Computer simulations that embraced the full complexity of the 3-D problem started with no salt crust or polygons and produced something that looks very much like real playas.</p>



<p>“This fluid dynamical model makes much more sense than a model that ignores what’s happening beneath the surface,” says physicist Julyan Cartwright of the Spanish National Research Council, who is based in Granada and was not involved in the research.</p>





<p>Tests at Owens Lake helped the team verify and refine the model. “Physics is so much more than just sitting in front of a computer,” Lasser says, “and I wanted to do something that involves experiments.”</p>



<p>The lake dried up in the 1920s as water was diverted to Los Angeles. The deposited minerals on the remaining salt flat include large natural concentrations of arsenic, which blows away with the dust kicked up by wind — creating serious health hazards. Among <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dried-california-lake-gets-muddy-facial">other remediation effort</a>s, brine has been pumped onto the lake bed to try to create a more stable salt crust (<em>SN: 11/28/01</em>). That human intervention gave the researchers the opportunity to test their ideas in a controlled way.</p>



<p>“The whole area is destroyed,” Lasser says, “but for us it was the perfect research environment.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">Trends in preprint, data, and code sharing, 2019-2022</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Lauren Cadwallader, Lindsay Morton, and Iain Hryaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>PLOS recently <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">introduced Open Science Indicators</a> (OSIs), a large public dataset identifying and quantifying Open Science practices like preprint posting, data sharing and code sharing in PLOS articles, as well as a selection of comparator articles published elsewhere. <strong>Now, we are delighted to release another six months of data from the second half of 2022, providing a new view of Open Science practices by researchers, over four years. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#numbers">latest results</a> continue to show incremental growth in all three areas.</strong> Read on for more details on the project, detailed numbers, and a closer look at preprints.</p>



<h2>The why and how of Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; founding mission centers on breaking down barriers to publish, read, and reuse trusted scholarly research with the overall aim of accelerating progress across science and medicine. We do that by making Open Access publishing options and Open Science best-practices more accessible to all researchers, in all disciplines, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We aren&rsquo;t alone in this work: across the scholarly ecosystem, researchers, funders, institutions, librarians, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/open-science-advocacy-and-capacity-building-for-leadership-in-african-higher-education-institutions/">professional organizations</a>, and other Open Access publishers are embracing Open practices that support equity and inclusion, research integrity and reproducibility, and collaboration across distance and discipline. But to understand whether we are making progress towards increased adoption, we first have to understand where researchers are today. Open Science Indicators allow us to establish benchmarks, and to track changes over time.</p>



<p id="poll">After developing <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">a set of principles and definitions</a> for Open Science practices, PLOS <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">partnered with DataSeer</a> to create &ldquo;indicators&rdquo; which identify and measure specific Open Science practices in published research articles. In December we introduced our first three indicators: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting. We are currently working on a fourth indicator for protocol sharing. In the future we aim to continue refining our methods and expanding the dataset. We appreciate your comments and feedback, both on the latest data, how you are using it, and the data points and features you&rsquo;d find most valuable in the future.

<h2>A closer look at the latest Open Science Indicators</h2>



<h3>About the dataset</h3>



<p>The March 2023 dataset includes all 71,109 PLOS research articles published during the 4 year period from January 2019 to December 2022, along with a comparator set of 7,635 publicly-available research articles from PubMed Central, an increase of 16% over the previous dataset.</p>



<p>A few caveats to bear in mind: Open Science Indicators report only machine-detectible traits. Unclear labeling or missing metadata may mean that some practices are underrepresented in the dataset. Accuracy rates for the dataset have <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=39883933">been updated and expanded in this second release</a>, offering a more nuanced view of the quality of the dataset for advanced users.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="numbers">Updates through the end of 2022</h3>



<p>Open Science Indicators results continued to follow established patterns through the remainder of 2022. Specifically for PLOS articles:</p>



<ul><li>Rates of data repository use continued to rise, from 26% in 2021 to 28% for articles published in 2022. Overall rates of data sharing also rose to 75%.</li><li>Code sharing rates rose slightly in 2022, compared to 2021, reaching 15% for all articles published in 2022</li><li>The rate of preprints associated with published articles held steady at 24% across 2021 and 2022</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="404" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21202" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2.png 624w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/triptych_square_v2-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></figure>



<h3>A closer look at preprint posting</h3>



<p>To complement the summary of data- and code-sharing results that accompanied our first data release, here we take a more in-depth look at preprint posting.</p>



<p>While the proportion of published articles with an associated preprint remained the same across 2021 and 2022, if we look at preprint habits based on the date the preprint was posted, rather than the date the associated article was published, a different pattern emerges. For PLOS articles, 57% more preprints were posted in Q2 2020 compared to the previous quarter, likely in part in response to the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Since then, rates have gradually normalized until, by Q4 2021, they were slightly above pre-pandemic levels, in keeping with the gradual upward trend observed in prior years. Comparator data sees a less marked pandemic increase and levels remain more stable throughout 2021 (although this is a much smaller sample size). Future iterations of the dataset will provide greater clarity on the ongoing trends for preprints.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="923" height="302" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21200" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021.png 923w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021-300x98.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/preprint-posting-trends-plos-and-comparators-to-end-2021-768x251.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px"></figure>



<p><sub>*Preprints posted in 2022 are date are excluded, as many of these papers have not yet gone on to publication</sub></p>



<p>One benefit of the Open Science Indicators dataset is that it provides a more complete view of preprint posting <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">than has previously been possible</a> for PLOS. Among the most popular preprint servers for both PLOS and comparators were the community/discipline specific servers bioRxiv, medRxiv. Differences in server use between PLOS and comparators is likely correlated with the preprint servers different publishers work most closely with.</p>

<p><sub>*Calculated as a percentage of total preprints posted in a detectable repository</sub></p>



<p>The prevalence of preprints also varies by region. Looking at broad geographic areas, we see the highest preprint rates (27%) in the Americas. Africa (excluding North Africa), Europe, and Australasia all post preprints at a similar rate (21-23%), while Asia and North Africa/Middle East (MENA) have lower adoption at 15% and 17% respectively. We haven&rsquo;t so far sought to interpret why these differences in preprint posting by region exist, but welcome comments. These latest Open Science Indicator results may complement the work of others who have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281659">begun to look</a> at regional preprint adoption rates in the context of equity in scientific publication.</p>

<h2>Using the Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>There are many ways to view and analyze Open Science Indicators: take a closer look at the data: identify the most popular data and code repositories, look for patterns in how researchers use repositories vs Supporting Information files to share data, or cross reference to investigate differences in disciplinary or regional norms. Just last month, Robyn Price, Imperial College London wrote on <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/"><em>The Bibliomagician</em></a> how institutions might use Indicators to better understand their researchers&rsquo; publishing patterns while taking a deeper look at the data for a specific institution. However <em>you </em>use Open Science Indicators, we want to hear about it! Share your interpretations, thoughts, and questions&mdash;and be sure to let us know what additional data points would be most useful to you.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flour-beetles-drink-water-using-butts">How some beetles ‘drink’ water using their butts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some beetles “drink” using their butts, and scientists are starting to understand how.</p>



<p>Red flour beetles, a major agricultural pest, open their anus to get water vapor in the air flowing into the lower gut and condensing on any poop there. The insects draw water out of the fecal material <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217084120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using special cells lining their lower digestive system</a>, researchers report March 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>This “amazing mechanism” could one day be exploited to make beetle-specific pesticides that could protect crops while safeguarding bees and other insects, says Kenneth Halberg, a comparative endocrinologist and physiologist at the University of Copenhagen.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Insect pests get into <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/av013e/av013e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as 20 percent</a> of the global food supply every year, destroying food and costing farmers money, the United Nations&#8217; Food and Agriculture Organization estimates. Beetles are particularly pernicious. These insects can thrive in arid environments, including in supplies of wheat and other bone-dry crops. One way dry-adapted beetles survive is by recycling water out of their poop using the rectal complex, an organ near the end of their digestive system. But researchers didn’t know how the insects accomplished the feat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Halberg and colleagues found that in red flour beetles (<em>Tribolium castaneum</em>), the gene <em>Nha1</em> is more active in cells pockmarking the lining of the rectal complex than elsewhere in the body. Scientists have previously suggested that the rectal complex’s blisterlike cells were involved in sucking water out of material in the organ.</p>



<p>But “the paradox was that they don’t look like transporting cells,” says Michael O’Donnell, an insect physiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The new study may resolve that paradox. <em>Nha1 </em>produces a protein that pumps charged potassium particles across the cells’ membranes, Halberg’s team found. That may result in a buildup of the ions on the outside of the rectal complex, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>Through osmosis, water will move toward areas with a high concentration of ions. So that pool of potassium could allow beetles to move water through the wall of the rectal complex and into the rest of the body.</p>



<p>Experiments confirmed that the insects opened their anuses in high humidity so water vapor could flow into the rectal complex. What’s more, beetles with <em>Nha1</em> deactivated didn’t survive as well in dry conditions as normal beetles.</p>





<p>It’s not clear whether other beetles use a similar mechanism, Halberg says. But the finding emphasizes how “nature has its way of developing some quite interesting solutions to some very interesting problems.”</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission? We recently launched the </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, I created an alert on Scopus to keep me updated about new publications in the <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences,</em> which had been<em> </em><a href="http://hkjoss.com/index.php/journal">hijacked by fraudulent publishers</a>. I wanted to know if unauthorized content from this hijacked journal ended up in the index.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I forgot about the alert until last month, when I received three notifications from Scopus regarding new publications in the journal.</p>



<p>These notifications included lists of a dozen papers indexed in Scopus, all of them originating from the hijacked version of the journal. Inspecting the profile of the journal showed that probably more than 55 papers from the hijackers are currently indexed in Scopus:</p>



<span id="more-126833"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xu2CHwdse9VyHrkBNn6FsOoyI4VYR7MiOJOn3YbLXFvxT6nPS8N4L2QS4bP4iBgG-1-dNtHsTcvhXbsO_biIgNeiXio-2t1If0k7TEgzZPnh9SDjAmB_kM_Fduhtf1iWrN-JQ9bHsfsaPh1LTzogzQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The hijacking of the <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> started in 2019, when the web domain of the clone journal was created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hijackers’ website mimicked the genuine journal well. The archive of past issues included papers from the genuine journal. Additionally, the clone journal falsely claimed that it was indexed in Scopus and Web of Science and adhered to the ethical principles set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Although the papers were published online in English, the title and abstract of each paper were translated into Chinese to make the hijacked journal appear authentic. However, the Chinese versions were most likely machine-translated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, the hijacked <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> is a high quality clone, and hundreds of scholars have been duped by the fraudulent journal over several years.</p>



<p>The original journal became aware of the problem and informed potential authors:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GVlNSA6VbdNNwgRxs9WiNYu-59SEXdyDUuZu-JC-_BYZ30XCFLQefLe4l6OvmguyFOmgVTBNtUOy8AUJtaVD3q0yzO03P_LfKxOjyQuM3PQPU0h9lL5CZfoEA-kZZOHqjEpVV2zwDdecsH4aCRf3Qg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><em>Screenshot from April 2022.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“We have been alerted that some English websites have collected payments from authors for publications on the pretext of our Journal’s English and Chinese titles, i.e. Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences (香港社會科學學報), ISSN and Journal’s cover. The Journal solemnly clarifies that we are an academic journal only publishes papers written in Chinese, and do not charge from authors. If in doubt, please contact us at hkjss@eduhk.hk”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This fraudulent journal could continue to publish dozens of papers, charging 300 euros each, while&nbsp; the genuine journal, <a href="https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alPublicationJournal?PublicationID=P20201111001&amp;type=P001">according to the information on one Chinese website</a>, ceased publishing in 2022, with volume 58 as its final issue. <a href="http://www.eduhk.hk/hkjss">The website of the genuine journal </a>is not available anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the genuine <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> has really stopped publishing, this opens a new opportunity for the hijacked journal, because the clone website remains the only one for the title. Evidence from other cases also suggests that hijackers are particularly interested in cloning journals that have stopped publishing. Thus, the hijacked <em>Hong Kong Journal of Social Sciences</em> succeeded in penetrating Scopus with an issue 59, published in 2022. All the new papers were published in English, unlike the genuine journal, which was published in Chinese.</p>



<p>Many of the papers published in this hijacked journal, including those which, according to Scopus, were funded by various universities, the Connecting Europe Facility, and the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research, are not considered as having been officially published. Furthermore, the money from universities and international organizations may have gone to fraudulent publishers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/threats-civilization-survival-humanity-apocalypse">Here are the Top 10 threats to the survival of civilization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Civilizations don’t last forever. Just ask the Aztecs. Or the Maya. Or fans of the original Roman Empire.</p>



<p>From the ancient Myceneans in the Mediterranean to the Anasazi in Arizona, societies throughout history have often gone the way of the dinosaurs and the dodo. Wars, or disease, or altered weather patterns, or natural disasters, or famine have repeatedly tipped complex regional societies past the point of stability, initiating chaos, ruin and ultimately total demise.</p>



<p>In his original unabridged dictionary, published in 1828, Noah Webster defined civilization as “the state of being refined in manners, from the grossness of savage life, and improved in arts and learning.”</p>





<p>Today civilization is a lot more complicated. Now <em>civilization</em> connotes global complexity and technological sophistication beyond anything Webster would have recognized. Civilization has become a state “marked by urbanization, advanced techniques (as of agriculture and industry), expanded population, and complex social organization,” as the most recent unabridged Webster’s dictionary describes it.</p>



<p>Civilization’s current stability depends on a vast global interdependence of countless connected components. Food and fuel, materials for manufacturing, clothing and housing — all require the cooperation of individuals, corporations and nations. Transportation, communication, economic activity anywhere affect everything everywhere (sometimes, all at once).</p>



<p>So far, the economic and social structures, governmental agencies and relevant public policies have managed to maintain something resembling Webster’s recent definition. But all that is under threat. Civilization is on the brink of breakdown. There’s no guarantee that 21st century civilization will last till the 22nd.</p>



<p>In fact, humankind now faces a multitude of credible existential threats of which everybody ought to be aware. Lack of space, though, requires that immediate warnings herein be restricted to the Top 10 Threats to the Survival of Civilization, with relevant movies noted. (Note to <em>The Last of Us</em> fans — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">fungal zombie apocalypse</a> would have been No. 11.)</p>



<h4>10. Alien invasion</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The War of the Worlds</em></a></p>





<p>An assault on Earth by extraterrestrials isn’t exactly likely anytime soon. Even if enemy aliens are out there, they’d have to come a really long way for no good reason. Surely they’ve monitored Earth’s TV and radio output and would decide to look for intelligent life elsewhere.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, if spacefaring aliens did attack, they could easily destroy all earthly civilization. Even if they appeared to be friendly at first, don’t be fooled by a gift book from them titled <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734684/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>To Serve Man</em></a>. And don’t think Earth’s microbes will save us like they did in <em>The War of the Worlds</em>. If aliens possessed the technological capability for interstellar travel, they would also be smart enough to wear a damn mask.</p>



<h4>9. Asteroid impact</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Armageddon</em></a><em></em></p>



<p>Not an immediate concern, yet more likely than an alien invasion. After all, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-dinosaur-demise-cause-mystery">asteroid has already wiped out civilization on Earth once before</a>. True, dinosaur civilization didn’t have the same kind of technology human civilization does. But a sufficiently big asteroid would certainly take down a lot of modern technology, and subsequent fires followed by global cooling (a <em>Game of Thrones</em> version of winter) would make a mess of the rest.</p>



<h4>8. Bees all die</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389790/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bee Movie</em></a></p>



<p>According to Twitter, if bees all die, humans will soon all be dead as well. That prediction appears to derive from an Albert Einstein quote found widely on the internet: “If the bee disappeared off the face of the Earth, man would only have four years left to live.” Such a quote does not appear in the standard compilation of Einstein quotations, though, and nobody seems to have any evidence that he ever said it.</p>



<p>Still, the demise of the bees would be disastrous. Their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-bees-pollinators-billion-yields-six-u-s-crops">pollination of important crops</a> (coffee beans, for instance) keeps the world going. Bees are not the only important pollinators of course, but if some combination of pesticide poisoning and other calamities wiped out bees and other pollinating insects and animals, the consequences for humankind’s food supplies would be dire. Animal pollination is of at least some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1702377/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">importance for the majority of the world’s food crops</a>, a 2007 study concluded. </p>



<p>Still, it’s unlikely that the human race would die out completely without pollinators. But civilization would probably collapse as the food chain (or web) unraveled, and there was no coffee.</p>



<h4>7. Artificial intelligence takeover</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Terminator</em></a> (or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Colossus: The Forbin Project</em></a>)</p>



<p>A vast literature already exists describing the threats that artificial intelligence poses to civilization. Most such threats are minimal now, but as AI systems become more widespread, and both software and hardware become more sophisticated, AI’s destructive potential will pose an accelerating threat. A 2018 paper identified <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/TURCOG-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of scenarios for AI-generated global catastrophe</a>.</p>



<p>For example, in a future in which civilization relies extensively on robots, a computer virus with AI capability could become a weapon for a malevolent cyberattack. “If the attack is on a very large scale, affecting billions of sophisticated robots with a large degree of autonomy, it may result in human extinction,” wrote <a href="https://www.archmission.org/alexey-turchin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexey Turchin</a> and <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/denkenberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Denkenberger</a>.</p>



<p>And of course, putting AI in charge of things like nuclear weapons might easily become just as dangerous in real life as it is in the movies. Already the military makes use of AI technologies and, in the future, will no doubt employ AI-powered drones and other robotic weapons with increasing frequency. “Military robotics could become so cheap that drone swarms could cause enormous damage to the human population; a large autonomous army could attack humans because of a command error; billions of nanobots with narrow AI could be created in a terrorist attack and create a global catastrophe,” note Turchin and Denkenberger. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>6. Quantum computing</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/robert-redford-film-foretold-shors-quantum-computing-bombshell">Relevant movie</a>: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/?ref_=tt_mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sneakers</a></p>



<p>Ordinary AI has the potential to be risky enough, so it shouldn’t be surprising to discover that quantum computing, in principle a much more powerful technology still in its infancy, poses even more serious dangers. Overhyped as it frequently is, quantum computing nevertheless might someday be able to perform specific tasks dramatically more rapidly than today’s supercomputers. One such task might be simulating the interactions of atoms and molecules in order to design new drugs or other chemicals.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantum simulation</a> … offers an exponential quantum speedup in understanding reaction mechanism in molecules and probing the properties of new materials,” quantum scientist <a href="https://www.mpq.mpg.de/person/104566/6448833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Schiffer</a> wrote in a paper last year.</p>



<p>In malevolent hands, such power would also enable design of more effective poisons. Using quantum computers, a novel pandemic agent could be engineered without the need for time-consuming ordinary chemical trial and error. “There is an existential threat to humanity arising from the prospect of being able to run quantum simulation on a quantum computers in the future,” Schiffer argues.</p>



<h4>5. Complexity’s instability</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <em>The Butterfly Effect</em> (title only — actual movie is irrelevant)</p>



<p>Any sufficiently complex system is at risk of reaching a tipping point where the slightest disturbance can initiate a collapse. So a seemingly insignificant event can trigger an apocalypse. It’s like the way at some point adding a single grain of sand to a large sandpile can cause it all to come tumbling down. Or the snap of a twig initiating an avalanche. Such complex systems seem stable because their complexity conceals underlying vulnerability. But the math exists to analyze such systems and predict their demise.</p>



<p>In 2000, geophysicists <a href="https://emeritus.er.ethz.ch/about-us/people/sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didier Sornette</a> and Anders Johansen warned that such analyses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast a collapse of human population growth</a> along with the mother of all economic crashes in the 2050s. Obviously, the economy and human population growth are key aspects of civilization as a whole. So these forecasts “point to the existence of an end to the present era, which will be irreversible and cannot be overcome by any novel innovation,” Sornette and Johansen wrote.</p>



<p>In a 2013 paper, Sornette and <a href="https://www.risk.net/author/peter-cauwels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Cauwels</a> compared the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silent march to catastrophe to the phenomenon of “creep” in materials</a>, where small, unnoticeable cracks accumulate until the material suddenly fractures. It’s like society today is a lobster that thinks it’s getting a nice, pleasant bath and doesn’t notice the water getting warmer until it’s too late. For the world at large, the result might very well be a “blood red abyss,” Sornette and Cauwels wrote, the “likely and very painful final stage of creep … ending in the failure of existing institutions.”</p>



<h4>4. Social media</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Don’t Look Up</em></a></p>



<p>It’s already evident that social media platforms have amplified ideological idiocy propagated to deter efforts to prevent or diminish many of the threats to civilization. Anti-vaccination propaganda is a prominent example, as is the effort to dispel the dangers of climate change and block efforts to address it. Social media enables <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">disseminators of falsehoods to manipulate the masses</a> and intimidate governments (as well as many organizations within the supposedly legitimate mainstream media). </p>



<p>On its own, social media might not destroy civilization totally, just eliminate civilized discourse. But combined with other options for vast destruction, social media could accelerate civilization’s devastation while impeding efforts to prevent it.</p>



<h4>3. Pandemic(s)</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>I Am Legend</em></a></p>



<p>You would think that a pandemic that has killed more than a million Americans and many millions more people worldwide would launch a serious effort to guard against future pandemics. Instead, the pandemic has led not to strengthening of public health measures, but an official response telling everybody they’re on their own.</p>



<p>Institutions charged with protecting public health now say individuals should weigh their own risks, but do not provide the necessary information to weigh those risks, and ignore the fact that the vast majority of people do not possess the expertise needed to weigh risks intelligently anyway. Making pandemic mitigations a personal choice is very much like saying people should decide for themselves whether to obey stop signs or run red lights. Consequently, a future pandemic as infectious as COVID-19, but with a much higher fatality rate, could kill enough people to shred the social fabric.</p>



<p>This danger has long been foreseen, but mostly ignored. In 1988, molecular biologist and Nobel laureate <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/373248" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Lederberg lamented complacency about the threat of global epidemics</a>, and warned that viruses and other microbes are formidable foes in a never-ending competition for planetary domination. “In that natural evolutionary competition,” Lederberg wrote, “there is no guarantee that we will find ourselves the survivor.”</p>



<h4>2. Nuclear war</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dr. Strangelove</em></a></p>



<p>After World War II, nuclear war was the most likely end-of-civilization scenario, and it certainly became a popular theme for fictional accounts of civilization’s demise. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, though, many people who had been holding their breath since 1945 permitted themselves to exhale. But as long as nuclear arsenals remained undismantled, the threat continued, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-power-weapons-risk-physics">now it may be greater than ever</a>.</p>



<p>In January, the <em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</em> <a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed its famous doomsday clock to 90 seconds before midnight</a>, the closest to global catastrophe in the clock’s history. The publication’s science and security board released a statement saying the new time was motivated largely, but not exclusively, by Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Russia’s thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict — by accident, intention, or miscalculation — is a terrible risk. The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone’s control remains high.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, declared last year that the world now faces a time of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-health-antonio-guterres-2871563e530f9a676d7884b3e2d871c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear danger</a> as great as during the height of the Cold War. “Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he warned.</p>



<p>And of course, if Russia doesn’t initiate nuclear holocaust, there’s always North Korea, China, Iran and a bunch of other countries.</p>



<h4>1. Climate change</h4>



<p>Relevant movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Mononoke</a></p>



<p>Scientists have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">warning for more than a century</a> that carbon dioxide emissions could alter the planet. Higher average temperatures, hotter summers, melting sea ice, severe droughts, more wildfires, more powerful hurricanes and yes, even stronger winter storms are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">already signaling that climate change is not a myth</a>. International efforts to agree on steps to limit rising carbon dioxide levels have stumbled. Study after study has detailed the numerous negative consequences for agriculture, human health and social well-being. Catastrophic climate change could instigate wars, famine, revolution.</p>



<p>Efforts to mitigate climate change might save civilization of course. But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if such efforts fail, the worst-case warming scenarios are truly apocalyptic</a>, as <a href="https://www.cser.ac.uk/team/luke-kemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Kemp</a> and coauthors warned last year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. “There is ample evidence that climate change could become catastrophic,” they wrote. They point out that climate change has played a part in the collapse of many regional civilizations. (There’s a reason why most people have never heard of the Natufian hunter-gatherers of Southwest Asia.) Uncertainties about future climate are great enough, those authors contend, to warrant serious investigation into the prospect that climate change could result “in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction.”</p>



<p>Of course, most of the risks to the civilization are not isolated threats. Climate change could trigger wars (see No. 2) or contribute to the spread of infectious diseases (No. 3), Kemp and colleagues note. And a United Nations report last year found that analyses of numerous related systemic risks “show a <a href="https://www.undrr.org/publication/global-catastrophic-risk-and-planetary-boundaries-relationship-global-targets-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous tendency</a> for the world to move toward a global collapse scenario” in “the absence of ambitious policy and near global adoption and successful implementation.” In other words, without worldwide cooperation, “total societal collapse is a possibility.”</p>



<p>Both Kemp and colleagues and the authors of the U.N. report emphasize that these warnings are not predictions but calls to action. Listing threats is not for the purpose of overdramatizing them or to suggest that everybody should surrender to an inevitable existential catastrophe.</p>



<p>Behavioral scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/RVAwonk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caroline Orr Bueno</a>, one of the few sane voices who offsets Twitter’s threat to civilization with insight and intelligence about misinformation and the techniques for spreading it, warns that scaring people “makes them reject the message.”</p>



<p>“The key is to get people to perceive that the threat is real,” she tweets, “but also that there are things we can do to effectively reverse the threat.”</p>



<p>And therein lies the hope. </p>



<p>Warnings of potential catastrophes should not be taken as cause for despair, but as motivation for investigating the dangers. “Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience and inform policy,” Kemp and colleagues write. After all, when drought dissolved the Natufians’ civilization 10,000 years ago, they had no power to affect the climate. Modern humans do have such power. They could, in principle, stop using that power to make things worse and take steps to restore civilization’s safety and stability. At least until the aliens arrive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-heavier-accelerator-collider">The W boson might not be heavier than expected after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>The battle over the heft of a hard-to-detect particle is heating up. What’s at stake? Only the leading theory describing all known matter in the universe.</p>



<p>A recalculation of the mass of an elementary particle, the W boson, has increased the tension between measurements from competing particle collider experiments. The ultimate outcome could bolster the standard model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental forces and quantum bits that make up everything we see in the cosmos. Or it could reveal signs of the standard model’s breakdown, depending on which lab’s answer prevails.</p>





<p>A reanalysis of old data from the Large Hadron Collider’s ATLAS experiment yields <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2853290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a W boson mass of about 80,360 million electron volts</a>, or MeV. Researchers with the experiment, at CERN in Geneva, reported the measurement March 23 at the Rencontres de Moriond conference in La Thuile, Italy. The revised value is closely aligned with predictions from the standard model.</p>



<p>It also boasts reduced uncertainty from the researchers’ previous analysis of the data, which they reported in 2018, increasing their confidence that they got the mass right.</p>



<p>But the updated mass is at odds with that of another group. In 2022, scientists from the Collider Detector at Fermilab, or CDF, experiment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">shocked the physics community</a> with a measurement of 80,434 MeV — about 100 MeV heavier than expected (<em>SN: 4/7/22</em>). If the CDF report is correct, it implies that something is off with the standard model that has persevered in the face of every experimental challenge thrown at it over the last 50 years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-physics-missing-link-found">W boson</a> is responsible for the weak force, one of three fundamental forces in the standard model (<em>SN: 2/5/83</em>). And “it’s the only mass of a particle in the standard model that can be calculated,” says theoretical physicist Sven Heinemeyer of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. That is, the standard model theory yields a specific mass for the W boson, whereas the masses of other particles such as electrons and quarks are inputs and can be — as far as the theory is concerned — any value. Finding a W boson mass that’s different from standard model predictions would show the current theory is wrong.</p>



<p>The ATLAS reanalysis offers a stronger counterpoint to the CDF claim <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5475-4#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the earlier ATLAS analysis of the same data</a>. “The new analysis is an important confirmation of our previous result,” says Andreas Hoecker, a physicist at CERN.</p>



<p>The latest ATLAS value widens the chasm that separates CDF’s mass measurement from the herd of other studies. But it shouldn’t be seen as erasing CDF’s standard model challenge, says Duke University physicist Ashutosh Kotwal, a member of the CDF collaboration.</p>



<p>“The perspective on the CDF [announcement of a heavy W boson in 2022] does not change because of the ATLAS reanalysis,” Kotwal says. Because the reanalysis is based on data that ATLAS already released in 2017, he says, “the fact that ATLAS obtains a similar value as before is to be expected.”</p>





<p>Heinemeyer, who is not affiliated with ATLAS or CDF, sees a shift in the W boson mass landscape, but no sign of a resolution of the discrepancy.</p>



<p>“Having one new measurement is not enough,” Heinemeyer says. “If more and more measurements were to come out now from ATLAS and [other experiments], and they would all be in the same ballpark, at some point the community would decide CDF did something wrong.”</p>



<p>The next word on the W boson mass will probably come with pending studies from ATLAS and other experiments at CERN. The CDF experiment shut down in 2011, so it will not contribute further to the debate.</p>



<p>In the meantime, researchers hope to scrutinize each other’s analyses to search for clues that might help explain discrepancies in W boson mass measurements. “The CDF April 2022 paper provides a number of cross-checks of the CDF methodology and is transparent,” Kotwal says. “I look forward to detailed discussions of the ATLAS methodology.”</p>



<p>In the end, the conflict might reveal a new crack in the standard model. Or it could turn out to be another example of one of the most successful theories in history standing strong.</p>

<p>A group of insectologists is receiving praise on social media for retracting a 2022 paper in which they claimed, erroneously, it turns out, to have discovered a novel ant fossil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “An Eocene army ant,” appeared in November in <em>Biology Letters</em>, a Royal Society title. The authors were led by Christine Sosiak, of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, in Newark. The paper has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0398">Sosiak and her colleagues</a>:</p>



<span id="more-126828"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Here we report the oldest army ant fossil and the first from the Eastern Hemisphere (EH), Dissimulodorylus perseus, preserved in Baltic amber dated to the Eocene. Using a combined morphological and molecular ultra conserved elements dataset spanning doryline lineages, we find that D. perseus is nested among extant EH army ants with affinities to Dorylus. Army ants are characterized by limited extant diversification throughout most of the Cenozoic; the discovery of D. perseus suggests an unexpected diversity of now-extinct army ant lineages in the Cenozoic, some of which were present in Continental Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But not long after the paper appeared, other ant experts informed the researchers that their ant advance was not an emissary from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene Epoch</a> after all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2023.0059">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Shortly after the publication of this report the authors were contacted independently by two researchers (Brendon E. Boudinot, The University of Jena and Dmitry A. Dubovikoff, St Petersburg State University). Both researchers indicated that they were aware of several specimens of Dorylus preserved in sub-fossil resin (copal), within historical collections of Baltic amber from 1920 to 1930s—the same time frame associated with the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) specimen reported in Sosiak et al. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031430/#RSBL20230059C1">1</a>]. Copal in both cases were either initially misidentified or mixed among pieces of authentic Baltic amber. The collection at the University of Jena comprised both Baltic amber and copal mixed and without labels; those copal specimens were identified via FTIR analysis this year. At least one of the Jena copal specimens, although not a Dorylus army ant specimen, was prepared in the same manner as the MCZ specimen we reported here: trimmed and mounted directly to a microscope slide. The traditional practice of slide mounting Baltic amber with inclusions contributed to our confidence regarding the provenance of the MCZ specimen. Slide mounting was a common practice in the nineteenth and early twentieth century among Baltic amber researchers [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031430/#RSBL20230059C2">2</a>].&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sosiak and her colleagues explain that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While we recovered a characteristic signature of Baltic amber in all spectra from both raw and prepared Baltic amber references (the ‘Baltic shoulder&#8217; between 1175 and 1250 cm−1 [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031430/#RSBL20230059C4">4</a>]), we did not recover the ‘shoulder&#8217; in the MCZ specimen or in any of the copal specimens (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10031430/figure/RSBL20230059F1/">figure 1</a>). The exact provenance of this specimen will require additional investigation; however, we feel confident in stating that the MCZ holotype is not Baltic amber and is likely a sub-fossil resin. Because the age and locality of Baltic amber is central to the conclusions made in our report, we wish to retract our publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors end with an apology, and a warning of sorts to others in the field:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While museum labels remain the most common manner in which specimen provenance is established, we should have exhibited more caution regarding specimen provenance and deeply regret this error.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-supersized-snails">What did Homo sapiens eat 170,000 years ago? Roasted, supersized land snails</a></h4>

              
                <p>Slow-motion large land snails made for easy catching and good eating as early as 170,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Until now, the oldest evidence of <em>Homo sapiens</em> eating land snails dated to roughly 49,000 years ago in Africa and 36,000 years ago in Europe. But tens of thousands of years earlier, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people at a southern African rock-shelter roasted these slimy, chewy — and nutritious — creepers</a> that can grow as big as an adult’s hand, researchers report in the April 15 <em>Quaternary Science Reviews</em>.</p>





<p>Analyses of shell fragments excavated at South Africa’s Border Cave indicate that hunter-gatherers who periodically occupied the site heated large African land snails on embers and then presumably ate them, say chemist Marine Wojcieszak and colleagues. Wojcieszak, of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage in Brussels, studies chemical properties of archaeological sites and artifacts.</p>



<p>The supersized delicacy became especially popular between about 160,000 and 70,000 years ago, the researchers say. Numbers of unearthed snail shell pieces were substantially larger in sediment layers dating to that time period.</p>



<p>New discoveries at Border Cave challenge an influential idea that human groups did not make land snails and other small game a big part of their diet until the last Ice Age waned around 15,000 to 10,000 years ago, Wojcieszak says.</p>



<p>Long before that, hunter-gatherer groups in southern Africa roamed the countryside collecting large land snails to bring back to Border Cave for themselves and to share with others, the team contends. Some of the group members who stayed behind on snail-gathering forays may have had limited mobility due to age or injury, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>“The easy-to-eat, fatty protein of snails would have been an important food for the elderly and small children, who are less able to chew hard foods,” Wojcieszak says. “Food sharing [at Border Cave] shows that cooperative social behavior was in place from the dawn of our species.”</p>



<p>Border Cave’s ancient snail scarfers also push back the human consumption of mollusks by several thousand years, says archaeologist Antonieta Jerardino of the University of South Africa in Pretoria. Previous excavations at a cave on South Africa’s southern tip found evidence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-edge-ancestors">humans eating mussels, limpets and other marine mollusks as early as around 164,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/11</em>).</p>



<p>Given the nutritional value of large land snails, an earlier argument that it was eating fish and shellfish that energized human brain evolution may have been overstated, says Jerardino, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>It’s not surprising that ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> recognized the nutritional value of land snails and occasionally cooked and ate them by 170,000 years ago, says Teresa Steele, an archaeologist at the University of California, Davis who was not part of the work. But intensive consumption of these snails starting around 160,000 years ago is unexpected and raises questions about whether climate and habitat changes may have reduced the availability of other foods, &nbsp;Steele says.</p>



<p>Researchers have already found evidence that ancient people at Border Cave cooked starchy plant stems, ate an array of fruits and hunted small and large animals. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-grass-beds-insect-repellent">The oldest known grass bedding</a>, from around 200,000 years ago, has also been unearthed at Border Cave (<em>SN: 8/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>Several excavations have been conducted at the site since 1934. Three archaeologists on the new study — Lucinda Backwell and Lyn Wadley of Wits University in Johannesburg and Francesco d’Errico of the University of Bordeaux in France — directed the latest Border Cave dig, which ran from 2015 through 2019.</p>



<p>Discoveries by that team inspired the new investigation. Excavations uncovered shell fragments of large land snails, many discolored from possible burning, in all but the oldest sediment layers containing remnants of campfires and other <em>H. sapiens</em> activity. The oldest layers date to at least 227,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Chemical and microscopic characteristics of 27 snail shell fragments from various sediment layers were compared with shell fragments of modern large African snails that were heated in a metal furnace. Experimental temperatures ranged from 200° to 550° Celsius. Heating times lasted from five minutes to 36 hours.</p>



<p>All but a few ancient shell pieces displayed signs of extended heat exposure consistent with having once been attached to snails that were cooked on hot embers. Heating clues on shell surfaces included microscopic cracks and a dull finish.</p>



<p>Only lower parts of large land snail shells would have rested against embers during cooking, possibly explaining the mix of burned and unburned shell fragments unearthed at Border Cave, the researchers say.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rogue-planets-moons-life">Planets without stars might have moons suitable for life</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NOORDWIJK, THE NETHERLANDS —</strong> Life might arise in the darkest of places: the moon of a planet wandering the galaxy without a star.</p>



<p>The gravitational tug-of-war between a moon and its planet can keep certain satellites toasty enough for liquid water to exist there — a condition widely considered crucial for life. Now computer simulations suggest that, given the right orbit and atmosphere, some moons orbiting rogue planets <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/8143902/11530746/abstract_Giulia+Roccetti.pdf/512d1d33-ef9c-97b1-ae3b-fe4fe999ec77?t=1677492128888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can stay warm for over a billion years</a>, astrophysicist Giulia Roccetti reported March 23 at the PLANET-ESLAB 2023 Symposium. She and her colleagues <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/presence-of-liquid-water-during-the-evolution-of-exomoons-orbiting-ejected-freefloating-planets/0F01ACB0AB373E87BB30D1DDA6F45800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also report their findings</a> March 20 in the <em>International Journal of Astrobiology</em>.</p>





<p>“There might be many places in the universe where habitable conditions can be present,&#8221; says Roccetti, of the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany. But life presumably also needs long-term stability. &#8220;What we are looking for is places where these habitable conditions can be sustained for hundreds of millions, or billions, of years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Habitability and stability don’t necessarily need to come from a nearby sun. Astronomers have spotted about 100 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fewer-big-rogue-planets-roam-galaxy-recount-shows">starless planets</a>, some possibly formed from gas and dust clouds the way stars form, others probably ejected from their home solar systems (<em>SN: 7/24/17</em>). Computer simulations suggest that there may be as many of these free-floating planets as there are stars in the galaxy.</p>



<p>Such orphaned planets might also have moons — and in 2021, researchers calculated that these moons<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/abs/presence-of-water-on-exomoons-orbiting-freefloating-planets-a-case-study/1863C1DB337F974DF8B2ACE4D5BB8319" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> need not be cold and barren places</a>.</p>



<p>Unless a moon&#8217;s orbit is a perfect circle, the gravitational pull of its planet continually deforms it. Resulting friction inside the moon generates heat. In our own solar system, this process plays out on moons such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-core-water-ocean-saturn">Saturn&#8217;s Enceladus</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-moons-tidal-waves-ganymede-callisto-europa-io">Jupiter’s Europa</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/17; SN: 8/6/20</em>). A sufficiently thick, heat-trapping atmosphere, likely one dominated by carbon dioxide, might then keep the surface warm enough for water to remain liquid. That water could come from chemical reactions with the carbon dioxide and hydrogen in the atmosphere, initiated by the impact of high-speed charged particles from space.</p>



<p>But such a moon won&#8217;t stay warm forever. The same gravitational forces that heat it up also mold its orbit into a circle. Gradually, the ebb and flow of gravity felt by the moon deforms it less and less, and the supply of frictional heat dwindles.</p>



<p>In the new study, Roccetti and her colleagues ran 8,000 computer simulations of a sunlike star with three Jupiter-sized planets. These simulations showed that planets that are ejected from their solar system will often sail off into space with their moons in tow.</p>



<p>The team then ran simulations of those moons, assumed to be the size of Earth, whizzing around their planets along the orbit they ended up with during the ejection. The goal was to see if gravitational heating occurred and if it lasted long enough for life to potentially originate there. Earth may have become <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-may-have-been-possible-earth-earliest-most-hellish-eon">habitable within a few hundred million years</a>, although the earliest evidence of living organisms here date to about 1 billion years after the planet formed (<em>SN: 1/26/18</em>).</p>





<p>Because an atmosphere is crucial to heat retention, the team did their calculations with three alternatives. For moons with an atmosphere the same pressure as Earth’s, the period of potential habitability lasted at most about 50 million years, the team found. But it can last nearly 300 million years if the atmospheric pressure is 10 times that of Earth, and for about 1.6 billion years at pressures 10 times greater still. That amount of pressure may sound extreme, but it’s close to conditions on the similarly sized Venus. <s></s></p>



<p>Warmth and water might not be enough to let living organisms appear, though. Moons of free-floating planets “will not be the most favorable places for life to arise,” says astrophysicist Alex Teachey, of the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think stars, due to their incredible power output and their longevity, are going to be far better sources of energy for life,” says Teachey, who studies the moons of exoplanets. “A big open question … is whether you can even start life in a place like Europa or Enceladus, even if the conditions are right to sustain life, because you don&#8217;t have, for example, solar radiation that can help along the process of mutation for evolution.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Roccetti — although not an astrobiologist herself — thinks moons of orphan planets have a few &nbsp;important advantages. They will have some, but not too much, water, which many astrobiologists think is a better starting point for life than, say, an ocean world. And not having a star nearby means there are no solar flares, which in many cases will destroy the atmosphere of an otherwise promising planet.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are many environments in our universe which are very different from what we have here on Earth,” she says, “and it is important to investigate all of them.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-battery-cancer-cells-oxygen-mice">A new battery starves cancer cells of oxygen in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s not great when a person sucks all the oxygen out of a room. When a battery does it to a tumor, though, it could be a good thing.</p>



<p>A tiny self-charging battery wrapped around a tumor removes oxygen from the cancer cells’ environment, boosting the power of some cancer therapies, a study in mice shows. Mice that had small batteries wrapped around their breast cancer tumors, combined with cancer therapy, showed a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 percent decrease in tumor volume</a> in two weeks, researchers report March 31 in <em>Science Advances</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Solid tumors, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breast-cancer-cells-spread-already-armed-mob">those that can develop in breast cancer</a>, often grow rapidly — so rapidly that the tumor’s growth is faster than its blood supply can support (<em>SN: 5/10/17</em>). This means that the center of many tumors can be hypoxic, with much lower oxygen levels than surrounding tissue.</p>



<p>“Hypoxia is a double-edged sword,” says materials scientist Yongyao Xia, who specializes in battery materials at Fudan University in Shanghai. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/instead-starving-cancer-researchers-go-after-its-defenses">Low oxygen levels in tumors</a> mean that the body’s immune cells often cannot survive long enough to kill the cancerous cells (<em>SN: 2/22/17</em>). Hypoxic cells are also resistant to treatments like radiotherapy and even to traditional chemotherapies, as there isn’t enough blood flow to deliver a deadly dose, explains Fudan’s Fan Zhang, who studies biomedical materials.</p>



<p>“On the other hand, it provides a target for precision treatment of tumors,” Xia and Zhang write in the new paper.</p>



<p>The hypoxia could act as a beacon for chemicals called hypoxia-activated prodrugs. These are chemotherapeutic drugs hooked to a linking chemical that ensures the drug becomes active only in a low-oxygen environment, says Qing Zhang, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>But hypoxia-activated prodrugs don’t show much benefit in clinical trials, possibly in part because the solid tumors they are deployed against are not evenly hypoxic or not hypoxic enough. Xia and Fan Zhang wanted to find a way to make tumors more hypoxic, to give the prodrugs a better chance.</p>



<p>So the researchers and their colleagues deployed a tiny, flexible battery that could partially wrap around a tumor. The battery’s zinc electrode self-charges by sucking up oxygen from the environment. It also creates highly reactive oxygen pairs that can damage DNA but aren’t a usable form of oxygen for cells.</p>



<p>By slurping up most of the available oxygen and producing lots of reactive oxygen pairs, the battery alone was capable of shrinking tumors in mice by up to 26 percent of their original size two weeks after implantation. When combined with a hypoxia-activated prodrug, average tumor size shrank by 90 percent.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“I think the concept, the scientific basis, is solid,” Qing Zhang says. The findings are encouraging, he says, but extremely preliminary. Not only were the batteries deployed only in mice, but they also were used against a mouse-specific breast cancer. “It has to be tested in several breast cancer models, and also has to be tested in other cancer models,” he says. And, of course, in humans.</p>



<p>And a 90 percent decrease in tumor size is not a 100 percent decrease. “There’s still 10 percent left,” Qing Zhang says. If those cells survive, it could mean they are resistant to the hypoxia, and the tumor could grow back. As with many treatments, he says, it will probably have to be combined with other therapies to make sure the whole tumor is zapped for good.</p>



<p>Xia, Fan Zhang and their colleagues are already thinking about how the battery might have to be made more flexible and more powerful to work on human-sized tumors — using battery energy to starve cancer of air.</p>

<p>A nanotechnology journal has retracted two papers coauthored by a scientist in France who is <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2023/02/open-letter-to-cnrs.html">accused of</a> manipulating or reusing graphs and figures in nearly two dozen instances, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The scientist, <a href="https://cspbat.univ-paris13.fr/41-membres/105-spadavecchia-jolanda.html">Jolanda Spadavecchia</a> (pictured), is research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). In December, an <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2022/12/05/une-affaire-d-inconduite-scientifique-agite-un-laboratoire-de-recherche-en-chimie_6153035_1650684.html">article</a> in the newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> described allegations of misconduct in Spadavecchia’s lab.</p>



<p>Spadavecchia is second author of one of the retracted papers, “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/26/43/435703">Interaction of Thermus thermophilus ArsC enzyme and gold nanoparticles naked-eye assays speciation between As(III) and As(V);</a>” she is senior author of the other, “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/27/19/195701">One-pot synthesis of a gold nanoparticle–Vmh2 hydrophobin nanobiocomplex for glucose monitoring</a>.”</p>



<span id="more-126818"></span>



<p>The papers were published in <em>Nanotechnology</em> in 2015 and 2016, respectively. They have been cited 19 and 18 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/acc643">retraction</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/acc644">notices</a> appeared online March 30. They state that an investigation by the journal’s publisher, IOP Publishing, found that a figure in each report was “duplicated from another source without disclosure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2016 paper, an electron-microscopy image was apparently copied from the 2015 paper; that paper contained a histogram from a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-013-2111-6">2013 paper</a> on which&nbsp; Spadavecchia was an author.</p>



<p>The duplications in the two papers are not isolated incidents. In an <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2023/02/open-letter-to-cnrs.html">open letter</a> to CNRS published on <a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/dorothy-bishop">Dorothy Bishop</a>’s blog, the psychologist and scientific sleuth, along with 16 other researchers, responded to the recent article in <em>Le Monde</em> about misconduct in Spadavecchia’s lab. They pointed to 23 instances, noted in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1di9gvmdMDi81PPgX-7jK8QDD_nREHDVKpuNvOi3rjbM/edit">an appendix</a> to their letter, where commenters on PubPeer flagged Spadavecchia’s studies for image duplication and manipulation. A search for Spadavecchia’s name on PubPeer yields more than <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Jolanda+Spadavecchia">30 results</a> with at least one comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one of Spadavecchia’s studies had been retracted until now. That article, “<a href="https://www.dovepress.com/design-and-synthesis-of-gold-gadolinium-core-shell-nanoparticles-as-co-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">Design and Synthesis of Gold-Gadolinium-Core-Shell Nanoparticles as Contrast Agent: a Smart Way to Future Nanomaterials for Nanomedicine Applications</a>,” was pulled by the <em>International Journal of Nanomedicine</em> in 2022 for problematic data presented in histograms. The journal’s editors determined that “this part of the article was integral to the study and the admission of these errors, because of the miscalculation, meant the data was unreliable,” according to the <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-design-and-synthesis-of-gold-gadolinium-core-shell-nanopart-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">retraction notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their letter, Bishop and her coauthors wrote that although CNRS did decide to take disciplinary action against Spadavecchia, the organization removed her from her lab for only a month. According to the letter, such “institutional malaise”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>allows those who are prepared to cheat to compete with other scientists to gain positions of influence, and so perpetuate further misconduct, while damaging the prospects of honest scientists who obtain less striking results.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were not able to reach <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-politi-490b7a39/">Jane Politi</a>, the first author of both papers in <em>Nanotechnology</em>. Spadavecchia did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Nanotechnology</em>’s retraction notices state that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have provided explanations and offered to make a correction; however, these do not adequately explain the re-use of the image and raise more concerns about the integrity of the work. As such IOP Publishing and the Editor in Chief agree this article should be retracted. IOP Publishing express thanks to the anonymous whistleblower and subject experts who were consulted during the investigation.The authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Luca De Stefano of the Italian National Research Council, the senior author of the 2015 paper, said the papers should have been corrected, not retracted. Of the duplication of the image from the 2015 paper, he told us in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I don&#8217;t know what exactly was the mistake at the basis of this error (since I was not the corresponding author of the paper at that time), but I offered to IOP the replication of the AuNPs synthesis and a new SEM image to correct the one found in the second (in order of time) paper published, but they refused. I agree that it is on all the authors&#8217; responsibility to check the material submitted for publication but in international cooperation work unfortunately it could happen with such kind of mistake. I simply believe that replicability is much more important, this is the reason for my proposal against the retraction. If the result is replicable, the figure is only a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>IOP said that the authors attributed the mistake to an unnamed student. A spokesperson for the publisher told us that the authors originally suggested updating the image caption, “claiming the similarities occurred because they reused nanoparticles from the previous study,” although the methods included in the newer study were different from the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson said the authors claimed the different methods would not affect the size or distribution of the nanoparticles. The authors also requested to change the synthesis description in the 2016 paper’s methods section, IOP said, which outside experts worried would change the results of the study. The authors then offered to create new images with the stated methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors did not explain how a histogram in the 2015 study was duplicated from a 2013 paper, according to the IOP spokesperson. They simply suggested replacing the histogram with a new one using the correct data, which were notably different. Both circumstances, the spokesperson said, were concerning enough to warrant retracting the studies.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>De Stefano declined to comment on how the histogram was duplicated because he was not an author of the 2013 study, but reiterated that in his view the paper should have been corrected, not retracted, since the experiment could be replicated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/capybaras-thrive-humans-eat">Capybaras thrive, even near humans, because they’re not picky eaters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Capybaras, the world’s largest rodent, naturally live in vast grasslands, wetlands and rivers throughout South America. Their name literally means grass eater in the Tupi language, which is indigenous to Brazil and other regions in South America.</p>



<p>So scientists who study capybara diets were surprised when they found the animals seemed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.13057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as happy munching on leafy forest plants as the wavy grasses</a> they’re used to. The new findings, which appear February 27 in the <em>Journal of Zoology</em>, suggest dietary flexibility has helped capybara populations balloon in cities and survive in farther-flung landscapes fragmented by roads, fields and other human-made changes over the past five decades or so.</p>





<p>“If a species’ diet is pretty specialized, that’s going to constrain their ability to adapt to modified ecosystems,” says Maria Luisa Jorge, an ecologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who was not involved in the study. “Capybaras eat a lot of grass — we call them grazers — but they can eat other things.” That has set them up for success, she says.</p>



<p>That success is visible in São Paulo, Brazil’s most densely populated metropolis.</p>



<p>“At the University of São Paulo, you’d see them every day, grazing” on campus, says Marcelo Magioli, an ecologist at Instituto Pró-Carnívoros in Brazil. They also amble along roadways and frequent farm fields, which give them easy access to calorie-rich crops.</p>



<p>Magioli wanted to know what capybaras around Brazil were eating to survive the shifting landscape. So he and his colleagues sampled hair from 210 capybaras in 13 different populations living in natural to heavily modified environments around Brazil. Some animals lived in the bustling metropolis of São Paulo; others lived near agricultural fields.</p>



<p>The team also sampled two populations in the Pantanal — South America’s massive, flooded grassland. The researchers analyzed carbon isotopes, different forms of carbon that can act as chemical fingerprints, in capybara hairs. The carbon isotopes told the scientists how much grass versus forest plants the animals ate.</p>



<p>As expected, capybaras with access to crops were eating them up; corn and sugarcane are grasses, familiar foods for the rodents. But capybaras in more fragmented, urban areas and in the Pantanal, where forests are encroaching into grasslands, munched on trees, vines and even cacti that were available to them, rather than selectively searching out grasses, the team found. Some capybaras ate both.</p>



<p>“I think the most impressive feeding behavior of this species is that they can transition between preferred and nonpreferred foods so they can survive in practically any habitat,” Magioli says.</p>





<p>While the flexible diet might mean capybaras have survived some big ecosystem changes, it’s not all good news. Crop-eating capybaras can get too chunky and suffer poor health, as well as be viewed as pests by farmers for eating or damaging crops. Comfort around infrastructure means more get hit by cars, and ticks the rodents carry can transmit deadly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilian spotted fever</a> to humans.</p>



<p>Reconnecting fragmented landscapes could let natural predators control capybara populations, decrease contact with humans and restore an ecological balance, Magioli says.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13176 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/AdobeStock_296764863.jpg.jCfs89rRMWATAA.0NHjYeTHcO.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />AIDS-related illnesses are the top cause of death for women aged 15-49 globally, with 18.8 million women and girls currently living with HIV. Young women in sub-Saharan Africa are twice as likely as young men to get infected due to socio-cultural, economic, and political inequalities. While HIV prevention medication has come a long way, remembering to take a daily tablet can be challenging. Injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) offers longer lasting and more convenient protection but still requires frequent visits to the clinic, which is why implant alternatives are being tested. But would women want to use them?</p>
<p>A recent study published in <em>BMC Women&#8217;s Health</em> gathered feedback from 800 women aged 18-30 in South Africa and Zimbabwe on their implant preferences using discrete choice experiments (DCEs). DCEs are a widely used survey method in market research and health economics that allows to identify preferences for various products or services. This approach enabled the researchers to prioritize the essential attributes of the implant and explore the trade-offs that women would be willing to make. Women were presented with five attributes of hypothetical implants, which were based on prior exploratory qualitative research. These attributes included rod length, number of rods and insertion sites on the body, duration, flexibility, and biodegradability (i.e., dissolvability). The survey asked participants to choose between pairs of hypothetical implants and whether they would use the product they chose.</p>
<p>The study found that women prioritized a longer duration of protection (2 years over 6 months) and considered the number of insertion sites and physical flexibility of the implant as important features to ensure discretion of the implant. Biodegradability was considered the least important attribute. The authors concluded that developers should take these preferences into consideration when designing an implant that women would actually want to use.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis is the process through which plants create sugars from light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and water. C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis is the most common type but is constrained by a tendency of photosynthetic enzymes to fix oxygen molecules instead of CO<sub>2</sub>. This phenomenon, known as photorespiration, squanders the plant&#8217;s energy. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, which evolved nearly 70 times in angiosperms circumvents photorespiration and lowers the rate of photosynthesis in certain environments. Intermediate species that have characteristics of both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis – the so-called C<sub>3</sub> Proto-Kranz (PK) photosynthesis – are rare but have provided valuable insights into the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Despite decades of research, there are still many questions about the genetic changes that occurred during the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis from a C<sub>3</sub> ancestor.</p>
<p>In a study recently published in <em>BMC Genomics</em>, high-confidence protein-coding leaf transcriptomes were generated from three closely related non-model grass species in the Otachyriinae subtribe. Transcriptomes were assembled across four different leaf segments that capture different stages of development. An analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) found that immature segments showed a higher transcriptional dynamic than mature segments. This pattern was observed in both C<sub>4</sub> and PK leaves, but the trend of decreasing DEG was reduced in the C<sub>3</sub> leaf segments. Interestingly, only the C<sub>4</sub> species maintained high levels of DEG until a later stage of development, suggesting that the C<sub>4</sub> leaf takes more time to complete the necessary anatomical differentiation prior to the activation of the photosynthetic machinery.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that the developmental program in C<sub>3</sub>, PK, and C<sub>4</sub> species is evolutionarily conserved, and that the recruitment of new pathways in C3 species may have contributed to the changes observed in C<sub>4</sub> species. This study provides a valuable contribution to the existing genomic resources and new tools to investigate the evolution of photosynthesis.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13178 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Fotolia_39193032_Subscription_XXL.jpg.jCftudvRMUANAA.7-Y5N9ken.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Providing healthcare for prisoners is a complex and challenging task that presents unique ethical, legal, and practical challenges. Healthcare professionals need specialized training to work with incarcerated people, balancing the responsibility of providing excellent medical care with maintaining security in the healthcare setting.</p>
<p>A recent debate article in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> explores the difficulties of providing hospital care that respects prisoners&#8217; rights and dignity. While prisoners are entitled to healthcare services, the quality of these services can vary widely between countries or even facilities. The authors emphasize that following medical ethics guidelines is crucial in prison medicine, and highlight the challenges of maintaining confidentiality, professional independence, and equivalence of care in hospital settings. Healthcare professionals must ensure that security guards do not interfere with patient-provider interaction, and their independence from prison administration is necessary to minimize the risk of conflicting loyalties.</p>
<p>To improve healthcare for incarcerated individuals in hospitals, the authors suggest that healthcare and security staff must work together while respecting each other&#8217;s roles and responsibilities. Clear communication is vital for better health outcomes and efficient hospital functioning. Patients should also receive clear information about the rules and living conditions while in hospital to ensure compliance. Additionally, the authors recommend independent expert groups regularly monitor and accredit on-site and off-site in-patient facilities for incarcerated individuals to ensure that medical ethics guidelines are being followed.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Health Services Research</em> &#8211; </strong><a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-023-09163-7"><strong>Should I stay or should I go? Why nurses are leaving community nursing in the UK</strong></a></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13179 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/AdobeStock_282020662.jpeg.jCeT79fRMYAZAA.S0nPD_3IbW.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="163" />This year, the UK has been facing the biggest health worker strike actions since the beginning of the NHS, causing significant disruption of health care. With inflation at a 40-year high, health workers are demanding an increase in wages to match increased cost of living. According to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), notoriously low pay has led to over 25,000 nurses to leave in the past year. Community nurses, who provide healthcare services to people in their homes or in community settings (nursing homes, clinics, and health centers) are particularly affected. But is low pay the only reason for this mass exodus we are witnessing?</p>
<p>In a study published in <em>BMC Health Services Research</em>, scientists from the University of Sheffield, Division of Nursing &amp; Midwifery, recently explored the differences in individual and organizational factors between community nurses who intend to leave and those who intend to stay in the profession. This cross-sectional online survey included questions on demographics, missed care, staffing levels, job satisfaction, and intention to leave. The survey found that 54.5% of respondents were dissatisfied with their job, and 27.6% of those who reported being dissatisfied intended to leave their job. The study identified four factors that have the highest impact on community nurses who intend to leave: excessive overtime, a reduced proportion of permanent staff, poor management and support, and poor working conditions.</p>
<p>The results of this study are consistent with similar research conducted in South Africa, Canada, and Saudi Arabia and reveal inherent problems in the organisational structure of health care settings. The authors suggest that policy initiatives should focus on ensuring that community nursing services have sufficient resources and funding to employ a safe and required number of staff at appropriate grades to reduce workload, burnout and increase job satisfaction.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13180 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/AdobeStock_201228660.jpeg.jCfNk9nRMWATAA.WkPD58TKfN.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Glioma is a tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain and spinal cord and is classified based on the type of glial cell they arise from. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of glioma with an average survival time of 12-18 months after diagnosis. Tumor classification used to rely solely on histological staining, but the current gold standard also includes molecular characterization. Nevertheless, more convenient and less biased techniques are needed to ensure the correct classification and treatment of glioma.</p>
<p>A recent study published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> discusses the potential use of confocal Raman spectroscopy (RS) combined with machine learning for objective and label-free diagnosis of glioma. RS is a non-invasive technique that determines the vibrational modes of molecules to identify their unique fingerprint. Using RS in combination with machine learning the authors successfully discriminated glioma grades and identified biomolecular changes during glioma progression at three different levels: tissue, serum, and single cell/multicellular spheroid level.</p>
<p>More specifically, RS was able to detect changes in the intensity of biomolecules, including proteins, hemoglobin, DNA, collagen, lipids, and glycans. The changes in glycosylation patterns were found to be important in glioma progression and contribute to the immunosuppressive nature of the glioma micro environment. The study also shows that liquid biopsies from patient serum samples could be used for glioma diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring as a minimally invasive alternative to solid biopsies. Finally, different cell lines could be discriminated with high accuracy using RS, indicating that grade discrimination may be achievable on single live cells.  The authors conclude that targeting single cells with RS could provide an additional benefit to current single-cell technologies in the era of cancer personalized medicine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiviral-drug-paxlovid-reduces-risk-long-covid">The antiviral drug Paxlovid reduces the risk of getting long COVID</a></h4>

              
                <p>The antiviral medication Paxlovid seems to reduce the chance of developing long COVID, researchers report.</p>



<p>In a large study of veterans’ medical records, Paxlovid lowered a person’s chance of landing in the hospital or dying from all causes in the six months following a COVID-19 infection. And the drug <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2802878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced the risk</a> of developing 10 of 13 long-term health problems, researchers report March 23 in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>. On average, the drug lowered the relative risk of developing the conditions by 26 percent, says Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p>





<p>The antiviral drug provided protection against some heart problems, blood clots, kidney damage, muscle pain, fatigue, shortness of breath and two neurological conditions. But it did not lessen the chance of developing liver disease, cough or of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-diabetes-fat-cells-blood-sugar">getting diabetes after a COVID infection</a> (<em>SN: 1/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>Paxlovid, made by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, has previously been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-testing-treatment">reduce the chance that susceptible people will be hospitalized or die</a> from COVID (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>)). To assess the drug’s longer-term effects, Al-Aly and colleagues examined medical records from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system. The researchers found more than 280,000 patients who had a positive COVID test in 2022 and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. Of those people, nearly 36,000 got Paxlovid within five days of their positive test result.</p>



<p>The team then compared the health outcomes of those who took Paxlovid with those who did not. Since omicron and its subvariants were circulating in 2022, the researchers compared people in the Paxlovid group only with people in the untreated group who were infected at the same time and in the same geographic region, Al-Aly says. Paxlovid takers had a reduced risk of post-COVID conditions regardless of whether the infection was their first or if they’d had prior bouts with earlier variants. The drug also lowered long COVID risk for unvaccinated people, for those who were vaccinated with one or two doses, and for people who had at least one booster shot.</p>



<p>Some researchers dispute whether the study fully captures what long COVID is. The condition is notoriously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">hard to define</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). “Even in research studies in which we have hours to ask questions, figuring out who has long COVID and who does not is challenging,” says Steven Deeks, a long COVID researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “These electronic medical record reviews are helpful, but they lack specificity for long COVID. They are great for studying other long-term consequences [of COVID], including cardiovascular events and strokes.”</p>



<p>For instance, many people with long COVID experience post-exertional malaise, or extreme tiredness after exercise, says Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, director of the post-COVID recovery clinic at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. But there isn’t a medical code for that condition, she says, “so it’s hard to pull out of a medical record review.”</p>



<p>Still, the study was able to identify some of the conditions that affect many people with long COVID, including <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/dysautonomia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dysautonomia,</a> a condition in which the nervous system has trouble regulating heart rate, blood pressure and breathing.</p>



<p>And the large number of people in the study allows researchers to see effects they might not be able to uncover in smaller randomized control trials, Deeks says. “You can overcome bad data with huge numbers,” he says. In such large studies, “when you do see something, it tends to be real.”</p>





<p>One limitation of the study is that most patients in the Veterans Affairs system are white males, whereas long COVID patients tend to be female, says Al-Aly, who is also the chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis health care system. &nbsp;But he defends the study’s relevance to multiple populations. The study has “literally tens of thousands of women,” he says. “Is it true that the majority are male? It’s true, but you cannot deny the experience of tens of thousands of people just because they’re the minority.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Paxlovid — as well as other antiviral drugs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-risk-nih-recover-symptoms">vaccination</a> and perhaps a diabetes drug called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4375620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metformin</a> — might all help protect against long COVID, but plenty of patients who have taken Paxlovid are still showing up in long COVID clinics (<em>SN: 10/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We know it’s not this panacea. It’s not going to be a miracle cure for long COVID,” Verduzco-Gutierrez says. “It may be one of the things that can help, or that can decrease the risk, but it’s not going to take it away completely.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/03/30/does-gpt-4-have-common-sense/">Does GPT-4 have common sense?</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s been remarkable progress in Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), taking us much closer to generally useful AI than I could have imagined. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">GPT-4 exhibits impressive capabilities</a> such as passing the bar exam, navigating virtual mazes, and even demonstrating what seems like a theory of mind. This brings us to a fascinating question: does GPT-4 possess common sense?</p>



<p>Exploring GPT-4&#8217;s common sense is not just an intellectual curiosity; it has practical implications. As a powerful large-scale language model (LLM), GPT-4 will inevitably be used to generate content and automate decisions. Will these decisions stem from &#8220;an alien mind&#8221;, or will they be grounded in common sense?</p>



<p>To investigate this question, I assessed GPT-4&#8217;s ability to categorize everyday objects. There is abundant data on how humans naturally group objects, such as tools, body parts, colourful items, and so forth. Surprisingly, GPT-4 doesn&#8217;t perform particularly well on this simple task. It exhibits different default categories and ways of understanding common objects compared to humans: its intuition for grouping and organizing the world is distinct from ours. In this blog post, I’ll delve deeper into the implications of these findings and discuss their potential impact on the Natural Abstraction Hypothesis and AI alignment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Grounding and Common Sense</strong></h2>



<p>Many researchers, most recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08340">Tony Zador and colleagues</a>, have argued that a true AI needs grounding in the real world to display physical common sense. Some aspects of semantics that can be easily inferred in the real world may be difficult to deduce from text on the internet. This is especially true for very basic things about tools and common objects, which often go unsaid in online text. Despite all its impressive abilities, it&#8217;s not too challenging to get GPT-4 to say outrageous things about everyday items.</p>



<p>For instance, let&#8217;s see what happens when I ask it about eating soup without a spoon:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I forgot to bring a spoon with my lunch. However, I have a fork. Will I be able to eat my soup?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While it might be challenging to eat soup with a fork, it is not impossible. You could try the following techniques:</p>



<ol>
<li>Scoop and sip: Tilt the bowl and try to scoop as much soup as you can with the fork, then sip the soup from the fork. This might be time-consuming and not as effective as using a spoon, but it can work in a pinch.</li>



<li>Let the soup cool: If the soup contains solid ingredients like vegetables or meat, let it cool down a bit and use the fork to pick up the solid pieces. You can then sip the remaining broth directly from the bowl.</li>



<li>Make a makeshift spoon: If you have access to materials like aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or paper, you can try fashioning a makeshift spoon by wrapping the material around the fork&#8217;s prongs. This might not be the most effective solution, but it could help you consume more soup than with just a fork.</li>
</ol>



<p>In the end, the most effective solution might be to ask a colleague, friend, or nearby cafe if they have a spare spoon you could borrow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I would rate this response a 2 out of 4: two fine suggestions (ask a friend or drink the soup) and two absurd ones (use the fork like a spoon or make a makeshift spoon). The current GPT-4 demonstrates impressive performance on difficult tasks but can fail significantly on simple ones.</p>



<p>Anecdotes like these help refine our mental model for how GPT-4 works, but it would be valuable to supplement them with data. Let’s do some science!</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The latent semantics of GPT models</h1>



<p>To determine the extent of intuitive physics and semantics absorbed by GPT, I used the <strong><a href="https://things-initiative.org/">THINGS database</a></strong>. This database contains 1,854 objects, each accompanied by an image. These objects are concrete and visualizable (think: aardvark, not democracy). THINGS consists of several datasets, but one, in particular, caught my attention: a similarity dataset featuring 3 million judgments on an odd-one-out task presented visually.</p>



<p>The task works as follows: the MTurk worker sees three images, such as a skateboard, a burrito, and a chihuahua. Which is the odd one out?</p>

<p>You could argue it’s the skateboard, because the other two are associated with Mexico; the burrito, because the others can move; or the chihuahua, because the other two are non-living. It’s precisely because <em>there’s no right answer</em> in an objective sense that the answers are fascinating. There’s some tortured logic behind the judgements that seem to be reproducible amongst people. In this way, it’s similar to <a href="https://xcorr.net/2015/11/20/turing-machines-the-number-game-and-inference/">the Number Game</a>, how you can get people to reliably complete sequences of numbers; in theory, any set is as good as any other set. Yet, people display clear patterns.</p>



<p>Although the original task is presented visually, it&#8217;s straightforward enough to ask using just words. We can then compare the model&#8217;s responses against human judgment and analyze the underlying thought process of the machine. I used <strong><code>testset2.txt</code></strong> as the test case, which contains 1,000 odd-one-out judgments, repeated multiple times across a large population of MTurk workers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GPT-3.5</strong></h2>



<p>I started by testing GPT-3.5. Although GPT-3 is quite good at <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03753">naming properties of objects</a></strong>, suggesting it should handle the odd-one-out task easily, it performed surprisingly poorly. Initially, it mostly refused to do the task. Its answers were biased, rarely choosing the first item in a list as the odd one out (&lt;10% of cases). I experimented with different variants of the task, such as choosing the odd-one-out without justification, thinking step-by-step, considering visual attributes, and using a rubric.</p>



<p>The only way to achieve decent accuracy was to compute GPT-3.5&#8217;s answers across three orderings of the items and use a majority vote. This approach yielded a <strong>55% correct</strong> score (similar numbers with and without thinking step-by-step). For comparison, <strong>chance is 33%, and an oracle is 92%</strong>*. While it&#8217;s common practice in more challenging tasks to generate multiple completions from a language model and only accept the best ones (as with <strong><a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-905/full">AlphaCode</a></strong>), I don&#8217;t believe this is a difficult task. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if young children could perform better than GPT-3.5. I could expand to all 6 orderings and do multiple rollouts, but the fact remains: it doesn’t really <em>get</em> this task.</p>



<p>The model&#8217;s reasoning for its choices often seemed ad hoc and sometimes incorrect. For example, when asked to choose the odd-one-out among 1) aardvark, 2) branch, and 3) outlet:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To determine which of the three objects is the least similar to the other two, we can compare their characteristics. Object 1 (aardvark) is an animal, while objects 2 (branch) and 3 (outlet) are inanimate objects. Object 2 (branch) is a natural object found in nature, while object 3 (outlet) is a man-made object used for electricity. Based on these characteristics, it seems that Object 1 (aardvark) is the least similar to the other two. Therefore, the answer is 1.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this case, the model fails to use the fact that branches and aardvark are living things. In other instances, it correctly identifies the categories for the objects but refuses to compare them, claiming they have nothing in common and seemingly choosing based on a whim.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t put too much stock in its purported reasoning, as there&#8217;s no significant difference between think-step-by-step and direct mode. The step-by-step thinking might just be fluff. But clearly, <strong>this is a hard task for a (rather sophisticated) AI and an easy task for a human</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">GPT-4</h2>



<p>GPT-4 does a better job than GPT3.5. For one, it actually tries to solve the task, and I report the results from just one (alphabetical) ordering. On this dataset, it gets <strong>63% right</strong> – better than GPT3.5, but without the need for averaging. The prompt I used is as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Report which of these objects, 1, 2 or 3, is the least similar to the other two. 1: {word1}, 2: {word2}, 3: {word3}. Focus your judgement on the objects. Think step-by-step. Finish with the phrase: The answer is <em>digit</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some positives:</p>



<ul>
<li>It actually attempts to do the task. Its distribution of answers (first, second or third item) is 37%/40%/23%. It could still use some averaging over word orderings but I didn’t want to spend 100$ on this.</li>



<li>It is very good at following instructions, unlike GPT3.5. If you tell it you need a particular format, it almost always does it. Parsing the output is much less of a pain.</li>



<li>It lists some real properties of objects</li>
</ul>



<p>However, it reliably comes up with real headscratchers in its arguments:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<ol>
<li>Anchor: heavy, metal, used for holding boats in place</li>



<li>Banana peel: organic, biodegradable, related to food</li>



<li>Recorder: musical instrument, lightweight, used for playing music</li>
</ol>



<p>Based on the characteristics, the anchor is heavy and made of metal, while the banana peel and the recorder are lightweight. The banana peel is related to food and the recorder is a musical instrument, while the anchor has no such connections. The anchor and the recorder have more specific purposes (holding boats and playing music), while a banana peel&#8217;s purpose is mainly as food waste.</p>



<p>The answer is 1</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s trying really hard, but it doesn’t see the fact that banana peels are organic, while anchors and recorders are man-made.</p>



<p>Here are ten pairs it gets wrong (its choice in italics, human in bold). I picked among non-controversial examples (where humans pick the same answer &gt; 75% of the time):</p>



<ol>
<li><em>anchor</em>, <strong>banana peel</strong>, recorder</li>



<li><strong>ashtray</strong>, easter egg, <em>goldfish</em></li>



<li><strong>banana</strong>, <em>crow</em>, scorpion</li>



<li><em>barcode</em>, <strong>cart</strong>, laptop</li>



<li><em>bark</em>, <strong>parrot</strong>, tree</li>



<li><strong>barrel</strong>, blinder, <em>tiger</em></li>



<li><strong>baton</strong>, <em>leopard</em>, tumbleweed</li>



<li><strong>bell pepper</strong>, <em>curling iron</em>, shower curtain</li>



<li><strong>belt</strong>, <em>coral</em>, gondola</li>



<li><em>boar</em>, <strong>brace</strong>, trough</li>
</ol>



<p>It feels like it doesn’t have a rank ordering of properties that are important in intuitive categorization. This is especially noticeable when the three objects are in very different categories, forcing it to use intuitive categories it doesn’t have access to. The authors of the THINGS database have worked on learning labelled features using the triplet human answers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02915.pdf">first in the SPoSE paper</a>, then <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/da1a97b53eec1c763c6d06835538fe3e-Abstract-Conference.html">in the VICE paper</a>. The 11 most important dimensions as revealed by the SPoSE paper are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Metal tools</li>



<li>Food</li>



<li>Mammals</li>



<li>Clothes</li>



<li>Furniture</li>



<li>Green leafery</li>



<li>Man-made-garden-related</li>



<li>Cars/trucks</li>



<li>Wooden</li>



<li>Body parts</li>



<li>Colorful things</li>
</ol>



<p>This seems like a weird list – not unlike the categorization of animals offered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge">Borges’ Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge</a>. When you think about humans as agents, however, they make a lot more sense. The top categories correspond to things that might be very important for survival (think: zombie apocalypse), and that have useful and varied affordances. Interestingly, many of these categories also seem to be represented by distinct chunks of the brain (e.g. body parts, tools, faces of animals).</p>



<p>If you cross-reference GPT-4’s errors against the SPoSE dimensions, you realize why it makes the mistakes it makes. It doesn’t always put tools and metal stuff together (e.g. barrel, blinder vs tiger), or organic things together (baton, leopard and tumbleweed).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does it mean for AI alignment?</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Natural Abstraction Hypothesis, proposed by John Wentworth, states that there exist abstractions (relatively low-dimensional summaries which capture information relevant for prediction) which are &#8220;natural&#8221; in the sense that we should expect a wide variety of cognitive systems to converge on using them. —<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fut8dtFsBYRz8atFF/the-natural-abstraction-hypothesis-implications-and-evidence">TheMcDouglas on LessWrong</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some people In rationalist/XAI circles think that if the natural abstraction hypothesis is true, we might get AI alignment “for free”. In other words, if we can get intuitive semantics right, then perhaps we might get intuitive values right.</p>



<p>The results I present here go against the Natural Abstraction Hypothesis. It shows that GPT is not very well grounded, despite having been trained on just about all the text that’s ever been written. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it will have bad ethics and be misaligned. But if it doesn’t grasp a lot of deeply ingrained, intuitive categories of objects, it feels doubtful that it would also recapitulate intuitive ethics, especially the very core stuff that goes unsaid. It also, of course, doesn’t mean that it’s not useful: it’s simply different from how a human is.</p>



<p>As we refine our mental models for what LLMs are, that’s important to keep in mind. These are skilled token manipulators, not unlike the operator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese Room</a> in Searle’s metaphor (albeit a stochastic version of the Chinese Room operator). Its tokens are not very well grounded, and it doesn’t have access to a simulation environment (i.e. the equivalent of what humans call the real world).</p>



<p>That means LLMs can fail when tested out-of-distribution on stuff that often goes unsaid. These are things that are deeply ingrained within us as humans because of shared DNA and environment: gravity points down, grass is on the ground, cats are soft, etc.</p>



<p>A consequence of this is garbage-in-garbage-out. If something is not reflected within its training set, it is unlikely that it will figure it out. If we want it to be aligned to human values and semantics, we probably have to feed those in using well-curated datasets, either during pretraining or RLHF, or both. And writing down human values in all their complexities is difficult! I would like to see large-scale capture of human values and evaluation, perhaps in a similar way to THINGS.</p>



<p>I think this is relevant (and was written partially in response) to <a href="https://twitter.com/MWCvitkovic/status/1640415726690525186">Milan Cviktovic’s argument</a> that we need neurotech to solve AI alignment. Based on some of the distinctions that brains make, e.g. organic vs. non-organic is very strongly differentiated in fMRI, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192200413X">it seems like RL(brain)F could realign something like GPT-4 and partially resolve its discrepancies with human judgements</a>. Perhaps you could do brain-based realignment for ethics as well; the big question is whether you can make it make economic sense when clever behavioural experiments. Milan’s point is that if neurotech is too expensive to do this today, maybe what we should do is make neurotech cheaper to make benevolent AI. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5">Seems like a fine idea for a Focused Research Organization (FRO)</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meta</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/triplets">Here’s the code I wrote for this</a>. I was assisted by Github Copilot and ChatGPT4. I used the OpenAI API to make API requests. I wrote this article in bullet form and had GPT-4 interpolate the rest. I also used Grammarly to refine the text. GPT-4 generated copy for a tweet thread. The featured image was generated by Dall-E 2 (although it really didn’t want to draw a spork, which was disappointing).</p>



<p>* The THINGS similarity paper refers to noise ceilings, which is (simplifying a bit) how well a single human can predit another human&#8217;s response. What I&#8217;ve calculated is instead an oracle score, which is how well an agent could predict <em>the wisdom of the crowd</em> answer (i.e. majority vote), given the sampling noise of the average response. This oracle score would go to 100% if we had infinite ratings per triplet; currently, it&#8217;s closer to .92-.94 given a few dozen ratings per repeated triplet. I would argue that the machine could, in theory, achieve the oracle score if it categorized things like a crowd of humans. <br><br>Now, GPT-4 is stochastic, and we might need to average and take a majority vote of itself to calculate its true ability to predict the <em>wisdom of the crowd answer</em>. To test this, I calculated the majority vote for 12 different repeats (with different orderings) of the first 101 triplets. Majority vote does help but it satures at about 6 samples. Overall, majority voting gives an absolute improvement on the order of 0.06, which is not bad at all, but it doesn&#8217;t go anywhere close to oracle score. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-spinal-fluid-awake-brain">Scientists triggered the flow of spinal fluid in the awake brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Waves of cerebrospinal fluid which normally wash over brains during sleep can be made to pulse in the brains of people who are wide awake, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The clear fluid may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-brain-alzheimers-plaques-protein">flush out harmful waste</a>, such as the sticky proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease (<em>SN: 7/15/18</em>). So being able to control the fluid’s flow in the brain could possibly one day have implications for treating certain brain disorders.</p>



<p>“I think this [finding] will help with many neurological disorders,” says Jonathan Kipnis, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “Think of Formula One. You can have the best car and driver, but without a great maintenance crew, that driver will not win the race.” Spinal fluid flow in the brain is a major part of that maintenance crew, he says. But he and other researchers, including the study’s authors, caution that any potential therapeutic applications are still far off.</p>





<p>In 2019, neuroscientist Laura Lewis of Boston University and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-may-trigger-rhythmic-power-washing-brain">strong waves of cerebrospinal fluid wash through our brains while we slumber</a>, suggesting that one unappreciated role of sleep may be to give the brain a deep clean (<em>SN: 10/31/19</em>). And the team showed that the slow neural oscillations that characterize deep, non-REM sleep occur in lockstep with the waves of spinal fluid through the brain.</p>



<p>“If you drop your clothes in a bath of water, eventually dirt will come out. But if you swish them back and forth, things are moving much more effectively,” Lewis says. “That’s the analogy I think of.”</p>



<p>These flows were far larger than the small, rhythmic influences that one’s breathing and heartbeat have on spinal fluid.</p>



<p>The researchers think that as brain activity during sleep causes blood to flow through the brain — bringing oxygen to power-hungry cells — the spinal fluid flows in behind the blood to maintain constant pressure inside the skull.</p>



<p>In the new study, “the first question we wanted to answer is, can you manipulate [blood flow] enough to also drive [fluid] flow when someone’s awake?” says Stephanie Williams, a neuroscientist also at Boston University.</p>



<p>To stimulate blood flow in the brain, Williams, Lewis and their colleagues showed a flickering checkerboard pattern to six healthy adults. A mix of eavesdropping techniques, including fMRI and electrodes, confirmed that this intense visual stimulation affected brain blood flow and allowed the team to see the order of events.</p>





<p>Neural activity increased when the flashing pattern was turned on, followed by increased blood flow. Cerebrospinal fluid flow was suppressed while blood flow increased, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then surged into the brain as blood flow ebbed</a> when the stimulation stopped, the team reports March 30 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. &nbsp;Longer stimulation produced larger spinal fluid flows, suggesting it was possible to maximize the response.</p>



<p>The effect of brain activity on the spinal fluid flow is separate from the influences of heartbeat and breathing, the researchers found. “There&#8217;s a really interesting biological insight that comes out of this,” Lewis says, “which is that the brain has a way to control its own fluid flow.”</p>



<p>Whether any waste was cleared from the awake brain was not measured. Previous studies in mice have found that certain audio-visual stimuli reduce levels of the toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Clinical trials are testing if the technique works in humans.</p>



<p>“It’s beautiful study, but I wouldn’t draw therapeutic conclusions from this,” says Steven Goldman, a neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the work. The brain’s fluid flow system, he says, is optimally set up for cleaning during sleep. “It would be more effective to just ensure a good night’s sleep,” he says. “Any manipulations over and above that would be best employed during sleep.”</p>



<p>The researchers acknowledge that the spinal fluid flows they induced were not as large as those seen during sleep. “We didn&#8217;t manage to re-create sleep itself, but it was really a pretty substantial change in the flow,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>The team is planning to study the connections between spinal fluid flow in the brain and diseases like Alzheimer’s, she says. “In disorders where fluid flow is implicated, as seems to be the case with Alzheimer’s, this [technique] would hopefully give us a handle on understanding where does that come from, what’s the process that’s disrupted?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/native-americans-spanish-horses">Native Americans corralled Spanish horses decades before Europeans arrived</a></h4>

              
                <p>Indigenous knowledge and Western science have written a new tale about when horses most recently arrived in North America.</p>



<p>Spaniards brought horses to Mexico in 1519. Indigenous peoples then took the reins, rapidly transporting offspring of those equine newcomers north along trade routes. As a result, a new study finds, many Native American populations across the Great Plains and the Rockies had incorporated horses into their ways of life by the early 1600s, decades before encountering any Europeans.</p>





<p>This unconventional scenario of how domesticated horses originally spread throughout central and western North America bucks a previous narrative: European written accounts dating mainly to the 1700s and 1800s had contended that horses first spread into North America in large numbers after Pueblo people temporarily drove Spanish settlers out of New Mexico in 1680. But little evidence existed to confirm or deny that claim.</p>



<p>Europeans’ historical texts didn’t ring true for molecular archaeologist Yvette Running Horse Collin of the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France. Running Horse Collin is a member of the Oglala Lakota Nation. Great Plains populations such as the Lakota and Comanche speak of having cared for, herded and otherwise interacted with horses long before Europeans showed up.</p>



<p>Running Horse Collin contacted Toulouse colleague Ludovic Orlando, a molecular archaeologist who has traced <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">the origins of domesticated horses to southwestern Asia more than 4,200 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>). The duo organized a large collaboration of Western scientists and Indigenous scholars and officials, including members of the Lakota, Comanche, Pawnee and Pueblo Nations.</p>



<p>“Our findings indicate that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horses spread from Mexico into North America by the turn of the 17th century</a> and were raised locally, which strikingly lines up with Native American perspectives,” archaeozoologist William Taylor of the University of Colorado Boulder said at a March 28 news conference. Results of their investigation appear in the March 31 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Taylor directed an effort that located and radiocarbon-dated previously excavated remains of 23 horses from western North America and six horses from Argentina. Three of the North American horses dated to the second half of the 1500s, well before the 1680 Pueblo Revolt. Those specimens came from sites in Kansas, New Mexico and Wyoming. Reanalysis of a previously radiocarbon-dated horse’s remains from an Idaho site, using a technique that measures the amount of near-infrared radiation absorbed by bone, produced a comparably early age estimate.</p>

<p>What’s particularly important is that those finds yielded evidence of Native American groups caring for, riding and culturally embracing horses by the early 1600s, says archaeologist Mark Mitchell of the Paleocultural Research Group in Broomfield, Colo., who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>The earliest North American horse remains include bony growths at the back of the skull consistent with the use of a halter or bridle, Taylor said. One horse from the 1500s displayed the kind of dental damage seen from use of a bridle’s metal bit. Another early horse had been found among various ritual artifacts, indicating that it had held ceremonial meaning of some kind.</p>





<p>Analyses of diet-related chemical elements in teeth typical of particular geographic regions indicated that one early North American horse had grown up locally. Another was raised even farther north, probably part of a managed herd that was fed maize during part of the year, the researchers say.</p>



<p>DNA comparisons with a range of modern horses showed that early North American horses were primarily of Spanish ancestry.</p>



<p>Some Indigenous oral histories suggest that their interactions with horses go back thousands of years to equines that might have survived the Ice Age. But analysis of DNA retrieved from remains of two Ice Age horses previously found in Alaska — one dating to about 26,100 years ago and another to around 28,400 years ago — showed no direct ties to later North American horses. Scientists generally suspect that <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cumuseum/horses-north-american-west" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild horses first evolved in North America</a> over tens of millions of years before dying out around 10,000 years ago.</p>



<p>For now, the scientific evidence just supports the pre-European integration of horses into Great Plains societies, says University of Oxford archaeologist Peter Mitchell, who was not part of the new investigation. Further research needs to establish precisely how long ancient wild horses survived in Alaska, he says.</p>



<p>Taylor and his colleagues have nonetheless married Western science to Indigenous knowledge in a way that “sets a new standard for archaeological research into the early spread of the horse and the take-up of horse usage by Indigenous groups” throughout the world, Mitchell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trex-lips-modern-lizards-dinosaur">T. rex may have had lips like a modern lizard’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>In movies and TV shows, <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> often sports a fleet of big, sharp teeth that are almost always on display. But the dinosaurs and their kin may have kept their pearly whites mostly tucked behind lizardlike lips.</p>



<p>Similar to Komodo dragons today, these <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo7877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dinosaurs had ample soft tissue around the mouth</a> that would have functioned as lips, an analysis of fossilized and modern reptile skulls and teeth finds. The research, described in the March 31 <em>Science</em>, challenges common, traditional reconstructions of how these top predators appeared in life.</p>





<p>“This is a nice, concise answer to a question that has been asked for a long time by dinosaur paleontologists,” says Emily Lessner, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, who wasn’t involved in the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soft tissue is not often included in analyses of the biomechanics of feeding dinosaurs, she says. Acknowledging the potential presence of lips in these tests could change how we think some dinosaurs ate.</p>



<p>It’s “not an unfair argument” to suggest that nonavian theropods, the dinosaur group that includes <em>T. rex</em>, might have had their chompers constantly exposed, says paleontologist Thomas Cullen of Auburn University in Alabama. Their sharp teeth tended to be large, potentially too big to fit fully in the mouth. And crocodiles and their ilk — theropods’ closest living relatives that have teeth — lack lips.</p>



<p>But almost all land vertebrates today have liplike coverings for their teeth, Cullen says.&nbsp;Why should <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and other nonbird theropods be different?</p>



<p>Cullen and his colleagues analyzed fossilized theropod skulls and teeth alongside comparisons of living reptiles.&nbsp;The team examined the pattern of foramina, small passageways through bones, in the upper jaws of theropods and some modern and other extinct reptiles.</p>

<p>Foramina route blood vessels and nerves to the soft tissue around the mouth. In crocodilians, these foramina are scattered across the jaw. But in lipped reptiles like lizards, the little holes are arranged in a line along the edge of the jaw near the teeth. <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> shares this row of jaw pores, the analysis showed.</p>



<p>Enamel in theropod and crocodilian teeth also yielded clues. When enamel dries out, it wears down more easily. The researchers found that the side of alligator teeth that are continually exposed erode more than the wetter side facing the inside of the mouth. Theropods have a more even wear pattern, suggesting the teeth were kept covered and moist.&nbsp;</p>





<p>And monitor lizards (<em>Varanus </em>spp.), which have proportionally long, serrated teeth much like theropods did, don’t decrease their lip coverage with increasing tooth and skull size, the researchers found. Because tooth length and skull size scale similarly in monitor lizards and theropods, the team says, there’s no reason to think that theropods couldn’t fit their teeth fully in their mouths too.</p>



<p>What’s more, the analysis revealed a neat row of jaw foramina in <em>Hesperosuchus</em>, an extinct, very early cousin of crocodilians. That finding suggests that lips may have been present in the earliest archosaurs — the group of reptiles that gave rise to dinosaurs (including birds) and crocodilians. The researchers think lips may have eventually been lost in the crocodilian lineages that survived to the modern day and lost in a separate process in birds.</p>



<p>But paleontologist Thomas Carr, who has studied tyrannosaurs, is not persuaded by the results. The new study “can be summed up in two words: completely unconvincing,” says Carr, of Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisc.</p>



<p>In 2017, he and his colleagues showed that tyrannosaurs had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-tyrannosaur-had-sensitive-side">a rough, wrinkled surface texture to the jaw bones</a>, and that crocodilians have this same bone texture underlying the lipless, scaly margins of their jaws (<em>SN: 3/30/17</em>).</p>



<p>“In many cases,” Carr says, “the soft tissues leave signatures on bone.” Those signatures can tell you what sat on top of the bone in animals whose skin or scales haven’t been preserved, he says. The new research “completely disregards … the texture of the facial bones, which unambiguously shows that [tyrannosaurs] had flat scales, like in crocodilians, all the way down to the edges of the jaws.”</p>



<p>This bone roughness isn’t a consistent feature in theropods, Cullen says. Young tyrannosaurs and smaller theropod species had smooth bones similar to a lizard’s. It’s possible that these animals had lips and then lost them over their life, but “I don&#8217;t think there is really any modern example of that kind of thing happening,” he says.</p>



<p>Something like the discovery of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-mummies-fossils-paleontology">mummified</a> tyrannosaur carcass with preserved facial tissues, Carr says, could settle the matter of who had lips and who didn’t (<em>SN: 10/12/22</em>).</p>
