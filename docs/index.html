<p>Scholarly publishing in mathematics is unlike many other fields, marked by fewer papers, fewer coauthors per paper and fewer citations. But that doesn’t mean the field is immune to fraud and cheating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A pair of papers posted to the arXiv addresses the issue of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07257">fraudulent publishing in math</a>, particularly metrics gaming, and offers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09877">a list of recommendations</a> to help detect and deal with that problem and other fraudulent activities. (The former <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202509/noti3217/noti3217.html?adat=October%202025&amp;trk=3217&amp;pdfissue=202509&amp;pdffile=rnoti-p1038.pdf&amp;cat=none&amp;type=.html">was also published</a> in the October <em>AMS Notices</em>; the latter will appear in the November issue.) “Fraudulent publishing undermines trust in science and scientific results and therefore fuels antiscience movements,” mathematician <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~agricola/">Ilka Agricola</a>, lead author of both papers, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A professor of mathematics at Marburg University in Germany, Agricola was president of the German Mathematical Society in 2021-2022 and is chair of the Committee on Publishing of the International Mathematical Union. The new articles are the products of a working group of the IMU and the International Council of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132920"></span>



<p>Agricola spoke with us about the reports and about fraud in mathematics. Questions and responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>:&nbsp; Few people talk about fraudulent publishing in math. Why is that?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: For a long time, mathematicians thought that as long as they keep away from predatory journals or paper mills, the problem does not affect them. This turned out to be wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: If you look at the number of papers that tripped Clear Skies’ Papermill Alarm in 2022 (we included a histogram in <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224),">this article</a> we wrote for <em>The Conversation</em>), math is pretty far down the list. Are there a lot of fake papers in math?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: It is probably fair to say that the problem is not as severe as in other fields like cancer research, but the community is smaller and the number of fake papers is growing at alarming speed. Predatory and low-quality mega-journals are trying hard to lure respected scientists into their parallel universe of fake science, thus trying to give themselves the impression of respectability. Thus, one of our goals is to raise awareness for the issue in the mathematical community!</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: As you note in the new papers, Clarivate announced in 2023 it had excluded the entire field of math from its list of “Highly Cited Researchers,” or HCRs. What’s going on?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: The publication culture in math differs a bit from, say, experimental and life sciences. On average, mathematicians publish fewer papers with fewer authors than scientists in other fields. So, with the same absolute number of papers and citations, one can become a “highly-cited researcher” in math, but not in other fields. Thus, gaming the system is easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list of HCRs for mathematics became so screwed that Clarivate couldn’t pretend anymore that it had any value. This being said, Clarivate announced that they would look into new measuring tools, but didn’t come up with any alternative ideas in the meantime, nor did they contact any representatives of the international mathematical community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: You note in your paper that the institution with the highest number of highly cited researchers in 2019 was China Medical University in Taiwan, which does not have a program in mathematics. How is that possible?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Good question! Admission to the “Hall of Fame” of HCRs has a decisive advantage for the university of a scholar: It impacts their rank in the “<a href="https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2025">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>” [ARWU, published since 2003], also nicknamed the “Shanghai ranking.” So, the institution benefits even if it does not have a math program. Of course, we agree that a topic not taught at a place ought not to be included, but that’s how the system works. Clarivate is treating its HCRs in a very kind way: They ask them about their affiliation. So, at the moment of making the count, researchers just give China Medical University (or any other institution) as their affiliation, despite not being there. The researchers typically get a contract as a “visiting professor” to hide that, in the end, they are being dishonest about their affiliation, and of course, being an HCR may give them more benefits, prestige, and grant access at their home institution as well. I was certainly surprised to learn that there is a lot of cheating with affiliations going on! Actually, many institutions do not have clear rules for primary and secondary affiliations.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: If a clinical trial is fake, that’s a problem that can obviously affect life-and-death decisions. Do bogus papers and other types of publishing fraud in math have real-world consequences, too?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Mathematics has many famous open conjectures. Predatory journals can give people the opportunity to publish “proofs” of these without credible peer review. The status of these results can become unclear, and further research based on them will then be a waste of effort or resources. On a larger scale, many junk papers are claiming to deal with applications, so it could create the wrong impression that these results solve concrete problems, and actually don’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: You and your coauthors are mathematicians, and yet you argue against focusing on numbers like journal impact factors and publication and citation counts. Is that what’s driving all of this bad behavior?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” This quote is from the British economist Charles Goodhart, and it also applies to bibliometrics measures. Of course, gaming these metrics has always existed, but some of us liked to believe that they would be roughly OK, with some error bar due to some cheating. Now, we realize the error bar is larger than the number one wants to measure. Perhaps one advantage of mathematicians is that they are not easily impressed by numbers, and we have the means to understand and analyze them — this is our job. And so, the conclusion is very clear: The correlation between bibliometrics and research quality is so low that we should not use bibliometrics. And I urge all colleagues to say so openly!</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: So how do we judge research quality if we shouldn&#8217;t use publication metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Read the actual publications instead of relying on bibliometrics! Plus, in mathematics, we are lucky to have two extremely well curated databases for math papers and journals, <a href="https://zbmath.org/">zbMath Open</a> and <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/publications-search">MathReviews</a>. If a journal is not included there, it’s either very interdisciplinary or one should get suspicious.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: Is it possible for individual researchers to jump off the bibiometrics bandwagon without jeopardizing their careers?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: We need to fight for a change in culture, that’s for sure, and the path will be rash and hard. To young researchers, we should give the warning that being involved in predatory publishing can also just as well put their scientific integrity at risk. Remember the people who had to resign because of data falsification?&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the situation is not hopeless. Some effective changes would be easy to implement:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Define good publishing practices, encourage people to follow them, educate the young generation about predatory publishing.</li>



<li>Discourage the use of bibliometrics in hiring and promotion committees or for graduating.</li>



<li>Evaluate faculty by their best papers and ‘activeness’ without pressure to publish too frequently.</li>



<li>Do not publish in journals charging article processing charges  — most serious math journals don’t do it.</li>



<li>Check the quality of journals before joining their editorial board.</li>



<li>Choose the journals or special issues in which you publish and the journals for which you write reviews wisely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy fixes for complex health problems can be tempting — but they rarely pan out. That seems to be the case for the investigators on one clinical trial who claimed consuming apple cider vinegar caused obese teens and young adults to lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000823">article</a> appeared in March 2024 in <em>BMJ Nutrition, Prevention &amp; Health</em>. The journal is retracting the paper &#8220;because the authors’ analyses could not be replicated and multiple errors were identified,” according to the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000823ret">retraction notice</a>.</p>



<p>The retraction, dated September 23, comes more than a year after sleuths pointed out some of these errors and other problems with the analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132917"></span>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/drinking-1-tablespoon-of-apple-cider-vinegar-daily-linked-to-weight-loss">was</a> <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/apple-cider-vinegar-may-help-with-weight-management">covered</a> <a href="https://www.health.com/study-daily-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss-8619969">widely</a> when it was published, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/well/eat/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits.html?smid=url-share">some outlets</a> gave context for the unreliability of this type of research when they mentioned it. It has been cited three times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study found that overweight and obese people who consumed apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost an average of 6 to 8 kilograms and their BMI dropped by an average of 2.7 to 3.0 points.</p>



<p>If the claims were true, apple cider vinegar would be 50 percent more effective than GLP-1 agonists such as Ozempic, said James Heathers, a research integrity consultant and director of the Medical Evidence Project (an initiative of The Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rony Abou-Khalil, corresponding author on both the paper and the response, did not respond to our requests for comment. He is listed as the <a href="https://www.usek.edu.lb/en/about-usek/faculty-affairs/directory/rony-abou-khalil">head of the department of biology</a> at Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, in Lebanon.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Heathers started looking into the paper shortly after it was published, and published <a href="https://www.researchhub.com/post/2220/apple-cider-vinegar-for-weight-management">an analysis</a> describing flaws in the study in May 2024. He described the nearly identical age and BMI distributions within each 30-person experimental group as “unlikely.” </p>



<p>Although researchers want each group to have similar characteristics, randomly assigning participants would usually result in more variation between the groups than seen in the study. The age, height and weight are “almost identical between the randomized [groups of] participants,” he wrote. “This extreme uniformity likely represents a failure of randomization, although it is unclear how this arose.”</p>



<p>He went on to describe other flaws with the statistical analysis in the paper, and pointed out the authors didn’t include their original dataset with the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reading Heathers’ assessment, Vahid Malbouby at Boise State University and Eric Trexler at Duke University wrote to him citing additional problems with the paper. For example, other studies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02214-3">do not support the claim</a> that apple cider vinegar raises basal metabolic rate even at higher doses than used in the study. The three wrote a letter to the journal detailing their concerns, which they submitted in June 2024 and the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2024-000997">published in February</a> of this year.</p>



<p>Five rapid responses posted on the article in September and October 2024 questioned the statistical analysis conducted in the paper, as well as problems with the study’s design. One such concern is that each experimental group included participants ages 12 to 25 years. This large range of ages including both children and adults could confound the results, “in that BMI and weight change is very different in a 12 year old who is still likely to be growing and a 25 year old,” according to a response authored by Duane D. Mellor, a dietitian at Aston University in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mellor also pointed out “there is no statement of trial registration, no CONSORT flowchart and now [sic] CONSORT checklist.“ Many publishers, including BMJ, require authors to provide these documents before publishing the research to ensure the validity and transparency of the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2024, the journal published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2024-001102">a letter</a> from two of the paper’s original three authors. The authors cited papers to justify their original statistical analysis, the biological plausibility of such a large effect, and the unusual data distributions. They concluded, “we assert that the methodologies employed in our study were appropriate and supported by existing literature.”</p>



<p>Given how long ago serious flaws were identified, “it is disappointing that an expression of concern had not been posted to the article,” said Andrew W. Brown, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and director of biostatistics for the Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, who studies pediatrics, nutrition and obesity. “That left a window of time when a reader may have been misled by the work while it was being evaluated.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In addition to the paper’s analyses not being replicable, the retraction notice identifies other issues as well: “The authors supplied dataset also demonstrated patterns inconsistent with random allocation of participants to treatment groups, improbably small p-values given the limited number of participants included in the study.”</p>



<p>According to the notice, “the authors state that the discrepancies were honest mistakes that arose from version mismatches, data rounding or formatting differences when exporting from statistical software to reporting spreadsheets. However, the authors agree with the decision to retract the work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1099052">statement</a>, Helen Macdonald, publication ethics and content integrity editor at BMJ Group, said: “While we deal with allegations as swiftly as possible, it’s very important that due process is followed. Investigations are often complex. This one involved detailed scrutiny of data and correspondence with researchers, institutions, and other experts, for example. Reaching a sound and fair and final decision can therefore take several months.”</p>



<p>Regarding the fact that the journal published the study without clinical trial registration, Martin Kohlmeier, editor-in-chief of <em>BMJ Nutrition Prevention &amp; Health,</em> said in the same statement, “In hindsight, this was the wrong decision to make. But the authors come from a scientific environment that is underrepresented in nutritional research and the journal aims to prioritise high quality evidence, which usually comes from clinical trials.”</p>



<p>Flawed clinical trials are not uncommon in the field of nutrition, Brown told us. “I am glad to see the retraction of this paper to uphold the integrity of the field, but we need to do better in the field of nutrition to register, design, conduct, and report trials to a high standard before publication,” he said.</p>

<p>Just as <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em> was the first of 14 books in a series, our recent coverage of a paper on “Tin Man syndrome” seems to have sequels. After <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/15/tin-man-syndrome-case-plagiarized-from-hoax-sleuths-say/">we wrote</a> about a case study describing a man with his heart in his abdomen <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/02/tin-man-syndrome-five-other-case-studies-retracted-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">retracted for plagiarizing images</a> from an April Fools’ joke, a reader flagged yet another paper using the same image.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, the authors of a “rare case report” appearing in <em>Medicine</em> claimed they had encountered a case of a man with asymptomatic “ectopia cordis interna,” in which his heart was in his abdomen. After the article was retracted, the corresponding author admitted the photos had been taken from a <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/cases/april-fools-2015-ectopia-cordis-interna-tin-man-syndrome?lang=us">2015 April Fools’ paper</a> in <em>Radiopaedia</em> describing the same (fictitious) condition.</p>



<p>Following that coverage, a reader did a reverse image search of the X-ray in both papers and found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/4535136">a 2021 article</a> from <em>Scientific Programming</em>, published by Wiley. The study recommends a non-conventional ventilation option for treating neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The paper has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132912"></span>



<p>Figure 2 of the paper purports to show a neonate X-ray where the “heart contour of diaphragm was not seen.” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, an image expert and biologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., told us it “is indisputable” that the figure “derives from” the Tin Man Syndrome hoax paper. Aside from similarities within the image itself, Sanders pointed to the label in the upper right hand corner, which has helped us identify other instances of reuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 9, a spokesperson from Wiley, which publishes <em>Scientific Programming,</em> told us they had initiated an investigation after we flagged concerns.</p>



<p>Sanders said the paper has even more flaws.The references of the paper “are a mess,” including number 8, which describes an algorithm for removing shadows of moving objects. Reference 5, which the authors point to when sourcing the term “white lung,” makes no mention of the condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2188-6360">Xin Chen</a>, a researcher at The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in China, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen and two coauthors on the <em>Scientific Programming </em>article lost a paper in 2022 from the <em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em>, a Wiley title formerly owned by Hindawi, which Wiley acquired in 2021. The retraction notice says the paper was investigated by the Hindawi Research Integrity team, which raised concerns “that the peer review process has been compromised.”</p>



<p>Wiley has retracted over 11,000 papers in journals it acquired from Hindawi, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">a known target of paper mill activity</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/zbaszyn/">Zbąszyń</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> invented the heliotrope for long-distance surveying in 1821. Just a year later, he proved that least squares regression provided the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLUE estimator</a> for data with uncorrelated Gaussian errors (with mean zero and equal variance). The heliotrope tool and the least squares method allowed Gauss to perform a geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover by triangulation between 1821 and 1825, an unprecedented accomplishment at the time.</p>

<p>Gauss&#8217; approach was scaled up massively by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a>, who in 1838 published an epic triangulation based survey of East Prussia and parts of Russia in <a href="https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/view/bsb10000711?q=Fuchsberg&amp;page=14,15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gradmessung in Ostpreußen und ihre Verbindung mit Preußischen und Russischen Dreiecksketten</a>. His work included understanding for the first time how to calculate the standard error of the mean (which led him to introduce <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/bessels-correction-and-the-dangers-of-moocs/">Bessel&#8217;s correction</a>), providing an important assessment of how errors in individual measurements during triangulation contributed to overall errors from the least squares procedure. The scale of his survey (~3x Hanover) was arguably also the first use of statistics for big data. Bessel may have been the first ̶m̶a̶c̶h̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶r̶n̶i̶n̶g̶ AI disruptor in history. And he did it not from silicon <em>valley </em>but from Königs<em>berg</em> (now Kaliningrad).</p>

<p>Bessel&#8217;s work enabled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Germany" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completion of the first cross-country rail line linking a Western European capital to an Eastern European capital</a>. The rail line, between Berlin and Warsaw, was completed in 1848 and was a quantum leap after the first national <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig%E2%80%93Dresden_railway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-distance rail between Leipzig and Dresden</a> in the Kingdom of Saxony was completed in 1839. At ~500km, Berlin-Warsaw was much longer than any previous international crossings. The distance was long enough that Bessel was able to use his triangulation to show that the earth is an oblate spheroid (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the method dates to 1825</a>) and in 1841 he established the ellipsoid major and minor axes <em>a =&nbsp;6377397.155&nbsp;m, b&nbsp;=&nbsp;6356078.962822 m</em>. His accuracy was amazing; the WGS84 modern world geodetic system from 1984 is almost the same with <em>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;6378137.0&nbsp;m, b&nbsp;=&nbsp;6356752.30&nbsp;m</em>. As of 2010 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_ellipsoid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bessel ellipsoid</a> was still the geodetic system of choice in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>The Berlin-Warsaw line of 1848 crossed the Prussian-Russian border near the Prosna river, west of the town of Łowicz, which is just under 100km west of Warsaw. Warsaw at the time was part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Poland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Congress Poland</a> formed at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, although by the mid 19th century the territory was fully under Russian administration ruled directly by the Tsar. The border moved in 1919 as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treaty of Versailles</a> after World War I, when a new Polish Republic was established. At that time the border crossing on the Berlin-Warsaw rail line shifted to the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C4%85szy%C5%84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zbąszyń</a> (a medieval Polish name for the town, which the Germans had renamed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C4%85szy%C5%84">Bentschen</a> when the town came under Prussian control in 1793).</p>

<p>In the 19th century Zbąszyń was what today we might today call a &#8220;multicultural town&#8221;. <a href="https://sztetl.org.pl/en/towns/z/779-zbaszyn/99-history/138313-history-of-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out of a population of ~1,300 in 1833, there were 336 Jews</a> (~25%), about 35% Germans, and approximately 40% Poles. In other words, there were more Poles than Germans, but Poles were a minority with respect to Jews and Germans. The percent Jewish population in Zbąszyń, which dates back to at least 1437 when it is known that a Jew named Palto sued a nobleman for failure of repaying a loan, peaked in the early 19th century. The reasons for a decline in Jewish population over a century were manifold, but a major factor was antisemitism, including regular blood libels and pogroms in neighboring cities of which a partial list is <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom_w_Warszawie_(1805)#:~:text=W%201805%20roku%20Bo%C5%BCe%20Cia%C5%82o,zakaz%20opuszczania%20dom%C3%B3w%20przez%20starozakonnych." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the &#8220;forgotten&#8221; Warsaw pogrom in 1805</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Gda%C5%84sk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pogroms in Gdańsk in 1819 and 1821</a>, <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/kalisz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Kalisz pogrom of 1878</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_pogrom_(1881)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Warsaw pogrom of 1881</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Łódź pogrom of 1892</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cz%C4%99stochowa_pogrom_(1902)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Częstochowa pogrom in 1902</a>, and the <a href="https://mjhnyc.org/blog/devastation-destruction-the-1906-bialystok-pogrom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Białystok</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siedlce_pogrom">Siedlce</a> pogroms in 1906.

By 1919 when Zbąszyń became part of the Polish Republic (it was deemed Polish in the Versailles treaty on the basis of a majority Polish population), the Jewish population had declined to under 10%, part of a mass migration from Eastern Europe totaling around 3 million Jews.</p>

<p>One couple that emigrated was Zindel Grynszpan and Rivka Grynszpan, who <a href="https://www.porta-polonica.de/en/atlas-of-remembrance-places/story-herschel-grynszpan?singlepage=yes&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lived in Dmenin near Radomsko just south of Łódź</a>, and moved to the city of Hanover in the Kingdom of Hanover, Prussia in 1911. The Grynszpans started a family in Hanover and eventually had six children, although only three survived into adulthood. The youngest was a boy named Herschel Feibel born in 1921. The Grynszpans were never German citizens; after the Polish Republic was established in 1919 they were recognized as Polish citizens, since they had been born in what was deemed in 1919 to be Polish territory (although in the 19th century Radomsko was part of the Russian empire). Herschel was born in Hanover, but due to the <em>jus sanguinis</em> principle of the German Citizenship Law which came into effect in 1914 (citizenship by descent, not birthplace), he was a Polish, not German, citizen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">On the 28th of October, 1938, the members of the Grynszpan family, along with thousands of other Polish Jews living in Germany, were deported via train to Zbąszyń, the town that happened to be the border town on the Berlin-Warsaw line. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The conditions of this deportation were horrific. <a href="https://www.jmberlin.de/en/max-karp-polenaktion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deportation notices technically gave 24 hours to leave but many individuals were deported minutes after receiving a knock on the door</a>, and were not allowed to bring much more than the clothes on their back. How this came about is a sad and sordid story. On March 31, 1938, a Polish law came into effect that revoked the citizenship of Poles who had lived abroad for more than five years. This law was enacted specifically to prevent Jewish Poles from returning to Poland after the Anschluss, i.e. the German annexation of Austria on March 12, 1938. On the 9th of October Polish authorities added a regulation that required passports issued outside of Poland to receive a special consular stamp in order to be valid. In other words, Polish Jews were being stripped of their citizenship. This served as a pretext for German authorities to kick Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostjuden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ostjuden</a> (eastern Jews) out of Germany, and in what has come to be termed &#8220;Polenaktion&#8221;, they proceeded to dump Polish Jews, many of whom had just been rendered stateless, at Zbąszyń. Below are two first-hand accounts of what the deportation and arrival in Zbąszyń was like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-left">Your parents were&nbsp;Ost Juden&nbsp;[East European Jews]. Was your family involved in the expulsion to Zbąszyń?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I am so surprised that nobody mentions this, which happened on the 28th of October, 1938, ten days before the&nbsp;pogrom. In our Jewish school the boys were praying in the morning. The girls didn’t have to, but they had to prepare breakfast for the boys to eat after praying. It was the turn of my friend and I to make the tea and we had to be at school at 7:00 instead of 8:00. I was already dressed and ready to leave the house when I heard knocking at our door. When I opened the door, two tall policemen were standing at the door. They asked, “Where are your parents?” I told them they were asleep. “Wake them up, you are going to Poland.” I answered, “What? What do I have to do with Poland? I was born in Germany.” He said, “Take me to the bedroom of your parents.” They both went into their bedroom and put on the light and said, “Get up. You are going to Poland.” My mother thought it was a bad dream. They said, “Don’t ask questions, you are going to Poland.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">My father thought there was a problem with his income tax returns. My mother told me to wake up my 16-year-old brother. My parents asked why they were going to Poland – could they take something with them? The policemen said, “You are going to such a cultural land.” (When Germans talked about Poland they said “dirty Poles”). “No,” he said, “don’t take anything with you.” My father phoned his brother and asked him to take the keys to our apartment. He asked my father, “What have you done?” My father answered, “Nothing.” My aunt came and took the keys but when she got home, the police were in her house, and they really were sent immediately to Poland. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I will never forget my neighbor. She was a widow. She was wearing her nightgown, had hastily put on her overcoat and was carrying a little handbag. When I asked her why she wasn’t dressed, she told me the police didn’t give her time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We were taken and crammed in to the gymnastics hall of the Jewish school. We saw all the people we knew from the neighborhood who were of Polish origin. My father had very high blood pressure and he couldn’t breathe. He called a doctor who said, “This man has to go hospital, he can’t be transported.” My brother said, “We will never see you again. We will be in Poland and you will be in Germany.” Every half hour a bus came to take the people to the railway station. My mother didn’t want to push, so we took the next bus and as we got in people were pushed in with us. We were all standing and that way we arrived at the Leipzig railway station. On the way, one woman became crazy. They took us to a siding where they take animals, horses and cows. There were soldiers with bayonets standing every ten meters to make sure we didn’t run away. So you see, at 7:00 in the morning I was a student, and at 5:00, I was a criminal. It was terrible (<a href="https://www.motl.org/yad-vashem-interview-with-miriam-ron-witness-to-the-events-of-kristallnacht/">source: Yad Vashem interview with Miriam Ron</a>)</p>

<p>My dear ones!<br><br>You have probably already heard of my fate from Cilli. On October 27 of this year, on a Thursday evening at 9 o’clock, two men came from the Crime Police, demanded my passport, and then placed a&nbsp;deportation&nbsp;document before me to sign and ordered me to accompany them immediately. Cilli and Bernd were already in bed. I had just finished my work and was sitting down to eat, but had to get dressed immediately and go with them. I was so upset I could scarcely speak a word. In all my life I will never forget this moment. I was then immediately locked up in the Castle prison like a criminal. It was a bad night for me. On Friday at 4 o’clock in the afternoon we were taken to the main station under strict guard by Police and SS. Everybody was given two loaves of bread and margarine and was then loaded on the freight cars. It was a cruel picture. Weeping women and children, heart-breaking scenes. We were then taken to the border in sealed cars and under the strictest police guard. When we reached the border at 5 o’clock on Saturday afternoon we were put across. A new terrible scene was revealed here. We spent three days on the platform and in the waiting rooms, 8,000 people. Women and children fainted, went mad, people died, faces as yellow as wax. It was like a cemetery full of dead people. I was also among those who fainted. There was nothing to eat except the dry prison bread, without anything to drink. I never slept at all, for two nights on the platform and one in the waiting room, where I collapsed. There was no room even to stand. The air was pestilential. Women and children were half dead. On the fourth day help at last arrived. Doctors, nurses with medicine, butter and bread from the Jewish Committee in&nbsp;Warsaw. Then we were taken to barracks (military stables) where there was straw on the floor on which we could lie down&#8230;.<br><br>H.J.

<p class="has-text-align-left">In total, around 17,000 Polish Jews living in Germany were deported and left stateless on the Polish border; about 8,000 of those arrived in Zbąszyń. Herschel Grynzspan was not with the rest of his family when they arrived in Zbąszyń, as he had left for Paris in 1936. The story of how Herschel arrived in Paris is briefly as follows: his family had intended for him to emigrate to British Mandate Palestine, but he was refused entry by the British for being too young. His parents therefore decided that he ought to emigrate to Paris instead, where they expected he could find refuge with an uncle and aunt (he was 14 in 1935). He eventually left for Paris, albeit his entry to France was illegal because he had no financial support and it was illegal for Jews to take money out of Germany by the mid 1930s.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">On the 3rd of November, 1938, just five days after the arrival of his family in Zbąszyń, Herschel received a postcard from his sister Berta detailing their plight. While the Germans had discarded thousands of Jews in Zbaszyn, Poland was unwilling to accept them into the country. The Jews at the border were therefore effectively stateless and unwanted, squeezed into a border town where they were dumped in horse stables, a flour mill, military barracks, or left to sleep outside in fields. Emanuel Ringer, a social worker who went to Zbąszyń to help wrote the following on December 6, 1938 (<a href="https://www.jewishgen.org/blog/?p=the-zbaszyn-tragedy-a-town-without-pity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full letter here</a>):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-left">&#8220;Jews were humiliated to the level of lepers, to citizens of the third class, and as a result we are all visited by terrible tragedy. Zbąszyń was a heavy moral blow against the Jewish population of Poland. And it is for this reason that all the threads lead from the Jewish masses to Zbąszyń and to the Jews who suffer there.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The text in the postcard from Berta to her brother Herschel is reproduced below (<a href="https://www.porta-polonica.de/en/atlas-of-remembrance-places/story-herschel-grynszpan?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source: Federal Archives, Berlin, R&nbsp;55/20991, letters to and from Herschel Grynszpan</a>):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dear Hermann [German rendering of Herschel]!<br><br>You will surely have heard of our great misfortune. Let me describe what happened. On Thursday evening, rumours were circulating that all Polish Jews were to be expelled from a city. Even so, we found them difficult to believe. On Thursday evening at&nbsp;9, a policeman came to us and told us that we should go to the police station with our passports. All together, as we were, we went to the police station accompanied by the policeman. We found almost our entire district gathered there. A police car immediately took us to the city hall. Everyone was taken there. No-one told us what was going on. However, we could see what they had in mind.</p>



<p>Each one of us was handed an expulsion order. We were told we had to leave Germany before the 29th. We were no longer allowed to return home. I begged them to allow me to go home to at least collect a few things. I then left for home, accompanied by a policeman, and packed the most important items of clothing in a suitcase. That’s all that I was able to save.</p>



<p>We don’t have a single penny on us. [&#8230;] I’ll tell you more next time</p>



<p>Love and kisses from us all</p>

<p>The letter left Herschel distraught and desperate, and his first instinct was to send all his savings to his family. He ended up arguing with his uncle over this plan, and he was persuaded not to do it, due to the low likelihood that the money would make it to his family. Just two days later, on the 6th of November, Herschel departed his uncle&#8217;s house announcing he would not return, slept in a hotel, and the next morning, at 9:30am on November 7th, 1938, managed to enter the German embassy in Paris by pretending to have to deliver an important message. Upon entering the office of diplomat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_vom_Rath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ernst vom Rath</a>, he shot him. He had bought the gun that morning on his way to the embassy.</p>

Later that night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reinhard Heydrich</a> <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/nazi-telegram-instructions-kristallnacht-november-10-1938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a teletype</a> from Berlin to Gestapo and police office instructing police not to interfere with demonstrators acting against Jews, telling them to target only Jewish businesses and synagogues, ordering the seizure of Jewish property and instructing fire brigades to let synagogues burn.</p>



<p>That night and the following day <a href="https://www.pogromnovember1938.co.uk/viewer/">More than 1,200 synagogues and prayer halls were burned and/or destroyed across Germany</a> and two hundred or so more in Austria. Jewish cemeteries and schools were desecrated. Thousands of Jewish businesses were looted and sacked. Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. 91 Jews were murdered. The next day <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goebbels-kristallnacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goebbels wrote in his diary</a> &#8220;This is one dead man who is costing the Jews dear. Our darling Jews will think twice in the future before simply gunning down German diplomats.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Jewish cemetery in Zbąszyń is today a patch of grass. It was desecrated in 1939, although some of the grave remnants were still there at the end of World War II. Those remains were razed to the ground and liquidated completely in the 1970s. Now, a small memorial stone from 1992 commemorates what the lawn once was. It asks that one honor the site. I visited the place last week on September 13, 2025 and found it to be littered with broken glass bottles and beer cans. While cleaning up the trash I wondered about the futility of the act.</p>

<p>The Gryzbowski brothers were Jews who owned a <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/gallery/zbaszyn">flour mill in Zbąszyń</a> that they used to house some of the Polenaktion Jews. Two Stolper stones mark the last place they lived in the town. The Polish inscription underneath Rafał Grzybowski&#8217;s name translates to &#8220;helped the deported during the Polenaktion, deported to the Kutno-Konstancja camp, murdered&#8221;.</p>

<p>In 1939, several months after their internment, some of the Jews in Zbąszyń started to be allowed to leave farther east into Poland. Like Rafał Grzybowski, the vast majority of them were almost certainly murdered. Kristallnacht was a prelude to the holocaust, which was a genocide in many acts with many actors. The Nazis found eager partners among the Poles, as evident already in the <a href="https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/45926/1/Antisemitism%20in%20Eastern%20Poland%20H%C3%B3lmfr%C3%AD%C3%B0ur%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Bjarnveig.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Białystock</a> and <a href="https://www.jhi.pl/en/articles/anniversary-of-the-jedwabne-pogrom,3752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedwabne</a> pogroms of 1941 (this <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/complicity-of-poles-in-the-deaths-of-jews-is-highly-underestimated-scholars-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history is being erased today</a>). 90% of the Jews in Poland were murdered in the holocaust, amounting to 3 million souls.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The Nazis relied on the high-precision geodetic surveys they had throughout the war. When US Army Major Floyd Hough entered Aachen, the first German city to fall to the Allies, on October 21st, 1944,<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/untold-story-secret-mission-seize-nazi-map-data-180973317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> he found a treasure trove of German maps</a> bundled for evacuation, evidently left behind by German soldiers as they undertook a hasty retreat. The surveys were immediately useful to the Allies, helping artillery units on the front improve their targeting. </p>

<p>But it was the Red Army that liberated Zbąszyń during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula%E2%80%93Oder_offensive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vistula-Oder offensive</a> in January 1945. By the time they arrived there was no longer a Jewish community in Zbąszyń and there has not been one since.

<p>To guard against identity theft, academic publishers have been using institutional email addresses to verify authors and reviewers are who they say they are. Now, however, findings appearing in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04024">a preprint</a> last month on arXiv.org suggest bad actors have found a way to breach this defense – and are routinely doing so.</p>



<p>From a pool of thousands of reviewer profiles set up as part of AI conferences in 2024 and 2025, staff at the nonprofit<a href="https://openreview.net/"> OpenReview</a>, a platform connecting authors with reviewers, found 94 profiles involving fake identities. In all but two cases, the impostors had used “round-trip-verified” email addresses belonging to the domains of “reputed” universities, the authors write. (The remaining two used &#8220;.edu&#8221; domains of defunct institutions.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impersonating someone else using an institutional email address “adds another layer of challenge in the detection” of bad actors, said first author<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/"> Nihar B. Shah</a> of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who also sits on OpenReview’s board.</p>



<span id="more-132868"></span>



<p>Shah told us a presenter at the<a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/"> International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication</a> earlier this month had encouraged greater reliance on institutional emails to help combat paper mills. The new findings suggest “that is not entirely foolproof and so we should try to use multiple different ways together for identity verification.”</p>

<p>Fraudsters already try to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/15/more-details-on-the-bmcspringer-retraction-ring-an-impersonated-reviewer-speaks/">impersonate reviewers</a> to make sure articles they or their accomplices wrote get favorable reviews. Other forms of identity theft are also<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9867-x"> a growing threat</a> to academia. Researchers may find their names on<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/"> papers they never wrote</a>, or<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"> entire journals may be hijacked</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/my-journal-was-hijacked-an-editors-experience/">swindling authors</a> into paying for useless publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create a fake institutional email, fraudsters rely on institutions allowing members and visitors to create email aliases, according to the preprint.</p>



<p>“The dishonest researcher gained access to an email of a trusted institution, and created email alias(es) resembling someone else at that institution. Alternatively, the dishonest researcher may ask a co-conspirator at another institution to create such an alias,” the authors write.</p>



<p>Once an email address was secured, the impostor then signed up to review using the other person&#8217;s identity, they add.</p>



<p>Embedded in the review system, “the dishonest researcher under this fraudulent identity attempts to get assigned to review papers authored by their true identity. This can sometimes be accomplished by expressing interest in reviewing the paper during bidding. This may alternatively be accomplished by increasing their perceived suitability as a reviewer for the paper by carefully tuning the false reviewer profile or some text in their own paper.”</p>



<p>Some impostors created multiple fake reviewer profiles, the authors note, or teamed “up with another dishonest researcher to favorably review their co-conspirators&#8217; work in exchange for some quid-pro-quo.”</p>



<p>Nobody knows how common identity theft is in academia. Among thousands of legitimate reviewers, the 94 fake profiles are “a relatively small number,” said<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/bio.html"> Andrew McCallum</a> of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, an author of the preprint and the creator of OpenReview. “But of course, even one case is very concerning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a joint interview, <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/people/hylke-koers/">Hylke Koers</a>,&nbsp; chief information officer of the International Association of Scientific, Technical, &amp; Medical Publishers, or STM, and his colleague <a href="https://richard.northover.info/">Richard Northover</a>, product manager for identity and access at STM, welcomed the new findings from OpenReview.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re very specific about some of the scenarios through which institutional email addresses can still be used for fraudulent purposes,” Koers told us. “I think there&#8217;s a call to action for publishers there, but also for research institutes and other parts of the research community to all step up and be much more vigilant about these kinds of scenarios.”</p>



<p>As we wrote in May in<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/19/researcher-identity-verification-framework-stm-author-editor-reviewer/"> a Q&amp;A</a> with Koers, <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/new-digital-identity-framework-aims-to-strengthen-research-integrity-in-scholarly-publishing/">new guidance</a> from the trade organization “suggests identifying “good” and “bad” actors based on what validated information they can provide, using passport validation when all else fails, and creating a common language in publishing circles to address authorship.”</p>



<p>Northover, who also worked on the recommendations, emphasized the need to make individual risk assessments and not be “so restrictive that you would exclude many legitimate scholars from participating.”</p>



<p>“You don&#8217;t go from &#8230; nothing to everybody needing to provide their retina scan and fingerprints,” he told us. “One example of something that you can use instead of, or as well as, institutional email addresses, would be<a href="https://info.orcid.org/interpreting-the-trustworthiness-of-an-orcid-record/"> ORCID with trust markers</a>,” independently verified information such as institutional affiliation and publication record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shah and McCallum said they believe identity theft is happening across different academic fields, with certain ways of picking referees – asking authors for suggestions or relying on open calls, for instance – being particularly ripe for abuse.</p>



<p>Based on his experience with AI conferences, Shah said he estimates about one in 200 reviewer profiles could be fake. Given that reviewers and authors are increasingly being paired using artificial intelligence, he added, developers “should make sure that the AI is far more robust to any kind of gaming.”</p>



<p>As to the 94 fake profiles in OpenReview’s system, they “were all blocked before they could do any real damage,” Shah told us.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="785" height="485" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132899" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg 785w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-300x185.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-768x474.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Oday A. Al-Owaedi</figcaption></figure>



<p>A professor of physics in Iraq was permanently dismissed last week after a government investigation found he orchestrated a massive fraudulent publishing scheme involving hundreds of thousands of dollars paid into his bank account by unwitting researchers, documents obtained by Retraction Watch show.</p>



<p>The scam included a deal between a prominent association of Iraqi academics and a predatory publisher, as well as the creation of a fake journal website and bogus acceptance letters purporting to be from reputed journals.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ministerial-order-with-translation_Redacted.pdf">ministerial order</a> dated September 9 and obtained by Retraction Watch, the physicist,<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0721-0409"> Oday A. Al-Owaedi</a>, who also goes by several other names, defrauded “researchers by collecting money from them under the pretext of publishing their papers in reputable international journals as promised, while in fact falsifying and forging publication in fake websites.”</p>



<span id="more-132898"></span>



<p>The document also stated Al-Owaedi falsified “the scientific content of research papers, knowingly, by inserting his name and his scientific works as references in these allegedly published papers.”</p>



<p>An Iraqi scholar close to the matter told us “hundreds” of budding researchers had been caught in the scam. That has put their careers at risk, because master’s and Ph.D. students in Iraq <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf">are required to publish papers</a> in indexed journals before they can obtain their degrees, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>“Many graduate students and researchers relied on these conference acceptances for thesis defenses, academic promotion, publication requirements, or graduation,” the source added. “Now, they face academic uncertainty or setbacks due to decisions beyond their control.”</p>



<p>We contacted Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to confirm Al-Owaedi’s termination, which has not been officially announced, and ask if the ministry will take steps to help the victims. We have not heard back. The order permanently removes Al-Owaedi from his position at the University of Babylon in Hilla, a public institution, adding that he committed “acts that render his continuation in state service harmful to the public interest.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Al-Owaedi nor his former employer responded to requests for comment. But on September 17, the day after we emailed him about the evidence we had obtained, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/oday.aljubory/posts/pfbid0MBvpX82ffYUHbwnwxYttvuYNnu3GaVjGA1Hh6zGUFFuH5uc1sHrRFHr1uGMsbH1Ml"> announced his dismissal</a> on Facebook (in Arabic) and said he was “innocent of the charges” against him. Al-Owaedi is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/prof.odai.jubori?rdid=btNiLLLlxjY0lFLo&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F17JQR2KLQE%2F"> also a politician</a> and is running in Iraq’s parliamentary election in November.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Al-Owaedi’s publishing scheme centered on<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250917134132/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> a conference that was organized by a prominent association</a> of Iraqi academics and was slated to take place in Baghdad this month. According to its website, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250912213012/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> 7th International Conference of the Iraqi Academics Syndicate for Sciences</a> (ICIASS-2025) offered participants a chance to publish their research in<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp"> AIP Conference Proceedings</a> or one of several “highly respected and peer-reviewed journals from renowned Dutch publishing house Elsevier.” (In correspondence we obtained, AIP Publishing denied having “an agreement in place to publish the proceedings of this conference.”)</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="758" height="926" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132884" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg 758w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier-246x300.jpg 246w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A message from Telegram shows El-Owaedi claimed he made a deal with Elsevier to publish hundreds of papers.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In messages posted to the conference’s now-deleted Telegram group, Al-Owaedi, who chaired the organizing committee for the event, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg">claimed he had made a deal with Elsevier</a> to publish hundreds of papers at discounted prices.</p>



<p>Authors were required to pay “publication fees” after receiving a preliminary acceptance notice from the conference, but before publication, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Telegram_Al-Owaedi.jpg">Al-Owaedi explained</a>. These fees varied by journal, but typically amounted to US$650 – or some $100 more than<a href="https://shafaq.com/en/Economy/Iraq-s-average-salary-ranks-modest-globally-eighth-in-Arab-world"> Iraq’s average monthly salary</a> – according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supporting-journals.pdf">a list the conference supplied</a> of more than two dozen journals from Elsevier, AIP and another publisher.</p>



<p>After payment, the works would be sent to “the publishing house,” which would edit it and submit it to one of the journals on the list, Al-Owaedi wrote.</p>



<p>In reality, the ”publishing house” referred to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> Acadia Pulse</a>, which in May <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Contract-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">signed an agreement</a> with Al-Owaedi to assist his organization in publishing a “total of 400 academic papers in peer-reviewed Scopus Q2 indexed journals.”</p>



<p>Acadia Pulse<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916111616/https:/acadiapulse.org/resources/"> describes itself</a> as a New York-based “international consultancy offering students, researchers, and corporations the opportunity to publish in PubMed and Scopus indexed journals.” But no records of a business called Acadia Pulse exist in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s<a href="https://www.edgarcompany.sec.gov/servlet/CompanyDBSearch?page=main"> EDGAR company database</a>. Meanwhile, the operation’s website has<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/"> several hallmarks of a full-fledged paper mill</a>, such as<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> promising</a> ”guaranteed publications in our flagship journals.”</p>



<p>One of these “flagship” publications is the <em>International Journal of Scientific Studies and Qualitative Research</em>, which<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916112638/https:/www.ijssqr.org/about-us"> lists as its editor-in-chief</a> Gunnar Möller.<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/466/m%C3%B6ller-gunnar"> A physicist at the University of Kent</a> in the UK, Möller told us he had never heard of the journal.</p>



<p>The company did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acceptance-emails-from-IAS_Redacted.pdf">emails</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A-proof-of-payment_Redacted.pdf">bank receipts</a> we obtained, authors at the conference were required to pay the publication fees directly into Al-Owaedi’s personal bank account. In at least one case, the required payment – 950,000 Iraqi dinars, or about US$725 – exceeded the “publishing cost” provided in the journal list by more than US$50.</p>



<p>On July 8, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1613437808723201/permalink/24006494742324188/?rdid=i01arQxgVcbZ95Ls"> announced on Facebook</a> that the first research from the conference had been published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Vocational Behavior</em>. He included what he described as a link to the paper:<a href="https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR4RLJMmnFLy3SymurdrUkj4bvluMMPbdQmDDH2kVjuNYhcH_Y9lvStV1RhJ4A_aem_KO7ezPppFRm5d1G4dabv8g"> https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213</a>. When the link was still functional (we archived it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250908083304/https:/links-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213">here</a>), it sent readers to a near-perfect sham version of the journal’s website. The site displayed a complete article, titled “Holland&#8217;s Characteristics of personality Traits and Their Influence in Impression Management” and written by two real Iraqi scholars.</p>



<p>But the Digital Object Identifier link was forged – real DOI prefixes<a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/doi-basics"> always start with “10,”</a> not “11” – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Sultani-Al-Saidi-fake-publication.pdf">the paper</a> had never been published. We reached out to the two authors, but one told us he was sick and the other never replied.</p>

<p>Similarly, some authors began receiving purported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fake-acceptance-letter_Applied-Mathematics.jpeg">acceptance letters</a> from the journals, as well as what appeared to be login information allowing them to access Elsevier’s Editorial Manager system to track their submissions, according to videos we have seen.</p>



<p>But Elsevier told us the letters had not been issued by their publications, adding, “The matter is still under investigation, but so far, we have no evidence that Editorial Manager was compromised.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The ministerial order dismissing Al-Owaedi states he handed over the money received from the researchers to his wife, “without authorization from the [Iraqi Academics Syndicate] and without disclosure thereof.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi Academics Syndicate has not responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>In his September 17 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A32yxmqPa/">Facebook</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1C93mL4p8U/">posts</a>, Al-Owaedi stated the money he received had “been transferred by the conference to the publishing company.” As proof, he attached pictures of two purported bank transaction slips listing amounts of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-1.jpg">$54,000</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-2.jpg">$150,000</a>, respectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Letters-from-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">Correspondence</a> from Acadia Pulse addressed to “Iraqi Universities” suggests the forgery did not go unnoticed, and the company attempted damage control through obfuscation.</p>



<p>In a section titled “Reasons Why Journals Declare Acceptance Letters Fake and Papers Non-Existent,” a letter signed by a “Henry Davis” stated, “Journals have strict terms and conditions that authors must follow. One of these is that authors must not contact the journal directly before publication. If an author violates this condition, the journal may deny any connection to the manuscript because such contact undermines the confidentiality of the editorial process and affects their business model.”</p>



<p>Another message addressed questions about the strange DOI prefix of the forged conference publication. “We would like to clarify that the assignment of DOI prefixes is entirely determined by the respective journal or publisher,” the letter stated. ”Each publisher is registered with CrossRef (or another DOI registration agency) and may receive a different prefix based on their allocation.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity said some students had not been awarded their degrees because they presented the fake journal acceptance letters at their thesis defense.</p>



<p>“There have been attempts to blame students and researchers for making payments or not recognizing the fraud,” the source told us. “This is unfair. The participants received what appeared to be formal, official conference acceptance letters. They were acting in good faith, based on institutional trust, and should not be penalized for the failure of oversight bodies.”</p>



<p>The source also criticized the government for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICSAI-2025-Al-Owaedi-chair-of-preparatory-committee_arabic.jpg">making Al-Owaedi chair</a> of yet <a href="https://www.icsai-2025.alzahu.edu.iq/#">another conference</a> organizing committee two weeks after the investigation against him began, and for keeping the probe under wraps while conference participants continued submitting papers and paying publication fees to the physicist.</p>



<p>“This delay directly enabled the harm done to researchers and students,” the source said.</p>
