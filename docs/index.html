<p>An oral surgeon in Japan falsified images in several papers, granted authorship to whomever he saw fit and stored experimental data sloppily, according to an investigation by Showa University in Tokyo, where the physician was a lecturer at the time of the misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of the findings, the university has recommended retracting eight papers by the surgeon, Masayasu Iwase, according to a translation commissioned by Retraction Watch of a December <a href="https://www.showa-u.ac.jp/news/albums/abm.php?d=4820&amp;f=abm00039533.pdf&amp;n=%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%BB%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E6%A6%82%E8%A6%81.pdf">report</a> from the committee that investigated the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university also is discussing revoking the graduate degrees of two of Iwase’s former students whose dissertations were based on the &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; papers, the report explains.</p>



<p>Tadashi Hisamitsu, Showa’s president, <a href="https://www-showa--u-ac-jp.translate.goog/news/nid00004820.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">wrote</a> on the university&#8217;s website:</p>



<span id="more-126377"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I deeply regret that research misconduct was committed, and I deeply apologize for the loss of trust in research at the university. In the future, we will implement measures to prevent recurrence, such as thorough research ethics education, and the entire university will work to prevent recurrence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iwase left academia in 2010. He served as chief of the Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery at Hakujikai Memorial General Hospital, also in Tokyo, and <a href="https://www-grace--dc-com.translate.goog/clinic/dental-hokuso/?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">still appears to be practicing</a> medicine at Grace Dental Medical Clinic Hokuso Branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eight articles, about oral-cancer cell biology, were published between 2003 and 2011. The university did not reveal the identity of the papers when contacted by Retraction Watch, but <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Masayasu+Iwase">concerns have been raised</a> on PubPeer and <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/03/08/oral-oncology-at-showa-university/">elsewhere</a> about several of Iwase&#8217;s publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2021, the <em>International Journal of Cancer</em> issued <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33825">an expression of concern</a> about one of them, noting that it had also contacted the university &#8220;but no investigation was initiated.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Showa report states that a preliminary committee was established on July 16, 2021, to investigate concerns raised by &#8220;a journal editor-in-chief&#8221; who had contacted the university the previous day.</p>



<p>The committee&#8217;s investigation focuses on papers based on research by four of Iwase&#8217;s then-graduate students. The students&#8217; experimental data were stored on a shared computer, the report notes, but Iwase:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>did not have a clear rule on how to save data. Therefore, when he used the data, he was unsure which data was from which experiment. He said the data management was sloppy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The studies used β-actin as a control for Western blotting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>but Iwase did not consider it as important. So even though he was unsure about the link between the experiment and the β-actin image, he used it for the papers. As a result, the same image has been published in multiple papers as images of different experiments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report states that, at that time, another university instructor strictly emphasized the importance of the β-actin control to students, leading the committee to conclude that Iwase lacked &#8220;awareness of research integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The committee also asked a company specializing in image matching to check the images in the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company found that “what was described as different image data in the papers showed an extremely high matching rate,&#8221; leading to the conclusion that Iwase was guilty of &#8220;data falsification.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iwase, who, according to the report, &#8220;did not understand the authorship criteria at the time,&#8221; also appears to have wielded autocratic powers over which research was submitted for publication and who was listed as authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when someone gave advice on experimental techniques or the contents of a paper, he made them an author; a person responsible for the graduate program was also made an author. &#8220;However, Iwase does not recall why he chose someone in another research group as an author,&#8221; the report states.</p>



<p>When one student proved unable to write his dissertation in English, as required by his supervisor, Iwase himself wrote and submitted papers based on the student&#8217;s work, without offering further guidance to the student. As a result, the student &#8220;could not complete&#8221; his dissertation, according to the investigators, who add:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Masayasu Iwase sometimes showed the manuscript draft to some of the authors, but he did not give authors opportunities to check the contents and he submitted [the papers] without their approval.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iwase has been notified about the findings and has not contested them, according to the report, which does not identify any of the former students by name.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The committee doesn&#8217;t just point fingers at individuals, but also blames systemic issues at Showa University. During the period when the misconduct occurred, the institution &#8220;did not work hard&#8221; to promote research ethics and appropriate data management and authorship practices, the report states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another Showa researcher, anesthesiologist Hironobu Ueshima, previously was found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/28/anesthesiology-researcher-guilty-of-misconduct-in-more-than-140-papers-investigation/">fabricated data and tinkered with authorship</a> in 142 papers.</p>



<p>Today, extensive ethics education is mandatory for both graduate students and faculty at the university, according to the report, and the school has established an explicit authorship policy. In 2016, Showa University also introduced a set of regulations to prevent research misconduct, and random checks are being done to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>We will update this post if we hear more from Showa University about which papers it recommends for retraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">Rare earth mining may be key to our renewable energy future. But at what cost?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In spring 1949, three prospectors armed with Geiger counters set out to hunt for treasure in the arid mountains of southern Nevada and southeastern California.</p>



<p>In the previous century, those mountains yielded gold, silver, copper and cobalt. But the men were looking for a different kind of treasure: uranium. The world was emerging from World War II and careening into the Cold War. The United States needed uranium to build its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mining homegrown sources became a matter of national security.</p>





<p>After weeks of searching, the trio hit what they thought was pay dirt. Their instruments detected intense radioactivity in brownish-red veins of ore exposed in a rocky outcrop within California’s Clark Mountain Range. But instead of uranium, the brownish-red stuff turned out to be bastnaesite, a mineral bearing fluorine, carbon and 17 curious elements known collectively as rare earths. Traces of radioactive thorium, also in the ore, had set the Geiger counters pinging.</p>



<p>As disappointing as that must have been, the bastnaesite still held value, and the prospectors sold their claim to the Molybdenum Corporation of America, later called Molycorp. The company was interested in mining the rare earths. During the mid-20th century, rare earth elements were becoming useful in a variety of ways: <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/58/cerium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cerium</a>, for example, was the basis for a glass-polishing powder and <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/63/europium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">europium</a> lent luminescence to recently invented color television screens and fluorescent lamps.</p>



<p>For the next few decades, the site, later dubbed Mountain Pass mine, was the world’s top source for rare earth elements, until two pressures became too much. By the late 1980s, China was intensively mining its own rare earths — and selling them at lower prices. And a series of toxic waste spills at Mountain Pass brought production at the struggling mine to a halt in 2002.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the story. The green-tech revolution of the 21st century brought new attention to Mountain Pass, which later reopened and remains the only U.S. mine for rare earths.</p>



<p>Rare earths are now integral to the manufacture of many carbon-neutral technologies — plus a whole host of tools that move the modern world. These elements are the building blocks of small, super­efficient permanent magnets that keep smartphones buzzing, wind turbines spinning, electric vehicles zooming and more.</p>

<h3>Rare earths’ journey from mine to magnet</h3>

<p>Mining U.S. sources of rare earth elements, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Joe Biden’s administration stated in February 2021</a>, is a matter of national security.</p>



<p>Rare earths are not actually rare on Earth, but they tend to be scattered throughout the crust at low concentrations. And the ore alone is worth relatively little without the complex, often environmentally hazardous processing involved in converting the ore into a usable form, says Julie Klinger, a geographer at the University of Delaware in Newark. As a result, the rare earth mining industry is wrestling with a legacy of environmental problems.</p>



<p>Rare earths are mined by digging vast open pits in the ground, which can contaminate the environment and disrupt ecosystems. When poorly regulated, mining can produce wastewater ponds filled with acids, heavy metals and radioactive material that might leak into groundwater. Processing the raw ore into a form useful to make magnets and other tech is a lengthy effort that takes large amounts of water and potentially toxic chemicals, and produces voluminous waste.</p>



<p>“We need rare earth elements … to help us with the transition to a climate-safe future,” says Michele Bustamante, a sustainability researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C. Yet “everything that we do when we’re mining is impactful environmentally,” Bustamante says.</p>



<p>But there are ways to reduce mining’s footprint, says Thomas Lograsso, a metallurgist at the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the director of the <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/cmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Materials Institute</a>, a Department of Energy research center. Researchers are investigating everything from reducing the amount of waste produced during the ore processing to improving the efficiency of rare earth element separation, which can also cut down on the amount of toxic waste. Scientists are also testing alternatives to mining, such as recycling rare earths from old electronics or recovering them from coal waste.</p>



<p>Much of this research is in partnership with the mining industry, whose buy-in is key, Lograsso says. Mining companies have to be willing to invest in making changes. “We want to make sure that the science and innovations that we do are driven by industry needs, so that we’re not here developing solutions that nobody really wants,” he says.</p>



<p>Klinger says she’s cautiously optimistic that the rare earth mining industry can become less polluting and more sustainable, if such solutions are widely adopted. “A lot of gains come from the low-hanging fruit,” she says. Even basic hardware upgrades to improve insulation can reduce the fuel required to reach the high temperatures needed for some processing. “You do what you [can].”</p>



<h4>The environmental impact of rare earth mining</h4>



<p>Between the jagged peaks of California’s Clark range and the Nevada border sits a broad, flat, shimmering valley known as the Ivanpah Dry Lake. Some 8,000 years ago, the valley held water year-round. Today, like many such playas in the Mojave Desert, the lake is ephemeral, winking into appearance only after an intense rain and flash flooding. It’s a beautiful, stark place, home to endangered desert tortoises and rare desert plants like Mojave milkweed.</p>



<p>From about 1984 to 1998, the Ivanpah Dry Lake was also a holding pen for wastewater piped in from Mountain Pass. The wastewater was a by-product of chemical processing to concentrate the rare earth elements in the mined rock, making it more marketable to companies that could then extract those elements to make specific products. Via a buried pipeline, the mine sent wastewater to evaporation ponds about 23 kilometers away, in and around the dry lake bed.</p>

<p>The pipeline repeatedly ruptured over the years. At least 60 separate spills dumped an estimated 2,000 metric tons of wastewater containing radioactive thorium into the valley. Federal officials feared that local residents and visitors to the nearby Mojave National Preserve might be at risk of exposure to that thorium, which could lead to increased risk of lung, pancreatic and other cancers. </p>



<p>Unocal Corporation, which had acquired Molycorp in 1977, was ordered to clean up the spill in 1997, and the company paid over $1.4 million in fines and settlements. Chemical processing of the raw ore ground to a halt. Mining operations stopped shortly afterward.</p>



<p>Half a world away, another environmental disaster was unfolding. The vast majority — between 80 and 90 percent — of rare earth elements on the market since the 1990s have come from China. One site alone, the massive Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, accounted for 45 percent of rare earth production in 2019.</p>



<p>Bayan Obo spans some 4,800 hectares, about half the size of Florida’s Walt Disney World resort. It is also one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth. Clearing the land to dig for ore meant removing vegetation in an area already prone to desertification, allowing the Gobi Desert to creep southward.</p>



<p>In 2010, officials in the nearby city of Baotou noted that radioactive, arsenic- and fluorine-containing mine waste, or tailings, was being dumped on farmland and into local water supplies, as well as into the nearby Yellow River. The air was polluted by fumes and toxic dust that reduced visibility. Residents complained of nausea, dizziness, migraines and arthritis. Some had skin lesions and discolored teeth, signs of prolonged exposure to arsenic; others exhibited signs of brittle bones, indications of skeletal fluorosis, Klinger says.</p>



<p>The country’s rare earth industry was causing “severe damage to the ecological environment,” China’s State Council wrote in 2010. The release of heavy metals and other pollutants during mining led to “the destruction of vegetation and pollution of surface water, groundwater and farmland.” The “excessive rare earth mining,” the council wrote, led to landslides and clogged rivers.</p>



<p>Faced with these mounting environmental disasters, as well as fears that it was depleting its rare earth resources too rapidly, China slashed its export of the elements in 2010 by 40 percent. The new limits sent prices soaring and kicked off concern around the globe that China had too tight of a stranglehold on these must-have elements. That, in turn, sparked investment in rare earth mining elsewhere.</p>



<p>In 2010, there were few other places mining rare earths, with only minimal production from India, Brazil and Malaysia. <a href="https://lynasrareearths.com/about-us/locations/mt-weld-western-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new mine in remote Western Australia came online</a> in 2011, owned by mining company Lynas. The company dug into fossilized lava preserved within an ancient volcano called Mount Weld.</p>



<p>Mount Weld didn’t have anywhere near the same sort of environmental impact seen in China: Its location was too remote and the mine was just a fraction of the size of Bayan Obo, according to Saleem Ali, an environmental planner at the University of Delaware. The United States, meanwhile, was eager to once again have its own source of rare earths — and Mountain Pass was still the best prospect.</p>

<h4>Mountain Pass mine gets revived</h4>



<p>After the Ivanpah Dry Lake mess, the Mountain Pass mine changed hands again. Chevron purchased it in 2005, but did not resume operations. Then, in 2008, a newly formed company called Molycorp Minerals purchased the mine with ambitious plans to create a complete rare earth supply chain in the United States.</p>



<p>The goal was not just mining and processing ore, but also separating out the desirable elements and even manufacturing them into magnets. Currently, the separations and magnet manufacturing are done overseas, mostly in China. The company also proposed a plan to avoid spilling wastewater into nearby fragile habitats. Molycorp resumed mining, and introduced a “dry tailings” process — a method to squeeze 85 percent of the water out of its mine waste, forming a thick paste. The company would then store the immobilized, pasty residue in lined pits on its own land and recycle the water back into the facility.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Molycorp “was an epic debacle” from a business perspective, says Matt Sloustcher, senior vice president of communications and policy at <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP Materials</a>, current owner of Mountain Pass mine. Mismanagement ultimately led Molycorp to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015. MP Materials bought the mine in 2017 and resumed mining later that year. By 2022, Mountain Pass mine was producing 15 percent of the world’s rare earths.</p>



<p>MP Materials, too, has an ambitious agenda with plans to create a complete supply chain. And the company is determined not to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors. “We have a world-class … unbelievable deposit, an untapped potential,” says Michael Rosenthal, MP Materials’ chief operating officer. “We want to support a robust and diverse U.S. supply chain, be the magnetics champion in the U.S.”</p>



<h4>The challenges of separating rare earths</h4>



<p>On a hot morning in August, Sloustcher stands at the edge of the Mountain Pass mine, a giant hole in the ground, 800 meters across and up to 183 meters deep, big enough to be visible from space. It’s an impressive sight, and a good vantage point from which to describe a vision for the future. He points out the various buildings: where the ore is crushed and ground, where the ground rocks are chemically treated to slough off as much non–rare earth material as possible, and where the water is squeezed from that waste and the waste is placed into lined ponds.</p>



<p>The end result is a highly concentrated rare earth oxide ore — still nowhere near the magnet-making stage. But the company has a three-stage plan “to restore the full rare earth supply to the United States,” from “mine to magnet,” Rosenthal says. Stage 1, begun in 2017, was to restart mining, crushing and concentrating the ore. Stage 2 will culminate in the chemical separation of the rare earth elements. And stage 3 will be magnet production, he says.</p>

<h3>Sources of rare earth elements over time</h3>



<p>In the mid-20th century, the U.S. Mountain Pass mine was the world’s top source for rare earth oxides. China began to dominate global production in the 1990s. In the last decade, the return of Mountain Pass along with the opening of Australia’s Mount Weld and production in Myanmar, Brazil and other locations have begun to shift that balance.</p>

<p>Since coming online in 2017, MP Materials has shipped its concentrated ore to China for the next steps, including the arduous, hazardous process of separating the elements from one another. But in November, the company announced to investors that it had <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begun the preliminary steps for stage 2, a “major milestone”</a> on the way to realizing its mine-to-magnet ambitions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With investments from the U.S. Department of Defense</a>, the company is building two separations facilities. One plant will pull out lighter rare earth elements — those with smaller atomic numbers, including neodymium and praseodymium, both of which are key ingredients in the permanent magnets that power electric vehicles and many consumer electronics. MP Materials has additional grant money from the DOD to design and build a second processing plant to split apart the heavier rare earth elements such as dysprosium, also an ingredient in magnets, and yttrium, used to make superconductors and lasers.</p>



<p>Like stage 2, stage 3 is already under way. In 2022, the company broke ground in Fort Worth, Texas, for a facility to produce neodymium magnets. And it inked a deal with General Motors to supply those magnets for electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>But separating the elements comes with its own set of environmental concerns.</p>



<p>The process is difficult and leads to lots of waste. Rare earth elements are extremely similar chemically, which means they tend to stick together. Forcing them apart requires multiple sequential steps and a variety of powerful solvents to separate them one by one. Caustic sodium hydroxide causes cerium to drop out of the mix, for example. Other steps involve solutions containing organic molecules called ligands, which have a powerful thirst for metal atoms. The ligands can selectively bind to particular rare earth elements and pull them out of the mix.</p>



<p>But one of the biggest issues plaguing this extraction process is its inefficiency, says Santa Jansone-Popova, an organic chemist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The scavenging of these metals is slow and imperfect, and companies have to go through a lot of extraction steps to get a sufficiently marketable amount of the elements. With the current chemical methods, “you need many, many, many stages in order to achieve the desired separation,” Jansone-Popova says. That makes the whole process “more complex, more expensive, and [it] produces more waste.”</p>



<p>Under the aegis of the DOE’s Critical Materials Institute, Jansone-Popova and her colleagues have been hunting for a way to make the process more efficient, eliminating many of those steps. In 2022, the researchers identified a ligand that they say is much more efficient at snagging certain rare earths than the ligands now used in the industry. Industry partners are on board to try out the new process this year, she says.</p>



<p>In addition to concerns about heavy metals and other toxic materials in the waste, there are lingering worries about the potential impacts of radioactivity on human health. The trouble is that there is still only limited epidemiological evidence of the impact of rare earth mining on human and environmental health, according to Ali, and much of that evidence is related to the toxicity of heavy metals such as arsenic. It’s also not clear, he says, how much of the concerns over radioactive waste are scientifically supported, due to the low concentration of radioactive elements in mined rare earths.</p>



<p>Such concerns get international attention, however. In 2019, protests erupted in Malaysia over what activists called “a mountain of toxic waste,” about 1.5 million metric tons, produced by a rare earth separation facility near the Malaysian city of Kuantan. The facility is owned by Lynas, which ships its rare earth ore from Australia’s Mount Weld to the site. To dissolve the rare earths, the ore is cooked with sulfuric acid and then diluted with water. The residue that’s left behind can contain traces of radioactive thorium.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="618" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant.jpg" alt="A photo of machinery at a plant near Kuantan, Malaysia built by Australian company Lynas" class="wp-image-3120818" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant-638x383.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant-750x450.jpg 750w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant-310x186.jpg 310w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011423_cg-rareearths_malaysia-plant-967x580.jpg 967w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120818">Australian company Lynas built a plant near Kuantan, Malaysia, (shown in 2012) to separate and process the rare earth oxide ore mined at Mount Weld in Western Australia.

<p>Lynas had no permanent storage for the waste, piling it up in hills near Kuantan instead. But the alarm over the potential radioactivity in those hills may be exaggerated, experts say. Lynas reports that workers at the site are exposed to less than 1.05 millisieverts per year, far below the radiation exposure threshold for workers of 20 millisieverts set by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of misinformation about by­products such as thorium.… The thorium from rare earth processing is actually very low-level radiation,” Ali says. “As someone who has been a committed environmentalist, I feel right now that there’s not much science-based decision making on these things.”</p>



<p>Given the concerns over new mining, environmental think tanks like the World Resources Institute have been calling for more recycling of existing rare earth materials to reduce the need for new mining and processing.</p>



<p>“The path to the future has to do with getting the most out of what we take out of the ground,” says Bustamante, of the NRDC. “Ultimately the biggest lever for change is not in the mining itself, but in the manufacturing, and what we do with those materials at the end of life.”</p>



<p>That means using mined resources as efficiently as possible, but also recycling rare earths out of already existing materials. Getting more out of these materials can reduce the overall environmental impacts of the mining itself, she adds. </p>



<p>That is a worthwhile goal, but recycling isn’t a silver bullet, Ali says. For one thing, there aren’t enough spent rare earth–laden batteries and other materials available at the moment for recycling. “Some mining will be necessary, [because] right now we don’t have the stock.” And that supply problem, he adds, will only grow as demand increases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">Why it’s easier to catch a cold, the flu or COVID in the winter</a></h4>

              
                <p>When bitter winds blew and temperatures dropped, my grandmother would urge me to come inside. “You’ll catch your death of cold out there,” she’d say.</p>



<p>Sure, freezing to death is possible in frigid temperatures. But doctors and other health experts have long stressed that <em>being</em> cold won’t give you a cold. Still, winter is undisputedly cold-and-flu season. It’s also a period when COVID-19 spreads more.</p>



<p>But if the chill doesn’t matter, why does the spread of so many respiratory viruses peak during the season?</p>





<p>“I’ve spent the past 13 years looking into this question,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies viruses in the air. “The deeper we go, the more I realize we don’t know [and] the more there is to figure out.”</p>



<p>She and I are not alone. “That wintertime seasonality has puzzled people for a very long time; thousands of years, to be honest,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases researcher who directs the Climate and Health Program at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.</p>



<p>There is some evidence that winter’s shorter days may make people more susceptible to infection, he says. Less sunlight means people make less vitamin D, which is required for some immune responses. But that’s just one piece of the puzzle.</p>



<p>Scientists are also looking at what other factors may play a role in making winter a sickening season.</p>



<h4>Illness may spread more inside.</h4>



<p>My grandma’s well-intentioned urging to come in from the cold may have instead increased the risk that I’d get sick.</p>





<p>Colds, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are all illnesses that are more prevalent at certain times of year when people spend more time inside. That includes winter in temperate climates, where there are distinct seasons, and rainy seasons in tropical zones. COVID-19 also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">spreads more indoors</a> than outside (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Those diseases are caused by viruses that are transmitted primarily through <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breathing in small droplets known as aerosols</a>. That’s a change in thinking. Many scientists thought until very recently that such viruses were spread mainly by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">touching contaminated surfaces</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>).</p>



<p>“When you’re outdoors, you’re in the ultimate well-ventilated space,” says David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Viruses exhaled outside are diluted quickly with clean air.</p>



<p>But inside, aerosols and the viruses they contain can build up. “When you’re in a poorly ventilated space, the air you breathe in is often air that other people have breathed out,” he says.</p>



<p>Since viruses come along with that exhaled breath, “it makes a lot of sense that proximity to individuals who might be contagious would facilitate transmission,” Shaman says.</p>



<p>But there is more to the story, says Benjamin Bleier, a specialist for sinus and nasal disorders at Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>“In modern society, we’re indoors all year round,” he says.</p>



<p>To drive the seasonal pattern we see year after year, something else must be going on too to make people more susceptible to infection and increase the amount of virus circulating, he says.</p>



<h4>Drier air can give some viruses a boost.</h4>



<p>Some viruses thrive in winter. But the reason why may not be so much about temperature, but humidity.</p>



<p>“There are some viruses that like it warm and wet, and some viruses like it dry and cold,” says Donald Milton, an aerobiologist at the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. For instance, rhinoviruses — one of the many types of viruses that cause colds — survive better when it is humid. Cases of rhinovirus infection typically peak in early fall, he says.</p>



<p>Marr and other researchers have found that viruses that surge in the winter, including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — survive best when the relative humidity in the air falls below about 40 percent.</p>



<p>Viruses aren’t usually floating around naked, Marr says. They are encased in droplets of fluid, such as saliva. Those droplets also have bits of mucus, proteins, salt and other substances in them. Those other components may determine if the virus survives drying.</p>



<p>When the humidity is higher, droplets dry slowly. Such <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501658v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow drying kills viruses</a> such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, Marr and colleagues reported July 27 in a preprint at&nbsp;bioRxiv.org. During slow drying, salt and other things that may harm the virus become more concentrated, although researchers still don’t fully understand what’s happening at the molecular scale to inactivate the virus.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;flash drying in parched air preserves&nbsp;those viruses. “If the air is very dry, the water quickly evaporates. Everything is dried down, and it’s almost like things are frozen in place,” Marr says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How humidity affects airborne droplets</h3>



<p>At low humidity levels, airborne droplets, or aerosols, dry quickly (left), preserving viruses under a feathery crystalline lattice, as this microscope image shows. At intermediate humidity levels, crystals form inside liquid droplets (middle), but those crystals may inactivate viruses, not preserve them. At high humidity levels (right), aerosols remain liquid, allowing viruses to survive better than at midlevel humidity. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dryer, smaller aerosols are also more buoyant and may hang in the air longer, increasing the chance that someone will breathe them in, Fisman says.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, dry air can tear down some of people’s defenses against viruses. Studies in animals suggest that <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dry air can trigger death of some cells</a> lining the airways. That could leave cracks where viruses can invade.</p>



<p>Mucus in the airways can trap viruses and help protect against infection. But breathing cold, dry air can also slow the system that usually moves mucus out of the body. That may give viruses time to break out of the mucus trap and invade cells, Fisman says.</p>



<h4>Cold may harm our ability to fight off viruses.</h4>



<p>Being cold may not give you a cold, but it could make you more susceptible to catching one.</p>



<p>Normally, the immune system has a trick for warding off viruses, Bleier and colleagues recently discovered. Cells in the nose and elsewhere in the body are studded with surface proteins that can detect viruses. When one of these sensor proteins sees a virus coming, it signals the cell to release tiny bubbles called extracellular vesicles.</p>



<p>The bubbles work as a diversionary tactic, a bit like chaff being released from a military jet trying to avoid a heat-seeking missile, Bleier says. Viruses may go after the vesicles instead of infecting cells.</p>



<p>If a virus docks with one of the bubbles, it’s in for a surprise: Inside the vesicles are virus-killing bits of RNA called microRNAs. One of those microRNAs known as <em>miR-17</em> could kill two types of rhinoviruses and a cold-causing coronavirus, the team reported December 6 in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>.</p>

<h3>How cold weather affects the immune system</h3>



<p>The immune system has a diversionary tactic to keep viruses from infecting cells in the nose:&nbsp;When viruses (black and gray spheres) are detected, nasal cells&nbsp;release bubbles called extracellular vesicles (blue circles). These bubbles are studded with proteins (red, blue and black shapes on blue circles) that are normally found on the surface of nasal cells. Viruses may go after the bubbles instead of infecting cells. When temperatures in the nose drop below body temperature (right), cells release fewer bubbles, making it easier for viruses to find and infect nasal cells.</p>

<p>Researchers measured bubbles released from human nasal cells grown in lab dishes at 37° Celsius, our typical body temperature. Then the scientists lowered the thermostat to 32° C. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cells released about 42 percent fewer vesicles</a> at the cooler temperature, the team found. What’s more, those vesicles carried fewer weapons. Vesicles can pack in about 24 percent more microRNA at body temperature than when it is cooler.</p>



<h4>Three tips to bolster our immune system.</h4>



<p>I asked the experts what people can do to protect themselves from viruses in the winter. Some said using a humidifier might help raise moisture levels enough to slow the drying of virus-laden droplets, killing the viruses.</p>



<p>“Any increase in humidity should be beneficial,” says Shaman. “You get a lot of bang for your buck if you go from very dry to dry.”</p>



<p>But Milton doesn’t think it’s a good idea to pump a lot of moisture into a house when it is cold outside. “That humidity is going to find all of the cold spaces in your house and condense there,” creating a breeding ground for mold and rot, he says.</p>



<p>Instead, he advocates turning on kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans to increase ventilation and to use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">HEPA filters or Corsi-Rosenthal boxes</a> to filter unwanted viruses out of the air (<em>SN: 7/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Bleier suggests wearing a mask. Not only can masks filter out viruses, but “our work suggests these masks have a second mechanism of action,” he says. “They keep a cushion of warm [moist] air in front of our noses, which could help bolster the immune system.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methylated-gases-indicator-alien-life">Methylated gases could be an unambiguous indicator of alien life</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SEATTLE</strong> — Attention alien hunters: If you want to find life on distant planets, try looking for signs of toxic chemical cleanup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gases that organisms produce as they tidy up their environments <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS241/Itinerary/PresentationDetail.aspx?evdid=1687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could provide clear signs of life on planets orbiting other stars</a>, researchers announced January 9 at the American Astronomical Society meeting. All we need to do to find hints of alien life is to look for those gases in the atmospheres of those exoplanets, in images coming from the James Webb Space Telescope or other observatories that could come online soon.</p>





<p>Barring an interstellar radio broadcast, the chemistry of a remote planet is one of the more promising ways that researchers could detect extraterrestrial life. On Earth, life produces lots of chemicals that alter the atmosphere: Plants churn out oxygen, for example, and a host of animals and plants release methane. Life elsewhere in the galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">might do the same thing</a>, leaving a chemical signature humans could detect from afar (<em>SN: 9/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>But many of life’s gases are also released in processes that have nothing to do with life at all. Their detection could lead to the false impression of a living planet in a faraway solar system, when it’s really just a sterile rock.</p>



<p>At least one type of compound that some organisms produce to protect themselves from toxic elements, however, might provide unambiguous indications of life.</p>



<p>The life-affirming compounds are called methylated gases. Microbes, fungi, algae and plants are among the terrestrial organisms that create the chemicals by linking carbon and hydrogen atoms to toxic materials such as chlorine or bromine. The resulting compounds evaporate, sweeping the deadly elements away.</p>



<p>The fact that living creatures almost always have a hand in making methylated gases means the presence of the compounds in a planet’s atmosphere would be a strong sign of life of some kind, planetary astrobiologist Michaela Leung of the University of California, Riverside said at the meeting.</p>



<p>The same isn’t true of oxygen and methane. Oxygen, in particular, can accumulate when a hot star warms a planet’s oceans. “You have a steam atmosphere, and the [ultraviolet] radiation from the star splits up the water” into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen, Leung says. Hydrogen is light, so much of it is lost to space on small planets. “What you have left is all of this oxygen,” which, she says, leads to “really convincing oxygen signals in this process that at no point involved life.” </p>



<p>Similarly, while living organisms produce methane in abundance, lifeless geological phenomena like volcanoes do too.</p>





<p>At the concentrations of methylated gases typical of Earth, these gases will be hard to see in the atmospheres of distant planets, even with an instrument <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-small-far-planets-space">as powerful as the Webb telescope</a> (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). But Leung has reason to believe there may be planets where the gas abundance is thousands of times that of Earth.</p>



<p>“The most productive environments [for releasing methylated gases] that we see here on Earth,” she says, “are things like estuaries and wetlands.” A watery planet with lots of small continents and correspondingly more coastline, for example, could be packed with organisms cleaning away toxic chemicals with methylated gases.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of looking for the compounds as a sign of life is that it doesn’t require that the life resembles anything like what we have on our planet. “Maybe it’s not DNA-based, maybe it has other weird chemistry going on,” Leung says. But by assuming chlorine and bromine are likely to be toxic generally, methylated gases offer what Leung calls an agnostic biosignature, which can tell us that something is alive on a planet even if it’s utterly alien to us.</p>



<p>“The more signs of life we know to look for, then the better our chances of recognizing life when we do encounter it,” says Vikki Meadows, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved with the study. “It also helps us understand what kind of telescopes we should build, what we should look for and what the instrument requirements should be. Michaela’s work is really important for that reason.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">4 key things to know about lung infections caused by fungi</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some fungi that can cause serious lung infections have spread to many parts of the United States. A <em>Science News</em> story on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">expanded range of <em>Histoplasma</em>, <em>Coccidioides</em> and <em>Blastomyces</em> fungi</a> hit a nerve with a lot of readers (<em>SN: 1/4/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They asked about the symptoms, treatments and testing for these fungal diseases. Some, like Judy Knudsen, whose husband Jack died from a <em>Histoplasma </em>infection in 2020, also wrote to share their own experiences with fungal infections. Others wanted to learn more about the fungi themselves.</p>





<p>I went back to Andrej Spec, a mycologist and infectious diseases doctor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis whose team published the new range maps, for answers.</p>



<p>Spec and his colleagues are studying what has caused the fungi to spread and factors that may contribute to people getting sick. Those include changes to climate, weather patterns, extreme weather events like wildfires and floods, and even migration patterns of animals.</p>



<h4>How do you catch these fungal infections?</h4>



<p>People generally get infected by inhaling fungal spores released during the fungi’s normal life cycle. Human activities that disturb the soil where these fungi typically live — such as farming, gardening, construction, road work or archaeology — can also stir up dust and spores.</p>



<p>Besides soil, bird droppings and bat guano can be sources for <em>Histoplasma.</em> The fungi can infect bats and grow in the animals’ intestines. Birds don’t usually carry the fungus because birds’ body temperatures are typically around 39° Celsius to 42° C (102° Fahrenheit to 107° F). “They’re too hot for <em>Histo</em>, but their droppings are perfectly suited to grow” the fungus, Spec says.</p>



<p>The highest risk to people comes when bird and bat droppings have dried out. “People will try and sweep [the droppings], and then you kick up all that dust and inhale it.” Instead of sweeping, Spec advises, “hose it down and shovel it off.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Wearing a mask can also help limit exposure. “Especially if you’re immunosuppressed, wear a mask.”</p>





<p>It is possible for the fungi to get into a cut or scrape and start an infection in the skin, but those cases are very rare, Spec says. And people generally can’t pass the infection on to others, except in very rare cases in which an infected person has donated an organ or other body tissue, he says.</p>



<h4>What happens in the body?</h4>



<p>These three types of fungi are known as dimorphic fungi because they have two forms. In the soil, where they normally grow, they are molds. But at 37° C — human body temperature — they shape-shift into yeast, which can grow rapidly and spread more easily in the body.</p>



<p>When a person inhales the fungal spores, the fungi can infect the lungs where conditions are right for it to transform. People with healthy immune systems may have no symptoms or may develop mild flulike symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, chills and body aches. People with <a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/coccidioidomycosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coccidiomycosis</a> — the disease caused by <em>Coccidioides —</em> may also get a rash on their legs or upper body.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How some fungi can make you sick</h3>



<p><em>Histoplasma, Blastomyces</em> and <em>Coccidioides</em> fungi live in the soil as molds. Sometimes people breathe in spores the fungi give off as part of their natural life cycle. In the lungs, the fungi can transform into a quick-growing yeast form and cause a flulike illness, pneumonia or chronic disease. In a small number of cases, the fungi can spread to other parts of the body and cause more serious disease.</p>

<p>The symptoms can take time to appear. People with <a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">histoplasmosis</a> — the disease caused by <em>Histoplasma</em> — can develop symptoms between three and 17 days after exposure. Symptoms of coccidiomycosis — also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Fever</a> — appear between one and three weeks after breathing in the spores. But it can take three weeks to three months for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/blastomycosis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blastomycosis</a> — caused by <em>Blastomyces</em> — symptoms to start.</p>



<p>Mild cases usually clear up on their own in a few weeks to a few months. But some people may have lingering symptoms, especially if the infection becomes severe.</p>



<p>In 2019, more than 20,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with coccidiomycosis, 1,124 people had confirmed or probable cases of histoplasmosis and there were 240 cases of confirmed or probable blastomycosis, according to cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s probably an undercount, given that mild cases likely aren’t reported and the infections can easily be misdiagnosed as more common lung diseases, the researchers say. But of the reported cases, more than half of people diagnosed with histoplasmosis and blastomycosis were hospitalized. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/ss/ss7107a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent of histoplasmosis patients died</a>. So did 9 percent of those with blastomycosis.</p>



<p>Some people may develop severe or chronic pneumonia. And in a small number of people, the infections may spread to other parts of the body. <em>Histoplasma</em> “likes to go after our liver and spleen, our bone marrow &#8230; adrenal glands &#8230; and our intestines,” Spec says.</p>



<p><em>Blastomyces</em> tends to spread to bones and joints. It may also spread to the brain where it can cause an abscess.</p>



<p><em>Coccidioides</em> spreads in a pattern similar to <em>Blastomyces</em>, targeting bones, joints, skin and the brain. But instead of creating a brain abscess, the fungi cause meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>“That’s with you forever if it spreads to your brain,” Spec says. “You can’t get rid of <em>Cocci</em>.” Doctors can manage the brain infection with antifungal drugs and give other medications to help with symptoms.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs can clear most other infections. “If caught early, most people do exceedingly well,” he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Warning signs</h3>



<p>Symptoms of all three fungal diseases caused by <em>Histoplasma, Coccidioides</em> and <em>Blastomyces</em> fungi are similar and can resemble the flu or other lung infections. Signs of a fungal lung infection may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fever</li>



<li>Cough</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>



<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Headache</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Muscle or joint pain or body aches</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Night sweats for people with <em>Blastomyces</em> or <em>Coccidioides </em>infections</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h4>Who is most affected by these fungal infections?</h4>



<p>People who have weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms and severe disease.</p>



<p>And fungal infections and severe disease occur more often in men than women. About 70 percent of <em>Blastomyces</em> infections, 52 percent of <em>Coccidioides</em> cases and 56 percent of <em>Histoplasma</em> infections were in males, the 2019 CDC survey found.</p>



<p>Why males are more affected isn’t entirely clear. Some people have speculated that men tend to have more outdoor jobs and hobbies that would expose them to dirt and thus more fungi.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how Jack Knudsen became infected. “We have no earthly idea why this came up,” says Judy, 82, of Oklahoma City. Already battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia, heart problems and diabetes, Jack’s immune system wasn’t up to tackling the fungus. “He struggled,” she says.</p>



<p>He spent two weeks in the hospital getting antifungal drugs intravenously. He also took four doses a day of a liquid antifungal medication called itraconazole for the rest of his life. He died on January 23, 2020, at age 79. “We had 61 good years together,” Judy says.</p>



<p>There may be biological reasons for the male-female skew. A recent study of coccidiomycosis found that the sex difference was also present in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/9/3/ofab543/6529267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonhuman primates and in dogs</a>. “There’s very little difference between occupational exposures and hobbies between male and female” animals, says Spec, who was not involved in that study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found no difference in infection rates in humans up to age 19. After that, the infection rate for males held steady. But female’s infection rate dropped, Ian McHardy, a microbiologist and immunologist at Scripps Health in San Diego, and colleagues reported in the March 2022 <em>Open Forum Infectious Diseases.</em> That might mean that estrogen and other hormones that are usually at higher levels in females may protect against fungal infections. But that link is still speculation.</p>

<p>See how the ranges of <em>Histoplasma, Blastomyces</em> and <em>Coccidioides</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">have changed</a> in the United States from 1950 to today. </p>
</div>



<p>Curiously, people of Filipino or African heritage may be at increased risk of developing more severe forms of Valley Fever. The reason is unknown. Other people, including those who are pregnant, living with HIV/AIDS or who have weakened immune systems from other causes are also at higher risk of more severe disease from all three fungi. So are people with diabetes and those who are older.</p>



<h4>How can I find out if my infection is caused by a fungus?</h4>



<p>Because symptoms of the fungal infections so closely resemble other illnesses, it can be hard to diagnose fungal disease, Spec says.</p>



<p>Jack Knudsen started having seizures in 2018, Judy says. At first, doctors thought he had epilepsy, but medications to treat the disorder had no effect. When one side of his face began to droop, an MRI and other tests revealed that Jack had <em>Histoplasma</em> in his brain. “I had never heard of it in my life,” says Judy, who said she wanted to share her husband’s story to make people more aware of the disease.</p>



<p>Blood or urine tests can be used to diagnose a fungal infection. Chest X-rays or CT scans may also be used. In some cases, doctors may need take a small amount of body tissue or fluids to test for the fungi.</p>



<p>“A lot of people who think they have [a fungal infection] are probably going not to have it.” Spec says. “It’s a disease that is certainly more common than people think but is still relatively rare.”&nbsp; The new maps Spec and colleagues compiled may make doctors and other people more aware that the fungal diseases may be present where they live.</p>



<p>People who are concerned that they may have a fungal infection can visit <a href="https://mycoses.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mycoses.org</a> where Spec and colleagues have assembled interactive maps showing where the fungi are found. “You’ll be able to see [based on] where you live which one you’re at risk for. When you have that data, your best goal is to talk to a doctor for testing.”</p>



<p>Any doctor can order a test, but infectious diseases specialists may have more expertise with the fungal diseases, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-lightning-gamma-rays-touch-passengers-flying">Rare ‘dark lightning’ might briefly touch passengers when flying</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — More than electricity can illuminate a thundercloud.</p>



<p>Brilliant bursts of gamma radiation, known as dark lightning or terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, also explode in lightning storms. And on rare occasions, those powerful blasts — the most energetic radiation to naturally arise on Earth — might even <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1071231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike a passing airplane</a>, researchers reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union meeting. The zap could briefly expose passengers to unsafe levels of radiation.</p>



<p>First <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.264.5163.1313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in 1994</a>, dark lightning is estimated to flash <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgra.50205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the world about a thousand times each day</a>. But scientists have only a hazy understanding of how it initiates. They generally agree dark lightning is sparked by the electric fields generated by thunderstorms and lightning bolts. These fields can spur electrons to velocities approaching the speed of light, amassing breakneck electron avalanches. When the streaming particles smash into airborne atoms, gamma radiation is unleashed.</p>





<p>Dark lightning often occurs around 10 to 15 kilometers high in the sky, altitudes frequented by airlines. The new analysis combines dark lightning observations and airline routes to suggest that dark lightning might strike near a plane around once every 1 to 4 years, atmospheric scientist Mélody Pallu said at the meeting. However, that’s probably “an upper limit of the real probability,” or even 10 times the actual rate, she said, largely because the calculations didn’t factor in pilots’ avoidance of thunderstorms.</p>



<p>Previous computer simulations have revealed that passengers flying within 200 meters of a strong terrestrial gamma-ray flash’s initiation point may become exposed to radiation doses <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeding 0.3 sieverts</a>, said Pallu, now at the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory in Paris. Such levels would surpass the occupational safety level of <a href="https://remm.hhs.gov/ICRP_guidelines.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.02 sieverts</a> per year put forth by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.</p>



<p>Though somewhat nebulous, the findings make one thing clear: Further investigations are needed to figure out how dark lightning impacts passengers flying through the sky.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid">Pandemic languishing is a thing. But is it a privilege?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Languishing. The term captured the zeitgeist in April 2021 when organizational psychologist Adam Grant penned an article in the <em>New York Times </em>titled, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s a name for the blah you’re feeling: It’s called languishing.</a>”</p>



<p>“Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health. It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being,” wrote Grant, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>The idea struck a chord with readers, and Grant’s ode to languishing went on to become the newspaper’s most read article of the year. Even I, generally suspicious of fads, felt the idea’s lure. Yes, I thought to myself, that explains a lot.</p>





<p>But I began to question my gut reaction to Grant’s piece after stumbling across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ssm-mental-health/special-issue/10NZQCCD255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several articles on flourishing</a> in the December <em>SSM-Mental Health </em>— all part of a series spearheaded by medical anthropologist Sarah Willen.</p>



<p>The study of how and why people flourish anchors a subfield of psychology known as positive psychology and includes related areas of research into happiness, well-being and resilience. In this research, flourishing refers to an optimal state of mental well-being, where one is happy, satisfied with life and has a sense of purpose.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists tend to believe that anyone can flourish if they just try hard enough, says Willen, of the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Consequently, she says, these researchers tend to downplay systemic barriers to flourishing, such as those related to race or class.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists “presume that people have a good measure of control over what they are able to do in life,” Willen says. But her own research, and that of others, shows that societal forces limit that control for many people.</p>



<p>In one article in the<em> SSM-Mental Health</em> series, Willen zooms in on Grant’s column to argue that its languishing framing speaks to the privileged few, and illustrates how the elite and powerful often capture the narrative during historic moments while <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560322000688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliding the lived experience</a> of people lower on the social totem pole.</p>



<h4>The rise of positive psychology</h4>





<p>Positive psychology is a relatively young field. In the late 1990s, when psychologist Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania took over as president of the American Psychological Association, he sought to reverse the field’s traditional focus on mental illness and focus instead on mental well-being. Since that time, positive psychology has emerged as a leading paradigm for research into mental health, writes Willen in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her introduction</a> to the mental health series.</p>



<p>The field has garnered enormous public and private investments: The Templeton Foundation, for example, currently funds the Global Flourishing Study, a $43.4 million initiative at Harvard University that will look at flourishing across time among 240,000 participants from 22 countries.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the study of human flourishing and its effects has permeated well beyond psychology research. The concept now shows up frequently in research on <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0749379721002762?token=1F2AC1EB34681716B155EB2AD905D2D6B08E55E0837AE4FA9BBF18F57B8BF5844CC8C66AA567D00A690CCACA93007B95&amp;originRegion=us-east-1&amp;originCreation=20221220211812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preventive medicine and physical health</a>, and in K-12 schools through what’s known as <a href="https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/posedseligmanadler.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive education</a>, where, the idea goes, positive schools and positive teachers who “transmit optimism, trust and a hopeful sense of the future … are the fulcrum for producing more well-being in a culture.”</p>



<p>But some researchers remain skeptical of positive psychology. For one, the field largely emphasizes individual-level — not societal — changes to help people flourish, such as practicing gratitude and volunteering. That risks reducing the study of flourishing to simple self-help tricks, Willen says. What’s more, this individualized view of flourishing helps fuel the incredibly powerful and profitable self-help industry, say Willen and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Positive psychology is a billion-dollar industry, and selling positivity as they do is incredibly lucrative and culturally seductive,” says Oksana Yakushko, a practicing psychologist in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>



<p>But, she says, the field ignores many people’s realities. “I am troubled by the socio-political implications of selling this positive psychology ideology in a world where human beings are consistently abused, traumatized, and stressed because they are not white, wealthy, able-bodied, Western, heterosexual, etc.”</p>



<h4>What does it mean to flourish?</h4>



<p>With positive psychology capturing money and attention, Willen began thinking a few years ago about how to push back against the movement. Decades of research into public health have made clear that thriving in life depends at least as much on a person’s environment and circumstances as their individual attributes, she says. “There are times in life when you feel like you just have to say something. It feels really important [to] bring a perspective from another discipline.”</p>



<p>So from 2018 to 2019, Willen and her team conducted a qualitative study of flourishing in Cleveland. Their 167-person pool of participants reflected the city’s economic and racial diversity. The team sought to understand how people conceived of flourishing through a series of open-ended questions beginning with: “Would you describe yourself as someone who’s flourishing at this point in your life? Why or why not?”</p>



<p>Roughly half of the participants said they were flourishing, the team reported in the December <em>SSM-Mental Health.</em> But the researchers also identified <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stark racial and socioeconomic disparities</a> in those responses.</p>



<p>Sixty-seven percent of white respondents felt they were flourishing compared with 48 percent of Black respondents. Similarly, 88 percent of respondents with incomes over $100,000 reported flourishing compared with 46 percent of respondents with incomes below $30,000.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A recipe for thriving</h3>



<p>U.S. researchers asked 167 Midwesterners to identify factors key to flourishing. Of the top six, four (blue) are generally included in existing indices of flourishing used by positive psychologists. But over two-thirds of people identified two factors, a stable income and one’s environment (gray), that aren’t generally included. Environment, which the researchers called “social determinants of health,” includes access to food, education and safe neighborhoods. As a result, positive psychologists miss crucial material or structural circumstances that contribute to people’s well-being, the researchers say.</p>

<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: S.S. Willen <em>et al</em>/<em>SSM-Mental Health</em> 2022</div>

<p>The team’s findings in response to another question — “What do people need, in general, to flourish?”— illuminated how participants’ understanding of flourishing often veered away from that of positive psychologists.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists tend to define someone as flourishing if they report having generally positive relationships and emotions, meaning and purpose in their life, self-acceptance or high self-esteem and deep engagement in their life’s activities. Among participants in Willen’s study, such relationships and feeling good about oneself were important to flourishing, but meaning and purpose showed up less frequently.</p>



<p>Most crucially, the participants in the study mentioned two aspects of flourishing that rarely figure into positive psychologists’ definitions of the term: Stable income and strong social determinants of health. The latter includes access to food, housing, education and safe neighborhoods while also experiencing low levels of discrimination.</p>



<p>If policy makers’ goal is to help as many people flourish as possible, then initiatives should focus on reducing inequality and mitigating those systemic barriers to well-being rather than more individualized measures, Willen says.</p>



<h4>Is flourishing, or languishing, a privilege?</h4>



<p>The disagreement between anthropologists and positive psychologists is largely one of world view, says Harvard University epidemiologist Tyler VanderWeele, who leads the Templeton-funded Global Flourishing Study. While Willen and her team argue that one’s environment may put happiness, or flourishing, out of reach, VanderWeele sees that world view as self-defeating.</p>



<p>Financial stability does comprise one of the six facets of flourishing that VanderWeele and colleagues are measuring in their global study of the concept. But for him, that facet is no more important than the other facets, which include happiness, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and close social relationships.</p>



<p>“We do need to worry about structural conditions, financial means and trying to ensure opportunities for everyone to flourish and the means necessary for that.… [but] I don’t think those trump the other aspects of well-being,” says VanderWeele, who coauthored <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560322001128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rebuttal to the series</a> in the same issue of <em>SSM-Mental Health</em>.</p>



<p>Focusing too much on factors outside any one individual’s control, such as racism or poverty, VanderWeele says, can be disempowering. Focusing on smaller factors, such as crafting one’s job to their liking or getting more involved in one’s community by joining a religious group or volunteering, meanwhile, hands that power back to the people.</p>



<p>This is not a debate between equals, Willen counters. With so much momentum behind their movement, positive psychologists have captured the narrative. And their self-help view of how to flourish is becoming The View, she says.</p>



<p>After Adam Grant’s article appeared in the <em>Times, </em>Willen witnessed how concepts drawn from positive psychology — in this case languishing — take on a life of their own as they enter the public domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That bird’s-eye view arose thanks to the Pandemic Journaling Project — an initiative Willen and other researchers launched in May 2020 to enable people from all walks of life to document how they were coping with this historic moment. Through those journal entries, the scientists observed which people glommed onto the idea that they were languishing — and who did not. Tellingly, entrants who mentioned the term skewed overwhelmingly white, wealthy and educated — a limited cohort that also reflects the readership of the <em>Times</em>, Willen says.</p>



<p>Grant uses his own arguably privileged experience of the moment to make sweeping claims about how people were experiencing the crisis, Willen says. He then uses those claims to write about how all people can overcome the blahs.</p>



<p>Specifically, Grant recommends people find flow. “Flow is that elusive state of absorption in a meaningful challenge or a momentary bond, where your sense of time, place and self melts away,” he writes. Such flow can arise by binge-watching shows and movies on Netflix, playing word games and, more broadly, pursuing uninterrupted time for oneself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But just who has had the luxury to pursue such remedies for languishing, Willen asks. And who, struggling with precarity in work, health and other domains, has instead experienced something darker, something more akin to suffering?</p>



<p>Grant maintains that Willen is creating a “false dichotomy” between personal and systemic solutions to flourishing. Simpler behavioral interventions serve as crucial stopgap measures in challenging times, Grant adds. “It would be awfully cruel to tell readers suffering through a pandemic that they should just wait for social policies to change.”</p>



<p>But most people aren’t even aware of how individualized solutions to flourishing are overshadowing more systemic solutions, Willen says. Bringing that oversight to public attention is vital. “Unless we step back and ask ourselves whose voice is missing,” Willen says, “we risk internalizing a distorted account of history.”</p>



<p>Her words remind me of the adage: History is written by the victors. It’s a thought echoed on the Pandemic Journaling Project’s website. “Usually, history is written only by the powerful,” read the <a href="https://pandemic-journaling-project.chip.uconn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory words</a>.&nbsp;“When the history of COVID-19 is written,&nbsp;let&#8217;s make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen.” That’s certainly an admonition I’ll be keeping in mind this year as I strive for balance in my reporting on positive psychology, the pandemic and other societal issues.</p>

Even though its influence on quality of life is widely recognized, spiritual care has been the most neglected component of palliative care for a long time. However, in recent years, initiatives including progress at national levels have been established to promote the integration of this dimension of palliative care in research and clinical care. Growing evidence supports the importance of spiritual care at the end of life and its positive effects on patients’ quality of life have been reported across age groups and patient groups/medical conditions.</p>

<p>Lawyers who represented Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University in Columbus, in failed libel and defamation suits – and who later sued him for not paying his tab – have won a judgment for $1 million against the scientist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/croce-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, dated Dec. 8, 2022, orders Croce to pay just shy of $1.1 million plus interest to <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill + Ritter</a>, of Columbus, one of the firms that represented him in his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel lawsuit</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and his <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/04/litigious-osu-professor-loses-appeal-in-federal-defamation-case/">defamation case</a> against David Sanders, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., both of which he lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The firm <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">sued Croce in 2020</a>, seeking more than $920,000 in unpaid fees. After the case went to trial, a jury awarded the full amount to the firm in damages, and the judge ruled that the lawyers were entitled to prejudgment interest at a rate of 4%, totaling an additional $175,000. The judgment amount can continue accruing interest, and Croce is responsible for the court costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his post-trial <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decision.pdf">decision</a>, judge Richard A. Frye wrote:</p>



<span id="more-126371"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The most troublesome part of this story is Dr. Croce’s response when his legal fees began to fall into arrears. He testified at trial that he “always intended to pay” but concluded–and communicated to KBHR as the overdue account grew–that he was “illiquid.” The firm was told he would promptly sell some of his artwork [Editor’s note: He has <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/high-hopes-for-a-new-kind-of-gene-30445792/?page=4">quite a collection</a>.]. They allowed months to pass while they continued to work, recognizing that it can take some time in dealing with New York City (or perhaps worldwide) art dealers. Only after months passed did the firm give up the ghost and withdraw. During this period Dr. Croce and two others jointly won the 2018 scientific prize awarded in Israel noted above. With it came $1 million split three ways. [Editor’s note: <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/27/cancer-researcher-under-cloud-of-suspicion-wins-300000-science-prize/">Here’s the prize</a>.] After receiving his share Dr. Croce bought more art rather than paying down his fees account owed KBHR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This seriously undermines Dr. Croce’s credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After the judgment, the law firm tried to begin collecting the money by garnishing Croce’s bank accounts. (Croce earns more than <a href="https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/Home/Salaries?Firstname=carlo&amp;Lastname=croce&amp;Funding=University&amp;WhichSource=Salaries&amp;Year=0&amp;IsValid=True">$800,000 a year from OSU</a>.) On January 5, Croce filed an appeal of the judgment, as well as a motion to stay the execution of the judgment and dissolve the garnishment orders, which the judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/another-denial.pdf">denied</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another law firm – with whom Croce had used his house as collateral – has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">previously sued him </a>&nbsp;for not paying his bills, and that case appears to be ongoing. In addition to legal fees, Croce has also <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">racked up 14 retractions</a>, as well as many corrections and expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. Croce is exercising his right to appeal,” Croce’s current lawyer, Andrew Mills Holford of Johrendt &amp; Holford, told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maria M. Guthrie of Kegler Brown, who was representing the firm in its case against Croce, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders, who despite winning the suit Croce brought against him <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">was still damaged</a> by the legal battle, told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope that the lawyers receive that to which the law has deemed them entitled.</p>

<p>Polish police are investigating alleged plagiarism in a series of articles by a group of researchers at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>A university commission also is looking into the allegations, which one of the authors told Retraction Watch had &#8220;greatly damaged&#8221; his career. While plagiarism is not usually considered a crime, it can be prosecuted under national copyright laws <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org/blog/2017/10/27/is-plagiarism-illegal">in Poland and elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The alleged plagiarism was first discovered by a reviewer for <em>Postępy Mikrobiologii &#8211; Advancements of Microbiology</em>, a quarterly of the Polish Society of Microbiologists, said Radosław Stachowiak, who worked as the journal&#8217;s deputy editor-in-chief until the end of last year. </p>



<span id="more-126359"></span>



<p>The journal investigated, then announced in October that it was <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGnat%252c%2bSebastian">retracting five papers</a> that were largely identical or similar to articles published by other researchers. Ahead of the announcement it also notified Krzysztof Kowalczyk, president of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, who told Retraction Watch he shared the information with the police as well as a &#8220;special commission&#8221; that is now investigating the case.</p>



<p>Stachowiak said the journal is a &#8220;witness&#8221; in the case and added that he is &#8220;preparing some materials for the police department.&#8221; Whether criminal charges have been brought against the authors is unclear.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Dominik Łagowski, a research assistant at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin and a coauthor of four of the five papers, cited &#8220;false accusations, invented evidence and lack of any cooperation on the part of the journal.&#8221;&nbsp; Łagowski said the editors had retracted the articles &#8220;while accusing the authors of the crime of plagiarism.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately &#8211; information about these retractions is already in the Retraction Watch database,&#8221; added Lagowski, who recently completed his PhD at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. &#8220;And at that point, it greatly damaged my career as a scientist.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also referred to &#8220;the intentional denigration of the authors by the above-mentioned journal&#8221; and said he was &#8220;in a legal dispute with Advancements of Microbiology to clear my name.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All I can say is that there was no such intention,&#8221; Stachowiak, the former editor, told Retraction Watch, adding that &#8220;nobody is going to profit from such a situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Four of the five articles list Sebastian Gnat, a professor at the university, as first author; he is second author of the fifth. Gnat could not be reached by phone for comment. According to Kowalczyk, the university commission investigating the case also has had problems reaching Gnat.</p>

<p><strong>Molecular biology’s flower child </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/molecular-biologys-flower-child"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 6, 1973&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>During the past several years, some artificial genes have been synthesized…. But no one had unraveled a real gene that dictates the production of a protein. Now researchers … have done just that…. There is little doubt that sequencing of genes holds powerful ramifications for the advance of medical science.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>A new era of genetics research dawned when scientists reported that they had deciphered the building blocks of a gene belonging to a virus. (The gene itself looks flowerlike when folded up.) In the decades since, scientists have rendered genetic blueprints, or genomes, for entire organisms across the tree of life. </p>



<p>In 2001, the Human Genome Project released a rough draft of our collective genome. The master <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">blueprint was finally completed last year</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 6</em>). Access to the human genome has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">led to powerful medical advances</a>, including the development of targeted gene therapies and screenings for rare disorders (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 10</em>). In the future, people may routinely have their genomes sequenced to monitor health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supply-chains-3000-years-bronze-age-shipwreck">Complex supply chains may have appeared more than 3,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-distance supply chains, vulnerable to disruptions from wars and disease outbreaks, may have formed millennia before anyone today gasped at gas prices or gawked at empty store shelves.</p>



<p>Roughly 3,650 to 3,200 years ago, herders and villagers who mined tin ore fueled long-distance supply chains that transported the metal from Central Asia and southern Turkey to merchant ships serving societies clustered around the Mediterranean, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Remote communities located near rare tin deposits <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq3766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapped into an intense demand</a> among ancient urban civilizations for a metal that, along with copper, was needed to produce bronze, researchers report in the Dec. 2 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Tin access transformed herders and part-time cultivators into powerful partners of Late Bronze Age states and rulers, say archaeometallurgist Wayne Powell of Brooklyn College in New York City and colleagues. Until now, it has been difficult to demonstrate the existence of such an ancient, long-distance tin supply chain or its geographic origins.</p>



<p>Powell’s group builds their argument on previous archaeological evidence that mobile groups in Central Asia <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-herders-spread-farming-around-asia">spread crop cultivation across much of Asia</a> more than 4,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/2/14</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">pioneered popular clothes-making innovations</a> by 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>). Land routes used by those groups would have connected Central Asian tin ore sources to the Mediterranean, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Evidence of an ancient tin pipeline stretching more than 3,000 kilometers from mining sites in present-day Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to merchant ships carrying processed tin in the eastern Mediterranean is particularly striking, says anthropologist Michael Frachetti of Washington University in St. Louis.</p>



<p>“That complex tin network was an early version of modern-day supply chains for commodities such as gas and oil,” Frachetti says.</p>



<p>Writing on clay tablets from Bronze Age sites in what’s now Turkey and Iraq refers to tin arriving from far to the east as early as around 3,900 years ago. But precise sources for eastern tin have proved elusive.</p>



<p>An ancient shipwreck discovered in 1982 off Turkey’s coast enabled the new study. Known as the Uluburun shipwreck, the vessel dates to around 3,300 years ago and is one of the oldest known shipwrecks. Its cargo included one metric ton of tin. The metal had been cast into portable, distinctively shaped pieces called ingots.</p>



<p>Powell’s group documented chemical fingerprints of 105 tin ingots, nearly all of those found in the Uluburun shipwreck. Ingot IDs were based on distinct combinations of different forms, or isotopes, of tin, lead and trace elements in the ingots. Data on the isotopic profiles of tin ore deposits in different parts of Eurasia have become available over the last few years, allowing the researchers to match the ingots’ tin to deposits, Powell says.</p>

<p>Powell, Frachetti and colleagues traced the origins of about one-third of the Uluburun tin ingots to an ore deposit in Tajikistan and several others nearby in Uzbekistan. Previous excavations indicate that herding groups used stone hammers to mine tin from outcrops at those sites.</p>



<p>Most of the remaining shipwreck ingots were linked to small tin deposits in southeastern Turkey’s Taurus Mountains. Mountain communities controlled by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-backyard-pendulum-saw-sliced-bronze-age-mystery">ancient Hittite kingdom</a> probably collected tin from those deposits, Frachetti says (<em>SN: 5/1/18</em>). Until now, many researchers have assumed that Turkish tin sources were depleted by the Late Bronze Age.</p>





<p>Despite the new evidence, geographic origins of the Uluburun tin ingots remain unclear, says archaeometallurgist Daniel Berger of Curt-Engelhorn-Centre of Archaeometry in Mannheim, Germany. Berger, who studies Bronze Age tin sources with another research group, did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Tin ores typically contain low lead levels, but the shipwreck ingots display high levels. Lead was probably added, deliberately or via accidental contamination, to tin somewhere on its way to the Mediterranean, he suggests. If so, that potentially complicates the attempt by Powell’s group to combine tin and lead isotopes to identify tin sources.</p>



<p>Isotopic signatures of tin within the same ore deposits vary greatly, and overlap exists between different deposits, Berger says. So tin isotopes by themselves cannot definitively identify tin sources of the Uluburun ingots.</p>



<p>“Tracing the tin sources of the Bronze Age is and remains one of the most challenging problems in archaeology,” Berger says. Efforts to identify chemical and molecular properties of different Eurasian tin deposits are still in the early stages, he adds.</p>



<p>In February, Berger and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440322000012?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tin ingots from a Late Bronze Age shipwreck found off Israel’s coast</a> displayed an isotopic connection to tin deposits in southwestern England. Further research is also needed to confirm that finding, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fiber-optic-cable-laser-waveguide">Here’s how to make a fiber-optic cable out of air using a laser</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tubular laser beams can create what amount to <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/8707dK4dIb91a60bb6df4e56bdc44a53b2267be80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiber-optic cables made of thin air</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review X</em>.</p>



<p>Laser-heated air can efficiently transmit light signals without the need to lay fiber-optic cables. These air-based &#8220;waveguides&#8221; can also provide pathways for ultrahigh-energy lasers that don’t propagate well through air on their own, building on earlier efforts that have been touted as a route to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superfast-laser-pulses-could-pave-way-beam-weapons">laser beam weapons</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/14</em>).</p>





<p>The latest experiments, says physicist Howard Milchberg of the University of Maryland in College Park, beat out his team’s prior waveguide attempts by more than 60 times, extending the length of a waveguide to nearly 50 meters.</p>



<p>The researchers ran a laser in “doughnut mode,” where the beam has a hollowed-out core along its length, resembling a stack of luminous doughnuts. The beam creates a hot, tubular air layer wrapped around cooler, denser air. This creates something akin to a fiber-optic cable made of air: Instead of a transparent core covered in plastic cladding that guides light in conventional fiber optics, the dense air acts as the core, while the hot air around it serves as cladding.</p>



<p>Stepping up the waveguide length to kilometers, Milchberg says, is primarily a matter of boosting the doughnut-mode laser power. “The only issue is we don’t have a kilometer” to safely fire a laser that far, he says. It may take a deal with one of the U.S. national laboratories to find space to run a longer version of the experiment.</p>



<p>Despite the potential military applications, Milchberg says he and his team are focused more on scientific uses, such as extending the range of systems that reveal the chemical makeup of materials by firing lasers at them and measuring the light they give off. Air-based waveguides could send emitted light back to remotely located systems, instead of needing to get up close to analyze a sample.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-americas-olmec-maya-star-calendar">Lasers reveal sites used as the Americas’ oldest known star calendars</a></h4>

              
                <p>Olmec and Maya people living along Mexico’s Gulf Coast as early as 3,100 years ago built star-aligned ceremonial centers to track important days of a 260-day calendar, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-calendar-hieroglyph-date-oldest-evidence">oldest written evidence of this calendar</a>, found on painted plaster mural fragments from a Maya site in Guatemala, dates to between 300 and 200 B.C., nearly a millennium later (<em>SN: 4/13/22</em>). But researchers have long suspected that a 260-day calendar developed hundreds of years earlier among Gulf Coast Olmec groups.</p>





<p>Now, an airborne laser-mapping technique called light detection and ranging, or lidar, has revealed <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq7675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astronomical orientations of 415 ceremonial complexes</a> dating to between about 1100 B.C. and A.D. 250, say archaeologist Ivan Šprajc and colleagues. Most ritual centers were aligned on an east-to-west axis, corresponding to sunrises or other celestial events on specific days of a 260-day year, the scientists report January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The finding points to the earliest evidence in the Americas of a formal calendar system that combined astronomical knowledge with earthly constructions. This system used celestial events to identify important dates during a 260-day portion of a full year.</p>



<p>“The 260-day cycle materialized in Mesoamerica’s earliest known monumental complexes [and was used] for scheduling seasonal, subsistence-related ceremonies,” says Šprajc, of the Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana. “We cannot be certain exactly when and where it was invented.”</p>



<p>Some of the oldest ceremonial centers identified by lidar clearly belong to the Olmec culture, but others are hard to classify, says archaeologist Stephen Houston of Brown University in Providence, R.I., who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Olmec society dates from around 3,500 to 2,400 years ago. Links between the Olmec and later Maya culture, known best for Classic-era cities and kingdoms that flourished between roughly 1,750 and 1,100 years ago, are unclear. But Classic Maya inscriptions and documents also reference the 260-day calendar.</p>



<p>Mobile groups in Mesoamerica, an ancient cultural region that extended from central Mexico to Central America, may have scheduled large, seasonal gatherings using the 260-day calendar long before it gained favor among Classic Maya kings, Šprajc and colleagues suggest. The same calendar may also have marked days of important agricultural activities or rituals as maize cultivation spread in Mesoamerica starting around 3,000 years ago, they add. Some Maya communities still use a 260-day calendar to organize maize cultivation and schedule agricultural rituals.</p>



<p>Previous lidar data indicated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-blueprint-olmec-maya-ceremonial-archaeology">ceremonial centers based on a common blueprint appeared at many Olmec and Maya sites</a> along Mexico’s Gulf Coast by about 3,400 years ago (<em>SN: 10/25/21</em>). Only now has the calendrical significance of ceremonial centers’ alignments become apparent.</p>





<p>The most common architectural alignment detected in the new study corresponded to the position of sunrises on February 11 and October 29 when complexes were in use, separated by 260 days. These complexes faced east toward a point on the horizon where the sun rose on those two days.</p>



<p>Another frequent orientation matched sunrises separated by 130 days, or half of the 260-day count.</p>



<p>A minority of ceremonial complexes were aligned with dates of solstices (longest and shortest days of the year), quarter days (the midpoint of each half of the year) or lunar cycles in the 260-day year. Other centers tracked the position of Venus, a star associated with the rainy season and maize farming.</p>



<p>Sunrises or sunsets recorded at ceremonial centers were typically separated by multiples of 13 or 20 days. Aside from representing basic mathematical units of a 260-day year, the numbers 13 and 20 have long been associated with various gods and sacred concepts among Maya people and other Mesoamerican groups, Šprajc says.</p>



<p>Future excavations at lidar-detected ceremonial complexes can investigate whether ancient groups formally dedicated certain structures to specific days in the 260-day year, Houston says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubbles-icicles-water-contamination-air">Tiny bubbles that make icicles hazy are filled with water, not air</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny drops of dirty water, often mistaken for air bubbles, tell the tale of rippling icicle growth.</p>



<p>Icicles made of pure water are smooth. But salt or other impurities make icicles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ripple-effect">develop ripples</a> as they hang from branches, bridges and power lines (<em>SN: 11/24/13</em>). Impurities are also responsible for the hazy appearance of icicles that has typically been attributed to air bubbles. Those bubbles are actually <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.054211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minute dollops of contaminated water</a>, researchers report in the November <em>Physical Review E</em>.</p>



<p>While examining 3-millimeter-thick cross sections of icicles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicle-turns">grown in the lab</a>, University of Toronto physicists Stephen Morris and John Ladan uncovered pockets of impure, liquid water surrounded by relatively pure ice (<em>SN: 8/13/10</em>). “It turns out that there are very few air bubbles in an icicle,” Morris says. He calls the water pockets “inclusions” to distinguish them from air bubbles.</p>

<p>What’s more, “the inclusions record the history of the growth of the ripples. It’s like the rings in a tree,” Morris says. Inclusions form in layers near the surface of an icicle, with older layers covered by younger ones as an icicle grows. “You can deduce something about the history of the growth by looking at the pattern of inclusions.”</p>



<p>To track icicle formation, the researchers mixed fluorescent dye into water in place of other types of impurities and used the water to grow icicles in the lab. The dye ended up concentrating at higher levels in liquid inclusions in the icicles, just as any other contaminant would. It also glowed brightly under ultraviolet light, which made the inclusion layers easier to see.</p>



<p>By varying the dye concentration in the water, the researchers showed one way that impurities affect the patterns of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicle-waves-go-flow">icicle ripples</a> (<em>SN: 10/10/02</em>). All it took was contamination comparable to that in tap water, Morris says, “before they change their shape from smooth to ripply.”</p>



<p>The underlying reasons that contaminants lead to ripples aren’t yet clear. As an experimentalist, Morris says, that’s a puzzle he’ll leave to theorists.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbes-give-cheeses-flavor-bacteria">Meet some of the microbes that give cheeses flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cheese making has been around for thousands of years, and there are now more than 1,000 varieties of cheese worldwide. But what exactly makes some cheeses like Parmesan taste fruity and others, such as Brie and Camembert, taste musty has remained a bit of a mystery. Now, scientists have pinned down the specific types of <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02894-22?_ga=2.72158995.1824052991.1668439872-336013472.1642513742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bacteria that produce these flavor compounds</a>.</p>



<p>The findings, described November 10 in <em>Microbiology Spectrum</em>, could help cheese makers more precisely tweak cheese flavor profiles to better match consumer preferences, say food microbiologist Morio Ishikawa and colleagues.</p>





<p>A cheese’s flavor depends on more than the type of milk and starter bacteria used to make the fermented dairy delight. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/studying-cheese-reveals-how-microbes-interact">constellation of organisms</a> that move in during the cheese-ripening process also contributes to the flavor (<em>SN: 5/14/16</em>).</p>



<p>Ishikawa, of the Tokyo University of Agriculture, likens these nonstarter bacteria to an orchestra. “We can perceive the tones played by the orchestra of cheese as a harmony, but we do not know what instruments each of them is responsible for.”</p>



<p>Previous research by Ishikawa and colleagues used genetic analysis, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to link specific flavor molecules with specific types of bacteria on surface mold–ripened cheeses made from pasteurized and raw cow milk in Japan and France.</p>



<p>In the new study, to show that each bacterial suspect was responsible for producing the flavor compound it had been linked to, the team unleashed each type of microbe onto its own unripe cheese sample. The researchers then observed how flavor compounds in the cheese changed over 21 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, <em>Pseudoalteromonas — </em>a genus of marine bacteria found in various cheeses — produced the greatest number of flavor compounds. And the microbes produced esters, ketones and sulfur compounds, known to impart fruity, moldy and oniony flavors in cheese.</p>



<p>Besides helping perfect popular cheeses, Ishikawa says, the findings might help cheese makers conduct new orchestras that would play new harmonies.</p>

<p>Are academic writing centers agents of US hegemony, spreading the evils of colonialism as they work to topple rogue syntax and rehabilitate failing grammatical states?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So argued a pair of authors in Canada in a now-retracted 2022 article which claimed that such centers have been used as “neocolonial tools” to push American foreign policy goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to critics, that claim –&nbsp; which seems like it might have emerged from a cross between Don DeLillo’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/books/white-noise-by-don-delillo.html">White Noise</a>” and Graham Greene’s, well, lots of his books – suffered from a fatal flaw or two, as we’ll shortly see.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126337"></span>



<p>“Writing Centers and Neocolonialism: How Writing Centers Are Being Commodified and Exported as U.S. Neocolonial Tools” appeared last November in the <em>Writing Center Journal</em> – a publication of Purdue University – and was written by Brian Hotson, of <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Hotson%22%20author_fname%3A%22Brian%22&amp;start=0&amp;context=119483">Dalhousie University</a>, in Nova Scotia, and Stevie Bell, of York University, in Toronto.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Writing-Centers-and-Neocolonialism%3A-How-Writing-Are-Hotson-Bell/110380051fdac2d535d3f339463f520625b8455c">abstract of the article</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In this paper, we explore the complicity of Western writing centers in global neocolonialism despite its resounding rejection within Western writing center scholarship, in which Romeo García contends that writing tutors can be “decolonial agents.” We show that higher education is used by Western governments as a neocolonial tool and situate international U.S. writing center initiatives within this context. Writing centers have remained complicit in global neocolonialism involving the commodification and exportation of American English as well as Western-style institutions, curricula, and pedagogies. This is most explicit in recent writing center initiatives undertaken by the U.S. Department of State in South America, Eastern Europe, and Central and Southeast Asia. Our analysis of the IWCA and the global community of writing center organizations reveals that few institutions in the field are well positioned to address this important issue. Indeed, the IWCA has remained silent on the complicity of Western writing centers in neocolonialism despite the resounding rejection of neocolonialism within the writing center community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the journal has now issued the following <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/wcj/vol40/iss2/4/">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors of the Writing Center Journal and Purdue University Press, publisher of WCJ, are retracting the following article:</p>



<p>Hotson, Brian, and Bell, Stevie. (2022). &#8220;Writing Centers and Neocolonialism: How Writing Centers Are Being Commodified and Exported as U.S. Neocolonial Tools.&#8221; Writing Center Journal, vol. 40, no. 2, article 4. <a href="https://doi.org/10.7771/2832-9414.1020">https://doi.org/10.7771/2832-9414.1020</a>.</p>



<p>This article contains two significant factual errors that the authors have agreed to correct. The Writing Center Journal is committed to the highest standards of publication ethics and has accepted the request of Dr. Ron Martinez and colleagues from the Universidade Federal do Paraná and the article’s authors to retract the piece until a revision can be posted. The journal will also create a space for published rebuttal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The nature of those errors is unstated. However, we received a tip about the article on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAsw4i5J8M7sOQ9GiG0_dglkim9gdPPba92yZRLfCq4u-o7w/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">database submission form</a>, which claimed:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors were obliged to acknowledge major factual errors in the article, which included baseless claims that the US Department of State were responsible for &#8220;exporting&#8221; writing program initiatives to Brazil and Russia in a &#8220;neocolonial&#8221; fashion when, in fact, those initiatives were created by scholars in those countries. With those false claims refuted, the article lost much of its validity and the editors felt compelled to retract.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bell initially told us that the article would be republished “with one minor correction” but acknowledged a second, “interrelated” problem. She did not immediately respond to our request for elaboration on the mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.drronmartinez.com/about.html">Martinez</a> confirmed the details in the tip, which he and several colleagues left, we received and told us the matter has “caused many people a great deal of stress” – one of those people being himself. Among his lengthy list of beefs with the article, as he wrote to the journal in a December 12 email, was its allegation that the:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“writing center Centro de Assessoria de Publicação Acadêmica (CAPA) at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) in Curitiba, Brazil, as well as the organization Writing Centers of Brazil (WCB) were created and are currently directed by the Department of State.” <strong>This is false. </strong>The CAPA writing center<a href="https://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/noticias/professor-da-ufpr-lanca-primeiro-centro-de-escrita-academica-do-brasil/"> was created by Dr. Ron Martinez as a professor of UFPR</a>, initially directed by him and vice director Eduardo Figueiredo (also of UFPR), completely independently of any government involvement (US or Brazilian). The center was opened in October of 2016 within the School of Humanities of UFPR, without any influence by the Department of State whatsoever, and never directed by anyone outside of UFPR. There is no source of information anywhere, including the bibliographic and media sources cited by the authors, in which CAPA is said to have been &#8220;created&#8221; or &#8220;directed&#8221; by the Department of State. Indeed, there is a notable lack of rigor with which basic facts —facts essential to the article’s entire thesis— were checked by the authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the end, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the mischaracterizations and prevarications presented here are serious. Under normal circumstances, it would behoove us to simply write a rebuttal to the article. However, there is no point in debating when the basic facts are unquestionably wrong, and can be proved to be so. In their own words, the authors of the article posit that writing centers are being “commodified” and “exported” by the US government —their central thesis. However, the data on which they base that assertion largely rests on the precarious examples provided from Brazil, especially. It has been established in this letter that CAPA did not originate in the US and therefore could not have been “exported.” Likewise, the Russian NWCC was created in Russia, by Russians, for Russians. These are verifiable facts that would have been easily discoverable by the authors. Indeed, all of the Brazilian initiatives mentioned in the article emerged endogenously in Brazil. Throughout —but especially in pages 55-57— most of the examples the authors provide to support their thesis are either outright falsehoods or, at best, half-truths. In that light, the entire thesis of their article is undermined. <strong>It means that readers of Writing Center Journal are being persuaded to sympathize with a position based on spurious information.&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martinez told us:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the errors were quite obvious, and that is not even counting the selective omissions of facts. I do believe the editors could have easily caught the issues in advance; what the editor wrote was as follows:</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When authors submit to the WCJ, they certify to the veracity of their facts because the journal is a completely voluntary staff without labor to provide such review in its own right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In other words, they allege that they did not have the &#8220;bandwidth&#8221; to have caught the falsehoods and simply relied on the integrity of the authors. However, I believe that the nature of the content of the article —which bordered on personal attack— should have compelled the editors to proceed with more caution to avoid possible libel exposure. In this case, it was not only myself and the organization that I created that was maligned, but also organizations in Russia and, especially, the US Department of State. In all cases, the evidence the authors presented in the article was based on errors and half-truths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martinez did commend the editors for acting promptly in the case, but he expressed concern that the posting of a corrected version of that paper might obscure the fact that the original had been retracted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If the authors want to submit a new article, it should be considered a new submission and not a &#8220;correction&#8221; &#8212; the errors the original article contained were far too egregious for a corrigendum.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-created-amazon-dark-earth">Indigenous people may have created the Amazon’s ‘dark earth’ on purpose</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — Indigenous people in the Amazon may have been deliberately creating fertile soil for farming for thousands of years.</p>



<p>At archaeological sites across the Amazon River basin, mysterious patches of unusually fertile soil dot the landscape. Scientists have long debated the origin of this “dark earth,” which is darker in color than surrounding soils and richer in carbon.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have shown that indigenous Kuikuro people in southeastern Brazil <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1188579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentionally create similar soil around their villages</a>. The finding, presented December 16 at the American Geophysical Union meeting, adds evidence to the idea that long-ago Amazonians deliberately manufactured such soil too.</p>





<p>The fact that Kuikuro people make dark earth today is a “pretty strong argument” that people were also making it in the past, says Paul Baker, a geochemist at Duke University who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>In doing so, these early inhabitants may have inadvertently stored massive quantities of carbon in the soil, says study presenter Taylor Perron, an earth scientist at MIT. The technique, he says, could provide a blueprint for developing methods of sustainably locking atmospheric carbon in tropical soils, helping fight climate change.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Indigenous people have altered the Amazon for thousands of years</h4>



<p>The Western world has long viewed the Amazon as a vast wilderness that was relatively untouched before Europeans showed up. At the center of this argument is the idea that the Amazon’s soil, which is poor in nutrients like other tropical soils, precluded its inhabitants from developing agriculture at a scale required to support complex societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a slew of archeological finds in recent decades — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia">the discovery of ancient urban centers in Amazonian areas of modern-day Bolivia</a> — has revealed that people were actively shaping the Amazon for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans (<em>SN: 5/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Most scientists today agree that the presence of dark earth near archaeological sites means that long-ago Amazonians used this soil to grow crops. But while some archaeologists argue that people purposely made the soil, others contend that dark earth was laid down through geologic processes.</p>





<p>Perron and colleagues reviewed interviews of Kuikuro people conducted by a Kuikuro filmmaker in 2018. Those conversations revealed that Kuikuro villagers actively make dark earth — <em>eegepe</em> in Kuikuro — using ash, food scraps and controlled burns.</p>



<p>“When you plant where there is no eegepe, the soil is weak,” explained elder Kanu Kuikuro in one of the interviews. “That is why we throw the ash, manioc peelings and manioc pulp.”</p>



<p>The researchers collected soil samples from around Kuikuro villages and archaeological sites in Brazil’s Xingu River basin. The team found “striking similarities” between dark earth samples from ancient and modern sites, Perron says. Both were far less acidic than surrounding soils — probably thanks to the neutralizing effect of ash — and contained higher levels of plant-friendly nutrients.</p>

<h4>Dark earth could store a lot of carbon in the Amazon</h4>



<p>These analyses also revealed that dark earth holds twice the amount of carbon as surrounding soils on average. Infrared scans of the Xingu region suggest that the area is pockmarked with dark earth, and that as much as roughly 9 megatons of carbon — the annual carbon emissions of a small, industrialized country — may have gone unaccounted in the area, the researchers reported at the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This number, while preliminary, could inflate to roughly the annual carbon emissions of the United States when all dark earth across the Amazon is taken into consideration, Perron says.</p>



<p>Figuring out how much carbon is actually stored in the Amazon could help improve climate simulations. But the researchers’ estimates are a “huge extrapolation from a very small dataset,” Baker cautions — a sentiment echoed by Perron.</p>



<p>Pinning down the true value of carbon stored in the Amazon’s dark earth will require more data, says Antoinette WinklerPrins, a geographer at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the study. Still, the research has “profound implications of the past and future” of the Amazon, she says.</p>



<p>For one thing, the technique highlights how ancient people were able to thrive in the Amazon by developing sustainable farming that doubled as a carbon-sequestration technique. With more and more greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere, making dark earth — or something like it — could be a method of mitigating climate change while supporting agriculture in the tropics.</p>



<p>“People in the ancient past figured out a way to store lots of carbon for hundreds or even thousands of years,” Perron says. “Maybe we can learn something from that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-beans-strategy-shade-moth">Jumping beans’ random strategy always leads to shade — eventually</a></h4>

              
                <p>Given enough time, jumping beans will always find their way out of the sun.</p>



<p>Jumping beans, which are really seed pods with twitchy moth larvae inside, hop around in a way that — if they live long enough — is <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/accepted/91078Rc6Gf214f2471c06a70cd26a2926ce89101e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guaranteed to eventually land them in the shade</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in January in <em>Physical Review E</em>.</p>



<p>When a jumping bean finds itself in a sunny spot where it might overheat and die, the moth larva will twitch to make the bean jump a short distance. “If I’m a bean and I exist outside of the shade,” says physicist Pasha Tabatabai of Seattle University, “all I want to know is what’s the eventual probability of finding shade?”</p>





<p>To determine how the creatures approach the problem, Tabatabai and Devon McKee — now a computer scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz — tracked the jumps of beans placed on a warm surface. They discovered that each jump was in a random direction, with no correlation to the previous jumps. Mathematicians call this way of moving around a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/winning-winding-random-walk">random walk</a> (<em>SN: 3/15/06</em>).</p>



<p>While a random walk isn’t a quick way to travel, Tabatabai says, a creature using it to move on a surface, like the ground near a tree, will theoretically visit every place on the surface eventually. That means a random walking bean will always end up in the shade if it keeps it up long enough.</p>



<p>Picking a direction and repeatedly going that way would cover distance faster. “You’re certainly going to find shade fastest,” Tabatabai says — assuming you’re headed the right way. “But it’s also very likely that you’ll pick the wrong direction and never find shade.”</p>



<p>Random walks are slow, and many jumping beans don’t survive to find shade in real life. But, Tabatabai says, the strategy minimizes the odds that they will never escape the sun.</p>

<p>Medicare records from 2007 through 2016 show that the fungi have spread, causing infection rates above a certain threshold in 47 states and Washington, D.C.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>These fungi are now “a lot more common than we think they are,” says Andrej Spec, an infectious diseases doctor and mycologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p>





<p>Doctors using maps from the 1950s and ’60s may fail to diagnose infections in patients who live outside of the fungi’s historical borders. Such missed or delayed diagnoses can have deadly consequences.</p>



<p>Spec and colleagues drew updated maps for <em>Histoplasma</em> cases and for two other fungi whose ranges have expanded, probably because of climate change.</p>



<p>Coccidioidomycosis cases, caused by <em>Coccidioides</em> fungi, have spread from their 1955 roots in the Southwest to 35 states, Medicare records indicate. <em>Coccidioides</em> includes fungi that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">cause valley fever</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-microbes-air-health-risk-bacteria-fungi">Wildfires have been linked</a> to a rise in valley fever cases in recent years (<em>SN: 4/13/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When diagnosing infections, doctors are taught to look for horses, not zebras, meaning tests typically focus on common infectious organisms, not rare ones, Spec says. “We’ve talked about these [fungi] as zebras … but they’re not zebras. They’re Clydesdales. Clydesdales aren’t the most common horse you’ll see, but they’re still horses.”</p>



<p>He hopes the updated maps encourage doctors to test for the fungi more often in patients with lung infections.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541600713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Voice in the Wilderness</a><br><em>Joseph L. Graves Jr.<br>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>It’s both good and bad that the first Black American to earn a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology is not a long-ago hidden figure but a contemporary scientist. On the upside, there’s no agonizing over papers no one saved, no stitching together other people’s memoirs to guess what pioneering might have felt like. Instead, Joseph L. Graves Jr., who finished his degree in 1988, tells his story himself in <em>A Voice in the Wilderness</em>.</p>





<p>But evolutionary biology’s first Black Ph.D. in 1988? That “first” came late even considering that the field took a while to declare itself a specialty. The Society for the Study of Evolution didn’t form until 1946.</p>



<p>Long before that, U.S. Black biologists had started cracking the glass ceiling of academic credentials. Graves credits Alfred O. Coffin as the first Black American to earn a biological Ph.D., awarded in 1889. He began a slow, intermittent series of Black Ph.D. biologists, who also struggled to get jobs befitting their credentials. Even now, while nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population is Black, Black scientists make up only about 3 percent of the resident Ph.D.s working in a biological discipline.</p>



<p>Showing how racism narrows the gateways to science becomes a major theme in<em> A Voice in the Wilderness</em> as Graves describes his own twisty, bruising path to becoming a “first.” Yet he declares that the book isn’t an autobiography but a call to embrace evolutionary science as crucial to the times we live in. <em>Voice</em> feels like a long, candid, free-flowing conversation. Graves mixes in bitter and sweet childhood memories, the lab challenges of coaxing insects to fly in place, quick math and science explainers, enthusiastic accounts of the scientific questions that drew him to the field, vignettes from his political activism, his alienation from and return to Christianity, some <em>Star Trek</em>…</p>



<p>Graves has already published on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12052-019-0110-5?fbclid=IwAR1vjZReAkzSLY8bEdcSGUJImAF5xUy9xUmlU7VXutr4f3cJhuKBsHzgmJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why Black evolutionary biologists are rare</a>, lamenting the longtime lack of an inclusive culture and the few, often barely visible, role models. Also, evolutionary biology has baggage. He described in his 2001 book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-emperor-s-new-clothes-biological-theories-of-race-at-the-millennium-joseph-l-graves-jr/12292320?ean=9780813533025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Emperor’s New Clothes</em></a>, a long whack-a-mole history of serial racist pseudoscience. Polygeny, for instance, a popular 19th century delusion, held that races had independent origins and were separate species. In the 20th century, the selective breeding notions of eugenics supposedly justified forced sterilizations and exterminations to purge unwanted traits as if people were livestock. Misuse of science continues, though Graves highlights a few heroes who have summoned science to fight the perversions.</p>

<h4>First Black U.S. Ph.D.s in their fields</h4>



<p>Black talent in the United States long contributed to science without Ph.D.s, but breaking through the barriers to earn the formal credentials was also a major achievement. Alfred O. Coffin is credited as the first Ph.D. biologist, earning his degree in 1889. Here are examples of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2962707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other pioneering Black Ph.D.s (from a 1997 accounting</a>). New scholarship may unearth even earlier pioneers but being second or third was still hard work.</p>



<p>1876: Physicist Edward Alexander Bouchet</p>



<p>1907: Entomologist Charles Henry Turner</p>



<p>1915: Physiologist Julian Herman Lewis</p>



<p>1916: Chemist St. Elmo Brady</p>



<p>1921: Botanist Thomas Wyatt Turner</p>



<p>1925: Mathematician Elbert Frank Cox</p>



<p>1930: Anatomist Roscoe Lewis McKinney</p>



<p>1942: Geologist Marguerite Thomas Williams</p>

<p>Graves’ own path was not easy. His parents were born in 1920s Virginia. His grandfather started the migration north after a tip that the Ku Klux Klan was about to target him. His moonshine was getting too competitive with white suppliers’.</p>



<p>“Both my parents grew up under the constant threat of the lynch rope should they in any way sass a white person,” Graves writes. He was born in New Jersey in 1955. “Four months after I was born, young Emmett Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi, for supposedly doing just that.”</p>



<p>Graves attended largely white-majority schools that didn’t see his potential. His mother, Helen, was the advocate who won him his education. For instance, she fought back when his elementary school pushed to move him into “special education.” Then in third grade, eye tests revealed that what he really needed were glasses. New possibilities dawned.</p>



<p>Another critical boost came from a student teacher who noticed that the library books he read were more complicated than his classmates’ reading. At the age of 13, for instance, he was fascinated by Charles Darwin’s <em>On the</em> <em>Origin of Species</em> and wowed by Karl Marx’s <em>Manifesto.</em><em></em></p>



<p>At another turning point, he convinced some kids playing chess to let him have a try. He lost badly but found two chess books in the library that he devoured that night. “In hindsight, I credit chess with being the most important factor changing the trajectory of my life,” he writes. He played on the school team and made lifelong friends.</p>



<p>His path through higher education got complicated. He went to Oberlin College in Ohio because its recruiting brochures had pictures of students who looked like him. There were still some tough spots. He and many other students struggled with freshman physics. Yet, as far as he could tell, he and the class’s other Black student were the only ones to get their final exams back marked, “You have no talent for physics, you should never take another physics class at this college.” Graves avoided physics, but the other student went on to earn a physics Ph.D. at MIT.</p>



<p>While studying parasites for his master’s degree, Graves discovered that his ability to spot weaknesses in current knowledge, which led him to overthink exam answers in his earlier school days, became a strength in research.</p>



<p>For his Ph.D., at first he wanted to go to Harvard University despite his experiences on campus visits. He recalls “European American students coming back and locking their offices or removing valuables from sight when I walked through the common area.”</p>



<p>The National Science Foundation awarded him a fellowship in 1979, not just honoring his talent but offering schools the catnip of full funding for his tuition and support. “I suspect I am the only person in the history of the [fellowship] to be rejected for admission to a graduate program in the same year the award was made,” he writes. Harvard informed him that he was qualified but that no one could be found to advise him.</p>



<p>So he happily plunged into the intellectual fizz of the University of Michigan. Yet passionate political activism eventually pulled him away. He organized efforts to stop Klan threats against Black Americans moving into Detroit suburbs. He went to the United Kingdom to stand arm in arm with the wives of striking miners as police charged them.</p>

<h4>First Black U.S. faculty hires</h4>



<p>Even after Black Americans began earning Ph.D.s , finding a faculty position at highly ranked, white-majority universities was just about impossible for decades. Harvard University’s dental school, one of the rare white-majority dental schools to take Black students, hired one of its own graduates, George F. Grant, in 1870. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25073834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A survey published in 2007</a>, however, didn’t find other examples of openly Black teaching faculty scholars at high-profile, white-majority schools — in any academic discipline — until 72 years later. Here’s a sampling of when a few select schools hired their first Black faculty.</p>



<p>1870: George F. Grant &#8211; Harvard University</p>



<p>1942: W. Allison Davis &#8211; University of Chicago</p>



<p>1952: Joseph T. Gier &#8211; University of California, Berkeley</p>



<p>1953: William F. Strother &#8211; Princeton University</p>



<p>1956: Joseph R. Applegate &#8211; MIT</p>



<p>1962: Michael G. Cooke &#8211; Yale University</p>



<p>1970: James Lowell Gibbs Jr.&nbsp;&#8211; Stanford University</p>

<p>Graves returned to academics and finished his Ph.D. in 1988 at Wayne State University in Detroit. His career took off as he worked on the evolutionary genetics of aging, and in 1994 he was elected a fellow&nbsp;of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Today, he’s a professor at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, a historically Black school.</p>



<p>In keeping with his activist past, Graves uses his evolutionary expertise to fight racism that claims a basis in science and to advocate for a culture that values scientific reasoning. The book’s title comes from the biblical phrase, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’” It has become a metaphor, Graves says, “for any perspective of great importance and truth that has been silenced to maintain the status quo.” He is far from silenced.</p>

<p>The president of an Iranian university and a colleague appear to have published the same microelectronics paper twice, according to allegations seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The articles, by <a href="https://nit.ac.ir/en/page/738/presidential-office">Bahram Azizollah Ganji</a> and Kamran Delfan Hemmati of Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, deal with the design of a new capacitive accelerometer with a high dynamic range and sensitivity. Both appeared online in 2020, <a href="http://www.midem-drustvo.si/Journal%20papers/MIDEM_50(2020)1p55.pdf">first</a> in the Slovenia-based <em>Journal of Microelectronics, Electronic Components and Materials</em> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00542-020-04932-4">later</a> in the higher-impact Springer journal <em>Microsystem Technologies</em>. The former version has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, while the latter has been cited twice.</p>



<p>The editors of <em>Microsystem Technologies</em> were made aware of the allegations on November 16 in an email that cited &#8220;significantly identical content&#8221; in the two papers. &#8220;Pretty much the entire introduction section and almost all figures are an exact copy from&#8221; the authors&#8217; previous article, the email stated.</p>



<span id="more-126333"></span>



<p>In a response shared with Retraction Watch, a Springer publishing assistant wrote on November 24:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I heard back from the Editors in Chief and they are all in agreement that this is a serious breach of ethical standards and violates copyrights laws. I am in contact with our Research Integrity Group daily and we are working to get this manuscript withdrawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <em>Microsystem Technologies</em> article has not been retracted as of this writing.</p>



<p>The allegations first surfaced publicly in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/international-community-of-iranian-academics_evidence-of-plagiarism-in-the-work-of-bahram-activity-7002089110836326401-JSrs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">LinkedIn post</a> from November by the International Community of Iranian Academics. The post included pictures highlighting identical passages and figures in the two articles, prefacing them with the text, &#8220;Evidence of plagiarism in the work of Bahram Azizollah Ganji, current president of Babol Noshirvani University of Technology and one of the prominent faces of oppression in the Islamic Republic’s higher education.&#8221;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has called the university and contacted both authors by email, but has not been able to reach them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/get-messages-sent-through-wormhole-relativity">We could get messages back from spacecraft sent through a wormhole</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you ever happen to fall through a wormhole in space, you won’t be coming back. It will snap shut behind you. But <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.104054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you may have just enough time to send a message</a> to the rest of us from the other side, researchers report in the Nov. 15 <em>Physical Review D</em>.</p>



<p>No one has yet seen a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-circling-wormhole-weird-gravitational-waves">wormhole</a>, but theoretically they could provide shortcuts to distant parts of the universe, or to other universes entirely, if they exist (<em>SN: 7/27/17</em>).&nbsp;Physicists have long known that one of the most commonly studied types of wormholes would be extremely unstable and would collapse if any matter entered it. It wasn’t clear, though, just how fast that might happen or what it means for something, or someone, heading into it.</p>





<p>Now, a new computer program shows how one type of wormhole would respond when something travels through it.</p>



<p>“You build a probe and you send it through” in the wormhole simulation, says Ben Kain, a physicist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. “You’re not necessarily trying to get it to come back, because you know the wormhole is going to collapse — but could a light signal get back in time before a collapse? And we found that it is possible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior studies of wormholes have concluded that the cosmic passageways could potentially stay open for repeated trips back and forth, Kain says, provided they’re supported by a form of matter that’s so exotic it’s called “ghost matter.” </p>



<p>Theoretically, ghost matter responds to gravity in exactly the opposite way to normal matter. That is, a ghost matter apple would fall up from a tree branch instead of down. While allowed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, ghost matter almost certainly doesn’t exist in reality, Kain says (<em>SN: 2/3/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Kain simulated ghost matter traveling through a wormhole and found that it caused the hole to expand as expected, rather than collapsing.</p>



<p>It was a different story with anything made of normal matter; that would trigger a collapse that pinches the hole closed and leaves something resembling a black hole behind, Kain’s simulation confirmed. But it would happen slowly enough for a fast-moving probe to transmit light-speed signals back to our side just before the wormhole completely closes.</p>



<p>Kain doesn’t imagine ever sending humans through a wormhole, if such things are ever found. “Just the capsule and a video camera. It’s all automated,” he says. It’ll be a one-way trip, “but we can at least get some video seeing what this device sees.”</p>





<p>The idea should be approached with a fair bit of skepticism, says physicist Sabine Hossenfelder of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. “[It] requires one to postulate the existence of [things] that for all we know do not exist…. Lots of things you can do mathematically have nothing to do with reality.”</p>



<p>Still, Kain says, it’s a valuable effort that might reveal ways to make wormholes that don’t rely on ghost matter to stay open long enough for us to travel back and forth throughout the universe or beyond.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-prematurely-aged-teens-brains">Brain scans suggest the pandemic prematurely aged teens’ brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Living through the COVID-19 pandemic may have matured teens’ brains beyond their years.</p>



<p>From online schooling and social isolation to economic hardship and a mounting death count, the last few years have been rough on young people. For teens, the pandemic and its many side effects came during a crucial window in brain development.</p>



<p>Now, a small study comparing brain scans of young people from before and after 2020 reveals that <a href="https://www.bpsgos.org/article/S2667-1743(22)00142-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the brains of teens who lived through the pandemic look about three years older than expected</a>, scientists say.</p>





<p>This research, published December 1 in <em>Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science</em>, is the first to look at the impact of the pandemic on brain aging.</p>



<p>The finding reveals that “the pandemic hasn’t been bad just in terms of mental health for adolescents,” says Ian Gotlib, a clinical neuroscientist at Stanford University. “It seems to have altered their brains as well.”</p>



<p>The study can’t link those brain changes to poor mental health during the pandemic. But “we know there is a relationship between adversity and the brain as it tries to adapt to what it’s been given,” says Beatriz Luna, a developmental cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, who wasn’t involved in the research. “I think this is a very important study that sets the ball rolling for us to look at this.”</p>



<p>The roots of this study date back to nearly a decade ago, when Gotlib and his colleagues launched a project in California’s Bay Area to study depression in adolescents. The researchers were collecting information on the mental health of the kids in the study, and did MRI scans of their brains.</p>



<p>Lockdown orders in the spring of 2020 forced the researchers to stop the project. When they restarted a year later, Gotlib worried that stress from the pandemic threatened to skew their results.</p>



<p>It turned out that the kids making their way back to the study after a year of pandemic life were reporting higher rates of anxiety and depression than their peers from before 2020. So, the team decided to compare brain scans captured before the start of the pandemic with scans taken between October 2020 and March 2022. </p>





<p>The researchers looked at differences in 64 scans from each group, matched by the kids’ sex and age, with an average age of around 16 for each group.</p>



<p>The results were “striking,” Gotlib says.</p>



<p>Adolescent brains naturally go through a maturation process that results in the thickening of the hippocampus, an area involved with memory and concentration, and the amygdala, which regulates emotional processing. At the same time, the cortex — an area that regulates emotional functioning — starts thinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain scans revealed that this maturation process had moved more quickly in teens who had lived through the pandemic. Gotlib says that their brains appeared three to four years older than the brains of the teens scanned before the start of the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Exactly what part of the pandemic may have shaped teen brains is unclear. But “this study shows that the pandemic has had a material impact on brain maturation,” says Joan Luby, a child psychiatrist at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>Gotlib suspects that stress is to blame. Previous studies have shown that exposure to violence or negligence can lead to accelerated brain maturation in children. Considering that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-long-term-imprint-health">mental health plummeted for teens during the pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 9/8/22</em>), “it’s not a big leap” to think that the stressful conditions could also have shaped brain development in his study’s cohort, Gotlib says.</p>



<p>But what caused the alterations and what implications they may have are still open questions. Rudolf Uher, a neuroscientist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, points out that other factors like more screen time due to online schooling could be at play. And he cautions that future research may not back up this study’s findings.</p>



<p>And it’s unclear whether accelerated brain aging has impacted teen health, or if issues will manifest later in life. While researchers can’t say for sure, “if your brain is prematurely aging, that’s generally not a good thing,” Luby says.</p>



<p>Either way, ensuring that people have access to mental health services will be crucial to helping children of the pandemic, Gotlib says.</p>



<p>“These kids are hurting,” he says. “We need to take that seriously and make sure we’re offering them treatment.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Elsevier psychology journal took down an article in early December with a notice that appeared to be an internal memo, including a typo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, a letter titled “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820301842?via%3Dihub">First COVID-19 suicide case in Bangladesh due to fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia: Possible suicide prevention strategies</a>,” was published in June of 2020 in the <em>Asian Journal of Psychiatry</em> by Mark D. Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University in the UK and Mohammed A. Mamun of Jahangirnagar University and the Undergraduate Research Organization in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It has been cited more than 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Griffiths’ high publishing rate – according to his <a href="https://llr.ntu.ac.uk/rpd/researchpublications.php?pubid=db51913b-503e-4bef-920c-13d7630b28e5#group_Journal=5Farticle">university’s index</a> he published nearly 200 journal articles in 2022 – came under <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2020/07/percent-by-most-prolific-author-score.html">scrutiny</a> from Oxford University psychologist Dorothy Bishop in 2020, including his <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2020/12/faux-peer-reviewed-journals-threat-to.html">many collaborations</a> with Mamun. Griffiths <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mark-griffiths-professor-who-publishes-paper-every-two-days">told the <em>Times Higher Education</em></a> that he “made an intellectual contribution to every refereed paper I’ve published.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126314"></span>



<p>In September of 2022, an anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#1">commented</a> on the June 2020 article from the <em>Asian Journal of Psychiatry</em>, sharing a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppc.12762">letter to the editor</a> published in <em>Perspectives in Psychiatric Care</em> expressing “a number of concerns” about a similar article by Griffiths and Mamun with other coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#2">Bishop commented</a> in October, pointing out that the article used the name of the person who had died by suicide and did not conform to other guidelines for media reporting on suicide. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is not clear what scientific value there is in such a report, which has potential to cause harm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In November, another anonymous user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EAFECED561A20A5EFCB4F069087FC9#3">posted a long comment</a> detailing questions about the evidence the authors had for multiple statements in the article, based on the news report that they cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal acted in early December, taking down the article and replacing it with this notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Frist [sic] and the foremost, the paper mentions the name of a person who committed suicide (in the third paragraph). Besides, there are comments in pubpeer doubts [sic] the scientific value and scientific rigor of the paper. The editor in chief and I are looking into this. In the meantime, in order to protect the person&#8217;s privacy, we ask you to help us take it down temporarily.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed <a href="https://med.wmich.edu/node/1907">Rajiv Tandon</a>, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Western Michigan University and the journal’s editor in chief, asking about the notice. An Elsevier spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We can confirm there was a glitch with our content platform, which led to the publishing of the internal message instead of the removal notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team is working to resolve this issue and to post the corrected notice – which will explain that the paper has been temporarily removed and will either be replaced or reinstated as soon as we reasonably can. The publisher has confirmed that the removal is due to a violation of our ethical policies, which state that we do not mention names of suicide victims.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Later in December, the publisher replaced the first notice (<a href="https://archive.vn/TknDp#selection-501.0-524.0">archived here</a>), with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820301842?via%3Dihub">this one</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed. A replacement will appear as soon as possible in which the reason for the removal of the article will be specified, or the article will be reinstated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also reached out to Mamun and Griffiths for comment on the paper’s removal and the PubPeer comments. Mamun told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have checked the PubPeer comments and found nothing special to respond to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, they claimed the victim&#8217;s privacy was disclosed. This is not the first disclosure of the victim in our paper. The suicide was reported in many newspapers, on TV, and shared on social media. We used publicly available information, and it is not the first paper published by the AJP; you can check here is another paper (you may get other papers too), for example, disclosed the name of suicide victims: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820304950&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another claim in the PubPeer was we used only a reference where they did not find the information in the cited newspaper. This is apparently right for people living outside Bangladesh and probably never tried to reach us about other sources or any clarification before commenting in the PubPeer. Being the first suicide related to COVID-19, it was the talk of the country, and there were several reports, and posts on social media about it. In addition, I communicated with people known to the victim before writing the correspondence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are waiting for hearing from the editor, as well as, will address all the comments formally, but not in the PubPeer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Griffiths shared with us the formal response to the journal, which we’ve made available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Asian-Journal-of-Psychiatry.-response-MG4-2022.docx">here</a>. It includes point-by-point responses to the PubPeer comments, and additional news articles that the authors said could not be included as references due to the journal’s limitations. </p>



<p>Mamun later told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to let you know that the publisher will reinstate the article as we had nothing wrong regarding all the claims made in PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In September of 2018, Nottingham Trent University <a href="https://forbetterscience.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/rj11.jpg">sent a letter</a> to Julian Derry, who had <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/17/nuttingham-trash-university/">criticized Griffiths</a> and another university professor on his blog, stating that “the content of your blog raises concerns of defamation for this University and its employees” and requesting that he remove it.</p>
