<p>This pilot study in Uganda aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of peer-delivered HIV self-tests (HIVST) and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to young women with suboptimal PrEP adherence. Despite adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) accounting for a disproportionate 29% of new HIV infections in Uganda, this group remains underrepresented in the population. The study involved 30 young women aged 18–24 with suboptimal PrEP adherence. Peer-delivered interventions were well-received, with high completion rates at three and six months. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed positive experiences and motivation through peer support, emphasizing the importance of peer support in adherence to PrEP. The study concludes that peer delivery of these interventions is both feasible and acceptable, suggesting potential effectiveness in addressing HIV prevention challenges among African AGYW. Future controlled studies are recommended to further evaluate effectiveness on a wider scale.</p>

<p>In this study researchers investigated the factors influencing comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among adolescent girls in Rwanda using data from the 2020 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. They found that of the 3258 participants, 53.6% demonstrated comprehensive HIV knowledge. Those with secondary education, health insurance, a mobile phone, exposure to television, and a history of HIV testing had where more likely to have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Conversely, girls in Kigali and Northern regions, as well as those practicing the Anglican religion, had lower odds. The findings of this study highlight the importance of expanding HIV preventive education through education and social media. Continued involvement of decision-makers and community actors, particularly religious leaders, is crucial for enhancing comprehensive understanding of HIV/AIDS among adolescent girls.</p>

<p>This study investigates the challenges and facilitators of implementing shared care models for people living with HIV in rural Australia. With improved HIV management, the aging HIV population faces comorbidities, necessitating coordinated care between general practitioners and specialists. However, those in rural areas experience barriers to accessing shared care. Thirteen qualitative interviews revealed that accessibility to general practice significantly influenced shared care engagement, moreover, participants doubted the additive value of general practitioners. Healthcare beliefs, stigma, and preferences for specialist care further impacted the use of shared care. The authors of the study found continuity of care in general practice helped facilitated shared care, however, logistical issues such as affordability and transport posed challenges. They concluded that overcoming patient priorities, anticipated stigma, and resource limitations in rural healthcare is crucial for effective shared care. Building rapport with general practitioners and ensuring continuity of care are essential strategies for quality primary care in shared models, supported by specialist physicians.</p>

<p>In fishing communities near Lake Victoria in Uganda, where HIV prevalence is high, <em>Schistosoma mansoni </em>(<em>S. mansoni</em>) infection rates are also significant. More than 50% of local fishermen are infected with <em>S. mansoni</em>. The authors of this study investigated how <em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection might modify immune responses against HIV. Using polychromatic flow cytometry and Gran-ToxiLux assays, the study compared HIV-specific responses, T cell phenotypes, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADCC) potency and titres between individuals with HIV-<em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection and those with HIV alone. Interestingly, the findings revealed that <em>S. mansoni</em> coinfection was associated with modified anti-HIV responses, including a lower frequency of bifunctional CD4 T cells, higher overall CD4 T cell activation, and lower HIV ADCC antibody titres compared to individuals with HIV alone. The results suggest that <em>S. mansoni</em> infection affects T cell and antibody responses to HIV in coinfected individuals, highlighting the importance of understanding the impact of <em>S. mansoni</em> treatment upon HIV-specific immune responses and disease progression.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The authors of this mixed-methods study investigated the attitudes, facilitators, and barriers to HIV drug resistance mutations (DRM) testing among pregnant women and children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya. Despite lower rates of viral suppression in this population, the significance of DRM in treatment decisions is recognized, leading to the scaling up of national DRM testing programs in resource-limited settings. They conducted interviews with adolescents, caregivers, pregnant women, providers, and policymakers in five HIV treatment facilities. Results from the interviews highlighted the value of DRM testing in clinical decision-making and patient reassurance, with a desire among providers and policymakers for a streamlined, potentially decentralized testing process with greater patient and provider “empowerment” to increase comfort with testing protocols. The study highlights the potential of DRM testing to improve patient health outcomes and emphasizes the need for simplified and efficient implementation strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bottlenosed-dolphins-sense-electric-fields-hunt-prey">Fish beware: Bottlenosed dolphins may be able to pick up your heartbeat</a></h4>

              
                <p>To snap up fish, bottlenosed dolphins may rely on more than just sharp sight and sonar detection. The creatures might also pick up on the weak electric pulses prey produce each time their hearts beat or air filters through their gills.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, two bottlenosed dolphins named Dolly and Donna <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.245845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliably sensed faint electric fields on the scale of microvolts</a>, says Tim Hüttner, a sensory biologist formerly affiliated with the University of Rostock in Germany. That puts the marine mammals’ Spidey sense on par with egg-laying mammals like platypuses and the Guiana dolphin (<em>Sotalia guianensis</em>).</p>





<p>The ability to detect the electrical signals living things give off is called electroreception. It has been previously documented in fish, amphibians and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-jelly-strong-proton-conductor">sharks</a> <em>(SN: 6/27/16</em>). But it was only in 2011 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-may-sense-body-electric#:~:text=It%20detects%20electrical%20fields%20using,remnants%20of%20long%2Dlost%20whiskers">the Guiana dolphin made the list</a>, as researchers discovered telltale sensory receptors hidden in an organ on the animals’ snouts (<em>SN</em>: 7<em>/27/11</em>).</p>



<p>In 2022, Hüttner and his colleagues&nbsp; identified the same structure in bottlenosed dolphins and confirmed that the creatures could detect electric fields on the scale of 0.5 millivolts per centimeter (or 500 microvolts), similar to those that some large fish and crustaceans emit. The new finding suggests that common bottlenosed dolphins (<em>Tursiops truncatus)</em> can likely make out the much subtler signals emanating off the majority of fish, the team reports November 30 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology.</em></p>



<p>For the new study, the researchers trained Dolly and Donna to position their snouts in a metal apparatus and to swim away if they could sense an electrical impulse delivered to their sensory organs. The dolphins proved sensitive to both direct current and alternating current, two forms of electricity that living things generate. The dolphins excelled, however, at detecting direct current, which produces a steady signal. Donna picked up on fields as low as 5.5 microvolts and Dolly on those of 2.4 microvolts.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A bottlenosed dolphin primed to respond to an electric stimulus places its snout in the experimental apparatus. If the dolphin sensed an electric field, it would swim away quickly. If not, it would stay put for several seconds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The study provides solid evidence for an intriguing theory, says Paul Nachtigall, a marine biologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Scientists have long regarded dolphins’ sensory organs, pits on their snouts, which prior to birth carried whiskers, as vestigial structures. It’s plausible that the organs may have evolved to fit another purpose, he says.</p>



<p>Electroreception may come in handy in situations where sight and echolocation are impaired. For instance, Guiana dolphins are benthic feeders, primarily hunting for food on the seafloor, where the sediment can muck up their senses.</p>



<p>Bottlenosed dolphins don’t hunt the same way but do often reside in murky waters and occasionally stick their heads into the sand to look for fish, in a hunting method called crater fishing. Echolocation stops working close up, but electroreception allows dolphins to spot prey a few centimeters away. The ability may just give the creatures the last push they need to nail a target, Hüttner says.</p>



<p>To test this idea, the team would like to study the dolphins’ electroreception while they are moving, Hüttner says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other species of dolphins have pits on their snouts as well, raising the possibility that electroreception is more widespread, he notes. Given that these creatures adopt different hunting strategies, the ability may serve an additional function: helping dolphins to orient themselves along Earth’s magnetic field lines as they migrate.</p>



<p>“There’s just so much to find out,” Nachtigall says. “This study is just the first page of a book.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinstrap-penguins-sleep-seconds-micronaps">These nesting penguins nod off over 10,000 times a day, for seconds at a time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nesting chinstrap penguins take nodding off to the extreme. The birds briefly dip into a slumber many thousands of times per day, sleeping for only seconds at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The penguins’ breeding colonies are noisy and stressful places, and threats from predatory birds and aggressive neighbor penguins are unrelenting. The extremely disjointed sleep schedule may help <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh0771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the penguins to protect their young while still getting enough shut-eye</a>, researchers report in the Dec. 1 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings add to evidence “that avian sleep can be very different from the sleep of land mammals,” says UCLA neuroscientist Jerome Siegel.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Nearly a decade ago, behavioral ecologist Won Young Lee of the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon noticed something peculiar about how chinstrap penguins (<em>Pygoscelis antarcticus</em>) nesting on Antarctica’s King George Island were sleeping. They would seemingly doze off for very short periods of time in their cacophonous colonies. Then in 2018, Lee learned about <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2016.0082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frigate birds’ ability to steal sleep</a> while airborne on days-long flights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lee teamed up with sleep ecophysiologist Paul-Antoine Libourel of the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France and other researchers to investigate the penguins’ sleep. In 2019, the team studied the daily sleep patterns of 14 nesting chinstrap penguins using data loggers mounted on the birds’ backs. The devices had electrodes surgically implanted into the penguins’ brains for measuring brain activity. Other instruments on the data loggers recorded the animals’ movements and location.</p>

Lee</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nesting penguins had incredibly fragmented sleep patterns, taking over 600 “microsleeps” an hour, each averaging only four seconds, the researchers found. At times, the penguins slept with only half of their brain; the other half stayed awake. All together, the oodles of snoozes added up, providing over 11 hours of sleep for each brain hemisphere across more than 10,000 brief sleeps each day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some marine mammals and other types of birds have strange or restricted sleep patterns too, often when staying alert is important. Dolphins can sleep with half their brain at a time, letting them remain vigilant for over two weeks straight. To stay wary of predators, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/half-asleep-birds-choose-which-half-dozes">mallard ducks can sleep with one half of their brain</a> at a time too (<em>SN: 2/6/99</em>)<em>.</em> And elephant seals dramatically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">reduce their sleeping hours</a> while out at sea (<em>SN: 4/20/23</em>). But the sheer number of microsleeps seen in chinstrap penguins is unprecedented among animals, Lee says.</p>



<p>“It seems that the penguins do not have any time where they decrease their vigilance,” Libourel says. “Just a slight increase of microsleep-bout length around noon.”</p>



<p>The sleep pattern may help the penguins balance the brain’s need for rest with the demands of nesting. Predatory birds like brown skuas (<em>Stercorarius antarcticus</em>) patrol penguin colonies looking to plunder undefended eggs and chicks. “Penguin parents should be vigilant all the time during breeding to keep their offspring safe,” Lee says.&nbsp;There’s also constant commotion and noise in the colony disrupting sleep. Such extremely interrupted sleep may reflect the penguins’ flexibility in handling the stressors of raising chicks.</p>



<p>The many micronaps did appear to be at least partially restorative to their brains, since the studied penguins were able to function well enough to both survive and successfully raise their chicks. It’s unclear if the penguins’ sleep pattern changes after the breeding season.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sleep seems to be very diverse and flexible among species,” Lee says. “I believe that there are still many things unrevealed about animal sleep. By studying their sleep behavior, we can understand how animals have evolved to achieve brain restoration.”</p>

<p>A paper that claimed to have developed a new method to predict acid drainage from mines was not so novel after all, according to one of its authors.</p>



<p>In a series of emails to Retraction Watch, Dulian Zeqiraj of the Polytechnic University of Tirana, Albania, admitted to lifting figures and tables from other articles and said he might also have left some “text as it is in original.”</p>



<p>His paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095758202301011X">A Novel Stochastic Approach for Modeling Acid Mine Drainage in Three Dimensions</a>,” was published November 17 in <em>Process Safety and Environmental Protection</em>, an Elsevier title.</p>



<p>That the article managed to clear peer review is astonishing, said <a href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-muniruzzaman-8760b864">Muhammad Muniruzzaman</a>, a senior scientist at the Geological Survey of Finland in Espoo, who discovered last week that Zeqiraj’s team had plagiarized his work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128324"></span>



<p>At first, Muniruzzaman said, he was pleasantly surprised when he got an email from Google Scholar notifying him that some of his studies had been cited. “That did not last beyond 10 seconds when I started browsing through the paper,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A dozen figures and tables from two of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883292720301682?via%3Dihub">Muniruzzaman’s</a> <a href="https://tupa.gtk.fi/julkaisu/bulletin/bt_408_pages_027_042.pdf">papers</a> appeared, without citation, in the new article as examples ostensibly validating the modeling. And several chunks of text were simply paraphrases of sections in Muniruzzaman’s work.</p>



<p>“I tried to read their paper,” said Muniruzzaman, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Turku. “It doesn&#8217;t really make sense. If you try to link from one section to another, there is no link whatsoever. It&#8217;s almost like gibberish, you feel like it&#8217;s not even human generated.”</p>



<p>He added that one of his coauthors had looked into other publications by Zeqiraj and had found what appeared to be a pair of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590037422000048">duplicate</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666720722000200?via%3Dihub">papers</a>, both crammed with mathematical formulas, in two Elsevier titles.</p>



<p>Zeqiraj said that although he had failed to cite Muniruzzaman’s work appropriately, “essentially my work is true and I can demonstrate the code in MATLAB. At this point I apologize for not mentioning the authors. I can do this now by asking Elsevier to give me the opportunity to cite the figures.”</p>



<p>In a later email, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is true that figures and tables are not cited. As for the text it is true that I have read his paper. <strong>But it works so</strong>: You for example read a paper and take from it the resume. Maybe in may [sic] case I have not made the resume but have left the text as it is in original. As for the plagiarism check it cost about 5 euros to control a paper online, practically nothing. I repeat: I have not used ChatGPT AND I AM OPEN FOR ANY DISCUSSION. Please give me the opportunity to speak with the Professor. But one thing is for sure. I will request the retraction from Elsevier if they don&#8217;t allow me to make the changes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Elsevier how the plagiarized paper could have passed peer review and whether it had gone through a plagiarism check. The publisher told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manuscript was run through iThenticate and had a total similarity index of 28%, with a maximum of 5% from any one source. The manuscript was sent for peer-review, and following revision, was accepted for publication in Process Safety and Environmental Protection.</p>



<p>We are now investigating Dr Muniruzzaman’s concerns and have put the paper, which is an Article-in-Press, on hold until our investigation is complete.</p>

<p>The professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/flpfY">Shadi Aljawarneh</a> of the Jordan University of Science and Technology, reaped a prodigious number of citations from the conference proceedings, often <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zui-mmVs_7NbDS-yTe1dtorQCAZ7YNjPaOoZ25q7BwE/edit#gid=0">in highly questionable ways</a>.</p>



<p>“Fraud can pay off,” <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/solal.pirelli/?lang=en">Solal Pirelli</a>, a doctoral student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, wrote on his blog in January. “Shadi Aljawarneh has <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/scholar.google.com/citations?user=xm2Hp7YAAAAJ">6082 citations</a> and an h-index of 38 per Google Scholar, above many well-regarded researchers. This probably helped him sit on the editorial board of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/peerj.com/SJawarneh/">PeerJ</a> Computer Science, alongside well-regarded researchers.”</p>



<span id="more-128329"></span>



<p>Aljawarneh, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, also is a visiting professor at Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>The conferences were put together by an organization called the International Association of Researchers (IARES), of which Aljawarneh is a member, under the auspices of two major industry groups, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many conference papers published by these groups have been found to suffer from plagiarism and other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/15/plague-of-anomalies-in-conference-proceedings-hint-at-systemic-issues/">problems hinting at compromised peer review</a>, as we have reported before.</p>



<p>Pirelli, who moonlights as a scientific sleuth, said he decided to blog about his findings after he reported them to the ACM but didn’t hear back. In July, he got a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-letter-redacted.pdf">letter</a> (in French) from a lawyer representing Aljawarneh threatening legal action unless he took down his post. He didn’t.</p>



<p>Then on November 28, Pirelli received a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-appeal-judgment-redacted-new.pdf">judgment</a> (in French) from an appellate court showing that, unbeknownst to him, Aljawarneh’s lawyer had filed defamation charges already in June. </p>



<p>“This guy is suing me because … I uncovered his whole … scam association that was organizing a bunch of conferences that may or may not have even happened,” Pirelli told Retraction Watch. “One of them was supposedly in Kazakhstan in a time when Kazakhstan was closed due to COVID.”</p>



<p>An ACM press officer told us: “As part of ACM’s plagiarism and fraud practices, we do not comment on ongoing investigations.”</p>



<p>From the judgment, Pirelli learned that the charges against him had been dismissed by the public prosecutor. The appellate court, however, decided to let the lawsuit proceed.</p>



<p>The judgment also revealed that, following the blog post, an upcoming conference had been canceled and Aljawarneh had been removed from the editorial board of <em>PeerJ Computer Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s like, you know, yay, I did some sleuthing and I prevented more bullshit from being added to the pile of stuff in computer science, but at the same time I now have somebody suing me,” Pirelli says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, he added, “in Switzerland, truth that is said in the general-public interest is a defense to libel, to slander, so I&#8217;m not too worried about that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-sphinx-wind-landform-ancient-egypt">Before ancient Egyptians, nature sculpted sphinxes. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Great Sphinx of Giza might have been sculpted by desert winds long before it was ever touched by human hands.</p>



<p>Mysterious desert landforms called yardangs can bear an uncanny resemblance to seated lions — so much so that some researchers think one lionlike yardang might have had the honor of later being carved into the Sphinx by ancient Egyptians. The basic ingredients for these unusual rock formations might be rather simple, researchers report in the November <em>Physical Review Fluids. </em>Scientists were able <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.8.110503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to reliably sculpt hand-sized, sphinx-shaped yardangs from clay globs in a water tunnel</a> so long as two basic conditions were met: consistent prevailing winds and a starting blob containing a mix of easily eroded and more resistant bits.</p>





<p>“This just came completely out of left field,” says geomorphologist Elena Favaro of the Open University in Milton Keynes, England, who was not involved in the study. Scientists aren’t sure exactly how yardangs start to form, but they appear in desert regions where winds wear exposed rock down into long, streamlined ridges facing into the prevailing winds. The study, Favaro says, is “a very inspired way to approach the problem” of how yardangs form.</p>



<p>Curious about how nature produces sphinxlike yardangs, New York University applied mathematician Leif Ristroph decided to take the question into his lab. He and his team study how natural shapes grow and change by compacting ages of erosion into experiments that last a few hours. They do this in a water tunnel, which is typically used to study fluid flow around stiff objects like wings.</p>



<p>“What we do, which is kind of abusive of the device,” Ristroph says, is “put things like a piece of ice in there and look how it changes shape” — or, “in this case, a chunk of mud.”</p>



<p>The team subjected their water tunnel to hundreds of muddy trials. Each time, they started with a stiff clay paste, sculpted it into a starting glob, embedded the glob with bits of hard plastic to represent harder parts of natural rock, and plopped the globs into the water tunnel to erode under a steady water “wind.”</p>



<p>Their setup reliably produced sphinxlike mini-yardangs. The initial shape of the glob and placement of the hard plastic bits didn’t matter much, so long as the plastic bits were in the windward half.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A fluid ‘mane’</h3>



<p>To visualize the current flow around sphinxlike shapes carved out of clay by water, researchers made 3D-printed replicas of the ensuing shapes and coated them in clay laced with fluorescent dye. One of those replicas is shown here from both the side and the top. The currents around the mini-sphinx are made more visible by upstream injections of fluorescein dye, which create glowing filaments that swirl around the object.</p>

<p>But because the sphinxes dissolved quickly, the team had to get creative to take pictures of the fluid flows that sculpted them. The researchers scanned their mini-yardangs and 3D-printed reusable plastic models of the forms. Before each experiment, they coated the plastic models with a thin veneer of clay laced with fluorescent dye.</p>



<p>In the water tunnel, the glowing clay allowed the researchers to trace the whorling currents around the blob. This revealed a few patterns that the team is now working to model mathematically, including a turbulent “mane” of eddies cast from behind the sphinx’s head that carves out a sloping, feline spine. Whether centimeter-scale blobs in water say anything about landscape-sized rocks eroded by wind is a question Ristroph hopes the new study can tempt geomorphologists into answering.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birdsong-track-rare-birds-purple-winged-ground-dove">This bird hasn’t been seen in 38 years. Its song may help track it down</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do you look for an animal you don&#8217;t even know exists anymore?</p>



<p>The last sighting of the purple-winged ground dove (<em>Paraclaravis geoffroyi</em>) — a small, bamboo-loving dove native to the South American Atlantic Forest in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay — was in 1985. But, researchers wondered, was it possible to capture the elusive bird’s sound in the wild to find out if any individuals are left?</p>



<p>It’s not an unheard-of idea. Scientists have used bioacoustics — a subfield of ecology that relies on sound to make environmental analyses — for everything from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-eavesdrops-dolphins-and-discovers-six-unknown-click-types">recording dolphins’ communication patterns</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-people-spillover-transmission-coronavirus-covid-19">studying bats from afar to avoid virus spillover</a> from humans (<em>SN: 12/7/17; SN: 10/23/22</em>). With artificial intelligence, it is now possible to use large audio datasets to train algorithms to spot different animal sounds within the cacophony of a natural background.</p>





<p>But the problem is that recordings of the purple-winged ground dove singing are as rare as the bird itself.</p>



<p>&#8220;I came across [the bird’s song] watching a 1985 interview with Carlos Keller, a former bird breeder in São Paulo state, who had a few individuals of the dove,&#8221; says Carlos Araújo, an ecologist at the Instituto de Biología Subtropical at the Universidad Nacional de Misiones in Argentina. “And they sang while he spoke.”</p>



<p>With Keller’s help, Araujo and colleagues accessed the decades-old recording and isolated the bird’s song.</p>



<p>The next challenge was to see if it was even possible to identify individual bird songs amidst the sounds of other birds chirping, leaves rustling, rain falling, insects whirring and gnawing and larger animals moving through the forest.</p>



<p>&#8220;We took a step back and did some analyses with other birds that are critically endangered but there are known individuals,&#8221; Araújo says. The team focused on three species found in Foz do Iguaçu, a national park that straddles the border of Brazil and Argentina: the cherry-throated tanager (<em>Nemosia rourei</em>), the Alagoas antwren (<em>Myrmotherula snowi</em>) and the blue-eyed ground-dove (<em>Columbina cyanopis</em>). These birds live in the same environments as the purple-winged ground dove. And the blue-eyed ground dove’s story inspires hope: The species went missing in 1941 and <a href="https://mz.usp.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lfs/Paraclaravis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rediscovered in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>The researchers installed 30 recorders in strategic spots along green areas in the Brazilian part of Foz do Iguaçu and recorded from July 2021 to April 2022. They also used data from another 100 recorders on the Argentinian side of Foz.</p>



<p>&#8220;We went looking for the <em>Guadua trinii</em> bamboo to place the recorders,&#8221; says Benjamin Phalan, Head of Conservation at Parque das Aves, a private institution in Foz do Iguaçu focused on the conservation of Atlantic Forest birds. Like the purple-winged ground dove, the three bird species follow the flowering season of the <em>G. trinii</em> bamboo, which happens about once every 30 years.</p>



<p>The team pushed through thickets of bamboo, braved ticks and biting flies, and watched out for venomous snakes such as jacaracas pit vipers. Bumping into these snakes is “rare but can happen. So we use galoshes or gaiters to protect us in case anyone steps on a snake or near it,&#8221; Phalan says.</p>

<p>The recorders captured one minute of landscape sound every 10 minutes and generated about 3,000 days&#8217; worth of recordings. &#8220;A lot of data to sift through,&#8221; says Araújo.</p>



<p>Readily available analysis software wouldn’t work. These software, Araújo says, &#8220;need a lot of data input. With such rare species, we just don&#8217;t have that much data to train the identification algorithm.&#8221;</p>





<p>So the team started from scratch, working with the little data they had for the three endangered birds. First, Araújo created a signal template — exactly like the birds&#8217; singing — based on just a few recordings. The algorithm then compares that template with the soundscape recordings, separating signal from noise. If it spots a sound that is similar to the template, chances are that it is the bird that the researchers are looking for.</p>



<p>The method relies on a statistical model &#8220;that is not new, but was used in a very clever and unusual way,&#8221; says David Donoso, an ecosystem ecology researcher at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany. Donoso and colleagues recently used <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41693-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bioacoustics to investigate the recovery of Choco</a>, a biodiversity hot spot in Ecuador that had been transformed in an agricultural area.</p>



<p>There are different approaches to bioacoustics depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, Donoso says. &#8220;You can either use fewer recordings to map a whole animal soundscape to tell what species are there, like we did, or you can use lots of recordings to look for a single sound pattern,” he says. The study at Foz do Iguaçu &#8220;shows that you can use a relatively simple model to answer a complex question — and it works.&#8221;</p>



<p>The tool <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2023.2268579?src=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked reasonably well to identify</a> the cherry-throated tanager and blue-eyed ground-dove singing, but not so much for the Alagoas antwren, Araújo’s team reports October 23 in <em>Bioacoustics</em>. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to understand what happened, but we know that the algorithm works,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p>The next step, Araújo says, is to refine the algorithm&#8217;s precision to find the Alagoas antwren and train it to look for the purple-winged ground dove. And they will do so at the same time. &#8220;We&#8217;re aiming at both goals at once because we&#8217;re running against the clock to find these birds,&#8221; Araújo says. &#8220;In the end, we are looking for a ghost.&#8221; But not a silent one, he hopes.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Katie Birditt delves into the world of mind-altering drugs with her review of 'Psychedelics' by Professor David Nutt. Psychedelic therapy has yet to be legalised in the UK and the substances themselves remain prohibited as Class A drugs. Is this holding back advances in  the treatment of mental health issues?</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_7232df1fa0bd4d288dedbfa1bc3f07d8~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Photo by Igor Omilaev on Unsplash" ></figure><p>I had given psychedelic research (relatively) little thought prior to reading the recently published book, ‘Psychedelics’, by Professor David Nutt. Embarking on this literary journey showed me that I had been missing out on one of the most radical, emerging fields within therapeutic neuroscience. As the famous author Aldous Huxley once said in 1950: </p><blockquote>“these drugs are destined to play a role in human affairs at least as important as alcohol has hitherto” - Aldous Huxley</blockquote><p>With the legislation around the use of psychedelics for scientific research beginning to change in some countries, Huxley’s statement could not seem more accurate. Evidently, it is time to start familiarising ourselves with this field!</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no one more suitable to tell the story of psychedelics than the neuropsychopharmacologist, David Nutt, who leads the first psychedelics research centre at Imperial College London. The engaging narrative he crafts encompasses aspects of the biological and the pharmacological, whilst also being enriched with added insights into the stigmatisation, history, and practicalities of psychedelic therapy. Probing the field through these various perspectives grounds the research - both its opportunities and challenges - in a real-world context where the forces of funding, public opinion, and governmental policy are all at play.</p>

<p>Delving into the pharmacology of substances like LSD, psilocybin, MDMA and ayahuasca (an Amazonian plant-based psychedelic), is truly fascinating and will encourage one to consider the related notions of consciousness and addiction. Classical and atypical psychedelics are introduced early in the book; their differences are explained by the ways in which they bind to various types of brain receptors to bring about their effects. Nutt elegantly discusses how these molecules can interfere with our brain’s perceptions of the world to cause the hallucinations characteristic of a “trip”. The power of psychedelics appears to reside in their ability to “switch off” master neural circuits, like the default-mode network (DMN) which can keep us locked in rigid thinking patterns. The DMN refers to a set of connected brain regions that seem to contribute to internal modes of cognition, such as thinking, remembering and mind wandering. Psychedelics appear to take this system “offline”, thus helping to unshackle an individual from compulsive thought and enable the formation of new connections between neurones (neuroplasticity at its finest). The therapeutic effect produced from this psychedelic-induced “rewiring” is optimal, provided that the patient is in the right mindset, the trip occurs in a controlled, safe setting and it is followed by therapy sessions that help individuals to process their experiences.</p>
<blockquote>...will encourage one to consider the related notions of consciousness and addiction</blockquote>
<p>Nutt’s style of writing throughout is concise, accessible and engaging, lending itself to this complex field where many unknowns still abound. So compelling is the writing that it becomes disconcertingly easy to get swept up in the “hype” that he builds around psychedelics. Many of the conditions that these substances could potentially be used to treat - such as eating disorders, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder - have historically had unsatisfactory treatments, and devastate many lives. Given the disheartening landscape of psychiatric therapy, unbridled optimism could lead to vulnerable individuals attaching unrealistic expectations to radical therapeutics that may merely offer more “hype” than hope.</p>

<p>Another inherent problem with psychedelics research is related to the study of the effects of these drugs on individuals. The revered Randomised Double-Blind Clinical Control study design, that guides most therapeutic experiments, cannot be effectively employed in studies examining psychedelic effects. Blinding refers to giving participants either a treatment or a placebo and not informing them which they have been given to eliminate any confirmation bias towards taking a certain substance. Psychedelics have very distinctive effects, which introduces an inevitable and problematic bias into these experiments. For example if participants expect positive effects from psychedelic therapy and know they are receiving this treatment, a placebo effect may take place which can impact the validity of the study. This placebo effect that arises from knowing one’s treatment group, and believing a specific response will arise from that treatment, poses a significant challenge to psychedelic research.</p>

<p>I do not intend to discount the future potential of psychedelics. Whilst reading this book, I was frequently intrigued by the findings of studies investigating these substances. However, it is important, particularly at this stage, to remain objective. As Nutt points out, the research is still in its infancy. The long-term effectiveness of regular, psychedelic-assisted therapy sessions are unknown, as are the side effect profiles of these substances. One should also be aware that psychedelics are not a “one-size-fits-all” solution. Individuals with cardiovascular problems, and those susceptible to psychosis, are strongly advised to avoid these substances due to potential adverse effects. There would likely be significant and unprecedented implications if psychedelics were introduced into mainstream medicine too soon. Based on well-documented evidence, these substances might benefit from a reclassification that removes them from a drug category occupied by the most dangerous and addictive substances. This should accelerate research and, potentially, provide answers to some of these pressing questions.</p>
<blockquote>Psychedelics are not a "one-size-fits-all" solution.</blockquote>
<p>One must admire Nutt and his decades-long crusade championing the potential of these drugs. However, it is hard to escape the nagging feeling that the potentially detrimental effects of psychedelics are largely skirted around. I was left with the sense that, although the risks were briefly acknowledged, they were not meaningfully discussed. Two throwaway chapters towards the end of the book, designed to discuss concerns around the substances, felt more defensive, as if he could justify the risks associated with psychedelics by making comparisons with more dangerous drugs. Coupled with the knowledge that Nutt serves on multiple psychedelic advisory boards, the book starts to feel slightly skewed in favour of the substances’ benefits. In spite of this, I do recommend reading the book; the comprehensive information it provides, and the questions it raises, are becoming increasingly relevant in neuroscience today.</p><hr><p>This article was written by Katie Birditt and edited by Rebecca Pope.

<p>Purdue University has reached a settlement with the federal government to pay back grant money the institution received through applications submitted with falsified data, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndin/pr/settlement-purdue-university-false-claims-research-grant-applications-federal-agencies">according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office</a> for the Northern District of Indiana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement resolves allegations under the False Claims Act related to the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/cancer-researcher-banned-from-federal-funding-for-faking-data-in-nearly-400-images-in-16-grant-applications/">case of Alice C. Chang</a> (who also uses the name Chun-Ju Chang), a former associate professor of basic medical sciences at Purdue’s College of Veterinary Medicine in West Lafayette, In. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2023/11/27/purdue-pay-737k-over-false-grant-application-allegations"><em>Inside Higher Ed</em></a> reported first on the settlement.</p>



<p>Last December, the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-chang-alice-c">U.S. Office of Research Integrity found</a> Chang had faked data in two published papers and nearly 400 images across 16 grant applications. As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/cancer-researcher-banned-from-federal-funding-for-faking-data-in-nearly-400-images-in-16-grant-applications/">reported then</a>: </p>



<span id="more-128319"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Two of the grant applications were funded. Chang received $688,196 from the National Cancer Institute, a division of the (NIH), from 2018-2019 for “Targeting metformin-directed stem cell fate in triple negative breast cancer.” The other grant ORI says was submitted in 2014 and funded, “Targeting cell polarity machinery to exhaust breast cancer stem cell pool,” does not show up in NIH RePorter. The rest of the grants were not approved.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Purdue agreed to pay the federal government $737,391, which the USAO release said “includes restitution and punitive damages.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Tim Doty, a Purdue spokesperson, told us the university “did not agree to any punitive damages.” He said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When in mid-2018 the university received notice from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calling into question the authenticity of some results that Dr. Alice Chang had included in proposal submissions to federal funding agencies since 2014, Purdue University cooperated and thoroughly investigated the alleged misconduct. When Purdue’s investigation was nearing conclusion in mid-2019, Dr. Chang left the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on its investigation, Purdue agreed that the funding was not deserved and should be returned.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Chang has been banned from all federal contracting, including grant funding, for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/false-claims-act">False Claims Act</a> allows the government to recover up to three times the amount it was defrauded, meaning that Purdue could have had to pay much more, said <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/16/guest-post-when-whistleblowers-need-lawyers/">Eugenie Reich</a>, a <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/">whistleblower lawyer</a> and former investigative science journalist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the university has got off relatively lightly in comparison to what it could have been in recognition of it self-investigating,” Reich told Retraction Watch. “This kind of settlement should incentivize other universities to self-investigate.”</p>



<p>Indeed, the amounts of settlements can vary a lot. Massachusetts General Hospital got off with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/13/false-claims-allegations-cost-mass-general-former-harvard-researcher-more-than-1-million/">repaying the government</a> less than $900,000 in grant funds in 2021, compared with nearly <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/27/harvard-teaching-hospital-pay-10-million-settle-research-misconduct-allegations/">$10 million in an earlier case</a> that the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, another Harvard facility, paid to settle claims based on allegations it said it brought to the government’s attention. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/14/columbia-has-settled-a-fraud-case-for-9-5m-heres-why-thats-important/">Columbia University</a> had to pay $9.5 million in 2016, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/03/25/duke-settles-case-alleging-data-doctoring-for-112-5-million/">Duke University</a> settled a case for $112.5 million in 2019.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methane-capture-air-global-warming-climate">Capturing methane from the air would slow global warming. Can it be done?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This summer was the hottest ever recorded on Earth, and 2023 is on track to be the hottest year. Heat waves threatened people’s health across North America, Europe and Asia. Canada had its worst wildfire season ever, and flames devastated the city of Lahaina in Maui. Los Angeles was pounded by an unheard-of summer tropical storm while rains in Libya caused devastating floods that left thousands dead and missing. This extreme weather is a warning sign that we are living in a climate crisis, and a call to action.</p>



<p>Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main culprit behind climate change, and scientists say they must be reined in. But there’s another greenhouse gas to deal with: methane. Tackling methane may be the best bet for putting the brakes on rising temperatures in the short term, says Rob Jackson, an Earth systems scientist at Stanford University and chair of the <a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Carbon Project</a>, which tracks greenhouse gas emissions. “Methane is the strongest lever we have to slow global warming over the next few decades.”</p>





<p>That’s because it’s relatively short-lived in the atmosphere — methane lasts about 12 years, while CO<sub>2</sub> can stick around for hundreds of years. And on a molecule-per-molecule basis, methane is more potent. Over the 20-year period after it’s emitted, methane can warm the atmosphere more than 80&nbsp;times as much as an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>



<p>We already have strategies for cutting methane emissions — fixing natural gas leaks (methane is the main component of natural gas), phasing out coal (mining operations release methane), eating less meat and dairy (cows burp up lots of methane) and electrifying transportation and appliances. Implementing all existing methane-mitigation strategies could <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abf9c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow global warming by 30 percent</a> over the next decade, research has shown.</p>



<p>But some climate scientists, including Jackson, say we need to go further. Several methane sources will be difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate. That includes some human-caused emissions, such as those produced by rice paddies and cattle farming — though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows">practices do exist to reduce these emissions</a> (<em>SN: 11/28/15, p. 22</em>). Some natural sources are poised to release more methane as the world warms. There are signs that tropical wetlands are already releasing more of the gas into the atmosphere, and rapid warming in the Arctic could turn permafrost into a hot spot for methane-making microbes and release a bomb of methane stored in the currently frozen soil.</p>



<p>So scientists want to develop ways to remove methane directly from the air.</p>



<p>Three billion metric tons more methane exist in the atmosphere today than in preindustrial times. Removing that excess methane would cool the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius, Jackson says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On the rise</h3>



<p>Over the last 40 years, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere has steadily risen, with a lull in the late 1990s and 2000s. Overall, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled over the last 200 years.</p>

<p>Similar “negative emissions” strategies are already in limited use for CO<sub>2</sub>. That gas is captured where it’s emitted, or directly from the air, and then stored somewhere. Methane, however, is a tricky molecule to capture, meaning scientists need different approaches.</p>





<p>Most ideas are still in early research stages. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is currently studying these potential technologies, their state of readiness and possible risks, and what further research and funding are needed. Some of the approaches include re-engineering bacteria that are already pros at eating methane and developing catalytic reactors to place in coal-mine vents and other methane-rich places to chemically transform the gas.</p>



<p>“Methane is a sprint and CO<sub>2</sub> is a marathon,” says Desirée Plata, a civil and environmental engineer at MIT. For scientists focused on removing greenhouse gases, it’s off to the races.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Microbes already remove methane from the air</h4>



<p>Methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is readily broken down in the atmosphere, where sunshine and highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are abundant. But it’s a different story when chemists try to work with the molecule. Methane’s four carbon-hydrogen bonds are strong and stable. Currently, chemists must expose the gas to extremely high temperatures and pressures to break it down.</p>



<p>Even getting hold of the gas is difficult. Despite its potent warming power, it’s present in low concentrations in the atmosphere. Only 2 out of every 1&nbsp;million air molecules are methane (by comparison, about 400 of every 1 million air molecules are CO<sub>2</sub>). So it’s challenging to grab enough methane to store it or efficiently convert it into something else.</p>



<p>Nature’s chemists, however, can take up and transform methane even in these challenging conditions. These microbes, called methanotrophs, use enzymes to eat methane. The natural global uptake of methane by methanotrophs living in soil is about 30 million metric tons per year. Compare that with the roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/sources-of-methane-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350 million tons of methane that human activities pumped</a> into the atmosphere in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Methane culprits &nbsp;</h3>



<p>Experts estimate that in 2022, about 590 million metric tons of methane were released into the atmosphere. About 60&nbsp;percent of those emissions came from human activities. </p>

<p>Microbiologists want to know whether it’s possible to get these bacteria to take up more methane more quickly.</p>



<p>Lisa Stein, a microbiologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, studies the genetics and physiology of these microbes. “We do basic research to understand how they thrive in different environments,” she says.</p>



<p>Methanotrophs work especially slowly in low-oxygen environments, Stein says, like wetland muck and landfills, the kinds of places where methane is plentiful. In these environments, microbes that make methane, called methanogens, generate the gas faster than methanotrophs can gobble it up.</p>



<p>But it might be possible to develop soil amendments and other ecosystem modifications to speed microbial methane uptake, Stein says. She’s also talking with materials scientists about engineering a surface to encourage methanotrophs to grow faster and thus speed up their methane consumption.</p>



<p>Scientists hope to get around this speed bump with a more detailed understanding of the enzyme that helps many methanotrophs feast on methane. Methane monooxygenase, or MMO, grabs the molecule and, with the help of copper embedded in the enzyme, uses oxygen to break methane’s carbon-hydrogen bonds. The enzyme ultimately produces methanol that the microbes then metabolize.</p>



<p>Boosting MMO’s speed could not only help with methane removal but also allow engineers to put methanotrophs to work in industrial systems. Turning methane into methanol would be the first step, followed by several faster reactions, to make an end product like plastic or fuel.</p>

<p>“Methane monooxygenases are not superfast enzymes,” says Amy Rosenzweig, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Any reaction involving MMO will impose a speed limit on the proceedings. “That is the key step, and unless you understand it, it’s going to be very difficult to make an engineered organism do what you want,” Rosenzweig says.</p>



<p>Enzymes are often shaped to fit their reactants — in this case, methane — like a glove. So having a clear view of MMO’s physical structure could help researchers tweak the enzyme’s actions. MMO is embedded in a lipid membrane in the cell. To image it, structural biologists have typically started by using detergents to remove the lipids, which inactivates the enzyme and results in an incomplete picture of it and its activity. But Rosenzweig and colleagues recently managed to image the enzyme in this lipid context. This <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm3282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprecedented view of MMO</a> in its native state, published in 2022 in <em>Science</em>, revealed a previously unseen site where copper binds.</p>



<p>But that’s still not the entire picture. Rosenzweig says she hopes her structural studies, along with other work, will lead to a breakthrough soon enough to help forestall further consequences of global warming. “Maybe people get lucky and engineer a strain quickly,” Rosenzweig says. “You don’t know until you try.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chemists make progress on catalysts</h4>



<p>Other scientists seek to put methane-destroying chemical reactors close to methane sources. These reactors typically use a catalyst to speed up the chemical reactions that convert methane into a less planet-warming molecule. These catalysts often require high temperatures or other stringent conditions to operate, contain expensive metals like platinum, and don’t work well at the concentrations of methane found in ambient air.</p>



<p>One promising place to start, though, is coal mines. Coal mining is associated with tens of millions of tons of methane emissions worldwide every year. Although coal-fired power plants are being phased out in many countries, coal will be difficult to eliminate entirely due to its key role in steel production, says Plata, of MIT.</p>



<p>To develop a catalyst that might work in a coal mine, Plata found inspiration in MMO. Her team <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed a catalyst material</a> based on a silicate material embedded with copper — the same metal found in MMO and much less expensive than those usually required to oxidize methane. The material is also porous, which improves the catalyst’s efficiency because it has a larger surface area, and thus more places for reactions to occur, than a nonporous material would. The catalyst turns methane into CO<sub>2</sub>, a reaction that releases heat, which is needed to further fuel the reaction. If methane concentrations are high enough, the reaction will be self-sustaining, Plata says.</p>



<p>Turning methane into CO<sub>2</sub> may sound counterproductive, but it reduces warming overall because methane traps much more heat than CO<sub>2</sub> and is far less abundant in the atmosphere. If all the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0299-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excess methane in the atmosphere were turned into CO<sub>2</sub></a>, according to a 2019 study led by Jackson, it would result in only 8.2 billion additional tons of CO<sub>2</sub> — equivalent to just a few months of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at today’s rates. And the net effect would be to lessen the heating of the atmosphere by a sixth.</p>



<p>Cattle feedlots are another place where Plata’s catalytic reactor might work. Barns outfitted with fans to keep cattle comfortable move air around, so reactors could be fitted to these ventilation systems. The next step is determining whether methane concentrations at industrial dairy farms are high enough for the catalyst to work.</p>

<p>Another researcher making progress is energy scientist and engineer Arun Majumdar, one of Jackson’s collaborators at Stanford. In January, Majumdar published initial results describing <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c04567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a catalyst that converts methane into methanol</a>, with an added boost from high-energy ultraviolet light. This UV blast adds the energy needed to overcome CH<sub>4</sub>’s stubborn bonds — and the carefully designed catalyst stays on target. Previous catalyst designs tended to produce a mix of CO<sub>2</sub> and methanol, but this catalyst mostly sticks to making methanol.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is geoengineering a path to methane removal?</h4>



<p>A more extreme approach to speed up methane’s natural breakdown is to change the chemistry of the atmosphere itself. A few companies, such as the U.S.-based Blue Dot Change, have proposed releasing chemicals into the sky to enhance methane oxidation.</p>



<p>Natalie Mahowald, an atmospheric chemist at Cornell University, decided to evaluate this type of geoengineering.</p>



<p>“I’m not super excited about throwing more things into the atmosphere,” Mahowald says. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average, though, it’s worth exploring all possibilities, she says. “If we’re going to meet these targets,” she says “we’re going to need some of these crazy ideas to work. So I’m willing to look at it. But I’m looking with a scientist’s critical eye.”</p>



<p>The main strategy proposed by advocates would inject iron aerosols into the air over the ocean on a sunny day. These aerosols would react with salty sea spray aerosols to form chlorine, which would then attack methane in the atmosphere and initiate further chemical reactions that turn it into CO<sub>2</sub>. Mahowald wondered how much chlorine would be needed — and if there might be any unintended consequences.</p>



<p>Detailed modeling revealed something alarming. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39794-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iron injections could have the opposite of the intended effect</a>, Mahowald and colleagues reported in July in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Chlorine won’t attack methane if ozone is around. Instead, chlorine will first break down all the ozone it can find. But ozone plays a key role in generating the hydroxyl radicals that naturally break down atmospheric methane. So when ozone levels fall, Mahowald says, the concentration and lifetime of methane molecules in the atmosphere actually increases. To use this strategy to break down methane, geo­engineers would need to add a tremendous amount of chlorine to the atmosphere — enough to first break down the ozone, then attack methane.</p>



<p>Removing 20 percent of the atmosphere’s methane, thus reducing the planet’s surface temperature by 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050, for example, would require creating about 630 million tons of atmospheric chlorine every year. That would in turn require injecting perhaps tens of millions of tons of iron. A form of particulate matter, these iron aerosols could worsen air quality; inhaling particulate matter is associated with a range of health problems, particularly cardiovascular and lung disease. This atmospheric tinkering could also create hydrochloric acid that could reach the ocean and acidify it.</p>



<p>And there’s no guarantee that some of the chlorine wouldn’t make it all the way up to the ozone layer, depleting the planetary shield that protects us from the sun’s harmful UV rays. Mahowald is still studying this possibility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Methane is a sprint and CO<sub>2</sub> is a marathon.</p><cite> Desirée Plata</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mahowald is ambivalent about doing research on geoengineering. “We’re just throwing out ideas here because we’re in a terrible, terrible position,” she says. She’s worried about what could happen if all the methane locked up in the world’s permafrost escapes. If scientists can figure out how to use iron aerosols effectively, without adverse effects — and if such geoengineering is accepted by society — we might need it.</p>



<p>“We’re just trying to see, is there any hope this could work and would we ever want to do it? Would it have enough benefits to outweigh the disadvantages?”</p>



<p>The committee organized by the National Academies to investigate methane removal is taking these kinds of ethical questions into account, as well as considering the potential cost and scale of technologies. Stein, a committee member, says a framework proposed by Spark Climate Solutions provides some guidance. The organization, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that evaluates methane-removal technologies, proposes investing in tech that can remove tens of millions of tons of methane per year in the coming decades, at a cost of less than $2,000 per ton. Spark cofounder David Mann says the numbers are designed to focus attention and investment on technologies that can make a real difference in curbing climate change in the near term.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/atmospheric-methane-removal-development-of-a-research-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Academies group</a> aims to make recommendations about research priorities on methane-removal technologies by next summer. It’s likely that a portfolio of different technologies will be necessary. What works in a cattle feedlot may not work at a wastewater treatment plant, for instance.</p>



<p>Scientists focused on methane removal are eager for more researchers, research funding and companies to enter the fray — and quickly. “It’s been a crazy year,” Jackson says of 2023’s extreme weather. We’re already feeling the effects of global warming, but we can seize the moment, he says. “This problem is not something for our grandchildren. It’s here.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasitic-wasps-brazil-mountain-home">One mountain in Brazil is home to a surprising number of these parasitic wasps</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tropics are teeming with life, tending to hold far more species than milder environments closer to the poles. But one group of insects, the Darwin wasps, were thought to buck that trend.</p>



<p>Researchers who compared wasp diversity in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/249583a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1937717" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the United States</a> with tropical areas in the 1970s and &#8217;80s concluded that these wasps were most diverse at mid-latitudes — say, Kentucky or England. But others thought that people just weren’t looking hard enough in the tropics.</p>





<p>It&#8217;s easy to look for wasps in a British garden, says Peter Mayhew, but “it&#8217;s very hard to do long-term work” in a tropical rainforest. Mayhew, a biologist at the University of York in England, was up to the challenge.</p>



<p>Now, after years of sifting through wasps collected from a single mountain in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest a decade ago, Mayhew and colleagues have <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/14/11/861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified nearly 100 Darwin wasp species</a>. The result, published November 7 in the journal <em>Insects</em>, suggests that the tropics are home to far more types of the wasp than was previously recognized.</p>



<p>Darwin wasps are one family of parasitic wasps, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/wasps-given-formal-names">Ichneumonidae</a>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasitic-wasp-larva-gets-more-meal-its-spider-host">lay their eggs on or inside other creepy-crawlies</a> so that the hatched larvae have a ready-made meal (<em>SN: 7/28/56</em>; <em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). In this way, the <em>Alien</em>-esque wasps help control the populations of their prey, serving a vital ecological role similar to that of apex predators like wolves and sharks. With 25,000 described species, there are more kinds of Darwin wasp than there are known mammal and bird species combined.</p>

<p>To understand where the wasps might live in the tropics, Mayhew and his Brazilian colleagues took a hike, several in fact. The team trekked up a mountain in Brazil’s Serra dos Órgãos National Park, placing pairs of traps known as Malaise traps at 15 sites along the way. The path started along a road, which made carting the traps — each consisting of a tent and a jar of alcohol weighing about a kilogram — relatively simple.</p>



<p>After that, though, the team had to carry them by hand up through the jungle. “The first hour is pure hell,” Mayhew recalls. “Very steep, very hot and very humid.” After laying the traps, members of the team returned every month for one year to swap the jars for fresh ones.</p>



<p>The rainforest is, unsurprisingly, full of critters, which led to each alcohol jar becoming what Mayhew calls “insect soup.” To simplify things for now, the researchers chose to focus on only half of the sample jars and look specifically for one subfamily of Darwin wasps called the pimplines.</p>



<p>With the help of an “army of undergraduates” and taxonomist Ilari Sääksjärvi of the University of Turku in Finland, the team identified 98 pimpline species, only 24 of which have been previously described and named. What’s more, there tended to be fewer pimpline species as researchers scaled the mountain — but the higher-elevation species weren’t found lower down. For comparison, the British Isles have 109 known pimpline species, and wasp diversity there has been sampled much more than in Brazil.</p>



<p>Based on this study, Mayhew says, middle to low elevations in the tropics could be targeted for protection in order to conserve the most Darwin wasp diversity there and preserve the insects’ key ecological role. “[At] 1,500 meters and below is where you get quite a lot,” he says.</p>



<p>The new research is “more evidence that, yes, this wonderful group of really interesting wasps has this amazing unexplored diversity in the tropics, and we need more people working on them,” says Laura Timms, a conservation biologist at Canada’s Credit Valley Conservation in Mississauga who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>Mayhew next hopes to examine other types of Darwin wasp that were collected in the insect soup to see if they are as diverse as the pimplines.</p>



<p>The wealth of creatures collected in the traps could also be useful to researchers interested in other insects too, Mayhew says, such as leaf beetles and fireflies. “Quite a lot of what&#8217;s in those bottles is going to be new to science.”</p>

<p>Dear Retraction Watch reader:<br><br>Earlier this week, The Retraction Watch Database surpassed 45,000 retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>45,000.</p>



<p>That’s three times as many as you’ll find in other data sources. And in a recognition of the value of the Database, earlier this year Crossref <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/">acquired it</a> – and made its contents freely available. The fact that the acquisition included five years of funding to cover the continued operation of the Database was critical to our sustainability. We were, in a word, overjoyed by the deal.</p>



<p>But the journalism side of Retraction Watch – the part that digs deep into stories about retraction and related issues, files public records requests, and occasionally faces legal threats – still needs regular sources of funding. At the moment, the salaries of our two reporter-editors – Ellie Kincaid and Fred Joelving – are funded by a combination of a generous two-year grant from the WoodNext Foundation, partnership with news outlets, and individual donations from readers like you.</p>



<p>In nonprofit parlance, we’ve diversified,&nbsp; but we always face the risk that one or more of those streams may dry up. We have a few ways you can help.</p>



<span id="more-128314"></span>



<p>This year, we’re pleased to offer a new way to support our work. As readers know, we offer two free newsletters: the Retraction Watch Daily five days per week, and Weekend Reads on Saturdays, full of our own items and material from elsewhere we think you’ll find of interest. Some of you have said that’s too many emails, that you’d like a weekly digest instead. </p>



<p>We’re sympathetic – but as I handle the newsletters as a volunteer, adding another newsletter option is very challenging. The RW Daily is an important way for us to reach all of you – yes, including for fundraising – and to populate our social media feeds, which is where even more people follow or work. It’s worth the effort.</p>



<p>Being able to provide a service to readers while working toward our sustainability is what gets me up early in the morning. So we’ve added a subscription-only newsletter, <a href="https://retractionwatch.substack.com">The Retraction Watch Weekly</a>. The cost is modest: $5 a month, $50 a year, or more if you’re inclined to be a founding subscriber.</p>



<p>To be completely transparent, there are really just two advantages to The Retraction Watch Weekly: Only one email from us per week, instead of six, and some minimal thoughts on why a particular item we include is noteworthy. We’ll link to all of our posts for the week, and to a selection of items that are also included in the RW Daily and Weekend Reads. </p>



<p>In other words, you can get a lot of this at Retraction Watch or our existing newsletters. which will always be free. But your tax-deductible subscription will help us continue to do our work. (If you’ve made at least $50 in contributions in the last 12 months, contact us to be added to The Retraction Watch Weekly list for free. We’ll contact everyone who has in order to make this offer, but that may take us a bit of time!)</p>



<p>If you’re just as happy as can be with the RW Daily and our other free offerings, we can still use your support. This Giving Tuesday, please consider a tax-deductible donation to support the Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organization. You can make a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1909130">one-time tax-deductible contribution by PayPal</a> or <a href="https://the-center-for-scientific-integrity.square.site/">by Square</a>, or a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DNSJMBBUE7P5C">monthly tax-deductible donation by Paypal</a>. Or if you prefer to send a check, please make it out to The Center For Scientific Integrity and mail it to 121 W. 36th St., Suite 209, New York, NY 10018. Should you be in a position to donate securities, please contact me at ivan@retractionwatch.com for instructions.</p>



<p>Thank you in advance, and thank you for your ongoing support.</p>



<p>Best,</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although mentoring only became popularized over the last two decades of the twentieth century, the history of mentoring can be traced back to Ancient Greece. The word “mentor” originates from the character Mentor, the adviser of Telemachus in Homer&#8217;s Odyssey. As a prevailing tool for self-development, understanding the impact of mentoring is essential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the United Kingdom, career advancement for Black and Minoritized Ethnicity (BME) occupational therapists is limited and little is known about the perceptions of BME therapists on the role of mentoring for their career. In an effort to better understand, this study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Health Services Research </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">utilized the principles of Participatory Learning and Action research methodology. The absence of BME role models in occupational therapy was identified as one of the crucial factors hindering career achievement. Needless to say, building a solid foundation of mentoring relationships is critical within cross race mentoring. The research highlighted the importance of trust and allyship at the initial stages of a mentoring process to secure compatible mentee-mentor pairing. The researchers propose the establishment of a mentoring charter, akin to the Athena SWAN model, for BME healthcare workers to ensure equitable support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A one-size-fits-all approach should not be assumed for mentoring. These findings can serve as encouragement to enhance support and access to career mentorship for health professionals of minority backgrounds.</span></p>

But why are whales so big? Ecological hypotheses of cetacean gigantism have been put forward, including thermoregulation, food acquisition and wider space in the aquatic environment to explore. However, the genetics involved in body size regulation in these ocean giants, remain under-explored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em>, explored the molecular evolution of gene regulatory regions associated with cetaceans’ gigantism, particularly the promoter region. The study utilized sequences from 13 species of cetaceans and 39 other non-cetacean species to represent the major mammalian groups. The researchers discovered enrichment of transcription factors binding sites linked to a large body size with distinct patterns in the promoters of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">IGFBP7 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">NCAPG </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">between giant and non-giant cetaceans. Most importantly, evidence of accelerated evolution in the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> IGF2, IGFBP2, IGFBP7,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ZFAT </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">promoters were detected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Science is a step closer to understanding the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the remarkable size of certain species, paving the way to further research with broader implications for the fields of evolution, biomedical research and conservation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Addiction is a complex condition with psychological, biological and social determinants at play. The interplay of these elements contributes to the persistence of recurring addictive behaviors. The use of complementary therapies, such as equine-assisted interventions for the management of substance use disorders (SUD) have gained recent exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this randomized clinical trial published in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, 100 adults diagnosed with SUD were recruited and randomized into two groups: an equine-assisted therapy intervention group and a control group. The intervention group received weekly equine-assisted therapy lasting 40-60 minutes for 6 weeks which did not involve horse riding, but might involve leading the horse from one spot to another, grooming or feeding. The research demonstrated that equine-assisted therapy led to significant improvements in SUD patients’ emotional regulation scales, general self efficacy and self-esteem scores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Employing a holistic approach to treatment of adults with SUD can provide long-term benefits to the individuals.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Colloquially known as the ‘Asian glow’, more than one in three people with East Asian heritage experience redness (flushing) on their skin when consuming alcohol. A type of alcohol intolerance, flushing occurs predominantly due to inherited deficiency in enzymes responsible for metabolizing alcohol efficiently:</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ALDH2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ADH1B</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">).</span></p>

Powered by data from 15,016 male individuals of East Asian ancestry, SNP-based heritability analyses from the study estimated that around 13% of the phenotypic variation in flushing can be attributed to common genetic variants. Importantly, the study identified </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ADH1B-rs1229984</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> having robust association with alcohol flushing, supporting its previously reported role in alcohol consumption phenotypes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond genetics, the study provided insight into how self-reported alcohol flushing could serve as a valuable instrument for measuring alcohol consumption. This study advances our understanding on how our genes play a crucial yet intricate role in our responses to alcohol, carrying significant implications for interventions addressing alcohol-related health and broader public health strategies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this survey study published in <em>BMC Women’s Health</em>, researchers delved into the often-overlooked relationship between breast cancer patients and their companion animals. The majority of participants in the study shared that their pets provide a great deal of support. Compared to the other three sub-types of support (emotional, social and tangible), affectionate support was rated the highest, with approximately 80% of participants reported feeling loved and needed by their companion pets most or all of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the remarkable benefits a companion pet brings, half of the participants shared that their veterinarians or oncologists were not fully supportive, potentially due to concerns of zoonotic risks. ‘Parental’ worries surrounding their pets include the worry of a suitable caregiver for their pets in case they are no longer able to care for them, and the guilt of not being able to provide the best care for their pets, all which are predictors of lower quality of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than 90% of pet owners see their animal companion as a part of their family. Opening up dialogues with patients, and considering companion animals in psycho-social support and care planning in the initial months following a cancer diagnosis, may aid in alleviating the distress cancer patients may face in trying to meet their pets needs. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-mosquitoes-target-frog-nostrils-blood">Some picky Australian mosquitoes may target frog nostrils for blood</a></h4>

              
                <p>An Australian mosquito species knows the best spot to drink its bloody meals: a frog’s nostril.</p>



<p>The bloodsuckers are surprisingly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eth.13424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selective when dining on frogs</a>, seemingly picking no other place on the body to feast, researchers report November 21 in <em>Ethology</em>. Frogs’ sniffers may be an easy and productive place for the mosquitoes to pierce the thin skin and drink up. The new finding could one day help scientists better understand the transmission of some frog diseases.</p>





<p>Behavioral biologist John Gould discovered the nostril-nibbling insects while studying frogs in ponds on Australia’s Kooragang Island. From 2020 through 2022, Gould occasionally noticed mosquitoes on the faces of the frogs he was surveying and would take photos.</p>



<p>“It was only once I laid out all the photos together that I realized something very particular and surprising was happening,” says Gould, of the University of Newcastle in Callaghan, Australia. &nbsp;In the 12 photos that Gould took of mosquitoes on frogs, every single bloodsucker was feeding on the skin of the frog’s nostril.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some mosquitoes feed only on frogs and toads but bite various parts of the body. The mosquito that caught Gould’s eye, <em>Mimomyia elegans</em>, has a generalized diet of amphibians, mammals and birds. “Yet its feeding strategy when using frogs appears to be highly specialized,” Gould says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="222" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111623_jb_mosquite_frog_nostrils_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C222&#038;ssl=1" alt="A composite shows three images of a mosquito on a frog. The mosquito appears on the frog's back in the first image, further up the back in the second image, and on the frog's head in the third image." class="wp-image-3133345" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111623_jb_mosquite_frog_nostrils_inline.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111623_jb_mosquite_frog_nostrils_inline.jpg?resize=330%2C108&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133345">In this series of photos, a mosquito walks along the back and toward the head of an adult frog (<em>Litoria fallax</em>), a behavior that might allow the insect to sneak up to its preferred feeding spot at the frog’s nostril without getting eaten.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133345">J. Gould</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The nostril skin may be especially soft and thin, making it easier for the mosquito’s biting mouthparts to pierce, Gould says. Alternatively, he notes, there could be a high density of blood vessels near the surface of the nostril skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dining at this venue on a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amphibian-loss-human-malaria-cases-mosquitoes">renowned insect eater</a> is risky, considering the nostrils rest just above a powerful, sticky tongue (<em>SN:10/5/22</em>). But the mosquitoes might have a stealthy work-around. Gould observed some of the mosquitoes landing on the frogs’ backs first before carefully walking up toward the head. This, he says, might keep them from being detected and eaten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gould and colleagues have shown in previous work that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334224837_Mosquitoes_as_a_potential_vector_for_the_transmission_of_the_amphibian_chytrid_fungus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mosquitoes may be vectors for amphibian chytrid fungus</a>, a grave threat to amphibians globally.&nbsp;“Determining where exactly mosquitoes land and subsequently feed on frogs may allow scientists to better understand the spread of the infection across the skin surfaces of frogs,” he says.</p>



<p>Some of the photographed mosquitoes were feeding on green and golden bell frogs (<em>Litoria aurea</em>). Those frogs are <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12143/3325402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered vulnerable to extinction</a>, in part due to habitat loss, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>



<p>A laboratory experiment to carefully watch frogs and mosquitoes to confirm the insects’ nasal predilections would be helpful, says Manuela Carnaghi, an insect behavioral ecologist at the University of Greenwich in Chatham, England, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Determining precisely how mosquitoes target and bite multiple kinds of hosts is key for understanding disease transmission in animals, Carnaghi says. It’s particularly important, she says, when considering the ability of a mosquito-borne pathogen or parasite to jump between different species.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Manal Helal will talk about her under-review draft paper &quot;Enhancing Deep Learning Models through Tensorization: A Comprehensive Survey and Framework&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The burgeoning growth of public domain data and the increasing complexity of deep learning
model architectures have underscored the need for more efficient data representation and
analysis techniques. This paper is motivated by the work of (Helal, 2023) and aims to
present a comprehensive overview of tensorization. This transformative approach bridges
the gap between the inherently multidimensional nature of data and the simplified
2-dimensional matrices commonly used in linear algebra-based machine learning algorithms.
This paper explores the steps involved in tensorization, multidimensional data sources,
various multiway analysis methods employed, and the benefits of these approaches. A small
example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is presented comparing 2-dimensional algorithms
and a multiway algorithm in Python. Results indicate that multiway analysis is more
expressive. Contrary to the intuition of the dimensionality curse, utilising
multidimensional datasets in their native form and applying multiway analysis methods
grounded in multilinear algebra reveal a profound capacity to capture intricate
interrelationships among various dimensions while, surprisingly, reducing the number of
model parameters and accelerating processing. A survey of the multi-away analysis methods
and integration with various Deep Neural Networks models is presented using case studies
in different application domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reindeer-indigenous-herders-arctic-warming-rain-on-snow">Reindeer herders and scientists collaborate to understand Arctic warming</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spring 2014 annual reindeer festival in Yar-Sale, a rural town on the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, was a grim affair. A rainstorm followed by a deep freeze the previous November had turned the normally snow-covered tundra into an ice shield. Reindeer could not paw through the thick ice to access lichen, their primary food source. In a region where winter temperatures can plunge below –50° Celsius, that ground remained frozen months later. Tens of thousands of reindeer had already died of starvation. Thousands more were on the brink of death.</p>



<p>A prominent reindeer herder named Vasily Serotetto approached a group of scientists. Could they predict when such an event — known as <em>seradt </em>in the Indigenous Nenets language — might occur, he asked. Even a few days advance notice would have enabled mobile slaughterhouse operators to come in and humanely kill the animals. And the animal meat and fur would not have gone to waste.</p>





<p>To the scientists in attendance, the request felt like a call to action. Serotetto was basically saying: “You scientists, what’s causing this?” says Bruce Forbes, a biogeographer at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland.</p>



<p>The scientists possessed a trove of satellite images of the Russian Arctic to start tackling that question, Forbes knew. But without more detailed, on-the-ground information from local inhabitants, such as the timing of the event and where it occurred, they did not know where to begin looking in that massive amount of data.</p>



<p>Now the two groups have joined forces to try to understand a phenomenon that has crucial implications for a people’s way of life, as well as a world at large grappling with climate change. Besides preventing herbivores from accessing foliage underneath the ice, rain on snow has been shown to trigger slush avalanches, create surface conditions that warm permafrost, change soil and vegetation conditions and disrupt transportation and communications.</p>



<p>While that paired knowledge helped unravel the many factors that caused the deadly icing in 2013, finding a way to predict such events remains a puzzle.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Power of partnership</h4>



<p>The idea that Indigenous and scientific communities can help each other has been gaining prominence in recent years. Forbes is part of a group of interdisciplinary scientists involved in the Arctic Rain on Snow Study, or AROSS, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. The team is studying what causes rain on snow in the Arctic and how such events affect local wildlife, ecology and communities. </p>



<p>And in September, NSF launched a research hub, the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/gateway/research/indigenous-knowledges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science</a>. That $30-million, five-year effort to bridge Western and Indigenous ways of knowing is based at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>



<p>Indigenous people, such as the Siberian reindeer herders, have a deep understanding of their local environs, says linguistic anthropologist Roza Laptander, an AROSS team member originally from the Yamal Peninsula. Laptander, of both the University of Lapland and the University of Hamburg in Germany, has periodically embedded with herding communities since 2006.</p>



<p>Laptander’s research shows <a href="https://ecologyandsociety.org/vol28/iss3/art6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how ecological knowledge is encoded in the Nenets language</a>. For instance, the first snow of the season is often soft and deep, or <em>idebya syra, </em>Laptander reported in September in <em>Ecology and Society. </em>That snow is difficult for the reindeer to walk in. Snow with ice granules, or <em>inggyem’ syra, </em>indicates high-quality lichen. <em>Seradt, </em>caused by rain falling on snow or unfrozen ground and then freezing solid, is to be feared. The word stems from <em>serad’’, </em>which translates to both rain and misfortune.</p>

Warming Arctic temperatures have increased the likelihood that rain will fall on snow, and then freezing temperatures will bury lichen under thick ice — which occurred in 2013. That winter, over 61,000 reindeer starved to death.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133113">Roza Laptander</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Historically, the herders could rely on their in-depth knowledge of varying types of snow and ice, along with an ability to read weather patterns and animal behavior, to gauge the likelihood of a difficult winter, Laptander says. But a rapidly warming Arctic is scrambling those signals. “Their traditional ways of predicting weather do not work anymore,” she says.</p>



<p>Scientists, meanwhile, often look to understand how warming-fueled changes to the Arctic climate, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-melting-dipole-arctic-oscillation">thinning sea ice</a> and melting permafrost, are affecting climate change and weather patterns on a global scale (<em>SN: 8/31/23</em>). Knowing where to zoom in and what to zoom in on to help local communities requires those communities’ input.</p>





<p>“[Scientists] probably wouldn’t even know one type of snow is different than another. We might just look and say, ‘There’s snow here,’” says Dylan Davis, a remote sensing archaeologist at Columbia University who is not involved with this project. “Local communities and Indigenous communities that live with this every day, they’re going to be able to see things that we don’t.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prediction challenges</h4>



<p>That’s what happened at Yar-Sale. Forbes told Serotetto that scientists might be able to sort out what caused the 2013–14 <em>seradt, </em>but they needed an idea of where to begin. Serotetto pointed to a map. In a typical winter, herders migrate from north to south. When the rain-on-snow event hit, many herders were already too far south to turn back or doubted the severity of the disaster. Serotetto, a herder with decades of experience, was able to push north. He discovered that the northern peninsula was relatively unscathed.</p>



<p>Serotetto drew a line on the map demarcating where he had come across the edge of the ice shield. When scientists pulled up satellite images from that November day, Forbes says, “the line was exactly where he drew it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That information enabled Laptander, Forbes and others on the team to begin investigating the unique confluence of sea ice levels, snow versus ice cover on land, air temperatures and precipitation that contributed to the November 2013 icing event in southern Yamal.</p>



<p>Melting sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas releases <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skimpy-sea-ice-linked-reindeer-starvation-land">humid air into the atmosphere</a>, the team found (<em>SN: 11/15/16</em>)<em>.</em> That <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humid air can blow onto the land as rain</a> when temperatures rise above freezing.</p>



<p>The answer to Serotetto’s question, though, is far from resolved. Predicting such events remains extremely challenging, Forbes says. For instance, in 2018, the North Atlantic was open water all the way to the North Pole, and rain-on-snow seemed almost inevitable. But such an event did not occur. How did conditions differ between 2013 and 2018?</p>



<p>Efforts to answer that question are currently on hold. First, the pandemic thwarted travel and then, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Climate research in the Russian Arctic has come to a virtual standstill, Forbes says. “Suddenly, half the Arctic is a no-go.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the work in Yamal has snowballed to other Arctic regions, Forbes says. For instance, on a trip to Greenland last year, sheep farmers and reindeer herders told Forbes that they had just dealt with their first serious rain-on-snow event the previous winter. Forbes and his colleagues are hoping to apply what they learned in Yamal to better understand that event. “Now we have a data-sharing network with Indigenous informants across Arctic North America,” Forbes says.</p>

                <p>Twitter used to be (and still is to some extent) a source of useful information for neuroscientists about technical details, clarifications of research findings and open discussions that cannot be obtained so easily otherwise. Here is a list of some these gems that have made it into my bookmarks, and I&#8217;m posting them here in order to archive their content at least to some detail. And yes, this list is mostly for my own reference, but it might be interesting for others as well.</p>

<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sr-lGk4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Munir Gunes Kutlu</a> asks which camera to use <a href="https://twitter.com/MunirGunesKutlu/status/1699099259633635726">to record mouse behavior</a> compatible with posture tracking. Among the recommendations are <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/">Raspberry Pi cameras</a> as the budget option (I have used those together <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v2">with Sian Duss</a> for pupillometry and was happy with it), the more expensive <a href="https://www.flir.eu/products/chameleon3-usb3/?vertical=machine+vision&amp;segment=iis">PointGrey Chameleon3</a> cameras; <a href="https://white-matter.com/products/e3vision/">WhiteMatter</a> cameras, where up to 15 cameras can be connected to a computer with a hub; the <a href="https://www.baslerweb.com/en/cameras/">Basler cameras</a> that are also used as a reliable option with few frame drops in the Helmchen lab; and the <a href="https://en.ids-imaging.com/newsroom-news-article/ids-ueye-brand-new-xle-xcp-models.html">uEye XCP camera</a> as a low-cost camera that is sufficiently good for academic purposes. It was mentioned that it is important to know beforehand whether single dropped frames are problematic or not. This is indeed important for simultaneous recording of longer chunks of behavior and neuronal activity in order to be able to synchronize two or more input streams.<br /></li>



<li><a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=7qngqfIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Tobias Rose</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qEadPMEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Jérôme Lecoq</a> discuss where to buy <a href="https://twitter.com/trose_neuro/status/1652380182223757312">cheap UV curing lights</a> (often used for surgeries with mice to cure dental cement). Tobias bought his curing light from Aliexpress, Jérôme recommends one from <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/1159N2/">McMaster-Carr</a> and advices to use protective goggles in any case. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s4JbtqUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Luke Sjulson</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lukesjulson/status/1728944088928624656">adds</a> that blue (not UV) curing lights are state of the art, and that they can be easily found by googling for &#8220;dental curing wand&#8221;. This made me remember<a href="https://twitter.com/lukesjulson/status/891094772164722689"> a previous discussion</a> involving Luke where curing lights and adhesive were also intensely discussed, where he recommended switching from Metabond to Optibond (both are used as the &#8216;the &#8220;luting&#8221; layer between bone and acrylic&#8217;).<br /></li>

I was completely unaware of this technique, which is apparently ideal for very controlled and small injections with less damage, the &#8220;gold standard for classical anterograde tracing&#8221; (according to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JWteol8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Thanh Doan</a>). <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NIJZFdEAAAAJ&amp;hl=it">Maximiliano Nigro</a> seems experienced with this technique and recommends a specific <a href="https://www.glo-bio-inc.com/product/midgard-precision-current-source/">precision pump</a>.<br /></li>



<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mAfPOB4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Matthijs Dorst</a> asks about recommendations for <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNeuro/status/1655859745608069121">oxygen concentrators vs. oxygen cylinders</a> for isoflurane anesthesia stations for mouse surgeries. Oxygen concentrators seemed to work quite well, except for being rather noisy. Apart from the normal medical equipment brands (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href="http://www.vetequip.com/item.asp?cat=7&amp;catalogID=931614">VetEquip</a>), some reported using small fish tank pumps as a replacement for oxygen concentrators. It was mentioned that compressed air might work similarly well as compressed oxygen, but others noted that for very long procedures (&gt;2h), mice started developing cataracts when using compressed air only. I also have learned some time ago that letting the mice inhale pure oxygen (without the isoflurane) after a surgery can improve and speed up the recovery from anesthesia.<br /></li>



<li>Based on some tweets (<a href="https://twitter.com/aandr314/status/1332669975572615170?s=20">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SiegenthalerLab/status/1397636261104521229">here</a>), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=OpYpmY8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Andrey Andreev</a> initiated a highly useful <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFzddItSR-N5eXmE-ff5ccMTorxC6V617mFN6Ntx88k/edit">list of tips on how to set up a microscopy room</a> (or any other lab room for a complicated data acquisition setup), including a lot of helpful links and considerations about lab infrastructure.<br /></li>



<li>On pre-Musk Twitter, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=MNNWY00AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Eleonore Duvelle</a> used to initiate a lot of interesting discussions about rodent behavior and extracellular electrophysiology in hippocampus.

Adobe Illustrator has been the best tool for vector graphic-based scientific illustrations, but <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> was always a good and free alternative. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2XfFvW4yII">Affinity Designer</a> is a newer and cheaper alternative which became more attractive when Adobe transformed to an annoying and very expensive cloud-based software a few years ago. In my opinion, all three tools are very useful, with Adobe Illustrator still being a bit better than the rest when you don&#8217;t consider the price tag. Importing PDFs generated with Python or in Matlab was, however, never easy. This extension is therefore a useful tool for any scientist using Inkscape for figure design.<br /></li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-energetic-cosmic-ray-mysterious-origins">A rare, extremely energetic cosmic ray has mysterious origins</a></h4>

              
                <p>The “Oh-My-God” particle has a new companion.</p>



<p>In 1991, physicists spotted a particle from space that crashed into Earth with so much energy that it warranted an “OMG!” With 320 quintillion electron volts, or exaelectron volts, it had the kinetic energy of a baseball zipping along at about 100 kilometers per hour. </p>



<p>Now, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new particle of comparable energy has been found</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 24&nbsp;<em>Science</em>. Detected in 2021 by the Telescope Array experiment near Delta, Utah, the particle had an energy of about 240 exaelectron volts.&nbsp;And mysteriously, scientists are unable to pinpoint any cosmic source for the particle.</p>





<p>“It’s a huge, huge amount of energy but in a tiny, tiny, tiny object,” says astroparticle physicist John Matthews of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, co-spokesperson of the Telescope Array collaboration.</p>



<p>Cosmic rays consist of protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at a wide range of energies. Particles with energies over 100 exaelectron volts are exceedingly rare: On average, scientists estimate, one such particle falls on a square kilometer of Earth’s surface each century. And particles over 200 exaelectron volts are even rarer — only a few such particles have previously been detected.</p>



<p>When a cosmic ray hits Earth, it collides with a nucleus of an atom in the atmosphere, creating a cascade of other particles that can be detected on Earth’s surface.</p>



<p>To catch the rarest, highest-energy particles, scientists build giant arrays of detectors. The Telescope Array monitors an area of 700 square kilometers using more than 500 detectors made of plastic scintillator, material that emits light when hit by a charged particle. Additional detectors measure ultraviolet light produced in the sky by the shower of particles (although those detectors weren’t operating during the newly reported particle’s arrival). Based on the times that individual scintillator detectors were hit by the cascade of particles, scientists can determine the direction of the incoming cosmic ray and use that information to trace it back to its origins.</p>



<p>Extremely high-energy cosmic rays&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrahigh-energy-cosmic-rays-come-outside-milky-way">come from outside the Milky Way</a>, but their exact sources are unknown (<em>SN: 9/21/17</em>). Most scientists think they are accelerated in violent cosmic environments, such as the jets of radiation that blast out of the areas around certain supermassive black holes, or starburst galaxies that form stars at a frenetic pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever their origins, the particles must come from the relatively nearby cosmic neighborhood. That’s because the highest-energy cosmic rays lose energy as they travel, by interacting with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks">cosmic microwave background</a>, the afterglow of the Big Bang (<em>SN: 7/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>Tracing back the particle’s location is complicated. “The issue is that when you detect a high-energy cosmic ray at Earth, the arrival direction that you get will not point to the source because it will be deflected by … any magnetic field that would be in the way,” says Telescope Array collaborator Noémie Globus, an astroparticle physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the RIKEN research institute in Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The magnetic fields present in the Milky Way and its environs scatter the cosmic rays like fog scatters light. To trace the particle to its home, scientists must take that scattering into account. But that backtracking pinpointed a cosmic void, a region of space with few galaxies at all, much less ones with violent processes going on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That makes this particle particularly interesting, says astrophysicist Vasiliki Pavlidou of the University of Crete in Heraklion, Greece. “It’s actually pointing towards nothing at all, absolutely in the middle of nowhere.”</p>



<p>That might hint that scientist are missing something. For example, researchers may need to better understand the magnetic fields of the galaxy, says Pavlidou, who was not involved with the research.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Every time you have one of these very high-energy events, just because they are so rare, it’s a big deal.”</p>

                <p><strong>There is a popular image, or pressure, of how an academic journey should look but this is not always reality. Many have faced huge personal challenges, academic difficulties or detours along the way. Macy Learmonth shares her own journey from failing A levels to neuropsychiatry to remind us that no path is ever ruled out for you, with advice for anyone who is struggling right now.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_c0ff345b4e5b4467980c4f48d197ce03~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Macy Learmonth" ></figure><p>Over the summer, I had a major interoceptive rumination of schooling, having worked as a Psychology tutor for a Cambridge international summer school. This stemmed from conversations with my students, some as young as 14, who confided in me about their fears of not getting into their dream universities or careers because they were failing biology, chemistry or maths.</p>

<p>I don’t think the stigma around academic struggle is discussed enough, if ever. Most of us remember a  time where we just didn’t “get” a subject. I was always embarrassed to talk about this, fearing the label of being unintelligent. This pressure is worsened by schools with this tunnel vision that amazing grades and top universities are the only means of achieving success. I hope this article will serve to reassure those lacking confidence and advise those who are struggling.</p>
<h5>My academic journey</h5><p>My attitude towards my education is deep-rooted in observing my mum. She enrolled into Oxford Brookes university when I was 3, meaning most of my early memories of her were of her head in her books. If I was lucky on the weekends, she would even take me to the university library with her where I would sit with my colouring book and a packet of smarties while she studied. I suppose she was the blueprint to my work ethic. Although we lived with my grandparents, she was still a single mother in her twenties raising me and my twin. She balanced full time study, employment and her kids, which wasn’t the easiest situation. From then, she ingrained into me that I should prioritise my education and have a good career to be a successful woman.</p>

<p>My primary education is where I established my first and consistent set-back in school - maths. I just didn’t understand it. I was always sat on the ‘red’ table, and given the easiest homework. Every maths test was flooded with red x’s, which became the topic of every parent's evening. This led up to my Year 6 assessments, which would determine my ability set for secondary education, and, as anticipated, my performance in maths was once again poor.</p>

<p>This led me to be placed in the bottom set in Year 7, but this wasn’t forever. Within two months, the school had pushed me up a set, and I finally felt I was getting better. Within two years, my progression throughout school generally improved, but with difficulty. English and languages were my strongest subjects, but maths and science were not for me. I was consistently stuck on Cs, and occasionally lower, which wouldn’t be enough to get into a health science career, <em>especially</em> not in neuroscience, which became my career aspiration at the time thanks to the Big Bang Theory.</p>

<p>As GCSEs started in Year 10, it came down to losing interest. Not only was it exhausting going through adolescence, oscillating friendships and boy problems, but I was grieving the sudden loss of my best friend who was killed by a dangerous driver. My school really didn’t do enough to support me then, which further led me to outlet my emotions unhealthily. My mock exam results were scattered with Ds, even in English and languages. </p>
<p>By Year 11, I knuckled down on my revision and pushed through it. Although I was losing my Grandad to cancer that year, who passed during my exams, I came out with good GCSEs, achieving all Bs and the odd couple of As.</p>

<p>I had obliterated my Year 7 predicted odds of getting into sixth form. However, this was a disaster yet to come. The school had students take four A-levels for the first year of sixth form (generally students only take three A-levels), so I chose my four, and started the year.</p>
<p>My Biology A-level was immediately doomed because my teacher was fired within the first month and my class was juggled between several unsuitable supply teachers until the term ended. Another wave of bad luck piled on  as I became a victim of stalking by older men and experienced another sudden death of a family friend. I became totally disengaged with school, which was telling through my December mock exam results; AUUU.</p>

<p>It was clear that I wasn’t coping, but the school wouldn’t let me drop out. I asked several times for some kind of counselling or wellbeing support - even just a chat with someone - but their solution was to stick me in revision sessions after school everyday, and have me make a revision timetable. I was treated like a statistic and not a person. This was solidified when my Psychology teacher finally called me in for that chat I needed on the last day of Year 12.</p>

<p><em>“We don’t know your exam results, but we don’t think you’ll pass. We’ve decided it would be best if you left the school, and did something else more suited to you. Have you thought about college?”</em></p>

<p>I was taken completely off-guard. Was I actually being kicked out for not being clever enough?</p>

<p>When it came to results day, I hadn’t failed all exams. But they didn’t allow me to leave without one final blow. Amongst everyone’s result envelopes that were spread across the table, they had overtly noted my sealed envelope telling me NOT to enroll for year 13 and to speak to the head of year. I hadn’t even opened my results yet, but was outed to my entire year group as a failure. After hiding behind the music block to open my results and break down, I became immediately furious after seeing my actual grades. I stormed into the sixth form block to face my Psychology teacher again. All I did was silently stare at her with my results on the desk, and she replied “so have you decided where you’re going next?” She never believed in me, and assumed that me staying wasn’t even an option, until my head of year came in. Again, he didn’t ask how I was, he just dumped the entire sixth form register in front of me and pointed to my highlighted name.</p>

<p><em>“You’re one of the ones we want to save, because you passed and yeah…struggled with Geography. And you didn’t like Biology anyway, did you?”</em></p>

<p>Had I seriously been strung along and made to feel terrible about myself, all for them to take me back? They had me wrong, and they didn’t deserve me.</p>

<p>I promptly stood up, left the school and called my mum, asking her to drive me to my back-up option. I walked into a new sixth form and met the head teacher who took my results and put her hand over my grades, offering me a fresh start with amazing teachers and wellbeing support.</p>

<p>Over those next two years, I re-sat my A levels with the most supportive teachers who got me ABB grades. I owe everything to my Psychology teachers who encouraged me to pursue the subject after everything.</p>

<p>I made myself at home with the Psychology Department at the University of Portsmouth. The staff were incredibly helpful and believed in me throughout my entire academic journey. My supervisor was a constant source of inspiration and support, who reassured me of my career aspirations in a neuroscientific discipline, and rebuilt my self-confidence. So much so, the department supported me to get  a place at my dream university which I was once never smart enough to get into, for a Master’s degree I thought I could never do. This was Clinical Neuropsychiatry at King’s College London.</p>
<h5>My advice</h5><p>The path I've taken to reach this point has been far from smooth, and I'm certain there’s many others who can relate. There are countless moments where it was justifiable for me to give up. To close my article, I share my best advice with anyone facing similar struggles.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Surround yourself with like-minded people</strong> - A supportive network of peers and colleagues is a lifeline in neuroscience. Friends come and go, but it’s the ones who guide, challenge and believe in you through the journey. For me, I couldn’t have gotten by without my friend Ben, who made neuroscience lab days bearable, but constantly encouraged me to strive for gold.</li>
  <li><strong>Discipline, sacrifice and balance</strong> - Wake up at 7am, sign up for that voluntary position at your department, stay behind and ask your lecturer questions. Be prepared to miss parties and brunches here and there, but find the time for self-care, perhaps by running a bath or cuddling your pets.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay resilient in the face of adversity - </strong>There will be bad days and people who will doubt you. But you know yourself best and only you can protect your spirit and peace. During my Master’s, I was confronted with losing another best friend, but this time I was stubborn about getting support. Indeed, my grades suffered temporarily, yet this decision was the lifeline that carried me through the course.</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-mate-penis-penetration-birds-mammals-serotine">These bats are the only mammals known to mate more like birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the only mammals that can fly, bats are the oddballs of the mammalian world. But serotine bats stand out for another, glaringly obvious reason — when erect, a male’s penis can swell to almost a quarter of its body length. How these bats use their humongous genitals to mate — <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01304-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without penetration</a> — is a method never seen in a mammal before, researchers report in the Nov. 20 <em>Current Biology</em>.  </p>



<p>At more than 16 millimeters when erect, the penis of male serotine bats (<em>Eptesicus serotinus</em>) has no chance of fitting inside the female’s approximately 2-millimeter-long vagina, a discrepancy that prompted biologist Nicolas Fasel to wonder how these bats go about getting it on. Videos collected at the Ukrainian Bat Rehabilitation Center in Kharkiv from 2018 to 2021 and the attic of St. Matthias Church in Castenray, Netherlands, from 2016 to 2022 revealed the answer. With footage, taken from underneath the bats, “we could see actually what was happening,” says Fasel of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.</p>





<p>Instead of inserting its penis into the vagina, a male uses it to move aside a membrane covering the female’s genitals and then presses the penis against the female’s vulva and holds it there, often for just under an hour. In one observation, the behavior lasted more than 12 hours.</p>



<p>Once the deed was done, the fur around the female’s vulva appeared wet, which Fasel and colleagues suspect is due to semen. Other scientists told Fasel the wet spots look similar to those in which they’ve found semen after mating in other bat species, he says. These observations suggest the serotine bats are mating without penetration, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-private-evolution">common practice in birds</a> but one never observed in a mammal before (<em>SN: 1/16/09</em>).</p>



<p>“I think it’s super interesting because it sort of brings up a different function for a penis” aside from penetration, says Patricia Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. “It doesn’t surprise me that this is a bat because bats have some of the craziest reproductive strategies in mammals,” such as females being able to store sperm for six months or males having spines on their penises.</p>



<p>Fasel agrees. Among mammals, bats “just have to be the weirdos of the group.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-automated-device-anesthesia-dose">A brain-monitoring device may one day take the guesswork out of anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new brain-monitoring device aims to be the Goldilocks of anesthesia delivery, dispensing drugs in just the right dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No physician wants a patient to wake up during surgery — nor do patients. So anesthesiologists often give more drug than necessary to keep patients sedated during medical procedures or while on lifesaving machines like ventilators.</p>



<p>But anesthetics can sometimes be harmful when given in excess, says David Mintz, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins University. For instance, elderly people with cognitive conditions like dementia or age-related cognitive decline may be at higher risk of post-surgical confusion. Studies also hint that long periods of use in young children might cause behavioral problems. “The less we give of them, the better,” Mintz says.</p>





<p>An automated anesthesia delivery system could help doctors find the right drug dose. The new device monitored rhesus macaques’ brain activity and supplied a common anesthetic called propofol in doses that were automatically adjusted every 20 seconds. Fluctuating doses ensured the animals <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received just enough drug — not too much or too little</a> — to stay sedated for 125 minutes, researchers reported October 31 in <em>PNAS Nexus</em>. The study is a step toward devising and testing a system that would work for people.</p>



<p>Normally, an anesthetic dose is based on body measurements like weight and age. But that calculation is not a perfect science. There is no clear relationship between dose and likelihood that patients will be fully anesthetized with propofol and similar drugs, says Mintz, who was not involved with the new study. So anesthesiologists give amounts on the higher end of the spectrum to ensure their patients remain unconscious.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not acceptable for doctors to work with doses that aren’t necessarily going to work for everyone, Mintz says. “You’re shooting for the 99th percentile… like 99.999” percent of patients should not wake up.</p>



<p>While patients are under anesthesia, physicians keep a close eye on indirect markers of consciousness such as breathing rate and heart rate. Anesthetics like propofol also alter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/going-under">brain waves</a>, so tracking brain activity can help anesthesiologists keep tabs on patient awareness, says neuroscientist and anesthesiologist Emery Brown (<em>SN: 5/6/11</em>). In practice, however, few physicians are trained to do so.</p>



<p>Brown and colleagues developed a device to do that work for anesthesiologists. The system requires limited human input, combining brain-monitoring medical equipment with a computer that uses algorithms to determine how the body processes propofol. Every 20 seconds, the machine calculates how much drug is needed to maintain a preset level of brain activity that previous work has shown is <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicative of unconsciousness</a> in macaques.</p>



<p>After computer simulations suggested the model would work, the team completed nine trials with two macaques. The researchers first manually administered the anesthetic for half an hour. Then they let the automated delivery system take over for 125 minutes. In all nine experiments, the system accurately shifted the macaques between a lighter sedation and a deeper sleep, each lasting 40 or 45 minutes.</p>



<p>The system isn’t the first of its kind to be developed. Some existing devices — which are not approved for use in the United States — can distribute a single, predetermined amount of drug. But because the new Goldilocks version relies on feedback from the brain, it’s a bit like flying a plane on autopilot, says Brown, of MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Just as autopilot is key for helping pilots navigate long flights, using a brain-monitoring machine to automatically adjust anesthesia doses would help during long surgeries and most likely reduce patients’ post-surgery delirium.</p>



<p>“Doesn’t mean the pilot can decide to take the day off,” Mintz says. But because machines don’t get sleepy or need a bathroom break, the new device “is a very helpful tool … because it complements human weakness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next steps include repeating the experiments with more animals to refine the system and make the brain monitoring steps less invasive. The device from the study measured brain activity from electrodes that had been directly implanted in the monkeys’ brains, Brown says, but the goal is to switch to using EEG electrodes that attach to the scalp.</p>



<p>Consciousness is difficult to define, and even EEGs aren’t a perfect tool, Mintz says. People with brain diseases, for instance, may have EEGs that look slightly different than people with healthy brains. Still, blending technology with anesthesiologists’ watchful eyes can take the guesswork out of hitting the sweet spot that slips people into oblivion.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kumar.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="128" height="128" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kumar.jpeg?resize=128%2C128&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128301" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Avinash Kumar</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On Feb. 10, 2022, <a href="https://archive.fo/UfNxc">Avinash Kumar</a>, a PhD student at one of India’s top technical schools, sent a trove of research data to his adviser. But when the same data appeared in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13399-023-04242-5">a paper</a> in a scientific journal earlier this year, Kumar’s name wasn’t on it.</p>



<p>“I have done the experimental and analysis part of this work,” Kumar, who has since graduated, wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I am in deep shock after seeing this article online.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seemed like a solid case of plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128300"></span>



<p>In support of his claim, Kumar, whose <a href="https://archive.fo/Uo9PA">award-winning</a> work on sustainable food packaging <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/sustainable-food-packaging-iit-roorkee-develops-paper-from-pine-needle-waste-1829319-2021-07-17">made national news</a> in 2021, shared a PDF of the email he sent to his former adviser, <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~DPT/Kirtiraj_K__Gaikwad">Kirtiraj Kundlik Gaikwad</a>, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. He included a side-by-side comparison of the graphs and images in the email and the offending paper. The two data sets were clearly identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar also questioned how Prachi Jain, who according to her <a href="https://archive.fo/gD415">LinkedIn profile</a> began her PhD studies at IIT Roorkee in January of this year, the same month the paper was submitted to the journal <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>, could have become its first author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Date stamps on electron microscopy images in the article show that when the research was done, Jain was still a master’s student at a university more than 1,500 miles away. Yet the paper, “Functionalization of sugarcane bagasse-based paper with amla pomace/titanium dioxide nanoparticles providing antimicrobial protection for food safety,” listed her contributions as “Formal Analysis, investigation, visualization, data curation, writing.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Gaikwad, however, called Kumar’s allegations “completely false.” Whereas the article in <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery </em>was about a material created from sugarcane fibers, Kumar’s PhD dissertation, and <a href="https://archive.fo/UfNxc">his published work</a>, focused on pine-needle waste. The research Kumar alleged was plagiarized was “not his work,” Gaikwad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the professor’s version of events, all Kumar did was ferry the data from the person who did the technical analysis to Gaikwad – while making it look as if Kumar had performed the work. He explained that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the paper tech department, all paper-related testing is done in a [National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories]-accredited laboratory where equipment is handled by well-trained technical staff … and students are not allowed to handle these equipments [sic] as per the guidelines of NABL.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gaikwad had asked Kumar “to collect the data from the technical person who did the experimental thing” and email it to him, he said. “That is the only thing he did.”</p>



<p>The professor sent us a copy of Kumar’s dissertation, which indeed was about a material derived from pine needles. He also passed along other documentation suggesting that the sugarcane research had originated with another researcher, Suman Singh of VCSG Uttarakhand University of Horticulture and Forestry. Singh and Gaikwad were co-corresponding authors on the paper in <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>.</p>



<p>“I believe this is a clear case of defaming me,” Gaikwad told Retraction Watch. “Such fake allegations against supervisors are increasing day by day, which is also a matter of concern and demotivates us. I have published a number of papers in my research career, and I understand the ethics of research in academia.”</p>



<p>Gaikwad also said Kumar had complained to the school’s ethics committee, which, according to Gaikwad, “found that it was a false claim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>IIT Roorkee and its ethics committee did not respond to repeated requests for comment. We also contacted Kumar to inquire about the information Gaikwad had provided, but follow-up emails, text messages and phone calls all went unanswered.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We take concerns of alleged plagiarism in papers we publish very seriously. When we become aware of such concerns, we investigate them carefully following an established process and in line with best-practice COPE guidelines. In this specific case, the journal editors are looking into the matter, but I’m afraid we cannot share further information at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We could not find contact information for Jain, and neither the school nor Gaikwad would provide it. In a <a href="https://archive.fo/IuRIB">LinkedIn post</a> announcing the paper’s publication, Jain thanked both Singh and Gaikwad, as well as two other coauthors, but did not mention Kumar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaikwad said Jain had been working with Singh on the sugarcane research for a “long time” before becoming his graduate student. In a phone interview, Singh told us she is currently Jain’s co-adviser and confirmed that Jain had worked with her on the sugarcane research “last year.” Asked when the collaboration started, however, Singh hung up. She did not respond to a follow-up email.</p>



<p>Update, 11/23/23, 1530 UTC: After our story ran, Singh contacted us to provide details on the timing of Jain&#8217;s work on the study:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Ms Prachi Jain Graduated in June 2022 from that point onwards she was working with me till December 2022 and majority of work in the paper she has done but not all hence there are co authors as well. As she performed well I recommend her to enroll with my co PI for PhD study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another email, Singh complained about our story, which we stand by. She also offered more details about the case:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express our deep concern and disappointment regarding the news article published today morning, which alleges that Professor Gaikwad engaged in data theft. We believe that the headline misrepresents the situation and unfairly portrays Professor Gaikwad.</p>



<p>Professor Gaikwad has been a dedicated mentor to Mr. Avinash, a student who faced academic challenges. When Professor Gaikwad took on the responsibility of guiding Mr. Avinash, it was a commitment to help an underprivileged student overcome hurdles and achieve a doctorate. The journey involved significant efforts from Professor Gaikwad, who even wrote Mr. Avinash&#8217;s papers due to language and technical barriers.</p>



<p>Despite Professor Gaikwad&#8217;s unwavering support, Mr. Avinash, after being denied a project assistant position, has started defaming both Professor Gaikwad and me. We are young researchers seeking justice, and the publication of this news has exacerbated our frustration.</p>



<p>We kindly request you to consider retracing the published news. The article does present both parties&#8217; views, but the title creates an unjust perception. We are willing to provide additional information, and we suggest conducting an interview with Mr. Avinash to verify his claims, as we believe they are baseless.</p>



<p>Your understanding and cooperation in rectifying this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/11/21/new-submission-holiday-delays/">Attention Authors: Temporary changes to announcement schedule due to end-of-year holidays</a></h4>

              
                <p>Planning a submission to arXiv in the next few weeks? The 2023 end-of-the-year holiday stretch will be temporarily impacting arXiv&#8217;s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This temporary change only affects the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>The arXiv team primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States, which at the end of the year includes many holidays in quick succession, leading to several announcement delays.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As our team rests, celebrates, and takes time to be with family, the will be some disruption to arXiv&#8217;s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</p>
<p>Please be aware of the delays around the following dates. Mailings and public availability of new submission will be deferred accordingly:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-mammal-embryos-grown-space">The first embryos from a mammal have now been grown in space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mouse embryos can make it to an early stage of development in space.</p>



<p>In an experiment conducted in 2021, a few hundred frozen two-cell embryos from mice thawed and grew over four days on the International Space Station. Of the several dozen embryos that made it back to Earth, nearly a quarter formed healthy clusters of cells known as blastocysts.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that the radiation and weightlessness of space <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)02254-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not pose immediate obstacles to mammalian reproduction</a>, researchers report October 27 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>





<p>The new study isolates only one part of the complicated process of reproduction and development. A blastocyst typically forms after fertilization and implants in the uterus before developing into the placenta and fetus. </p>



<p>But the result provides a starting point for biologists, says Christiane Hahn, a space biologist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, Netherlands, who wasn’t involved in the research. Mouse embryos are the first mammal embryos that researchers have grown in space, an important step in understanding how space affects human reproduction. Other experiments have involved animals such as salamanders, rice fish and quail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that the conditions in space are particularly harmful to the early stages of reproduction in mice. When in space, the animals have been too stressed to mate, and studies of the rodents’ eggs showed that they accumulated several mutations due to the heavy radiation. Freeze-dried mouse sperm, however, did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-sperm-dna-space-radiation-exposure-six-years">remain viable after one six-year stint on the space station</a> (<em>SN: 6/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>To overcome these challenges, biologist Teruhiko Wakayama and colleagues launched two-cell embryos to the ISS. A device specially made for the experiment held the fragile, developing cells. After the experiment ended, the cells were then sent back to Earth for analysis. Out of 360 samples, 72 survived the trip, and 17 of those developed into normal blastocysts. The undamaged cells successfully multiplied and took on new identities as either precursors of fetal tissue or the placenta.</p>



<p>Future alterations to the procedure could potentially increase the success rate, says Wakayama, of the University of Yamanashi in Kofu, Japan. The absence of perfectly sterile conditions in the space experiment probably exacerbated cell death, he says.</p>



<p>Blastocysts cannot survive for long outside of uteruses, so the experiment was designed to last only a few days. It’s unclear how the cells would fare as development unfolds. In future experiments, the team would like to implant any viable embryonic cells from space experiments in mice to find out.</p>



<p>The researchers are especially interested in further testing the impact of microgravity on the positioning of different cells in a blastocyst. The cells that give rise to the fetus usually all sink to the bottom of the cluster, encased by cells that will become placenta. Were the fetal cells to split into two spots instead, they’d create identical twin mice. Were they to split into more, the blastocysts would probably become unviable.</p>



<p>In the new study, three-quarters of the fetal precursors appeared to settle in the right location. But more research is needed to fully understand the effect of microgravity on the developing cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thanksgiving-myth-persists-history-memory-science">Why the Thanksgiving myth persists, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask someone in the United States to name five events important to the country’s foundation and there’s a good chance they’ll mention the Pilgrims.</p>



<p>That’s what researchers found a few years ago when they put that question to some 2,000 people. The Revolutionary War, Declaration of Independence, Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas and the Civil War topped the list. But <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1750698019856065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming in seventh place were the Pilgrims</a>, the team reported in 2022 in <em>Memory Studies</em>.</p>





<p>Their inclusion in the list is bizarre, says coauthor Abram Van Engen, an English professor at Washington University in St. Louis interested in national origin stories. “There’s no great reason why we start America with the Pilgrims…. They’re kind of late to the game.”</p>



<p>Before them, after all, came the Native Americans, Spanish settlers in St. Augustine, Fla., and European settlers — and the slaves they brought with them — in Jamestown, Va. But the Pilgrims’ tale of religious persecution, perseverance and self-governance provides people with a tidy, if aggrandized, national origin story, says Van Engen.</p>



<p>The “Thanksgiving myth” is part of that tale, says coauthor and cognitive psychologist Henry Roediger, also at Washington University. The shorthand for that story, he says, goes like this: In 1621, the Pilgrims and Native Americans “had this peaceful meal and powwow [while] singing kumbaya.”</p>



<p>The two groups did engage in a peaceful harvest celebration in the fall of 1621, history suggests. But historians are quick to point out that the tidy tale ignores context, particularly the deadly diseases and bloody wars that devastated Indigenous populations both before and after the occasion.</p>



<p>Despite persistent efforts to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/thanksgiving-myth-and-what-we-should-be-teaching-kids-180973655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flesh out the historical record</a>, the kumbaya vision persists. That’s because history and memory, far from being interchangeable as commonly assumed, often exist in opposition. History is rooted in fact, while memory is rooted in story. When shared across individuals, those stories — with their half-truths, exaggerations and elisions — foster unity.</p>



<p>Origin stories like the Thanksgiving one are particularly sticky as they underpin a group’s raison d’être. Fixing or changing the story risks muddying the plot and tearing apart the group, says Van Engen. “The Pilgrims just become right for telling [the] stories … that we want to tell about ourselves.”</p>



<p>Mythological origin stories are not unique to the United States. “Each nation has its heroic story. That is the tradition of collective memory,” says Chana Teeger, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science who studies how South Africans teach about apartheid.</p>



<p>But scholars are starting to grapple with how nations should contend with difficult pasts. “How do you keep a strong national identity and patriotism while at the same time acknowledging the more negative aspects of your history?” Roediger asks. The answer, as evidenced by increasing calls for racial reckonings in the United States and elsewhere, is very much a work in progress.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thanksgiving has become a “mental habit”</h4>



<p>Stories, Aristotle observed some 2,400 years ago, contain a distinct beginning, middle and end strung together via a causal chain, or plot.</p>





<p>Our brains are wired for such stories, psychologists discovered much later. People rely on clear narratives to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001613?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid information overload</a>, anthropologist James Wertsch and psychologist Olivia Jäggi, both of Washington University, reported in 2022. Our story-minded brains turn us into “cognitive misers,” they wrote in <em>Progress in Brain Research</em>. The pared-down nature of stories, in other words, is much easier for us to remember than the complex, often ugly, arcs of history.</p>



<p>For that 1621 Thanksgiving, the complex historic arc goes like this. Up to 90 percent of the Wampanoag population had died from an epidemic brought by a previous wave of European explorers by the time the Pilgrims arrived in December 1620 in what’s now Massachusetts. The weakened community faced threats from an encroaching neighboring tribe. Meanwhile, the Pilgrims, unaccustomed to the new environment and climate, were dying of starvation and disease.</p>



<p>In March 1621, those struggling groups formed an alliance. The Wampanoag people could teach the Pilgrims how to harvest crops and the Pilgrims could protect the Wampanoag people from invaders. The peace did not last. Over the next several decades, the settlers&#8217; population exploded and European leaders displaced the Wampanoag community, often through dishonest or violent means. War broke out in 1675, killing hundreds of colonists and thousands of Native Americans. Settlers killed the Wampanoag leader and displayed his head on a spike for two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The common narrative makes the settlers look like the good guys. Once you start chipping away at it, then everything falls apart,” says social studies educator John Bickford of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston.</p>



<p>History and memory have different relationships to the past, Wertsch explains. Historians will sacrifice narrative to preserve the facts. Agents of collective memory, such as political leaders, museum curators, teachers and family members, will sacrifice the facts to preserve the narrative — and group solidarity.</p>



<p>Consequently, memory and history are often at loggerheads, wrote French historian Pierre Nora in the 1989 <em>Representations</em>. “Memory and history, far from being synonymous, appear now to be in <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/representations/article-abstract/doi/10.2307/2928520/82272/Between-Memory-and-History-Les-Lieux-de-Memoire?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundamental opposition</a>.”</p>



<p>Moreover, the narrative habits offered up by memorable, though potentially fictitious, stories are just as hard to break as other habits, such as stopping nail-biting or forgoing that daily cup of coffee. For instance, we hear the word “bread” and we think “butter.” We hear “Thanksgiving” and we think Pilgrims and Native Americans singing kumbaya.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Thanksgiving myth came together slowly</h4>



<p>But in fact, adding Pilgrims to the Thanksgiving narrative is a surprisingly recent affair, beginning some 200 years after their arrival in New England.</p>



<p>Thanksgiving was initially an altogether more informal affair. European settlers celebrated thanksgivings, or harvest festivals, even before the Pilgrims’ arrival. And the Pilgrims themselves were somewhat sporadic with their feasts, celebrating the day when new friends or supplies arrived from Europe or when they defeated the Native Americans in various wars. In 1789, Thanksgiving wasn’t a national holiday but George Washington issued a proclamation celebrating the day in the name of an “Almighty God.”</p>





<p>In the 1820s, when the United States was roughly 50 years old, things started to formalize. Research into nation building shows that the half-century point is about when official histories, such as those in textbooks, begin to appear, Van Engen says. Such histories typically double as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">memory projects</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>In the United States, those projects began at a time when the young nation was shifting from an agrarian to an industrial society. As people moved away from their birthplaces for work, kinship ties were weakening. Starting in 1827, Sarah Josepha Hale, author and editor of a prominent women’s magazine<em>, </em>began calling for an official and family-oriented Thanksgiving holiday to bring families back together. Nearly four decades later in 1863, with the country in the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln took heed and turned Thanksgiving into a national holiday to promote unity.</p>



<p>From that point, presidents — powerful players in building a nation’s collective memory, and the accompanying feelings of national pride — began issuing annual Thanksgiving proclamations, says political scientist Judd Birdsall. Birdsall, of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., has read every one of those speeches to see how those memories evolve and coalesce over time to eventually capture the modern-day Thanksgiving spirit. “It’s a very niche specialty,” Birdsall admits.</p>



<p>Theodore Roosevelt made the earliest <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15570274.2021.1954408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vague reference to “the first settlers”</a> in his 1905 proclamation, by noting their many hardships, Birdsall reported in 2021 in the <em>Review of Faith &amp; International Affairs</em>. Franklin Delano Roosevelt identified the Pilgrims by name in 1939. But only after World War II do Pilgrims come to regularly feature in these proclamations, morphing into “archetypical Americans,” Birdsall says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pilgrims&#8217; progress</h2>



<p>When researchers asked some 2,000 U.S. survey respondents to list five events “important to the foundation of America,” top choices included the Revolutionary War and Declaration of Independence. But Pilgrims, who arrived after many others and had little to do with American origins, still came in seventh with 17 percent of the vote, researchers found. That could be due to the fact that, centuries after their arrival, the Pilgrims’ story of dining with the area’s Native Americans became Thanksgiving folklore.</p>

<p>Those speeches also show how America’s founders and political leaders have typically either ignored Native Americans or treated them as supporting actors to the main story. Their first appearance in the Thanksgiving story is in 1908, with Teddy Roosevelt’s pejorative mention of an “Indian haunted wilderness.” In 1980, President Jimmy Carter obliquely referenced the Native Americans by calling Thanksgiving “a commemoration of the day America’s earliest inhabitants sat down to a table with European colonists.” Ronald Reagan made Native Americans more central to the story, noting in 1986: “Indeed, the Native American Thanksgivings antedated those of the new Americans.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">America’s origin story is still in its messy middle</h4>



<p>Breaking up with the Thanksgiving narrative is no easy feat. But some people in the United States are starting to question Thanksgiving and other stories pointing to the country’s rosy beginnings, Wertsch says. “How do you [begin to] break a bad habit? You have somebody point it out to you.”</p>



<p>That’s what happened, say Wertsch and others, when a group of journalists at the <em>New York Times </em>launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1619 Project</a> a few years ago. Led by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, that long-term endeavor began the U.S. story with slaves’ arrival in Virginia in August 1619. The nation’s story, they argued, spirals outward from that ugly point.</p>



<p>“If there’s anything that debunks our national origins, it’s the 1619 Project,” Bickford says.</p>



<p>Today, that project has come to frame many of the country’s ongoing culture wars, especially fights over how to teach history. Institutions, such as schools and museums, become places where history and national identity collide, says Teeger. “History education [is] a site where collective memories are negotiated.”</p>



<p>Social scientists refer to conflicts over how events ought to be remembered as “mnemonic standoffs.” In the case of Thanksgiving, the standoff is over whether Thanksgiving ought to be remembered as a day of celebration or, as a growing chorus of Indigenous people and their allies call for, a day of mourning. Such standoffs illuminate the central tension between history and collective memory, researchers say. How do people maintain unity while acknowledging their difficult pasts?</p>



<p>Historians and social scientists used to assume that collective memories need to be positive, even mythological, to succeed. “Forgetting, I would go even as far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation,” French philosopher and historian Ernest Renan <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7312/rena17430/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued in 1882</a>.</p>



<p>Contemporary researchers question that view. Georgian people’s collective memories, for instance, include ideas of the Eastern European country as a perpetual underdog, says anthropologist Nutsa Batiashvili of the Free University of Tbilisi in Georgia. “The skeleton narrative, which repeats itself, is that a big enemy comes, and Georgians fight heroically, but they have traitors inside. And they lose the war but still manage to save the culture and integrity and identity.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Can people in the United States rewrite their national story to reflect this sort of complexity? That remains an open research question, Wertsch says. Stories work best when they have a neat beginning, middle and end. But Thanksgiving, and the broader American origin story, remain caught in the messy narrative middle. “We don’t have an ending of racism in America. It’s still here,” he says.</p>



<p>The more optimistic framing, Batiashvili says, is that the American story is still being written. “It’s a narrative in the making.”</p>

                <p><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. This time, Katie Birditt shares her own tips for choosing and applying to Masters courses after getting onto her programme of choice this year. </strong></p>

You must collect recommendation letters, update that CV from three years ago, and write a strong personal statement, often whilst juggling multiple other commitments.  As someone who recently went through this process, I am going to share some of my tips on how to research different Masters courses and craft a good personal statement!</p>
<h5>Research, research, research!</h5><p>One of your earliest considerations should be whether you are interested in pursuing a Master of Research (MRes) or a Master of Science (MSc) degree. These two programmes have slightly different focuses and purposes. Although both involve independent research, the MSc is a taught programme aiming to expand your theoretical knowledge of a subject and provide some foundational training in relevant techniques and skills whilst the MRes is research-based and quite specialised with fewer taught modules. Coming from a Biomedical Science background rather than pure neuroscience, I selected an MSc style programme to diversify my research skills and broaden my knowledge on the subject. However, if you are passionate about a specific area of research or have a strong grounding in the subject already, see yourself pursuing a PhD so want to gain maximum hands-on research experience, or you simply hate the idea of long coursework essays, then an MRes is worth looking into!</p>

<p>It is then important to investigate the ways in which programmes align with your specific interests and ambitions. Have a look through their  specialisations and faculty research output before making any firm decisions. Is the department renowned for a particular type of neuroscience, like behavioural or molecular? Who are some of the leading researchers in this field and are they working on projects that excite you? It is useful to ask yourself these questions early in the application process. Normally, all the course-specific information is available on department websites and will provide you with a good idea of how you could fit within the course and the wider department. If any burning questions are left unanswered by the website, then get in touch with the admissions team or perhaps even the course directors. </p>

<p>Everyone will have slightly different priorities when it comes to selecting a Masters course. An array of factors should be considered and researched, alongside the ones already mentioned. These could include the programme’s reputation and length or what the university’s surrounding city is like. I would be cautious about selecting a university based on prestige alone, as you wouldn’t want to find yourself stuck in a neuroscience department that is renowned for research you are not interested in or one that is in a city far away from friends and family.</p>
<h5>Personal statement</h5><p>Once you have thoroughly researched different Masters degrees and shortlisted a few, it is personal statement time. I believe that this component is one of the most important parts of the application. It is here that you sell yourself and place all the experiences and achievements your CV holds into a meaningful context that relates to your future ambitions and why the university and particular course are the perfect fit for you. An excellent personal statement coupled with good grades could be the reason you are selected for interviews at leading institutions. Now, how to begin writing it?</p>
<h5>Overcoming Blank Page Phobia </h5><p>In my experience the hardest part of personal statement writing is always starting. I struggle with that initial blank page. For anyone else who shares this fear I suggest brainstorming some ideas about why you are applying and writing down whatever comes to mind. Once those phrases are out the page, start slowly structuring them into sentences and paragraphs. There will be many iterations of the statement so do not worry about perfection in these initial stages. The main aim is to string your thoughts together into sentences and gradually start building up the personal statement.</p>
<h5>Show your passion and commitment to a specific field </h5><p> As an undergraduate the world of research can seem so broad and intimidating that it may be hard to select a single area of interest. You could be intrigued by two completely unrelated topics in neuroscience. If this is the case, I would suggest trying to focus on only one specific area because this makes your personal statement easy to follow and shows that you have given careful thought to further study. You’re not expected to have mapped out your five-year plan, so don’t worry! My advice is to simply be guided by your current interests and genuine motivations to study the degree. </p>
<h5>Talk about relevant experience</h5><p>Discuss any work experience that you have had and how it has influenced your trajectory up to this point.  This doesn’t have to be laboratory placements or internship: you could talk about your dissertation, volunteering experiences, or any other experience that will show the person reading your application who you are or the passion you have for the field. Do not just list these experiences in your CV! There are very few spaces where you can boast about all you’ve done, so seize this opportunity to talk about how brilliant you are! It can be hard, but capitalise on your own unique selling points because this will give your application an authentic voice and make it stand out. For example, having lived all my life in Zimbabwe I am aware that there is not much research there on dementia. Therefore, I framed my interest in neurodegenerative disease research within this unique context to ensure that my passion for this area of neuroscience came across clearly. </p>

<p>When mentioning your experience, try using the Situation Task Action Result (STAR) method. The technique encourages you to talk about a certain situation and reflect on all the ways in which you worked towards achieving a desired outcome. This approach is effective in producing clear, concise sentences that demonstrate all you learnt or accomplished during an experience. However, course leaders are not only interested in how wonderful you are, but also if you would fit well within that Masters degree. Be sure to talk about why your interests overlap well with various aspects of a programme. Maybe UCL has a whole course dedicated to dementia and this aligns well with the experiences you have had in a patient-centred volunteering role. Perhaps Cambridge has a focus on computational neuroscience, and you have just used some of these methods in a dissertation. All these details will make your application interesting and memorable.</p>
<h5>Some closing tips</h5><p>Let other people read through your personal statement when you’re finished. This could be anyone, but ideally someone who is more detached from the work and able to provide objective insights and different points of view. Ask your academic tutor, friends or even parents. My mum is my go-to application editor, even though she is not a scientist! </p>

<p>Give yourself regular, frequent breaks throughout the entire process. Approaching the application with fresh eyes and a rested mind helps far more than sitting in front of a computer for hours, frustrated and uninspired!</p>
