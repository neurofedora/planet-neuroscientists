<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324005896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossings</a><br><em>Ben Goldfarb<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Nearly 65 million kilometers of roadway crisscross the Earth — enough to encircle the planet more than 1,600 times — and that number will likely double by 2050. These roads have intruded into even the most remote corners of the world, and that has come at a cost: Vehicles are responsible for a staggering number of animal deaths. For instance, 1 million vertebrates are thought to die daily in collisions in the United States alone. Roads also kill indirectly, in part by fracturing migration routes and degrading pristine habitat.</p>





<p>In <em>Crossings</em>, journalist Ben Goldfarb delves into the burgeoning field of road ecology and introduces the impassioned, sometimes eccentric scientists who invite us to perceive our roads as animals do to better understand the ecological impacts. Goldfarb journeys alongside these researchers as they bike through Montana and wrestle anteaters in Brazil, squint at roadkill and rhapsodize about the design quirks that engineers can leverage to attract animals to safe overpasses and culverts. Road ecology, many of its proponents say, is a win-win: Building dedicated wildlife crossings, for example, is relatively cheap compared with other infrastructure projects, and minimizing collisions between drivers and animals preserves lives and lowers insurance premiums.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Goldfarb about roads and how to minimize their harm. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How did you get interested in road ecology? It seems very different from your <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/got-environmental-problem-beavers-could-be-solution">previous book on beavers</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb: </strong>The origins of this book date back to 2013, when I was on a reporting trip about habitat connectivity. I caught wind of wildlife crossings on Highway 93 in northern Montana, and I ended up taking a tour of them with Marcel Huijser, a wonderful road ecologist at the Western Transportation Institute in Montana.</p>



<p>The most powerful moment of that tour was when we moved to the one big wildlife overpass on Highway 93. The sun was going down on this beautiful October evening, and it was just incredibly inspiring to be on top of this piece of infrastructure that humans had built for wild animals. We do so much on this planet to make animals’ lives more difficult, and as a conservation journalist, it felt like a form of ecological empathy manifested as a science.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You dedicate a lot of the book to small animals like reptiles, amphibians, insects and fish. Is that where the science led you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> It’s where the field of road ecology is going in a lot of ways. A lot of the early history is focused on deer because that’s what safety-oriented engineers worry about. But as the field has evolved [to become more focused on conservation than human safety], it’s gotten more concerned with less charismatic, less dangerous organisms. They are important to think of because in some ways they’re the taxa most harmed by roads.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How has this book changed your perceptions of roads?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> One of the biggest takeaways is just how deleterious road noise pollution is. When you read the literature about the health effects and the ecological effects of road noise, you realize that it’s truly one of the great unsung public health crises of our time. It’s elevating our cortisol levels, raising our blood pressure, and making us more susceptible to cardiac disease and stroke.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>You make a lot of comparisons between roads and climate change and the actions that are needed to address them.</strong></p>





<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> The climate movement has evolved a lot over the last decade away from individual blaming and towards indicting larger corporate power structures. The same holds true in the world of road ecology. Most of us have had the experience of hitting wild animals. I’ve killed animals, unfortunately, and I always feel incredibly guilty about it and complicit in this car culture. But car culture is the product of this very intensive marketing campaign that the whole automotive industrial complex has waged.</p>



<p>Instead of blaming drivers for roadkill, the real answers are these larger systemic solutions. Maybe that’s modifying infrastructure to build more wildlife crossings to make highways permeable; maybe it means improved mass transit systems.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>You end the book talking about how roads have been leveraged as a tool of oppression against Black and brown communities. Why was it important to include that aspect?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> The parallels between the ways that roads impact ecological communities and the ways they impact human communities are striking. Highways are forces of division in both ecosystems and cities, and we humans fall victim to cars, just as wild animals do. But I also wanted to recognize that we’re not all harmed equally — roads, especially urban freeways, have been very deliberately weaponized against communities of color throughout the last century. And that’s still happening today.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You quote an early U.S. Forest Service employee as saying “roads are such final and irretrievable facts,” yet the book argues that roads can be made into “visitors” in a landscape.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> We have the capacity to change them. The Forest Service, one of the world’s largest road managers, is decommissioning thousands of roads, recognizing that they still have harmful ecological effects. On the other end of the spectrum, you have places like Syracuse, where an urban freeway was punched through the middle of the city, deliberately wiping out a Black neighborhood. This old viaduct will be torn down in recognition of the disproportionate harms that it inflicted on people of color.</p>



<p>It’s remarkable to think that everything from tiny dirt roads to this enormous urban freeway are being unmade. Our roads aren’t necessarily fatal, permanent mistakes after all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cake-cutting-math-problem-fairness-envy">Here’s why mathematicians are so interested in cake cutting</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ariel Procaccia has thought a lot about how to cut cake over the last 15 years. That’s partly because the Harvard computer scientist has three children who among them have celebrated more than two dozen birthdays. He knows what it’s like to stand with a knife before a layered masterpiece, frosted with buttercream and chocolate curls, while pressed on all sides by small partygoers who instinctively recognize when someone else gets a better slice.</p>



<p>But it’s also because much of Procaccia’s work focuses on exploring the mathematical rules for dividing stuff up. One way to do that is to think abstractly about dessert. For more than 75 years, he and other researchers trying to formalize fairness have been asking the deceptively simple question: What methods for cutting a cake guarantee that everyone who shows up to the party is happy with what they get?</p>





<p>The answers reach far beyond birthday parties. Cake-cutting contemplation is part of a sprawling mathematical subfield focused on the fair division of resources. It has spurred a raft of algorithms informing how to allocate food among hungry communities, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029890.1999.12005142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to split rent</a> or chores among roommates, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematician-answers-supreme-court-plea">how to draw boundaries for fair voting districts</a> and more. A mathematical problem at its heart, cake cutting connects rigorous reasoning to questions of human preferences and real-world issues, and so attracts not only mathematicians, but also computer scientists, economists, social scientists and legal experts. Questions of fairness (and unfairness) are decidedly universal. Of course, so is dessert. “It’s this very elegant model in which you can really distill what fairness is, and reason about it,” Procaccia says.</p>



<p>The cake, says Steven Brams, a game theorist and political scientist at New York University, is a metaphor for any divisible good, like land or time or limited resources. When cake-cutting insights are applied to settling international disputes, he says, “we are potentially helping the world find solutions.”</p>



<p>Experts have come up with cake-cutting algorithms — the mathematical rules for describing how to cut a cake fairly — many times and in many guises. (The approaches almost always focus on rectangular cakes. The related but more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cutting-pie-no-piece-cake">“pie-cutting” problem</a> addresses circular desserts or pizza.) The easiest rules reveal how to fairly share a cake between two people: One person cuts the cake into two pieces that they believe to be equal in value, and the other person picks first. Each eater receives a piece that they feel is at least as valuable as the other’s, if not better. Reports of this fair division strategy date back to ancient Greece.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>You can argue that fairness, or the lack thereof, is one of the most important problems in the world today.</p><cite>Steven Brams</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In the 1940s, mathematicians began taking serious interest in a mathematical approach to fairness, using cake cutting as an access point. They started exploring how to fairly share among three people, since I-cut-you-choose is a two-player game. That led to looking for ways to extend those algorithms to arbitrarily large numbers of people, and to asking more nuanced questions, like what is fairness exactly, and how do you prove it?</p>



<p>Cake cutting is easy to formulate and easy to relate to, says game theorist Bettina Klaus of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, who studies fairness in real-world situations like school choice allocation and equal access to housing. “But at the same time, the problem is mathematically interesting and challenging because of its complexity once the number of agents to share the cake grows.”</p>



<p>Recent years have brought progress in identifying the fewest number of cuts needed for a given number of people, as well as the maximum number of cuts, which can get ridiculously high but at least shows that cake cutting is finite. And new variations on the question keep emerging. What if you <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divide a cake for multiple groups of people</a> instead of individuals? Or, as explored in a paper published last year, what if cake eaters <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490486.3538321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lie about their preferences</a>? And what if you’re divvying up something that comes in discrete, indivisible pieces, like unopened Halloween candies, instead? By focusing on precise definitions and new scenarios, mathematicians have found new applications and kept cake cutting at the forefront of investigations into fairness.</p>



<p>“You can argue that fairness, or the lack thereof, is one of the most important problems in the world today,” says Brams, who over four decades has published hundreds of works on cake cutting or fairness more generally. “And we’re looking at the theoretical foundations of fairness.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recipes for fair cake cutting</h4>



<p>Documented experiments in finding fair ways to split stuff up go way back, at least to Hesiod’s poem <em>Theogony</em>, written some 2,700 years ago. In one story in the poem, gods and mortals clashed in Mecone, a mythical Greek city. As a sacrifice to appease the gods, Prometheus, who was both a god and humankind’s greatest benefactor, divided a recently slaughtered ox into two piles, one containing unappealing bare bones covered with a layer of fat and the other containing the desirable meat concealed beneath an unappealing section of stomach. Prometheus invited Zeus to take his pick. Zeus, seduced by the shiny fat, chose the unappetizing bones.</p>





<p>In this ancient story, Prometheus infuses the classic I-cut-you-choose strategy — the simplest version of cake cutting — with deception. But when I-cut-you-choose is executed in pursuit of fairness, it should guarantee the satisfaction of everyone involved.</p>



<p>The outcome is proportional, meaning that each player feels like their slice represents a fair share of the total. So for two players, a player would value their own slice at 1/2; for three, a fair share would be 1/3. (And for some arbitrary n number of cake eaters, a fair share would be 1/n.) If the cake is the same throughout, proportionality is equivalent to all the slices being the same size.</p>

<p>You probably already know how to fairly share cake between two people. It’s the simplest approach to fairly cutting cake and is often called the “divider-chooser” method.</p>

<p>But cake cutting isn’t an interesting mathematical problem if the cake is all the same. Ordinary division and a kitchen scale could readily separate a slab of uniform chocolate sponge into any number of proportional pieces. The problem becomes more complicated if you assume that the cake is heterogeneous — if it’s unevenly frosted, for example, or includes sections of varying flavors and toppings.</p>



<p>A maraschino cherry–lover might choose the smallest slice and feel satisfied if they get the cake’s only cherry. In this case, what mathematicians call the “serendipity of disagreement” gives rise to rich math. The most interesting math arises when there are differing opinions.</p>



<p>A two-person I-cut-you-choose scenario still works here. The divider divides the cake into two pieces of equal value in their view and will be happy with either; the chooser chooses their preferred piece. But increase the number of cake eaters, each with particular preferences, and there’s no easy solution.</p>



<p>Hugo Steinhaus of the University of Warsaw was one of the first mathematicians to dive into this complexity. During World War II, as questions of fair division of land were playing out on a large and violent scale, Steinhaus developed a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified I-cut-you-choose strategy</a> for three players. It came to be called the lone-divider method.</p>



<p>In this approach, one person, let’s call her Alice, cuts the cake into three pieces that she values equally (each at 1/3 of the total). Then a second person, Bob, indicates which of the pieces would be acceptable to him. If he approves at least two pieces, then the third person, Carla, can take any piece she wants, followed by Bob (who has at least one acceptable piece available). Alice gets the one that’s left.</p>



<p>But if either Bob or Carla disapprove of the same piece, then that piece goes to Alice (who valued all pieces equally). The remaining two pieces (which Bob and Carla must value at 2/3 or more of the total) are recombined and shared between Bob and Carla using I-cut-you-choose.</p>



<p>Steinhaus described this algorithm in a short paper published in 1948 in <em>Econometrica</em>. It represented one of the first rigorous investigations in the field of cake cutting. “The rule for the first partner,” Steinhaus wrote, “allows him to cut the object — it may be a cake — as he pleases.”</p>



<p>Steinhaus’ method worked for only three eaters, but in the same paper, he reported that two colleagues had developed an algorithm that could achieve proportionality for any number of cake eaters. The method is known as the last-diminisher method, and it goes like this: One person cuts off a piece of cake they deem to represent a fair share and passes that piece along to the next person. Each remaining player has a chance to either trim the cake (if they think it represents more than a proportional share) or pass (if they think it’s proportionally fair or less than fair). Once everyone has had a chance to trim, or “diminish” the slice, the last person who trimmed gets the piece and exits the game.</p>



<p>The trim is then recombined with the remaining cake, and the process begins again with the remaining players. When only two players are left, they use I-cut-you-choose.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How the “last-diminisher” method works</h3>



<p>Sharing cake among three people is harder. In the “last-diminisher” method, three people — Alice, Bob and Carla — each believe they are getting a piece that they value at 1/3 of the total. Mathematicians call that “proportionality,” but whoever exits the game first could still be envious of someone else’s piece.</p>

<p>Brams has called the last-diminisher method an elegant solution, and it guarantees that everyone judges their own piece to be at least as valuable as a fair share. But it’s not perfect because it doesn’t take envy into account. In both the lone-divider and last-diminisher approaches, a person who exits the game early may end up coveting a piece that is cut later in the game — even though they thought their piece was proportional. These algorithms are not what mathematicians call “envy-free,” which is another way to think about fairness.</p>



<p>There is another practical limitation to the last-diminisher method: With enough players, the cake that remains in later rounds might end up broken apart by a lot of slicing — or even reduced to crumbs. It’s easy to see how a partygoer might not value that as highly as a whole piece.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can cake cutting be free of envy?</h4>



<p>Since the debut of the last-diminisher method, cake cutting has fueled a small but mighty body of serious mathematics.</p>



<p>The 1960s brought a major step forward when mathematicians John Conway and John Selfridge, independently of each other, came up with a new cutting algorithm for three people. Unlike the work by Steinhaus and colleagues, the new recipe achieved both perceived proportionality and avoided any envy among the recipients.</p>



<p>An envy-free solution, in which no one covets another person’s piece, is easy to achieve, points out computer scientist Haris Aziz of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Just throw the entire cake away. “If you don’t give anything to anybody, that’s envy-free,” he says.</p>



<p>But if the cake lands in the rubbish bin, no one is happy. In Conway’s and Selfridge’s more pleasing scheme, Alice first divides the cake into three pieces she believes are of equal value. Then, Bob can trim one piece — at most — to create a two-way tie for the most valuable. (The trimmings are set aside.) Carla is left to choose among the three. Then the order reverses, and if Carla didn’t choose the trimmed piece, Bob takes it. Alice gets the one that remains. The eaters then turn to the trimmings, following a similar iterative protocol of cutting, trimming and choosing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to divide cake with no envy</h3>



<p>In a version of cake cutting for three people, each person — Alice, Bob and Carla — are guaranteed to feel that their piece represents 1/3 the total value of the cake. The method, named for John Selfridge and John Conway, also ensures that none of the cake eaters will be envious of another person’s piece. The Selfridge-Conway procedure has been extended for any number people, but the cutting can last a very long time.</p>

<p>Yet for decades more, an envy-free cake-cutting solution for any arbitrary number of eaters remained elusive. In the late 1980s, on his PBS television show <em>For All Practical Purposes: Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics</em>, mathematician Sol Garfunkel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS73L5YMZ_E&amp;list=PL9n195Q8MdMgGACoKTurcoXhB7xh7rbss&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured the unsolved cake-cutting problem</a> and related questions of fair division.</p>



<p>But the problem wouldn’t go unsolved for much longer. In 1995, Brams at NYU and Alan&nbsp;D. Taylor of Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., devised <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new procedure that cuts cake for four people</a> with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/formulas-fairness">no one envying anyone else</a>. “That was considered a breakthrough of sorts,” Brams says. It built on the “trimming” approach of Conway and Selfridge, running a similar procedure on all possible pairs of cake eaters. Brams and Taylor described how the procedure could be extended to any number of people.</p>



<p>The approach still had limitations. There was no guarantee of how many cuts it might take. “We showed in general that you could require three cuts or 3 million cuts,” Brams says. Or many, many more.</p>



<p>A few years later, mathematicians Jack Robertson and William Webb of Washington State University in Pullman described a useful computation model that could be used to analyze how many steps, including cuts and evaluations, are required by an algorithm. Its calculations confirmed, for example, that no maximum number of cuts could be predicted for any algorithm known at that time that divided cake proportionally and without envy for any arbitrary number of players.</p>



<p>Over the next few decades, many mathematicians came to wonder whether an upper bound for envy-free cake cutting even existed. If not, in theory, cake cutting could go on forever. What’s more, Procaccia says, no one had figured out the minimum, either.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>What mathematicians call the “serendipity of disagreement” gives rise to rich math.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is cake cutting infinite?</h4>



<p>Procaccia never actually set out to study cake cutting. In 2008, he was teaching a course on the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence. One day, walking home after delivering a lecture on resource allocation and the Robertson-Webb model, he realized how he could find a lower bound — a minimum number of steps, including cuts — for envy-free cake cutting for any number of people. The lower bound he found was somewhere around n² steps, where n is the number of cake eaters.</p>



<p>That would lead to his first paper on cake. Procaccia has a knack for giving mathematical papers catchy titles. The lower-bound paper, published in 2009, was titled “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1661445.1661484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thou shalt covet thy neighbor’s cake</a>.” In 2010, he coauthored one called “<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/aaai10/02/AAAI10-137.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth, justice, and cake cutting</a>,” which introduced the question of truthfulness — in addition to guaranteeing proportionality and removing envy. If a person hides their preferences during the cutting, someone may end up with an unequal share. It’s “mathematically fascinating,” Procaccia says.</p>



<p>As Procaccia continued in the field, he began thinking more about useful algorithms that could put insights from cake cutting — and the theory of fair division in general — to good use. One example: dividing rent.</p>



<p>The easiest way, of course, is to divide the total due by the number of inhabitants. But that ignores the “serendipity of disagreement.” One person might want a window, another might prefer the bigger closet. In 2014, Procaccia and colleagues designed a web-based tool called Spliddit that collected users’ preferences and produced mathematically fair ways to divide anything, from rent among roommates to possessions among divorcees.</p>



<p>The biggest recent breakthrough in cake cutting, Procaccia says, came from Aziz and computer scientist Simon Mackenzie, based in Sydney, who determined an upper bound on envy-free, proportional cake cutting. First, in 2015, the pair tackled the problem of how to share cake among four people. By borrowing ideas from Conway and Selfridge and from Brams and Taylor, the team devised an algorithm that produced an upper bound of 203&nbsp;steps, which could include almost as many cuts. That’s a lot but not too unreasonable.</p>



<p>A year later, the team extended the approach to an arbitrary number of people, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7782956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting an algorithm with a finite number of cuts</a> for envy-free, proportional cake cutting. It was a potentially astronomical number of cuts, but it was finite — answering a long-standing question in the field.</p>



<p>Cake cutting for n people, Aziz and Mackenzie reported, could require as many as n^n^n^n^n^n operations. That’s a totally unreasonable number. The maximum number of steps for five people would be around 2 x 10<sup>2,180</sup>. That means five people cutting the cake billions of times per second for 100 trillion years might barely be getting started.</p>



<p>However, Aziz says the algorithm can be adapted to a more reasonable, though still really big upper bound if the partygoers, for example, allow for a little cake to be left over. And it’s still possible that mathematicians could bring that upper bound lower in the future.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The cake-cutting problem endures</h4>



<p>Explorations into the question of how to fairly cut a cake aren’t over. Inspired by Procaccia’s 2010 paper on truthfulness, computer scientist Biaoshuai Tao of Shanghai Jiao Tong University investigated what happens <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07387.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you try to account for dishonest cake eaters</a>. “If everyone knows how the cake is allocated, then I should get more if I tell the truth,” he says.</p>



<p>But in some cases, dishonesty can yield an advantage. If Alice and Bob were to divide a cake, and Alice knew that Bob always preferred chocolate, she might knowingly divide the cake unequally so the smaller piece contained more chocolate. Then Bob would choose according to his preference, and Alice would get the larger piece.</p>



<p>In his work, presented in July 2022 at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Economics and Computation, in Boulder, Colo., Tao found that truthfulness and proportionality are incompatible, making it impossible to construct a cake-cutting algorithm that strictly guarantees truthfulness, proportionality and no envy.</p>



<p>Practical applications for cake cutting also continue to abound. Klaus, in Lausanne, points to school choice as an example.</p>



<p>A district with limited seats in certain schools has to balance the school board priorities — scores on entrance exams or geographic distribution, for example — with the preferences of parents to try to find a proportional solution with a fair value. “In the past, schools were just assigned … without asking people what they want,” Klaus says. “The school choice comes from the fact that the preferences of the parents or the kids would be taken into account.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Over time, cake cutting has evolved into a kind of mathematical sandbox, a constructive playground that brings together abstract proofs and intuitive applications.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And there are plenty of other real-world applications for questions of fair division. Brams has used ideas from cake cutting to study fair voting procedures. (To elect their leaders, at least four scientific societies, including the Mathematical Association of America, adopted an algorithm developed by him.)</p>



<p>Procaccia has applied fair division algorithms to model food allocation. Aziz is exploring applications ranging from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00879.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to divvy up chores</a> or other tasks that can’t be divided to how to best schedule doctors’ shifts in hospitals.</p>



<p>Others are studying fair allocation of goods that can’t be cleanly divided. After a divorce, for instance, former partners might come to agreement on a fair split only if some items are taken out of consideration. These investigations include approaches that are close to envy-free if not mathematically perfect.</p>



<p>Even after decades of investigation, cake cutting isn’t like a simple jigsaw puzzle with a well-defined solution. Instead, over time, it has evolved into a kind of mathematical sandbox, a constructive playground that brings together abstract proofs and intuitive applications. The more researchers explore it, the more there is to explore.</p>



<p>“I’m interested in it now not only because it’s beautiful in math,” Tao says, “but I still believe there’s a lot to be done.”</p>

<p>The publisher Frontiers has retracted nearly 40 papers across multiple journals linked to “the unethical practice of buying or selling authorship on research papers,” according to a <a href="https://blog.frontiersin.org/2023/09/04/frontiers-implements-new-policy-to-counter-authorship-for-sale/">press release</a> posted to a company website Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release also states Frontiers is adopting new policies to prevent the sale of authorships on papers it publishes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230829052027/https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics">old policy</a> simply stated that “Requests to modify the author list after submission should be made to the editorial office using the authorship change form.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, such requests “will only be granted under exceptional circumstances and after in-depth assessment by the Frontiers’ research integrity unit,” according to the release. The publisher will also keep track of the requests “to identify suspicious patterns and trends.”</p>



<span id="more-127841"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics#changes-in-authorship">new policy</a> also states that Frontiers will deny authorship changes requested after acceptance as a rule, and:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1285036/full">notice</a> for the <em>Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology paper</em>, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2021.775309/full">Optimizing sgRNA to improve CRISPR/Cas9 knockout efficiency: special focus on human and animal cell</a>,” states that the authors “do not agree to this retraction.” Neither corresponding author immediately responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shomali reached out to us separately regarding the entry in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">database</a> for his <em>Frontiers in Immunology</em> paper, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.839945/full">Dysregulation of Survivin-Targeting microRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases: New Perspectives for Novel Therapies</a>,” one of three of his articles that the publisher pulled on Monday. (We had mistakenly listed it as a “research paper” rather than a “review article,” which we corrected at his request.)</p>



<p>According to an email the publisher sent the authors in June, which Shomali shared with us, Frontiers had decided to retract the paper after “concerns were brought to our attention from the German Cancer Research Center regarding the authorship of the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The email included a draft retraction notice, which specified that “the German Cancer Research Center contacted the editorial office stating that the author Mostafa Jarahian is not an employee.” Jarahian has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shomali told us he had sent the following objection to the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I, the first author, on behalf of the authors, declare that there has never been any author contribution discrepancies in our article; nor has been posted In mysterious websites, PubPeer, etc, as well as the authorship and the order of the authors was the one that was submitted for the first time and remained unchanged during the whole peer-review process; to ensure, you can check the history of the journal. Besides, the APC of our article was paid by Dr. Marwah Suliman Maashi not DKFZ (as mentioned in acknowledgment section of article); therefore, DKFZ has not the right to complain about our article about affiliation of Mostafa Jarahian. Since the APC has been paid personally and there is no author contribution discrepancies in our article, you can address the possible minor concern by changing the affiliation of Dr. Jarahian to “Former DKFZ employee” and revoke your decision to retract and make a correction. Otherwise, I don’t see any rationale to retract our article; if so please give a reasonable explanation for your decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He further told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Actually, Mostafa Jarahian was working at DKFZ from 2004 until mid-2020 and published articles in prestigious journals such as Nature with DKFZ affiliation (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SBRj4H4AAAAJ&amp;hl=de). He used his affiliation In later articles as he did so without any biased purposes, but DKFZ informed the journal that it should not be. The article mentioned above is part of my PhD thesis; as I explained, there has never been any authorship change during whole review process and the APC was paid be second author not DKFZ, so there is no rationale to retract my article instead the affiliation can be changed to publish a correction. We complained about this matter to DOAJ, OASPA, and Thomson Reuters and looking forward to hearing from them. Since the article is a part of my PhD thesis and our institution monitors the retraction watch database and makes decisions based on it, I would sincerely ask you to please exclude my article from your database as an exceptional subject. My article has been retracted for an author’s affiliation who was working at for nearly 20 years. It is completely unfair to retract an article for such a minor error.</p>

<p>Two cancer researchers who formerly worked at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City published 12 papers with fake data that amounts to research misconduct, according to findings from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found that <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-dannenberg-andrew">Andrew Dannenberg</a> “engaged in research misconduct by recklessly reporting falsified and/or fabricated data” in the papers, and <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-subbaramaiah-kotha">Kotha Subbaramaiah</a> “reused Western blot images from the same source and falsely relabeled them to represent different proteins and/or experimental results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published findings for both scientists include the same extensive list of duplicated images in a dozen papers, all retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127834"></span>



<p>Dannenberg’s <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDannenberg%252c%2bAndrew%2bJ">retraction count</a> reached 20 last June, when <em>Cancer Prevention Research</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/03/former-weill-cornell-cancer-researcher-up-to-20-retractions-investigations-findings-are-with-feds/">retracted nine of his articles</a> at once. Subbaramaiah was a coauthor on all of the papers, and has 18 retractions <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKotha%2bSubbaramaiah">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported last year, Dannenberg and Subbaramaiah retired from Weill Cornell in late 2020 and early 2021. Dannenberg had received approximately $8 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health since 1995; Subbaramaiah received more than $1 million between 2005 and 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our story on the retractions, Dannenberg’s lawyer, Elizabeth McEvoy at the Boston firm Hinkley Allen, sent us this statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Dannenberg did not generate the problematic data nor prepare the figures necessitating retraction of any of the nine articles you reference; those data were prepared by another investigator, who is referenced in two of the Retraction Notices. At the time of publication, Dr. Dannenberg believed those data were valid and reliable and only came to learn more recently of concerns pertaining to those data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McAvoy has not yet responded to our request for comment on ORI’s findings. [See update at the end of this post.] However, the latest action suggests investigators were not satisfied Dannenberg was an innocent bystander in his colleague’s deception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subbaramaiah declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings state that Dannenberg agreed to have his research supervised for seven years – an unusually long term. Subbaramaiah agreed to “exclude himself” from federal contracting or receiving other government funding for the same length of time.</p>



<p>Update, 9/7/23, 2000 UTC: McEvoy sent us this statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fraudulent data in the retracted papers were generated&nbsp;and prepared&nbsp;by a faculty member in Dr. Dannenberg’s former laboratory,&nbsp;not by Dr. Dannenberg.&nbsp; Dr. Dannenberg believed the data produced in each of the implicated papers/grants were accurate and reliable when they were submitted.&nbsp; Dr. Dannenberg would never have published the data had he suspected or known that the data were manipulated or fabricated.&nbsp; Although Dr. Dannenberg believes he was careful and thorough in supervising data generation in his lab, he&nbsp;has reached a settlement with the Office of Research Integrity to allow him to continue&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp;his scientific endeavors in PHS-funded science&nbsp;and avoid the time and burden of further litigation.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grow-human-kidney-pig-embryo">Scientists grow humanized kidneys in pig embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have successfully grown kidneys made of mostly human cells inside pig embryos — taking researchers yet another step down the long road toward generating viable human organs for transplant.</p>



<p>The results, reported September 7 in <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2023.08.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mark the first time</a> a solid humanized organ, one with both human and animal cells, has been grown inside another species.</p>



<p>“This is a considerable progress in human-animal chimerism,” says Tao Tan, a cell biologist at the Kunming University of Science and Technology in China, who helped create the first chimeric <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human-monkey embryo</a> in 2021 but was not involved in the current study.</p>





<p>In the United States alone, more than 100,000 people <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently sit on an organ transplant waiting list</a>. A vast majority of those people need a kidney transplant. To meet this demand for life-saving organ transplants, scientists have been pursuing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-cells-grown-rats-cure-diabetes-mice">new methods to grow organs</a> and tissues in animals (<em>SN: 1/26/17</em>).</p>



<p>Advances in the last few years include <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31752-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing rat organs in mice</a> (and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vice versa</a>) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00693-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanized skeletal muscle</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0373-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endothelial tissue</a> in pigs. But significant hurdles remain, due in part to how challenging it is for human cells to thrive inside a foreign host. Human induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, which function as a sort of “starter kit” for growing many kinds of human tissue, often die when introduced into animals because the species’ cells have different physiological needs.</p>



<p>Stem cell biologist Liangxue Lai, of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China, and his team spent more than five years refining their methods to enhance the human stem cells’ survivability.</p>



<p>While the pig embryos were still just single cells, the team used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to edit out two genes necessary for kidney development. That created a niche in which the human iPSCs, once injected into the space, could develop into kidney cells. The human stem cells were also tweaked to have especially active genes that dampen apoptosis, or cell death, to keep the cells alive long enough to gain a foothold and begin forming the kidney.</p>



<p>More than 1,800 embryos were then transferred into surrogate sows, of which five were harvested for study within the first 28 days. All five had normal kidneys consistent with their level of development, and the organs contained 50 percent to 60 percent human-derived cells. That’s the highest percentage of human cells yet observed in any organ grown inside a pig, Tan says. Given more time, there’s no indication that the kidneys wouldn’t continue to grow and develop normally, possibly with the human cells increasingly edging out the pig cells, the researchers say.</p>

Wang <em>et al</em>/<em>Cell Stem Cell</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The study is “an important and interesting step,” says <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/massimo-mangiola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massimo Mangiola</a>, a transplant immunologist at New York University Langone Health who was not involved in the research. But it’s still many years out from fully functional xenotransplants, he notes.</p>



<p>While the stem cells did differentiate into several cell types, including kidney tubular cells and developmental tissue, the human kidney has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-021-00156-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 70 unique cell types</a> that scientists will need to recapitulate. And until researchers can create an organ that is 100 percent human, it’s likely that such transplants will prompt rejection.</p>



<p>In addition, a few iPSCs erroneously differentiated into neural cells in the brains and spinal cords of the embryos. Mangiola says that the cells appear to be random, unlike the kidney cells, making him think they’re not likely to result in animals with human brains — which would <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26078/chapter/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an ethical quandary</a>.</p>



<p>To avoid such ethical issues, Lai says that moving forward the team will knock out genes that orchestrate the stem cells’ differentiation into neurons — as well as into germline cells, eggs and sperm, which pass genetic information on to offspring. The team is also pursuing growing other human organ precursors in pigs as well, including the heart and pancreas.</p>





<p>“We feel that we have accomplished a milestone in the field, but this is only the first step, and many challenges remain,” Lai says. “We are optimistic that with time and effort we may be able to overcome these challenges too.”</p>

                <p>At PLOS, we are working to extend simple, free, and community-driven preprint options to each of the diverse research communities we serve. We believe that <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">posting preprints</a> empowers authors to take control of their scientific communications, disseminating results sooner and more broadly. At the same time preprinting serves the larger research community, contributing to a more efficient, more robust, and more equitable scientific record.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we made major progress in our efforts to increase access to preprinting when we partnered with <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a> to offer facilitated preprint posting in the fields of earth and planetary science. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">Since January 31st</a>, authors submitting to any of our three earth science-related journals have had the option to forward their manuscript to EarthArXiv with just a few clicks. And they have!</p>



<p>At <em>PLOS Climate</em>, 33% of published authors who submitted after the partnership went into effect chose to post a preprint using the integration. For <em>PLOS Water</em> authors that number is 47%. Six months after the launch of the integration, EarthArXiv preprints associated with PLOS submissions have already received more than 7,100 views and 3,900 downloads on the platform. This success follows in the footsteps of longstanding partnerships with the servers <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">medRxiv</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited to see how preprint posting rates continue to grow in the future. For now, you can learn more about the exciting work coming out of PLOS&rsquo; newest journals, and the preprint integration with EarthArXiv, in our <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/08/interview-with-the-authors-of-daily-stream-temperature-predictions/">interview with <em>PLOS Water</em> authors</a> Jared Siegel, Aimee Fullerton, Alyssa FitzGerald, Damon Holzer, and Chris Jordan on the Latitude blog.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-funga-flora-fauna-conservation-ecosystem">When discussing flora and fauna, don’t forget ‘funga’</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fungi. They grow between toes, on bread and in the shower. But the organisms also produce food and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-treat-depression-mushrooms-psychedelic">medicine </a>and act as ecosystem maids by decomposing dead matter — benefits that are sometimes overlooked (<em>SN: 11/17/20)</em>. That’s why the Fungi Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to fungi education and conservation, advocates for adding “funga” to the popular phrase “flora and fauna.”</p>



<p>The mushrooming movement is also backed by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwdGlnLIiFF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which in August called</a> for the addition of “a third ‘F’ — funga — to address the planetary challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.” More than 20 countries already use the term, including Australia, Iceland and Brazil.</p>





<p>Historically, fungi have been left out of most conservation discussions and plans, says mycologist Giuliana Furci, founder of the Fungi Foundation, which was created in Chile and is now based in the United States. While flora refers to an area’s plant diversity and fauna its animal diversity, fungi don’t fit into either category. “Fungi didn’t have a way in,” Furci says. “It’s about time they get this recognition.”</p>



<p>Whether a soil mold or a mushroom on a log, fungi face the same threats as other kingdoms of life, including habitat loss and climate change. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List includes more than 200 species of fungi that are either threatened or endangered. Fungi also form essential relationships with other organisms, like gut bacteria or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-microbes-climate-young-trees">the roots of plants</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/23)</em>. That means it is paramount that fungi are considered in conservation policies, Furci says. She and two other mycologists <a href="https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/BF03449441#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coined the term funga in 2018</a> in <em>IMA Fungus</em>. Mycota, the ancient Greek word for mushroom, would have been more accurate, but funga seemed catchier, Furci says.</p>



<p>The phrase has the potential to take off widely, says mycologist Catherine Gehring of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Using funga along with flora and fauna will be particularly powerful in nonscientist circles where the phrase could encourage interest in fungi among policymakers and the public, she says.</p>



<p>“[Fungi] are super valuable,” Gehring says. “It’s great to see the movement is gaining traction.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-bird-dinosaur-long-legs-fossil">This newfound birdlike dinosaur had surprisingly long legs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early birdlike dinosaurs are thought to have lived lofty lives up in the trees. But a newly discovered creature had surprisingly long legs that may have made for a life on the run.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06513-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leggy birdlike dino</a> (<em>Fujianvenator prodigiosus</em>) lived about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, researchers report September 6 in <em>Nature</em>. That’s around the same time as its distant cousin <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-had-wings-made-flapping-not-just-gliding"><em>Archaeopteryx</em></a>, one of the earliest known birds (<em>SN: 3/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>“It looks quite similar to <em>Archaeopteryx</em> … except the legs,” says paleontologist Min Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “<em>Fujianvenator</em> has really, really long legs.”</p>





<p>Wang and colleagues identified the creature as one of the earliest known avialans — a group that split off from the rest of dinosaurs and eventually became birds. The first avialans are key characters in the bird origin story. But little is known about them, Wang says, due to the scant diversity of fossils found.</p>

<p>Early avialans discovered so far, including <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, are generally short-limbed, apparently equipped for moving through the trees. Pheasant-sized <em>F. prodigiosus’</em> lower leg bones were twice as long as its thigh bones, a trait not found among the other known birdlike dinosaurs.</p>



<p>Entombed amid mudstones and shales in what is now southeastern China, the creature’s bones were discovered alongside fossils of aquatic and semiaquatic species. Those clues indicate that <em>F. prodigiosus</em> inhabited a swamplike environment. It probably dashed after prey like today’s ostriches or waded through water like a primitive crane, Wang says.</p>



<p>The first avialans weren’t all tree dwellers, he says. “It’s not the full picture.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/environmental-dna-leaf-swab-technique-biodiversity">A new DNA leaf swab technique could revolutionize how we monitor biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just a few swabs from a handful of leaves can say a lot about what animals are roaming in the area.</p>



<p>Two dozen leaf swabs from plants in Uganda’s Kibale National Park revealed <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00813-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a stunningly accurate genetic picture of the park’s vertebrate diversity</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 21 <em>Current Biology</em>. The swabs picked up environmental DNA, or eDNA, shed from 52 animals, 30 of which could be identified to the species level. The quick and easy technique is a potentially revolutionary way to monitor biodiversity.</p>





<p>“The fact that they could just swab a few leaves like that and get that many species is really kind of cool and remarkable,” says Julie Lockwood, a biologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>While we often picture DNA sitting safe and snug inside of cells, the truth is that particles of the genetic material are loose all over the environment. This eDNA often collects in “pools” in bodies of water or on surfaces like tree bark. Finding and analyzing eDNA can reveal what species are in an area — even those that are hard to spot.</p>



<p>Jan Gogarten, a biologist at the University of Greifswald in Germany, wanted to compare his eDNA source — flies that pick up DNA from dead animals and feces — with that of biologist Christina Lynggaard, who collects eDNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">from the air</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>). The two set out to compare their respective techniques in Kibale, but setting up the necessary air filters was time-consuming, so after collecting his flies, Gogarten decided to swab some nearby leaves while he waited.</p>



<p>“It was not something that we had planned before,” says Lynggaard, of the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>All the swabbing in the study, done across three areas of the park, took 72 minutes in total—an average of three minutes per swab. For comparison, Lynggaard ran air filters to collect eDNA for <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01690-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a minimum of 30 minutes</a> each in a prior study, not including time to set up and clean the apparatus. The researchers then brought the swabs back to Denmark for analysis.</p>



<p>The eDNA turned up many charismatic birds and mammals that are known to live in the park, including the great blue turaco (<em>Corythaeola cristata</em>) and the African bush elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana)</em>, but there were a few surprises too.</p>



<p>Colin Chapman, another collaborator on the project and a biologist at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, Canada, “has been working in the forest for 30-something years,” Gogarten says, “and he had bird species on the list that he hadn&#8217;t seen before,” but have been spotted in the park by others. “There’s a lot out there that we just don’t see” that can be revealed with eDNA.</p>



<p>What’s more, the swabs are more convenient to travel with compared with other sampling devices. Lockwood, for example, samples eDNA from plant surfaces <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using paint rollers</a>. With the smaller swabs, she says, “you can just use established forensic techniques to save the swabs and get them out of the field and take them back to the lab.”</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protecting-half-planet-climate-change-save-species">biodiversity declining in many areas around the globe</a>, sampling eDNA using techniques like leaf swabs “allows us a revolutionary step forward in our ability to document those changes and respond to them,” Lockwood says (<em>SN: 9/4/20</em>). “There&#8217;s not one tool for gathering the eDNA and processing everything that works in every case. So the more tools we have, the better off we are.”</p>



<p>Gogarten and Lynggaard hope that others will take their swabbing technique and run with it. Because the method “can be used by nonscientists,” Lynggaard says, “people interested in citizen science could … help researchers fight this biodiversity loss that we&#8217;re having worldwide.” </p>





<p>For example, schoolchildren armed with swabs, Gogarten says, could sample leaves in their backyards and produce a picture of their own area’s biodiversity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-holes-rare-jwst">Active supermassive black holes may be rarer than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fewer supermassive black holes may undergo growth spurts than astronomers had suspected.</p>



<p>Every known large galaxy hosts a gargantuan black hole at its center. Some of those behemoths experience bursts of beefing up, during which time they blaze brightly. But recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned up far fewer of these active black holes than expected</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>If confirmed, the finding raises questions about how some supermassive black holes got to be so big and what, if any, impact they have on the galaxies they inhabit.</p>





<p>Huge black holes, such as the one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-black-hole-active">at the center of the Milky Way</a>, tend to be pretty quiet (<em>SN: 6/28/23</em>). But occasionally, a surge of interstellar detritus rains down upon them — often following a collision with another galaxy — creating what’s called an active galactic nucleus, or AGN. Here, the heart of the host galaxy emits copious amounts of light at all wavelengths as the influx of material swirling around the black hole heats up. An AGN can not only outshine their host galaxies, but they are also the brightest persistent sources of light in the universe.</p>



<p>In 2017, astronomer Allison Kirkpatrick of the University of Kansas in Lawrence and colleagues predicted that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa911d#apjaa911ds3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JWST’s infrared eyes would find lots of these active black holes</a> based on observations from other, less sensitive, space-based infrared telescopes. In the new study, Kirkpatrick and her team turned JWST toward a well-studied strip of sky where, in 2008, the Spitzer Space Telescope had <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/525273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found infrared signatures of active galactic nuclei in nearly a third of the 19 galaxies</a> it studied.</p>



<p>Those galaxies, seen as they were around the peak of cosmic star formation roughly 10 billion years ago, were all relatively bright and massive. JWST is much more sensitive than Spitzer, so it’s capable of spotting fainter, more average-sized galaxies at the same epoch — ones more comparable in size to the Milky Way. And yet, out of the nearly 500 galaxies that JWST spotted, all observed for the first time, just 6 percent appear to contain active galactic nuclei, the team reports.</p>



<p>“We are actually probing a new population” of galaxies, says Tonima Tasnim Ananna, an astronomer at Wayne State University in Detroit, who was not involved with the study. The new data come from the far reaches of the universe, a region now more accessible than ever before thanks to JWST.</p>



<p>The new-to-us galaxies appear to be filled with interstellar dust. So it is possible, Kirkpatrick says, that fast-growing black holes are hiding in these distant dusty galaxies, and researchers just don’t have the technical capabilities to identify them yet.</p>



<p>If there really aren’t as many of these fast-growing black holes as once thought, it would throw astronomers’ understanding of black hole and galaxy formation for a loop. Supermassive black holes can weigh as much as several million — or even several billion — suns. The AGN phase is thought to be an important step for gathering so much mass.</p>



<p>“Maybe all galaxies don’t go through this active phase, [and] their black holes grow pretty slowly,” Kirkpatrick says. This would mean that some supermassive black holes would need to have started out relatively hefty, rather than growing up from comparably tiny objects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And an active black hole doesn’t just grow quickly in isolation. It also affects its host galaxy. “It gets really, really hot” in an AGN, Kirkpatrick says. That can make it harder for the host galaxy to form stars, which need relatively cool gas to get started.</p>



<p>And the radiation pressure around a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole can be powerful enough to launch winds “like a trillion hurricanes just ripping through your galaxy,” Kirkpatrick says. These winds could, in turn, make things too unstable near the galaxy’s center for planets to form that are capable of sustaining life, she says. But if many black holes aren’t going through an AGN phase, they may not be influencing their host galaxies all that much.</p>



<p>Another explanation for the apparent dearth of active black holes in the new JWST data is that many supermassive black holes could grow up through periodic, short bursts of activity. In that case, they would have influenced the galaxy around them — but such bursts would be virtually undetectable.</p>





<p>If the black holes “just flicker on and off for short time periods,” Kirkpatrick says, “you&#8217;re never going to find these things. You&#8217;re never going to be able to understand how the black holes are growing.”</p>



<p>More answers could be coming soon: Kirkpatrick is planning to use JWST again in January to conduct an even larger search. Instead of the nearly 500 galaxies used in this study, she says, “I&#8217;m going to have probably 4,000 galaxies to look at now.”</p>

                <p><strong>Transferable skills make STEM graduates highly employable outside research settings, but how do you identify those that are specific to you? Abi Parsons reflects on the importance of making time for personal development during your PhD. </strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_e7abb3a0b339403e8c5405633fefffad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Photo by Alvaro Reyes on Unsplash." ></figure><p>During the course of your PhD, it is easy to identify which laboratory techniques you’ve learnt. We are explicitly trained on these by more senior scientists and, usually, it’s clear if you have successfully followed a protocol or not. Progress isn't always as clear for ‘transferable’ skills and wider career development. Taking time to identify the transferable skills that you have developed during your studies is something we should all do. As well as helping you to tailor your CV and nail job interviews, this exercise can also serve as a reminder that a PhD is so much more than a training in lab work.</p>

<p>Think about an average day in the lab. You likely arrive with an idea of what needs to be done that day, and how that work fits into the wider project. This is a classic example of effective <strong>project management. </strong>The down-time or incubation periods between experiments are often spent planning out the next steps. Many of us run experiments in tandem, making clever use of those calmer moments to maximise how much we can get done in a day. Being able to view your PhD as a large project with individual experiments making up pieces of the puzzle trains us in good time management and organisation. As we progress, these skills become second nature to us, so it should be unsurprising that PhD students make very good project managers.</p>

<p>A near-universal experience of PhD students is explaining your research to a non-expert audience. This doesn’t have to mean holding events at science festivals or doing school visits, it’s also talking about your work with family and friends who may not have a scientific background. Within my own family, breaking down my research into accessible terms is a skill that naturally developed and, in doing so, massively improved my <strong>communication </strong>skills. This comes in handy when attending conferences, giving me the opportunity to discuss my research with other scientists from a basic to an expert level.  Adapting communication styles depending on the circumstance is a skill that is highly prized outside of a research career.</p>
<p>Many PhD students are also involved in teaching throughout their program, a job in which effective communication is essential. This could be through informal support of undergraduate or placement students undertaking short projects in the lab, or by working part time as practical class demonstrators. Through such roles, PhD students get further experience in communication and <strong>leadership</strong>. Assisting a group of new students through their first laboratory classes is a rewarding, but challenging, experience. Balancing this kind of paid work with our own research is also another example of good time and project management.</p>

<p>Since the start of my PhD I have constantly been <strong>problem solving</strong>. This includes academic challenges, piecing together the science of my project and overcoming logistical obstacles. No doubt at some point during your PhD you’ve had an experiment planned only for an antibody not to work, a piece of equipment to break or some other bout of scientific misfortune to occur. Unfortunately, this is all part of the process. Rather than giving up when faced with these obstacles, PhD students must adapt, plan a slightly different experiment and move the project forward. These conditions can be difficult but allow us to develop some pretty strong resilience in the process.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my PhD so far, it’s clear that my transferable skills are just as important and useful as my scientific training. A PhD really does teach you more than just lab skills, but with so much focus on the science it is easy to overlook our personal development. To identify those applicable to you, walk through a standard day and reflect on all those moments you are not actively doing lab work. What are you doing? Has it become easier with time? If so, that’s a skill you’ve developed through experience. Write them down, list clear examples of using them, and reflect on how you came to develop them. You’ll quickly realise that your scientific skills aren't the only thing you’ve developed in your PhD.</p><hr><p>This article was written by Abi Parsons and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p>Now, after two paper retractions and plagiarism allegations, there’s a haze of suspicion around Dias, and some physicists are worried that outsiders might suspect that the entire field is in disarray. “The big risk is that this whole thing … sheds a negative light on this field,” says theoretical physicist Lilia Boeri.</p>





<p>But other research on high-temperature superconductors is solid, many researchers say. Multiple groups have replicated key results, and theoretical calculations agree with real-world experiments. Physicists are investigating new classes of superconductors and confirming theoretical predictions. The hope is that such gradual advances will eventually lead scientists to a more practical superconductor.</p>



<p>“The sad thing is that there is a lot of nice work going on in the field but this [controversy] has taken so much attention,” says Boeri, of the Sapienza University of Rome.</p>



<p>To further shore up the scientific legitimacy of their claims, scientists are now developing new ways to identify superconductivity, debating what standards should be met before one can claim to have achieved superconductivity, and discussing new norms around sharing data.</p>



<p>The work, scientists say, could help researchers stave off any future questionable claims of superconductivity, which aren’t uncommon in physics. “We all recognize that our field is in danger of being written off by the wider scientific community because of all of the false positives,” says theoretical physicist Peter Hirschfeld of the University of Florida in Gainesville.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Controversy surrounding Dias’ superconductivity claims keeps growing</h4>



<p>With the power to conduct electricity without resistance, superconductors promise to transform modern technology — if they can be made to function at temperatures and pressures fit for everyday use. This tantalizing possibility fuels hype to levels uncommon in the typically esoteric realm of physics research.</p>



<p>The first eye-popping superconductivity claim from Dias’ group came in 2020. While most superconductors must be cooled to very cold temperatures to function, a material of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">remained superconducting up to 15° Celsius</a> (59° Fahrenheit), he and colleagues reported in <em>Nature </em>(<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>That material, like many of the highest-temperature superconductors, had to be squeezed to high pressure, meaning it was not feasible for practical use. Still, it was purportedly the first demonstration of a long-sought room-temperature superconductor.</p>



<p>But after other scientists raised doubts about the data and methods, <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">retracted the paper</a>, against the protestations of Dias and the other authors (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>In March, Dias’ team countered with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-scrutiny">an even bigger claim</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/23</em>). A material made of lutetium, nitrogen and hydrogen superconducts at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">room temperature and under pressures much closer to atmospheric pressure</a>, they reported in <em>Nature</em>.</p>

Adam Fenster/University of Rochester</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, skeptics delved into Dias’ history, alleging <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread plagiarism in his Ph.D. thesis</a>, according to an analysis reported in a news article in <em>Science</em>. The digging also <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.016401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagged a 2021 paper</a> that Dias coauthored in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, or <em>PRL</em>, unrelated to the two <em>Nature</em> papers on superconductivity. An investigation by <em>PRL </em>found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02401-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of data fabrication</a>, <em>Nature </em>reported in July. With the agreement of all the authors but Dias, <em>PRL </em><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.079902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted the paper</a> on August 15.</p>



<p>Asked about the retraction, Dias asserted in an email that “there has been no data fabrication, data manipulation or any other scientific misconduct in connection with our work.”</p>





<p>Dias is now under investigation by the University of Rochester, a university spokesperson said.</p>



<p>Amid all this controversy, outsiders might imagine that the entire field is fishy, says physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. “But in fact, it’s completely not so, because other people … are doing really good, great and very well-confirmed [work].”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Reproducibility is key for high-temperature superconductors</h4>



<p>High-pressure physics is highly specialized, and experiments that succeed in one laboratory can be challenging to replicate elsewhere. But consensus has gradually formed around several record-breaking superconductors.</p>



<p>The research centers around hydrogen-rich materials known as hydrides. This choice was inspired by a prediction that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pressure-make-metallic-hydrogen">pure hydrogen would become a superconducting metal</a> when squeezed to extreme pressure (<em>SN: 8/10/16</em>). Since those pressures proved difficult to reach, scientists added other elements to hydrogen in hopes of lowering the pressure needed.</p>



<p>The first major success was a compound of sulfur and hydrogen, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-big-stride-superconductivity">broke the record at the time for the highest-temperature superconductor</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>). It <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconducts up to around 203 kelvins</a> (−70° C), Eremets and colleagues reported in <em>Nature </em>in 2015. Then, in 2018, scientists crowned the current record holder (discounting Dias’ work), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">a compound of lanthanum and hydrogen</a>, which superconducts up to about −20° C (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>In both cases, multiple groups have confirmed the results. And theoretical calculations agree that the materials are superconducting at these high temperatures. Even so, both superconductors require a squeeze more than a million times the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere, limiting their practical usefulness. Other high-temperature superconductors, such as yttrium hydride, have also been replicated by multiple groups.</p>



<p>In contrast, physicists have struggled to conclusively reproduce the Dias group’s lutetium superconductor, or to come up with a convincing theoretical explanation for it. Coupled with the previous retractions, that leaves many researchers doubtful. “I absolutely do not trust any results of this group,” says physicist Dmitrii Semenok of the Center for High Pressure Science &amp; Technology Advanced Research in Beijing.</p>



<p>In an email, Dias waved away concerns, writing that “if&nbsp;people are struggling to replicate my work, that’s not surprising — not everyone will be able to do what took me years to accomplish.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">New superconducting materials make their debut</h4>



<p>In the light of the retractions and failed replications, many physicists think other developments in the field are more worthy of their attention.</p>



<p>One hot topic is ternary hydrides, materials in which hydrogen is combined with two additional elements instead of just one. By exploring the many possible combinations of elements in the periodic table, physicists hope to find new superconductors that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-pressure-physics-electricity">work at lower pressures and higher temperatures</a> than the hydrides studied so far (<em>SN: 3/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>In June, scientists reported the first example of a ternary hydride with a brand-new structure of atoms, never seen in previous binary hydrides. Made of lanthanum, beryllium and hydrogen, the material was <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.266001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconducting up to about 100 kelvins</a> (about −173° C), researchers report in a paper published in <em>PRL.</em> That’s not a record by any means. But the material requires less pressure than some other hydrides, says physicist Yanming Ma of Jilin University in Changchun, China. “We have the first example. Then later on, maybe people [will] build on our work.”</p>



<p>In another recent development, physicists tied up a decade-old loose end. A superconductor predicted in 2012, calcium hydride, was finally produced, two independent teams reported in 2022 <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.167001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in <em>PRL</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30454-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>. This was the first hydride superconductor predicted with a “clathrate” structure, in which the hydrogen atoms form a cage around another type of atom.</p>



<p>This clathrate structure has since been found in other high-temperature superconductors, including the accepted record holder, lanthanum hydride. The discovery of calcium hydride “is a really nice success,” says theoretical physicist Eva Zurek of the University at Buffalo in New York. “Examples like this go counter to saying … that the whole field is doing crappy work.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="492" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3.jpg" alt="A chemical diagram shows lanthanum atoms in blue and a beryllium atom in red surrounded by a cage of hydrogen atoms in light blue." class="wp-image-3130890" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-529x383.jpg 529w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-622x450.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-3-257x186.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130890">Most hydrogen-rich superconductors that scientists have discovered are made from hydrogen with the addition of one other element, what’s called a binary hydride.

Here, lanthanum atoms (blue) and a beryllium atom (red) are surrounded by a cage of hydrogen atoms (light blue).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130890">G. Liu/Jilin University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So far, hydrides still require a hefty squeeze to superconduct. “It’s very difficult to lower the pressure of these … hydrides to ambient conditions,” says theoretical physicist Hanyu Liu of Jilin University.</p>



<p>Some physicists are going beyond hydrogen. Physicist Timothy Strobel is swapping in other light elements. He’s studying clathrates made not with hydrogen but with boron and carbon — the fifth and sixth elements on the periodic table.</p>



<p>In such materials, “we would expect moderately high-temperature superconductivity, but not as high as hydrogen,” says Strobel, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>But that trade-off may be worth it. With such materials, scientists hope to find structures sturdy enough to persist at atmospheric pressure. It’s similar to carbon’s most flashy form, diamond, which forms under pressure but remains intact once that pressure is released. In a paper published in January in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, Zurek, Strobel and colleagues predict that <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c10089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some flavors of these materials could be superconductors</a> at temperatures up to 88 kelvins (about –185° Celsius ) under atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>That might seem low in comparison to the high-pressure hydrides. But temperatures above 77 kelvins (about −196° C), the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, are more easily achievable in practical use, because costly liquid helium isn’t required for coolant. In contrast, high pressures are currently prohibitive for practical purposes. Reaching ambient pressure may be more important than room temperature, Strobel argues.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Physicists want to raise the bar for claiming superconductivity</h4>



<p>In parallel to investigating new superconductors, high-pressure physicists are also discussing how to avoid controversies in their field in the future.</p>



<p>Some are calling for more sharing of raw data, with the intent of making claims easier to check and experiments easier to replicate. Semenok, for example, posts raw data online for most of his papers. Other physicists in the field find the idea appealing. “This really should be standard for major journals,” Eremets says. “In our age, why not?”</p>



<p>While Dias’ group provided data associated with their lutetium superconductor paper in <em>Nature</em>, that hasn’t satisfied other scientists. “In my mind, basically none of the data that’s been uploaded is raw data,” says physicist James Hamlin&nbsp;of the University of Florida in Gainesville. “Raw data is a data file that was created by your measurement software on the day of the measurement and then not touched after that point.” The Dias team’s data doesn’t fit that bill, Hamlin says.</p>



<p>Physicists are also working to strengthen the evidence for superconductivity in their materials. It’s not all about resistance, or lack thereof. Superconductors exhibit other hallmarks. One telltale sign is the Meissner effect, in which a material expels magnetic fields. This and other effects can help confirm that the superconductivity is real.</p>



<p>But high-pressure experiments involve mere specks of material squeezed between two diamonds. Making clear measurements of the Meissner effect and other hallmarks of superconductivity can be difficult under such conditions.</p>



<p>So scientists are coming up with additional ways to confirm superconductivity. For example, when certain types of superconductors are exposed to a magnetic field and the magnetic field is later switched off, a residual magnetic field remains trapped within the superconductor. In a June paper in <em>Nature Physics</em>, Eremets and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02089-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measurements of trapped magnetic fields</a> in both the sulfur and lanthanum hydrides, further solidifying the case for their superconductivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="271" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2.jpg" alt="A gloved hand points to a diamond anvil cell in a lab." class="wp-image-3130893" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090123_EC_superconductor_inline-2-330x132.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130893">To create new superconductors under high pressure, researchers squeeze materials inside diamond anvil cells like the one shown, which was used by physicist Mikhail Eremets and colleagues. Special techniques are needed to demonstrate conclusive signs of superconductivity in the tiny amounts of material contained within such cells.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130893">Stephen Bilenky</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some physicists are also calling for a set of criteria that scientists would be expected to meet before claiming to have found a new superconductor. “There should be some general standard of what one should prove to claim superconductivity,” Boeri says.</p>



<p>Besides measuring a dramatic drop in resistivity, Hirschfeld suggests requiring other markers of superconductivity, such as showing that a magnetic field lowers the temperature below which a material becomes a superconductor. Several other measurements would be required for the scientific community to accept the result, with the results confirmed by independent groups.</p>



<p>Despite efforts to bolster superconductor research, spurious claims of room-temperature superconductivity will probably be challenging to eliminate. “It’s not something rare; it happens from time to time,” Semenok says. The allure of the room-temperature superconductor looms large. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Case in point — a purported room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor called LK-99, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported prior to peer review</a> at arXiv.org in July, went viral on social media. Further scientific investigation <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/room-temperature-superconductor-lk-99-fails-replication-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon mostly debunked</a> the claim.</p>



<p>As for Dias, his lutetium-based superconductor still stands in the scientific record — for now. After researchers raised concerns about the paper, <em>Nature </em>began looking into it. “We are currently assessing concerns that have been raised with us, but we cannot discuss the specifics of those concerns relating to any particular paper while such post-publication assessments are underway,” a spokesperson for&nbsp;<em>Nature </em>said.</p>



<p>The paper now bears a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautionary editor’s note</a>. The reliability of the paper’s data, it says, is in question.</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University who <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resigned following scrutiny</a> of his published papers and an <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">institutional research misconduct investigation</a>, has retracted a third paper, this one from <em>Cell</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last week, Tessier-Lavigne <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">retracted two articles from <em>Science</em></a> that had been published in 2001.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Cell</em> paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400808041">A Ligand-Gated Association between Cytoplasmic Domains of UNC5 and DCC Family Receptors Converts Netrin-Induced Growth Cone Attraction to Repulsion</a>, was published in 1999.

<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423009133">retraction notice</a> was posted Monday. It states:</p>



<span id="more-127825"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the authors.</p>



<p>In 2015, we, the authors, consulted with <em>Cell</em> editors about issues that had been brought to our attention about this paper, specifically image splicing in Figures 3C, 5A, 5B, and 7B–7D and duplication of blank blots in Figure 7C. <em>Cell</em> declined to publish a Correction at that time because in 1999, when the paper was published, the journal did not have policies prohibiting unmarked image splicing and because, for the duplication, there was insufficient information to determine intent, and the impact of the duplication on the paper’s conclusions was limited. In 2022, when new concerns were raised, <em>Cell</em> posted an Editorial Expression of Concern (<em>Cell</em> 186, 230 [2023], https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.019) while an institutional investigation was conducted. The investigation is complete and has revealed further issues including manipulation of data-containing portions of Western blot images in Figures 3A–3C, 7A, 7B, and 7D, undermining confidence in the paper’s conclusions (https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf). As a result, we are retracting the paper. We regret the impact of these issues on the scientific community.</p>



<p>Two of the authors, K. Hong and M. Nishiyama, could not be contacted to sign this retraction. E. Stein declined to sign the retraction.</p>

<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “issues” the authors discussed with the <em>Cell</em> editors in 2015 were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/250D42FBB7D7298E704BFD6CD8B22A#1">flagged</a> by anonymous PubPeer users, as also happened with the <em>Science</em> papers retracted last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stanford’s investigation of the allegations, spurred by <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/stanford-presidents-research-under-investigation-for-scientific-misconduct-university-admits-mistakes/">reporting in the student newspaper</a>, determined four of Tessier-Lavigne’s papers contained “apparent manipulation of research data by others,” but Tessier-Lavigne was not responsible.&nbsp;<br>In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/news/message-stanford-community">statement</a> posted to his lab website on July 19, the same day as Stanford’s report was published, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to retract the <em>Science</em> and <em>Cell</em> articles and was in touch with <em>Nature</em> about a “thorough correction” to a 2004 paper.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bone-marrow-skull-alzheimers-ms-diseases">Bone marrow in the skull could be used to monitor Alzheimer’s, MS and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cells hidden in the skull may point to a way to detect, diagnose and treat inflamed brains.</p>



<p>A detailed look at the skull reveals that bone marrow cells there change and are recruited to the brain after injury, possibly traveling through tiny channels connecting the skull and the outer protective layer of the brain. Paired with the discovery that inflammation in the skull is disease-specific, these new findings collectively suggest the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0213-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skull’s marrow could serve as a target to track and potentially treat neurological disorders</a> involving brain inflammation, researchers report August 9 in <em>Cell</em>.</p>





<p>Immune cells that infiltrate the central nervous system during many diseases and neuronal injury can wreak havoc by flooding the brain with damaging molecules. This influx of immune cells causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-helps-disease-causing-immune-cells-invade-ms-patient-brains">can contribute to diseases like multiple sclerosis</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). Detecting and dampening this reaction has been an extensive field of research.</p>



<p>With this new work, the skull, “something that has been considered as just protective, suddenly becomes a very active site of interaction with the brain, not only responding to brain diseases, but also changing itself in response to brain diseases,” says Gerd Meyer zu Hörste, a neurologist at University of Münster in Germany who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Ali Ertürk of the Helmholtz Center in Munich and colleagues discovered this potential role for the skull while probing the idea that the cells in skull marrow might behave differently from those in other bones. Ertürk&#8217;s team compared the genetic activity of cells in mice skull marrow, and the proteins those cells made, with those in the rodent’s humerus, femur and four other bones, along with the meninges, the protective membranes between the skull and the brain.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Cells in the skull, particularly a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, differed from those in other bones but were similar to those in the meninges, the team found. And brain injury widened those differences. In mice with stroke symptoms, the activity in skull cells of genes related to cell migration and inflammation was higher than in other bone cells, suggesting that the cells respond to whatever is happening in the brain.</p>



<p>In another experiment, Ertürk and colleagues compared the profile of proteins in human skull cells with those in the pelvis or the vertebra. Skull marrow cells presented brain proteins while the other bones did not. “This tells us that the communication is two-way,” Ertürk says.</p>



<p>Those discoveries seemed important, but only if the skull and brain had a way to send cells back and forth. A few years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-tunnels-immune-cells-brain-injuries">observed connecting “tunnels” between the skull and the meninges in mice and humans</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/18</em>). More recently, another team showed that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf7844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune cells from the skull were actually getting into the brains</a> of mice, an observation made again in the new study.</p>



<p>To get a better look at the human tunnels, the team used a technique that makes tissue transparent, along with 3-D imaging, to inspect the bone and tissue of people who had died. That revealed a clear path to connect the skull and meninges, something “never been imaged in that much detail in humans before,” says Meyer zu Hörste.</p>



<p>The study “shows the connections very beautifully,” he says, “but how functionally relevant they are still needs to be studied.”</p>



<p>The team did track the location and levels of neuroinflammation in the skulls of people who have Alzheimer’s disease, stroke or multiple sclerosis using PET imaging. The pattern of skull inflammation was different with each disease. For example, in people with MS, there was a huge inflammation signal at the base of the skull, which was not present in people with stroke or Alzheimer’s.</p>





<p>“The inflammatory signature was moving depending on the nature of the neurological disorder,” says Ilgin Kolabas, a neuroscientist in Ertürk’s lab. The signal even increased in specific regions in the skulls of people with Alzheimer’s, a possible sign of the progression of the disease.</p>



<p>Because these signals might be mirroring what is happening in the brain, they could serve as a proxy for neuroinflammation, Kolabas says. The team anticipates these findings could help with both diagnosis and treatment of stroke, Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders using less invasive methods than spinal taps or other alternatives.</p>



<p>But the technology is still not sufficiently advanced for that yet; future studies need to address whether skull inflammation can actually be measured and targeted to attack brain diseases, Meyer zu Hörste says. “There is a lot of work left to be done.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adult-coral-frozen-survive-climate-change">Adult corals have been safely frozen and revived for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like something out of science fiction, small colonies of mature corals have been safely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40500-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frozen and revived</a> for the first time, though more work will be needed to ensure their long-term survival, researchers report August 23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Freezing chunks of living corals for safekeeping — or cryopreserving them — could save them from extinction as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">the oceans heat up</a> and acidify from human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 8/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers had already cryopreserved and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-larvae-survive-being-frozen-and-thawed-first-time">revived coral larvae</a> with success (<em>SN: 10/26/18)</em>. But larvae are accessible only when corals spawn, so just a few nights each year, says marine scientist Liza Roger of Arizona State University in Tempe. “That’s putting a lot of eggs in one basket.” What’s worse, she says, coral reproduction is struggling, and fewer larvae are surviving, thanks to warming seas.</p>





<p>With larvae collection becoming more difficult, one solution is to cryopreserve mature coral colonies, which are available year-round. If humans can reverse climate warming, preserved adult corals could help rebuild reef ecosystems in more hospitable seas. But larger specimens are harder to cryopreserve; it’s more difficult to prevent ice formation, which damages tissues somewhat like pipes cracking in the winter.</p>



<p>Thermodynamicist Matthew Powell-Palm of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station and his team experimented with freezing pea-sized pieces of a common Hawaiian finger coral, an anthozoan called <em>Porites compressa</em>. Using menthol and light, the researchers first removed microbes that could interfere with preservation. Next, the fragments were sealed within rigid metal chambers filled with a special chemical solution that partially dehydrated the corals and helped mitigate ice growth, then plunged into liquid nitrogen.</p>



<p>Amid the roughly –200° C temperatures, bathed in chemicals and restrained by the stubborn chamber walls, the remaining water in the corals solidified into a glassy form — or vitrified — without expanding into ice crystals. At such frigid conditions, Powell-Palm says, metabolic reactions and other life-driving processes “crawl to such an infinitesimally slow pace, you could preserve [living specimens] for hundreds, possibly thousands of years.”</p>



<p>But the real test came next. After a couple minutes spent in cryopreservation, the corals were pulled from the nippy nitrogen and put through a careful, 24-hour thawing and recovery routine. Then, the researchers measured how much oxygen the thawed corals were consuming. One day after thawing, the corals were alive and well.</p>



<p>The results are promising, but the team’s work isn’t finished, Roger says. As things stand, a few days after thawing, the corals were still so stressed out from the cryopreservation process, they were overrun and killed by bacteria they normally live in harmony with. The next steps should be to help the revived reef builders survive in the long-term, she says.</p>



<p>Powell-Palm is optimistic. Applying the right antibiotics, he says, could help the brave coral crumbs thrive in whatever new world they’re revived in.</p>

<p>Elsevier journals are retracting eight studies after learning that one of the authors on the papers was “fictitious” – as in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">similar case</a> we reported on recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ostensible author, Toshiyuki Bangi, was listed as affiliated with the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The eight studies, which were cited a collective 47 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, were published in three different journals — <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>, the <em>Journal of Building Engineering</em>, and <em>Case Studies in Construction Materials</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061822020621?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a> is the same for each paper, and states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127818"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following a complaint made by the Office of Research Integrity of the National Technical University (NTU) of Singapore, an investigation determined that the co-author “Toshiyuki Bangi” is fictitious; the name and affiliation were added to the paper by the corresponding author. NTU is in no way involved in this deception and the fictitious author was assigned a hotmail.com email address.</p>



<p>Manipulation of authorship is a serious violation of publication ethics that distorts the research record and draws all aspects of the work into question.</p>



<p>The corresponding author has admitted the deceit and understands the need for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author for all of the papers is Cong Zhang, a researcher in the School of Environmental and Civil Engineering at Jiangnan University in China. He did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The practice of listing “gift” or “honorary” authors, who have made little or no notable contribution to a paper, is sometimes an attempt to boost the reputation or prestige of research. Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">recently reported</a> on another case where this included inventing the entire identity of a researcher at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roderick Wayland Bates, NTU’s research integrity officer and an associate professor of chemistry, chemical engineering, and biotechnology at the institution, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I understand that this fictitious author was added to the paper as they thought that having an author from a well known University would improve the paper&#8217;s chances in the review process. As a reviewer myself, I am not influenced by addresses, but some people might be. The review system, despite its limitations, is the process that ensures the quality of academic publications. That is why it has to be protected from attempted abuse such as this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bates said he found out about the retraction from the university library, which heard about Bangi from a person in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, where Bangi supposedly worked. Bates said he isn’t sure how people think they can get away with adding fictional authors, since that person’s supposed colleagues are bound to notice and ask who the person is.</p>



<p>In addition to not having a university email, no profile for Bangi appears in NTU’s <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/faculty-directory?searchFaculty=&amp;interests=all&amp;page=1">faculty directory</a>. Attempts by Retraction Watch to contact Bangi at his listed email address yielded no response.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As indicated within the Retraction Notice, the paper was retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) following a complaint received on 1 March 2023. The EIC wrote to the corresponding author and on the 3 March 2023, the author acknowledged the need for retraction.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mike C. Forde, the Editor-in-Chief of Construction and Building Materials, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm that this paper was retracted by Construction and Building Materials with a notice explaining why the paper was retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Editors-in-Chief of the other two journals did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though Elsevier, as well as the publishing arm of the American Society of Civil Engineers, have retracted all articles published in their journals that included Bangi’s name, other journals with papers that list Bangi as an author remain unmarked — for instance, <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2022/7615616/">“Influence of Distribution Modulus on the Compressive Strength of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete with Coarse Aggregate (UHPC-CA)</a> in the journal <em>Advances in Civil Engineering</em>.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/04/interesting-papers-on-online-motion-correction-for-calcium-imaging/">Interesting papers on online motion correction for calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a living animal, the brain is moving up and down in the skull. This brain motion can be due to breathing, heartbeat, tongue movements, but also due to changes of posture or running. For each brain region and posture, specific brain movements are more likely to occur. For imaging of neuronal activity using two-photon microscopy through a window, the coverslip glass is usually gently pressed onto the brain to reduce motion. As a consequence, brain motion is typically smaller close to the glass surface and becomes more prominent for imaging deeper below the surface.</p>



<p><strong>Why axial movement artifacts are bad</strong></p>



<p>From the point of view of data analysis, there are two fundamentally different types of brain movements: Lateral movements (within the xy-imaging plane) and axial movement (in the axial z-direction). The first type can be corrected (except in the boundary region of the FOV) by shifting the image back to the “right place” within the plane. Axial movement, on the other hand, shifts the imaging focus to a different depth and cannot be corrected. From my experience, these axial motion artifacts are often underestimated and often ignored. But even if they are small (and barely visible by eye after non-rigid xy-motion correction), they might have an effect when an analysis averages across a lot of repetitions or &#8220;trials&#8221;. Especially for low imaging resolution and low signal-to-noise, it is often difficult to judge by eye whether something was due to z-motion or due to neuronal activity related to movement (or due to both). Imaging of small structures like axons or laterally-spreading dendrites is especially prone to movement artifacts, and there are many additional edge cases where brain movement might influence the analysis. Ideally, one would be able to correct for z-motion online during the recording. For example, when the brain moves up by 5 µm, the focus of the microscope would move up by the same amount, therefore imaging the same tissue despite the motion. Typically, z-motion of the brain is relatively slow, often below 20 Hz in mice. An online motion correction algorithm would therefore be required to work at a temporal responsiveness of, let’s say 40-50 Hz.</p>



<p><strong>ECG-synchronized image acquisition</strong></p>



<p>There have been several suggested methods to solve this problem. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2012.228114">Paukert and Bergles (2012)</a> developed a method to correct for only lateral (and not axial) movement, but the methods is still worth mentioning. They recorded the electro-cardiogram (ECG) and used the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex#/media/File:SinusRhythmLabels.svg">R-wave</a> to reliable trigger image acquisition. Therefore, they did not really correct for heartbeat-induced motion but rather recorded such that brain motion was the same for all acquired imaging frames. Better imaging preparations (more pressure exerted onto the brain by the coverslip window) have made this approach less relevant for cortical imaging. However, for deeper imaging, e.g., with 3P microscopy, the stabilization through the coverslip is reduced. Therefore, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01257-6">Streich et al. (2021)</a> used ECG-synchronized 3P scanning to improve image quality. They went a few steps further than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2012.228114">Paukert and Bergles (2012)</a> using the past heartbeats to predict &#8211; online with an FPGA &#8211; the next R-wave and to stop image acquisition around the R-wave window.</p>



<p><strong>Correction of stereotypic axial motion with an ETL</strong></p>



<p>A conceptually similar method has been developed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.259804">Chen et al. (2013)</a>. They also wanted to avoid motion artifacts induced by clearly defined motion-related events – not heartbeats in this case, but licking events. Depending on the brain region and the effort the mouse has to make, licking can cause huge motion artifacts. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.259804">Chen et al. (2013)</a> did not want to stop imaging during licking but instead wanted to correct the axial focus using a electrically tunable lens (ETL). They observed that licks consistently changed the focus of the imaging plane. They therefore used a lick sensor and fed its output to a corrective signal that moved the focus of the ETL in a calibrated manner. The idea is therefore based on the assumption that lick-induced movement is stereotyped. Therefore, one might have to recalibrate the correction algorithm for each mouse or for motion due to other parts of the body. However, it is, to my knowledge, the first attempt to really correct for axial brain motion in vivo.<br />It would be interesting to combine the recording of more diverse behaviors using a video camera with fast processing and with a predictive component as by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01257-6">Streich et al. (2021)</a> to develop a more general brain movement predictor and corrector. For example, an algorithm could map behaviors to expected brain movements for 10 min and then perform recordings with perfectly predicted brain motion that can be anticipated and corrected by an ETL or another remote scanning device. Wouldn&#8217;t this be cool?</p>



<p><strong>Using the sample surface as a reference</strong></p>



<p>Another set of methods tries to image the brain and at the same time perform a scan of a reference object in the brain (a “guide star”), or the brain surface or the brain itself, in order to extract the desired corrective factor for scanning in real-time.<br /><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019928">Laffray et al. (2011)</a> used a reflective imaging modality to detect the position of the spinal cord (which is well known to move a lot!). In their approach, they only corrected for lateral brain motion, most likely because their microscope was not equipped with a z-scanning device. But it seems possible to generalize this method to axial movement correction as well. The limitation of this approach is that the brain surface is typically pressured by a coverslip and does not move so much &#8211; it is rather the deeper parts of the brain that move much more.</p>



<p><strong>Scanning a reference object with an AOD scope</strong></p>



<p>A technically more advanced method for real-time 3D movement correction was developed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-0851-7">Griffiths et al. (2020)</a>. In this study, the authors used a random-access AOD-based microscope, recording only small environments around single neurons. Therefore, post-hoc movement correction, also in the lateral direction, was not really an option. To address this problem, the authors developed a closed-loop system based on an FPGA to perform online motion correction. AODs (acousto-optic deflectors) are very fast scanners, so the scan speed is not an issue. The authors defined a 3D reference object that was scanned in parallel to the imaged neurons, and corrected the focus of the microscope according to movements of the reference object. This method seems to be very elegant. The only limitation that I can see is that it requires an AOD microscope – very few z-scanning techniques would be able to perform an ultra-fast z-scan as a reference (maybe TAG-lenses would be an option?). And AOD scopes have been long known to be very challenging to operate and align &#8211; although some companies seem to have managed to make the systems a bit more user-friendly during the last decade.</p>



<p><strong>Scanning the brain with OCT-based imaging</strong></p>



<p>Recently, I came across another paper about online movement correction, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.490087">Tucker et al., (2023)</a>. The authors used optical coherence tomography to measure brain motion and to online correct for it. In this paper, the authors present a method to correct for brain motion in x and y, not addressing the more relevant problem of z-motion (although this is discussed in depth as well). On a side-note, I noticed that corrections were applied by adding signals to the regular voltage signals used to drive the scan mirrors, reminding me of my simple solution a few years ago to <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/03/25/modulating-laser-intensity-on-multiple-timescales-x-y-and-z/">add two analog signals with a summing amplifier</a>. Anyway, a z-correction would be more difficult to implement in a standard microscope because it would require an existing z-scanning device (such as a remote z-scanner, a tunable lens, or a piezo attached to the objective). However, I found the idea compelling, and on paper the principle of OCT seems simple. An OCT is more or less an interferometer that uses infrared backscattered light to form an image. Imaging speed is high for the modern variants of OCT imaging, and the possible resolution seems to be around 1 μm. If you now have become interested in OCT, I can recommend  <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-16638-0_3#:~:text=Typically%20OCT%20systems%20have%20a,source%2C%20not%20the%20focusing%20optics">this introduction</a>, especially section 2.3 on “Signal formation in OCT”.</p>



<p><strong>Open questions about OCT for online motion correction</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, I have never seen or used an OCT microscope before. Therefore, I have no intuition how difficult it would be to achieve high-resolution OCT imaging. How does an OCT volumetric image of a mouse brain look like? Which structures in the brain generate the contrast? Is there any contrast? How long does it take to acquire such an image with sufficient contrast at high resolution? What is the price tag of a spectral-domain OCT system? Is it more or less difficult to build than e.g. a two-photon microscope?<br />I have the impression that the study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.490087">Tucker et al. (2023)</a> only scratches the surface of what is possible, and that OCT imaging could be combined with 2P imaging without compromising excitation or detection pathways. If you are an expert in this technique and happen to meet me at the next conference, I’d be interested in knowing more!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thunderstorm-downburst-wind-danger-damage">How thunderstorms can spawn damaging ‘downbursts’</a></h4>

              
                <p>In July, a fierce thunderstorm raged through Washington, D.C., damaging homes, felling trees, producing blinding rain and leaving thousands without power. The storm was the District’s worst since a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire">derecho</a> swept through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions in 2012 (<em>SN: 8/27/20</em>). Was the new damage the result of another derecho or a tornado? No, said area meteorologists. This time the culprit was a downburst.</p>



<p>These lesser-known products of severe storms first sparked U.S. public attention in the 1980s when one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mastering-microburst">caused an airplane to crash</a> near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/fwd/delta191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killing 137 people</a> (<em>SN: 3/21/87</em>). Threats to aircraft have diminished thanks to more research on the phenomenon and greater monitoring of wind speeds at airports. But these fierce winds still pose a danger, evidenced by the damage left in the wake of severe storms that have battered the United States and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/25/italy-hail-switzerland-europe-storms-wind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parts of Europe</a> this summer.</p>





<p>Here’s what to know about downbursts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are downbursts?</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ohx/downbursts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downburst is an area of powerful winds</a> produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. When the downdraft reaches the ground, it slams into the surface and spreads out, sending winds outward in all directions like a water balloon dropped from the sky.</p>



<p>Every storm has a downdraft which sends cold air toward the ground and along the surface, says Charles Kuster, a research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. But for that downdraft to create a downburst, it needs to reach a certain velocity. There are a few different thresholds in use, but a common indicator is wind speeds above 93 kilometers per hour (58 miles per hour), which is also the wind speed that merits a severe thunderstorm warning from the National Weather Service.</p>



<p>Downbursts can come in two varieties: microbursts, which affect an area smaller than 4 kilometers wide, and macrobursts, which affect a larger area.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do downbursts form?</h4>



<p>Downbursts need two things to form: a favorable storm environment and a strong cooling mechanism. Humidity that increases with altitude and a large temperature difference between the storm and the surrounding environment both create favorable conditions for a downburst, as does high precipitation loading — the amount of rain or hail being held aloft by upward winds feeding into the storm.</p>



<p>The cooling mechanism can take a few different forms. Melting hail or evaporating rain in the atmosphere can cool the surrounding air because those processes require energy. Djordje Romanic, an atmospheric scientist at McGill University in Montreal, likens this cooling effect to stepping out of a hot shower. “You run across the room to get your towel, and you’re cold, but you just took a warm shower,” he says. “It’s possible because that water is evaporating, and evaporation takes energy” in the form of heat. The mass of dense, cooled air eventually becomes too heavy for the upward winds to keep it aloft and it falls to the earth, creating a downburst.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wild wind</h3>



<p>Downbursts are an area of powerful winds produced by a storm with strong downward-moving air, known as a downdraft. Downbursts smash into the ground and radiate outward. Wind speeds when a downburst strikes can rival a weak tornado.</p>

<p>Downbursts don’t require rain, though. While “wet” downbursts are common across the southern United States, less humid western states more often experience “dry” downbursts. In certain cases, rain evaporates in the dry atmosphere before it hits the ground, cooling the air inside the storm.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How is a downburst different from a tornado?</h4>



<p>Often when a downburst strikes, affected residents ascribe the damage to a tornado — and one could be forgiven for the mistake. Downbursts can generate winds that are about as powerful as a weak tornado, Romanic says. But the parallels end there. A tornado’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-research-may-upend-what-we-know-about-how-tornadoes-form">characteristic funnel cloud</a> requires high wind shear — changes in wind speed or direction at different altitudes — to drive its rotation (<em>SN: 12/14/18</em>). By contrast, downbursts require low wind shear to keep from tearing the blob of lofted, cooler air apart.</p>



<p>Patterns of damage differ between the two as well, says Mark Rose, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. A tornado’s rotating winds will send debris in a swirling pattern, while the straight-line winds of a downburst tend to cause damage along a single direction.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can downbursts be predicted?</h4>



<p>Any area that has thunderstorms can encounter a downburst, though not every storm will produce these strong winds, Kuster says. Because downbursts “develop quickly and dissipate quickly,” he says, the damaging winds can strike with little to no warning.</p>



<p>Storms with the potential to produce downbursts can be detected by radar, which shows the location and the approximate speed of a storm’s most intense winds, Rose says. But because the radar grid is larger than a typical downburst, it’s difficult to predict exactly when and where a downburst will strike, Romanic says. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094722000561?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most reported downbursts are microbursts</a>, he and colleagues reported in <em>Weather and Climate Extremes </em>in 2022.</p>



<p>The National Severe Storms Laboratory is studying a type of radar technology called <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/parise/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phased array radar</a> that could detect signs of an imminent downburst minutes before the downburst hits maximum intensity, potentially giving people in the affected area a few extra moments to prepare.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Will downbursts get worse with climate change?</h4>



<p>It’s hard to say. Reports of downbursts have increased over the years, but Romanic cautions that much of that increase could be tied to improvements in detection via radar, and to the greater potential for damage as cities have grown. After accounting for those factors, there hasn’t been a significant increase in downbursts since the 1990s, he says.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean extra heat has no effect on downbursts. Anything that increases a storm’s energy increases the likelihood of severe winds, Kuster says. That includes higher temperatures and more humidity. As summers get hotter, the planet could see more storms with the potential to produce downbursts, researchers suspect.</p>



<p>For now, Kuster emphasizes that while downbursts may not be as common as a typical thunderstorm or as well-known as a tornado, they are still hazardous. “Downbursts are serious. Severe thunderstorm warnings are serious,” he says. “So when you go under a severe thunderstorm warning, make sure that you take shelter.”</p>

                <p><strong>In this short interview series, we will be shining a light on inspiring women working in neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. We explore  job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to read new interviews every month from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_6ff9d745c20d42ca96d51fb5314420c3~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_660,h_597,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Tomi Akingbade, PhD student at the University of Cambridge and founder of the Black Women in Science network." ></figure><p>This month, we interviewed Tomi Akingbade, PhD student at the University of Cambridge and founder of the Black Women in Science network. Tomi currently works on the inflammatory response to protein aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease, and previously she completed an MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham which included a placement year at Leicester investigating peripheral biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Between her Masters and PhD, Tomi worked at the Dementia Research Institute UK as research technician for another biomarkers project.</p>
<h6>Tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially.</h6><p><p>My current role is as a PhD student researching inflammation in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. What interested me about neuroscience initially was the number of unknown questions in the field; I liked the idea that there were things left to discover and the constant questioning we’re able to do as a community.</p>
</p>
<h6>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your job?</h6><p><p>The freedom to explore new ideas and thoughts, and the longer timescale to commit to a project. I also enjoy being around people who are interested and passionate about their jobs.</p></p>

<h6>What are the challenges?</h6><p><p>Figuring out what a work/life balance looks like and implementing that. Also keeping up with literature – there’s always so much coming out, and it is difficult to know what to read and how much to take in. When multitasking with multiple projects, one always seems to get left behind.</p></p>

<h6>What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job/studies?</h6><p><p>Keeping up with admin and emails - they always pile up. Project management – keeping all the different streams of research going simultaneously.</p>
</p>
<h6>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</h6><p><p>The women I’ve met through the black women in science network! Any woman who turns up and does their thing is inspiring to me.</p></p>

<h6>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</h6><p><p>Balance health inequalities and health outcomes in all avenues. I have no idea where I’ll be in the next few years, and I’m enjoying the luxury of not having to think about that right now.</p>
</p>
<h6>What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</h6><p><p>Do what you find interesting. You can’t do good science if you’re not looking after yourself.</p></p><hr><p>This article was written by Lauren Wallis and edited by Ailie McWhinnie. Interested in writing for WiNUK yourself?

<p><strong>X-rays of the brain in thin cross sections </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/x-rays-brain-thin-cross-sections"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 1, 1973</p>



<p>A new [device], already hailed by some physicians as the most important advance in X-ray diagnosis since its original development, promises to give a detailed new look at the inner brain.… The EMI device produces detailed information about a particular region of the brain with relatively little radiation exposure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h3>



<p>That device was the first X-ray computed tomography, or CT, scanner. Today, the technology lets doctors and researchers peer inside not only the human brain, but also other organs, bones and even blood vessels. CT scanning has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">also become a useful tool in other areas of science</a>, from archaeology to zoology (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44</em>). For instance, the technology helped reveal why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">pumpkin toadlets are clumsy hoppers</a>: Their inner ears may be too small to maintain good balance (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 5</em>). Sharper images made by a “<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/two-monumental-milestones-achieved-ct-imaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon-counting</a>” CT scanner — approved last year by the U.S. Food and Drug A­dministration — could help resolve other mysteries too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newborn-baby-music-pain-heel-pricks-mozart">A classical lullaby helped reduce newborns’ pain during heel pricks</a></h4>

              
                <p>The soothing tones of a classical lullaby may help to relieve the pain newborns can feel from routine medical procedures. The mellifluous method could be a beneficial addition to other pain-easing tactics.</p>



<p>In a randomized clinical trial at a hospital nursery, newborns received a sugar solution — a standard method to lessen pain — before a heel prick. Around half of the infants also had a classical lullaby playing from speakers near their beds before, during and after the procedure. The lullaby group <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02746-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored lower on a newborn pain scale</a> at the time of the prick and after, compared with the group that only got sugar, researchers report August 29 in <em>Pediatric Research.</em></p>





<p>“Since they gave sucrose, it’s hard to say yes, music by itself would help,” says Mallory Perry-Eaddy, a pediatric intensive care unit nurse and a nurse scientist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. But combining music with other pain-relieving methods “could be really useful.”</p>



<p>Until fairly recently, the medical community did not believe newborns experienced pain. But over the last several decades, studies have revealed that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infants do perceive pain, and they may be more sensitive to painful stimuli than adults are</a>. Enduring repeated pain-inducing procedures without pain-relief treatment can have lasting neurological consequences for infants, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncpneuro0984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a heightened perception of pain</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s very important that we do try to stay on top of [pain] prior to procedures,” says Perry-Eaddy, rather than just trying to alleviate pain afterwards.</p>



<p>Heel pricks and shots are among the routine procedures newborns have soon after birth that can cause pain. The heel prick produces a few drops of blood for tests, including to check for certain disorders. Generally, for minor procedures like a heel prick, doctors and nurses turn to pain-reducing methods that don’t involve medication, says Saminathan Anbalagan, a neonatologist at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx, N.Y. Among these methods are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6570422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skin-to-skin contact between a parent and an infant, breastfeeding</a> and giving a newborn a sugar solution.</p>



<p>At Anbalagan’s hospital, the sugar solution combined with any of the other non-pharmacological approaches is the standard protocol, he says. He and his colleagues wanted to study music as another potential option that could be easily implemented and is cost-effective.</p>



<p>The research team randomly sorted 100 infants born at Lincoln into a lullaby and a no-music group. For the lullaby group, <a></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2cksmXWj_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the song “Deep Sleep”</a> from <em>Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies</em> began playing 20 minutes before the heel prick and continued for another five minutes after. The researchers assessed pain with a neonatal infant pain scale that considers newborns’ facial expressions, whether they cry, their breathing patterns and other signs. The pain scale ranges from 0 to 7.</p>



<p>During the heel prick, the no-music group had an average pain score of just under 7. But serenading the infants with a classical lullaby reduced the score to below 5. After that peak, the overall score steadily dropped for both groups in the next five minutes, with the lullaby group continuing to score lower.</p>



<p>More research is needed to better understand neonatal pain and determine the most effective ways to relieve it, including the optimal combination of methods, Anbalagan says. But “<a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/137/2/e20154271/52762/Prevention-and-Management-of-Procedural-Pain-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven and safe therapies are currently underused</a> for routine minor, yet pain procedures,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Along with investigating the effectiveness of music as a pain-relief method, Anbalagan and his colleagues sought to bring awareness to newborn pain with their study.</p>



<p>“While the misconception [about newborns and pain] has faded, it continues to be a common way of thinking in some health care settings,” he says. “Why some hospitals don’t have protocols for pain relief from minor procedures in neonates remains puzzling.”</p>

<p>A preprint about millipedes that was written using OpenAI&#8217;s chatbot <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> is <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">back online</a> after being withdrawn for including made-up references, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, fake references and all, is also under review by a journal specializing in tropical insects.</p>



<p>“This undermines trust in the scientific literature,&#8221; said <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/staffsnm/staff/?pure=en/persons/52118">Henrik Enghoff</a>, a millipede researcher at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/07/publisher-blacklists-authors-after-preprint-cites-made-up-studies/">first spotted problems</a> with the preprint, as we reported last month.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127813"></span>



<p>He and others said the case had caused a stir among researchers studying millipedes and centipedes, collectively known as myriapods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The myriapodological community is alert and closely following this matter,&#8221; said Carlos Martínez, a centipede taxonomist and a research associate at <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/">Senckenberg Society for Nature Research</a>, in Frankfurt, Germany. &#8220;I have also taken a personal interest in stopping this spurious manuscript from polluting the scientific record.&#8221;</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.1339/v1">first appeared</a> on Preprints.org in June. It came to Enghoff’s attention after he received an email from ResearchGate notifying him that his work had been cited. The citations were botched, he found, and some papers he was supposed to have written didn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was so obvious that it had to be caught,&#8221; Enghoff told Retraction Watch. &#8220;But there could be subtler cases where something is published that is completely fictitious but won&#8217;t be detected.&#8221;</p>



<p>After learning of the fake references, staff at the preprint server, suspecting the involvement of a chatbot, pulled down the article and blacklisted its authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manuscript had also been submitted to MDPI&#8217;s journal <em>Insects,</em> but had been rejected, Enghoff said a colleague told him.</p>



<p>According to a Danish newspaper following up on Retraction Watch&#8217;s reporting, the preprint&#8217;s corresponding author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7310-8085">Kahsay Tadesse Mawcha of Aksum University in Ethiopia</a>, <a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2023-30/ideer/tusindben-paa-afveje">admitted to using ChatGPT</a> to produce the manuscript.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mawcha reportedly explained that he wasn&#8217;t “good at using AI” and had since realized that ChatGPT was &#8220;not recommended&#8221; for writing scientific articles.</p>



<p>Then on August 25, Mawcha <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">posted</a> an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mawcha-2023-preprint-v.2.pdf">updated version</a> of the paper to the preprint server Research Square. Two days later, an email appeared in Enghoff&#8217;s inbox alerting him that his work had been cited. It was déjà vu: Mawcha, who now appeared as the sole author of the manuscript, had deleted the made-up papers by Enghoff in the reference list, but the Danish researcher&#8217;s work again was being cited for something off-topic, Enghoff said.</p>



<p>What’s more, the revised preprint&#8217;s reference list still mostly consisted of fictitious papers, according to Leif Moritz, who has studied myriapods at the Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change, in Bonn, Germany.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I personally find most worrying is that many of these made-up references suggest that millipedes have a more negative effect as pests on crops than is actually true,&#8221; Moritz told Retraction Watch. &#8220;This in turn might not only lead to a negative perception of these animals in the public but also to misguided decisions by policy makers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mawcha did not respond to a request for comments.</p>



<p>Asked if Research Square was aware of the manuscript’s troubled history, Mark Brewin, an editorial specialist at the company, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our retraction alert feature is currently in for repairs, so meanwhile we&#8217;re endeavoring to catch these manually. Under the circumstances, our editorial team will look into this case and take appropriate action on the preprint.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 30,&nbsp; the preprint <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">website</a> said Mawcha&#8217;s paper, titled &#8220;From Beneficial Arthropods to Soil-Dwelling Organisms: A Review on Millipedes in Africa,&#8221; was being reviewed by the <em>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</em>. But the following day, after we contacted Research Square, all mention of the journal had disappeared from the website.</p>



<p>Ritter Atoundem Guimapi, an editor at the journal, told Retraction Watch he and his colleagues were aware of the issues related to the manuscript and were &#8220;handling the case accordingly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Martínez, the centipede expert at <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/">Senckenberg Society for Nature Research</a>, said he had emailed Mawcha and asked him to stop trying to publish &#8220;his AI-generated manuscript.&#8221; He also contacted the <em>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</em>, he said, as well as the African Association of Insect Scientists and Ethiopia’s embassy in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-melting-dipole-arctic-oscillation">Arctic sea ice may melt faster in coming years due to shifting winds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A flip-flopping, yearslong pattern of winds helps control the fate of the Arctic’s sea ice — by regulating how much of the Atlantic Ocean’s relatively warm, salty water sneaks northward into the Arctic Ocean.</p>



<p>From 2007 to 2021, winds over North America and Eurasia were circulating in such a way that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh5158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they reduced the influx of warmer Atlantic water into the Arctic</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 1 <em>Science</em>. That helped slow the rate of sea ice loss during that time period — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">even as atmospheric warming ramped up</a> (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). But that grace period may come to an end within just a few years. When the winds shift back, enhanced “Atlantification” of the Arctic may speed up sea ice loss, by giving an extra oomph of warming from below.</p>





<p>“This phase has lasted about 15 years. We’re about at the end,” says physical oceanographer Igor Polyakov of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “The sea ice will be responding. There’s a great possibility for this rapid change in the system.”</p>



<p>Earth’s busy, interactive layers of ocean and atmosphere feature many different regional and global patterns that toggle between two different phases over years to decades, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">El Niño</a> and La Niña phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>).</p>



<p>The Arctic Dipole is a smaller-scale, regional pattern of winds that is having a global impact, Polyakov and colleagues suggest. To assess its influence, the researchers compared atmospheric wind patterns since 1979 with trends in summer ice extent and thickness gathered from satellite, airplane and shipboard surveys over that time frame. A clear relationship emerged, they say.</p>

<p>From 1979 to 2006, the Arctic Dipole was in a “negative” phase, with winds rotating counterclockwise over North America and clockwise over Eurasia. That brought more Atlantic water into the Arctic via the Fram Strait, a narrow strip of ocean between Greenland and Norway’s Svalbard archipelago. During that time period, summertime sea ice extent shrank rapidly from year to year, vanishing at a rate of about 1 million square kilometers per decade.</p>



<p>The year 2007, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-warming-noaa-report-card-2020">a record-breaking year for Arctic sea ice loss</a>, marked the end of this “negative” phase of the Arctic Dipole (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). From then until 2021, the rate of sea ice loss across the entire Arctic slowed, shrinking by only about 70,000 square kilometers per decade — largely due to atmospheric warming,</p>



<p>That’s not to say that the ice has recovered. It remains at a very low extent compared to the historical record. Human-caused global warming has ramped up heating across the region and created feedback loops that enhance sea ice loss: Melting sea ice exposes more ocean surface to the sun, warming that surface water, in turn enhancing ice melt. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the current, “positive” phase of the Dipole has helped put the brakes on the dramatic rate of Arctic sea ice loss — for now, Polyakov says. Less Atlantic water flowing in through the Fram Strait means the waters of the Arctic Ocean remain stratified — tightly layered, with the less-dense, colder, fresher Arctic water sitting on top of the warmer Atlantic waters like a lid on a pot.</p>



<p>That’s been protecting the sea ice from melting from below, says Thomas Rippeth, a physical oceanographer at Bangor University in Wales who was not involved in the new study. Whether another switchover in the Arctic Dipole is about to occur, shifting winds and encouraging more warm waters to flow northward, isn’t yet clear, Rippeth says. “This paper is telling us what to look for — that’s why it’s an important piece of work.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-cold-human-ancestors-population-crash-dna">Extreme cold may have nearly wiped out human ancestors 900,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human ancestors nearly died out between around 930,000 to 813,000 years ago in an evolutionarily pivotal population bust, a contested new study concludes.</p>



<p>This potential winnowing of human ancestors into a barely sustainable number of survivors coincided with a period of extreme cold and extended droughts in Africa and Eurasia, previous geologic evidence indicates.</p>



<p>If the new DNA-derived scenario holds up, relatively few survivors of the Stone Age big chill may have evolved into a species ancestral to <em>Homo sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans, say population geneticist Wangjie Hu of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and colleagues. Previous analyses of DNA extracted from ancient fossils estimate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03244-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this common ancestral species</a> appeared between around 700,000 and 500,000 years ago.</p>





<p>Not too long before that, members of the human genus,<em> Homo</em>, weathered a roughly 117,000-year-long freeze while maintaining an average of 1,280 individuals capable of breeding, the researchers report in the Sept. 1 <em>Science</em>. That number of our evolutionary precursors <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj9484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproduced just enough to stave off extinction</a>, they say.</p>



<p>Before the onset of the harsh climate, the number of potential breeders in the same ancestral population had totaled between 58,600 and 135,000 individuals, the team estimates.</p>



<p>Hu’s team devised a new statistical method to estimate the timing and sizes of ancient breeding populations using patterns of shared gene variants in human populations today. The modern genetic data came from 3,154 people in 10 African populations and 40 non-African populations. Hu’s group obtained that information from two scientific databases of human DNA.</p>



<p>The scientists calculated the expected diversity of these modern variants based on hypothetical ancient population histories, some of which included periods of drastic declines in numbers of breeding adults. A population crash among human ancestors that lasted from about 930,000 to 813,000 years ago best accounted for the genetic variation in the analyzed data, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>Africans displayed much stronger genetic evidence of an ancient population crash than non-Africans did, the scientists found. A depleted population of human ancestors probably lived in Africa starting around 900,000 years ago, although Eurasia cannot be excluded as a home region for those survivors, the team says.</p>



<p>As that diminished population began to rebound, its members <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-human-evolution-habitat-migration">may have evolved into <em>H. heidelbergensis</em></a>, Hu’s group suspects (<em>SN: 4/13/22</em>). Some researchers regard <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> as an ancestor of Denisovans, Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens </em>that first appeared around 700,000 years ago in Africa and Eurasia. But other scientists say that fossils assigned to <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> contain too many skeletal differences to qualify as a single <em>Homo</em> species.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj9484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comment published with the new study</a>, archaeologist Nick Ashton of the British Museum in London and paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of London&#8217;s Natural History Museum provisionally accept the new estimate of an ancient population crash among human ancestors.</p>



<p>Even so, an increasing number of fossil discoveries suggest that groups in the <em>Homo</em> genus occupied various parts of Africa, Asia and Europe between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago, during the newly proposed population crunch, Ashton and Stringer say. <br><br>Hu&#8217;s team suggests that populations unrelated to later <em>H. sapiens</em> that lived on those continents may somehow have survived severe global cooling better than groups related to people today. DNA from ancient <em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans will help to clarify when and where ancient population crashes occurred, Ashton and Stringer say.</p>



<p>Hu and colleagues’ report raises the possibility that ancestral human populations temporarily suffered a steep drop in numbers and formed small groups that rarely mated with each other, says population geneticist Aaron Ragsdale of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>



<p>But confirmation of the new findings must come from genetic studies that account for ancient fluctuations in population density, geographic range and interbreeding as well as population size, Ragsdale says.</p>





<p>Because estimated sizes of ancient breeding populations often downplay actual population numbers, “it’s a stretch to say that ancestral human populations were close to extinction,” he says.</p>



<p>Population geneticist Stephan Schiffels of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany sees no reason to accept the new study’s conclusions. Interconnected ancestries among ancient <em>Homo</em> groups and statistical uncertainties in determining their genetic ties obscure any molecular signals of population collapses that occurred nearly 1 million years ago, Schiffels contends.</p>



<p>“The suggested precision in dating events like this [proposed ancient population crash] is not possible,” he says.</p>



<p>Present-day human DNA analyzed in the new study has been studied and modeled for years by other investigators, none of whom have cited any signs of such an ancient, steep population decline, Schiffels says.</p>



<p>But severe climate shifts could potentially have pushed human ancestors and other species close to or over the brink of extinction, says population geneticist and study coauthor Ziqian Hao of Shandong First Medical University in Jinan, China. In the Aug. 11 <em>Science</em>, another team — including Ashton and Stringer — described ancient climate reconstructions indicating that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf4445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previously unrecognized cold phase in Europe led to sharp declines in hominid numbers about 1.1 million years ago</a>.</p>



<p>Hu and colleagues plan to incorporate ancient hominid DNA and a larger sample of present-day human DNA, especially from Africa, into further analyses of ancient population ups and downs.</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, whose <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resignation</a> as president of Stanford University becomes effective today, is retracting two papers from <em>Science</em> following an institutional investigation that found data manipulation in multiple figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both articles, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1058445">Hierarchical Organization of Guidance Receptors: Silencing of Netrin Attraction by Slit Through a Robo/DCC Receptor Complex</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1059391">Binding of DCC by Netrin-1 to Mediate Axon Guidance Independent of Adenosine A2B Receptor Activation</a>,” were published in 2001, when Tessier-Lavigne, the corresponding author, was at the University of California, San Francisco. They have been cited well over 600 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<p>Anonymous users on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BFCF07AC5A957DB7E8950B448CB6CB#1">posted</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59C3359E71EED451E01AF46CFDC0BC#1">concerns</a> about potentially manipulated images in the papers as early as 2015. Reporting by <em>The Stanford Daily</em> in <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/stanford-presidents-research-under-investigation-for-scientific-misconduct-university-admits-mistakes/">November 2022</a> spurred the university to <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/stanford-is-investigating-its-own-president-over-research-misconduct-allegations">launch an investigation</a> into several of Tessier-Lavigne’s papers, how he responded when others identified issues in his articles, and the culture of his lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">published the final report</a> last month, finding that four of the five papers it reviewed on which Tessier-Lavigne was a principal author contained “apparent manipulation of research data by others.” Tessier-Lavigne, the investigation committee concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127800"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>did not have actual knowledge of the manipulation of research data that occurred in his lab and was not reckless in failing to identify such manipulation prior to publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two <em>Science</em> papers were among those in which the panel identified manipulated data. In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/news/message-stanford-community">statement</a> posted to his lab website on July 19, the same day as the report was published, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to retract the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not respond to our request for comment, nor did Elke Stein, the first author on both papers. The notices state Stein, who is the only other author besides Tessier-Lavigne on one of the papers, did not agree with either retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tessier-Lavigne was aware of the issues raised on PubPeer, according to the investigation report. In 2015 he submitted corrections for the two papers to <em>Science</em> that attributed the issues to a software phenomenon called “tiling” rather than data manipulation. In fact, the panel members wrote in the report:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Tiling does not explain the underlying image manipulations in at least some of the figures to which the explanation was intended to apply.</p>

<p>“Due to an error,” the journal did not publish the corrections, Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the <em>Science</em> family of journals, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stanford-investigates-potential-misconduct-president-s-research">acknowledged</a> to the journal’s editorially independent news division.</p>



<p>After June 2016, Tessier-Lavigne did not follow up about the corrections that were never published, Stanford’s report stated. Instead, it described times he “failed to decisively and forthrightly correct mistakes in the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2021, scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59C3359E71EED451E01AF46CFDC0BC#14">posted a comment</a> on PubPeer pointing out the journal’s apparent lack of action on concerns raised about one of the papers and added a few findings of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her comment prompted Tessier-Lavigne to draft an email to <em>Science</em> asking about the status of the two corrections, according to the report, but he never sent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne told the investigation panel he “has a practice of drafting many e-mails to see how they read but only sends a portion of them and that he concluded the communication was unnecessary,” according to the report. The panel wrote that his decision not to follow up on the corrections “was insufficiently attentive to the continuing need to correct the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2022, after the <em>Stanford Daily</em> story drew attention to the issues with the papers, <em>Science</em> published <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.adg2852">editorial expressions of concern</a> for both articles, signed by Thorp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices acknowledged and described the 2015 corrections that were never published, and alluded to “additional concerns.” Thorp wrote that the journal was not proceeding with the corrections, but “alerting readers to the concerns while the authors and the authors’ institution investigate further.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retractions, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk1517">posted</a> <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk1521">today</a>, recap the papers’ history of publication, corrections that never appeared, and expressions of concern. Both notices state that an institutional investigation “is complete and has identified further issues, including manipulation of data-containing portions” in multiple figures, “undermining confidence in the paper’s conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne signed both notices, and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I regret the impact of these issues on the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Author retractions, such as Tessier-Lavigne’s, make up the bulk of the retractions <em>Science</em> has published in the last six years, a journal spokesperson told us – 14 of 16 issued since 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving an author’s request for retraction, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The role of the journal is to evaluate the request and make a decision based on various considerations, including the validity and seriousness of the concerns raised. At <em>Science</em>, we follow guidelines for retractions set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) to help ensure that the retraction process is fair, transparent, and consistent across different publications. For any retraction request by an author, we need to confirm that the retraction request aligns with COPE guidelines. In the event of an author retraction request, <em>Science</em> also reaches out to all authors of the paper to determine whether they agree to authorship of the retraction. In cases where there has been an institutional investigation, <em>Science</em> is guided by committee recommendations as well. Upon its decision, the journal must prepare to communicate openly with its readership about the retraction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bik, who raised new concerns about one of the <em>Science</em> papers on PubPeer in 2021 and evaluated the potential issues in Tessier-Lavigne’s publications for Theo Baker, the Stanford student journalist who broke the story, told us she had not expected the two papers would be retracted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I expected that the issues that had been raised on PubPeer would perhaps not be rising to the level where <em>Science</em> would think it necessary to retract after so many years, but they did.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“In the past, both parties dropped the ball,” she said of Tessier-Lavigne and <em>Science</em> failing to publish the agreed-upon corrections. “I think now they’re making up for it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expressions of concern like the ones <em>Science</em> published after Baker’s story are a “very good and underused method to flag a paper when under investigation,” Bik said.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>From that point on I think the whole retraction process has been handled well by the journal. At least compared to other journals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bik credited “the bravery of the student-run newspaper” for shining a light on the concerns an anonymous person raised back in 2015:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s only because of coverage by the news that these things have finally been addressed. They should have been addressed a long time ago.</p>
