              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-electric-vehicle-program">There’s good and bad news with California’s electric vehicle program</a></h4>

              
                <p>A worldwide gearshift from fossil fuel–powered cars to electric vehicles could significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that humans emit to the atmosphere. But current strategies for vehicle electrification can also shift some pollution to communities already suffering under higher economic, health and environmental burdens, researchers warn.</p>



<p>California, which leads the United States by a mile when it comes to EV adoption, offers a window into this evolving problem. The state is aggressively seeking to reduce its carbon footprint and has made substantial increases in wind and solar power generation as well as in the promotion of electric vehicle purchases. One tool the state has used is the California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, or CVRP, which kicked off in 2010 and offers consumers money back for the purchase or lease of new EVs.</p>





<p>Now, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis of the CVRP’s impact on the state’s air quality</a> from 2010 to 2021 reveals both good and bad news, researchers report May 3 in <em>PLOS Climate.</em></p>



<p>To assess the impact of the CVRP on a community and statewide level, the team developed a computer model that incorporates data on where the rebates went, how much additional electricity would be required to power those vehicles, which of the state’s electric generating units would provide that power and how much pollution they might produce.</p>



<p>The team then overlapped these data with a mapping tool called CalEnviroScreen that identifies which of the state’s more than 8,000 census tracts — county subdivisions used in population assessments — are the most vulnerable to pollution. That vulnerability measure is based not only on exposure to pollutants such as power plant emissions and unsafe water but also on factors such as income, education level, access to health care and linguistic isolation.</p>



<p>The good news is that the CVRP is responsible for making a dent in the state’s overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, reducing them by about 280,000 metric tons per year on average, says environmental scientist Jaye Mejía-Duwan of the University of California, Berkeley. In 2020, transportation in California produced about 160 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, about 40 percent of the total 370 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the state that year.</p>



<p>The program has also reduced the state’s overall emissions of other types of air-polluting gases, including sulfur dioxide and several nitrogen oxide gases collectively called NOx.</p>



<p>The bad news is that the most disadvantaged communities in the state didn’t see the same overall improvement in air quality, Mejía-Duwan and colleagues found. Those communities didn’t have the same decreases in sulfur dioxide and NOx gases — and in fact saw an increase in one type of air pollution, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">tiny particulates</a> known as PM<sub>2.5 </sub>(<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>). “These particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and cross over into the bloodstream,” increasing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular problems and cognitive decline, Mejía-Duwan says. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where the power is</h3>



<p>California uses a computer model called CalEnviroScreen, currently in its fourth version, to determine levels of vulnerability to the impacts of pollution. The most disadvantaged communities (darker blue) are determined by both pollutant exposure and socioeconomic factors. The state&#8217;s electricity-generating units (EGUs, circles) are disproportionately located in the most disadvantaged communities. That reveals how increasing electrification, which includes power generated by nonrenewable sources, could increase pollution in many of the most disadvantaged communities.</p>



<h5>Pollution impact by community</h5>

<p>That increase may be indirectly related to putting more EVs on the road. Although electric vehicles themselves don’t produce PM<sub>2.5 </sub>from their tailpipes, increased electricity generation, if it’s not fossil fuel–free, can. Renewable resources, including rooftop solar cells, supplied about half of California’s electricity in 2022. But natural gas–fired power plants still provide a hefty chunk of the state’s power.</p>



<p>“Electric vehicles are often incorrectly referred to as ‘zero-emission vehicles,’ but they’re only as clean as the underlying electric grid from which the energy is sourced,” Mejía-Duwan says. The most disadvantaged 25 percent of the state&#8217;s communities also contain 50 percent of the power plants, the team found.</p>





<p>EVs also tend to be relatively heavy due to their hefty batteries. And “heavier vehicles can produce as much if not more particulate matter” than equivalently sized fossil fuel-powered cars, due to brake, tire or road wear, Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>Increasing the cleanliness of the electric grid would help, as would changes to the management of the state’s generated power, the researchers say. California’s solar, wind and hydroelectric energy production has grown rapidly. But the battery technology to store and use that energy later lags behind. Most of that energy is generated during the day, so some researchers have suggested plugging in electric vehicles while it’s light out to take advantage of the daytime glut of electricity — and then using the vehicles to help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">power houses at nighttime</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>But, clever as that idea is, it doesn’t address the underlying factors behind these inequities. Since 2010, the CVRP has provided over 400,000 rebates for EVs of up to $7,500, depending on income. Yet, as it turns out, those rebates have disproportionately gone to the least disadvantaged communities. “That’s a major driver of these inequities,” Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>Changing that isn’t an easy fix. The state has tried several ways to address the issue, such as by imposing an income cap on eligibility.</p>



<p>But those efforts have had little effect, particularly given strong barriers that stand in the way of the adoption of EVs by people in disadvantaged communities. One roadblock is that prospective EV buyers must have enough money for a down payment, and then fill out forms and be able to wait several months for the rebate money. Another is that car manufacturers are trending toward producing larger, more expensive EVs. Chevrolet, for example, announced in April that its most affordable EV, the Bolt, will be discontinued as the company pivots to producing electric SUVs.</p>



<p>There’s also a lack of equitable access to vehicle charging infrastructure. And then there are subtler but no less insidious issues, such as “a lack of sufficient multicultural and multilingual outreach about EVs, plus the fact that people of color and minoritized communities report facing discrimination at dealerships,” Mejía-Duwan says.</p>



<p>These findings echo and support researchers’ longtime concerns about how current programs to encourage vehicle electrification will disproportionately impact people. “It’s not a surprise,” says Román Partida-López, senior legal counsel for transportation equity at The Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif. “What [California] is doing is a move in the right direction, but it’s not enough.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-climate-change-bill-legislation-clean-energy">California and other states pursuing aggressive zero-emissions policies</a> need to shift their thinking, Partida-López says, to be more intentional about targeting their efforts toward the communities experiencing the greatest impacts (<em>SN: 12/14/22</em>). Rebates, in particular, are known to be an inequitable approach, he says, because they “assume you have the money up front to be able to put down a down payment of several thousand dollars.”</p>



<p>A better strategy to reduce the barriers to EV adoption, he says, would be to provide other types of incentives, such as vouchers that low-income households could use at the time of purchase as well as accessible financing programs.</p>



<p>After all, making EVs accessible to everyone is going to be essential to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">the big picture of transitioning to zero emissions</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/23</em>). “We’re not going to meet any of those goals unless we center equity” in program designs, Partida-López says. “The focus has always been, ‘How do we transform the market?’ We need to change the narrative to ‘How are we going to focus on the people most impacted, to help with this transition?’”</p>

<p><strong>Light flashes no danger for short space flights</strong> – <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-flashes-no-danger-short-space-flights"><em>Science News</em></a>, May 12, 1973</p>



<p>The light flashes and streaks seen by [Apollo] astronauts have long been attributed to high-energy, heavy cosmic particles (HZE) passing through the eyes&#8230;. A new report … concludes that the particles are not a serious hazard for short trips to the moon or Earth-orbital missions such as Skylab. </p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The mechanism behind the flashes <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720010081/downloads/19720010081.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described by Apollo astronauts</a> remains a mystery. Perhaps the particles, which are components of c­osmic rays, emit radiation as they pass through part of the eye. Or perhaps they trick nerve cells to create the illusion of light. However the flashes happen, they are still an issue for astronauts. In 2006, about 80&nbsp;percent of NASA and European Space Agency astronauts reported <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16676658/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiencing the flashes</a>. How the phenomenon impacts astronaut health after months or years in deep space <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is unclear</a>. As NASA plans crewed missions to Mars and the moon, scientists are devising new ways to <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2022/04/18/staying-safe-in-space--uw-researchers-work-to-protect-astronauts-from-cosmic-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect astronauts from radiation</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 18</em>), such as portable magnetic shields that can deflect cosmic rays.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lake-antarctica-ice-microbes-carbon">In one lake deep under Antarctica’s ice, microbes feast on ancient carbon</a></h4>

              
                <p>How microbes survive in lakes far beneath Antarctica&#8217;s ice sheet has been a mystery. Now scientists have figured out what’s on the menu for microbes in one buried lake in West Antarctica.</p>



<p>The lake’s bacteria and other microbial inhabitants get by on carbon that seawater left behind thousands of years ago, researchers report in the April <em>AGU Advances</em>. The find adds to existing evidence that, during a period of warming about 6,000 years ago, the ice sheet in West Antarctica was smaller than it is today. That allowed <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000846" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seawater to deposit nutrients in what is now a lake bed</a> buried under hundreds of meters of ice.</p>





<p>This study is among the first to provide evidence from beneath the ice that the ice sheet was smaller in the not-so-distant past, geologically speaking, before growing back to its modern size, says Greg Balco, a geochemist at the Berkeley Geochronology Center in California.</p>



<p>Understanding how the ice sheet changed during past periods of warming is crucial to predicting Antarctica’s future as the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, says Balco, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Hundreds of lakes pool under Antarctica’s massive ice sheet, the result of the underside of the ice ever-so-slowly melting due to heat from the Earth’s interior. The lakes tend to be pitch-black, near freezing and are almost all isolated from the outside world.</p>



<p>These less-than-ideal conditions should make them hostile to life. “If I were a microbe, I wouldn’t want to live in the cold, dark depths where I haven’t seen the sun or a new nutrient in thousands of years,” says Ryan Venturelli, a paleoglaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. Yet billions of microbes — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life">and even some animals</a> — have found a way to thrive in these subglacial waterbodies (<em>SN: 4/21/23</em>).</p>



<p>As the last glacial period came to a close, starting around 15,000 years ago, ice sheets around the world retreated. Computer simulations have predicted that as the climate warmed, the ice sheet in West Antarctica may have shrunk to an even smaller size than it is today. But working out what a smaller ice sheet might have looked like isn’t easy since most of the evidence for it is now locked under ice, Balco says.</p>



<p>In 2018, Venturelli joined a team of about 30 scientists headed to a remote corner of West Antarctica to drill for the past. The journey took them to Lake Mercer: a body of subglacial water that today sits 150 kilometers from the sea.</p>



<p>It took the expedition over a week of using a hot-water drill 24 hours a day to pierce through just over a kilometer of ice to reach the lake. “There was a lot of cheering and high-fiving” when the drill finally made it through, Venturelli recalls. Lake Mercer is only the second subglacial lake in the world that scientists have ever managed to reach.</p>

<p>The team collected and analyzed lake water and sediment samples from the lake bed. This work revealed traces of 6,000-year-old carbon-14, a form of the element that’s made in the atmosphere and then falls to Earth. For that carbon to get past the ice, the lake would have had to have contact with the outside world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t spot any telltale signs of ancient photosynthesizing plankton, suggesting that the area wasn’t open ocean when the carbon settled in the sediment. Instead, seawater carrying the carbon must have come to the lake. That means that ocean water had to have flowed under the ice about 250 kilometers farther inland than it does today, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“There’s no other way to get carbon-14 in there,” Balco says. “You can’t push it through ice. Organisms can’t tunnel through. The only way for it to get it there is for ocean water to get under the ice sheet.”</p>



<p>Seawater does flow under the ice today — but not as far inland as the lake’s location. So the edge of the ice shelf was probably closer to Lake Mercer several thousand years ago. That suggests, the team says, that the ice sheet over West Antarctica was probably smaller back then.</p>



<p>Microorganisms living in this area 6,000 years ago would have feasted on the inflow from the ocean. And their descendants still seem to as well. The researchers found traces of carbon-14 in the water samples as well as in the sediment, suggesting the microbes are recycling the ancient carbon deposited in the lake bed as food.</p>



<p>The new study emphasizes how much information is waiting to be found in Antarctica’s hidden lakes, Venturelli says. “There are about 675 lakes under the ice sheet, and we’ve only sampled two,” she says. “I would very much like to drill into every single one of them.”</p>

<p>An engineering journal has retracted an article that was posted on a website claiming to sell author positions. The retraction comes nearly two years after we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">reported on the website</a> and a whistleblower informed the journal.</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15397734.2020.1858870">On the dynamics of an ultra-fast-rotating-induced piezoelectric cantilevered nanodisk surrounded by viscoelastic foundation</a>,” appeared in <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines </em>in December 2020. It listed researchers at Sichuan University of Science and Engineering in China as authors. The article has been cited five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The study was retracted on March 16, 2023. The retraction notice stated:</p>



<span id="more-127091"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, concerns have been raised about the authorship of the article. When approached for an explanation, the authors have been unable to verify their original data.</p>



<p>It has also come to our attention that the full authorship list for this manuscript were [sic] changed during the submission and publication process. As determining authorship is core to the integrity of published work and given our concerns regarding the data, we are therefore retracting this article.</p>



<p>The authors listed in this publication have been informed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study was among several posted on the Iranian website Teziran in 2021. The site has claimed to sell authorship positions for scientific papers under review in various journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/13/paper-with-authorship-posted-for-sale-retracted-over-a-year-after-retraction-watch-report/">previously reported</a>, an anonymous whistleblower who goes by the name Artemisia Stricta identified articles from a cached version of Teziran after reading our post, and informed the editors and publishers of the journals in which the papers appeared.</p>



<p>In September 2021, Artemisia sent an email to Corina Sandu, editor in chief of <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines</em>, writing, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I am sure you will agree, the listing of authorship for sale is a major red flag, and, in many cases, is accompanied by outright falsification of the article for scalability of authorship sales.</p>



<p>The large number of authors certainly seems to indicate that some positions of authorship were sold. Are you able to review the point during the review process when the authors were added? If any were added after initial submission, this would be a strong indication of authorship manipulation, which may constitute grounds for retraction. Of course, it is also possible that authorship was sold prior to submission. In any case, I hope that you will investigate this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sandu eventually replied, saying that she had forwarded the concern to the journal’s publisher. Over the next few months, Artemisia’s attempts to follow up about the investigation yielded either assurances that the matter was still being investigated, or no reply.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In reply to an email from Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for Taylor and Francis, the publisher of <em>Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines</em>, said of the March retraction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After concerns were raised about the article we conducted an investigation and found substantial authorship changes had been made. We reached out to the authors to confirm their individual contributions and also to provide the raw data and original figures for the article. Unfortunately the authors were unable to verify their original data and did not respond to further emails. Given our concerns regarding the data and authorship of the paper, we retracted this article. Since the publication of this article we have substantially improved our processes for authorship changes and, should significant authorship changes occur in the future, this would indicate that investigation is needed by the journal’s editorial team, with assistance from our publishing ethics and integrity team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson also clarified that Artemisia’s email brought this issue to the publisher’s attention, although the paper was only retracted after they had conducted their own investigation.</p>



<p>When asked why the investigation took as long as it did, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As with all investigations we must conduct due diligence and collect required evidence to ensure the outcome of an investigation is fair and unbiased. As a result, some cases take longer than others to resolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Sandu nor Mingjun Yang, the senior author of the paper, responded to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">None of the remaining papers posted on Teziran about which Artemisia raised concerns have been retracted or bear any indication that they are under investigation. The papers are:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>In reply to an email from Retraction Watch about the recent retraction, Artemisia wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In September 2021, I notified the journal that authorship of this paper had been listed for sale on Teziran. Given both the clear indication of misconduct, the severity of the allegations, and the comparative simplicity of the investigation (i.e., establishing that authors had been added following submission), I cannot understand why it took almost two years to retract the paper. It seems to me that journals ought to maintain easily-accessible records of when authors were added during the review process.</p>



<p>The scariest thing about this retraction is that the paper was only caught by a fluke. WayBack Machine caches sites irregularly, which makes it likely that other papers weren&#8217;t caught simply because their auction wasn&#8217;t cached. In light of this concern, I would be curious to know what steps Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines (and, more generally, Taylor &amp; Francis) is doing in order to identify other potentially-affected papers (e.g., searching for other cases of late-stage author addition or investigating other papers by the same authors).</p>

                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Renee Hoch, Managing Editor, PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>Journals&rsquo; and publishers&rsquo; authorship policies set expectations with regard to credit and responsibilities, and can help support researchers in making authorship decisions. By rooting our policies in industry-wide standards, journals across the sector can help to align authorship practices and safeguard the meaning of authorship within academia and the publishing industry. However, it is important to recognize, and adapt as needed, when the standards anchoring our policies fall short in serving our author communities.</p>



<p>On May 10, 2023, PLOS<strong> </strong>updated our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship">Authorship policy</a>. Among other changes, we updated our authorship criteria: all PLOS journals except <em>PLOS Medicine</em> now apply the authorship criteria put forth in a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1715374115">2018 PNAS article</a> by Marcia McNutt <em>et al</em>. (<em>PLOS Medicine</em> is an ICMJE member and continues to apply <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">ICMJE authorship criteria</a>.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="1024" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-791x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21300" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-791x1024.png 791w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-232x300.png 232w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-768x994.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2-1187x1536.png 1187w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/Authorship-Requirements-blog-graphic-2.png 1545w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"></figure>



<p>Prior to this change, all PLOS journals followed the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship</a>. These criteria were developed by and for the clinical and biomedical research communities, and were the dominant standard in STM publishing when PLOS launched our initial journals and established our initial editorial policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, an alternative standard emerged from National Academy of Sciences efforts to develop standards relevant across a broader range of disciplines. The 2018 guidance aligns with ICMJE on core requirements of credit and accountability: both advise that substantial contributions should be credited with authorship, all who meet criteria should be listed authors, and authors must fulfill certain responsibilities before and after publication. However, the two standards differ on some specific details.</p>



<p>Importantly, the 2018 guidance takes a more inclusive position on what types of contribution warrant authorship: it supports authorship for software tool development, and does not require all authors to have made substantial contributions to the research <em>AND </em>to manuscript preparation or revision. The allowance that writing or substantial manuscript revision can in itself be deserving of authorship better reflects standards in place within some research disciplines. Given the breadth of communities that PLOS serves, we decided that the more inclusive 2018 standards are better suited for our journal portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newer guidance also aligns better with how PLOS journals approach authorship in practice. We generally entrust authors with authorship decisions, and we require that each author&rsquo;s individual-level contributions be described using CRediT terms. With these considerations in place, not all PLOS journals have rigidly enforced whether listed contributions satisfy all ICMJE criteria. Even so, our requirement for transparency around contributions, combined with other terms in our policies, help us to address authorship issues when they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this policy update, PLOS is continuing in our efforts to advance open science, serve diverse research communities, and promote an inclusive and transparent approach to credit within the published record. We also hope that this update will improve authorship access for individuals &ndash; including those involved in global research &ndash; who make substantial contributions to research or reporting but who may not have the opportunities, skills, or resources needed to satisfy all ICMJE criteria.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-gills-thermoregulate">Why some hammerhead sharks seem to ‘hold their breath’ during dives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even fish sometimes hold their breath in cold, dark, deep water.</p>



<p>Scalloped hammerhead sharks living near Hawaii spend their days basking in warm surface waters. But at night, these fish hunt for squid and other prey in the cold ocean depths hundreds of meters below the surface. The sharks may hold on to body heat in the frigid waters by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suppressing the use of their gills while diving</a>, essentially “holding their breath” for around an hour at a time, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Whales and other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuviers-beaked-whale-longest-record-dive">deep-diving mammals are known to hold their breath</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). But this is the first time the behavior has been spotted in diving fish, says Mark Royer, a shark physiology and behavior researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu.</p>



<p>Sharks and other fish are ectotherms, meaning that their body temperature is largely controlled by the warmth of the water around them. Fish lose and gain a lot of body heat while breathing through their gills, which snag oxygen from water passing through the organ.</p>



<p>“Gills are like giant radiators strapped to your head,” Royer says, explaining that they leak heat. Because of this, a lot of shark species in the tropics tend to stick to roughly the first 100 meters of sun-heated water near the ocean surface, where temperatures hover around 26° Celsius. But tags attached to scalloped hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>) — a species found in coastal waters all over the tropics — revealed that these sharks take nightly, hour-long dives up to 1,000 meters below the surface.</p>



<p>At these depths, water temperatures can get as low as 5° C — far too cold for a tropical shark. To find out how the sharks endured such frigid temperatures, Royer and his colleagues attached specially designed instruments to the backs of sharks that had gathered in a shallow bay off Oahu to mate.</p>



<p>For the next 23 days, these sensors tracked how the sharks moved, how deep they swam, and how their internal temperature changed. “It was kind of like attaching a Fitbit to a shark,” says Royer. “It allowed me to get precise details on what the shark was doing.”</p>



<p>Sharks, the data show, went on V-shaped dives to the depths — plunging hundreds of meters before firing straight back up “like a missile,” says Royer. But strangely, the body temperature of diving sharks barely budged for the bulk of the dive. It was only when the sharks slowed their ascent at a depth of around 290 meters, where the water is a little cooler than at the surface, that their body temperature dropped by an average of 2.8 degrees C.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fish had to be shutting off their gills for most of the dive to hold on to their heat, the researchers concluded. It was only when the sharks had returned to a safer depth temperature-wise that they may have reactivated their gills — taking in oxygen for the first time in around an hour and sucking in cold water in the process.</p>





<p>Holding on to their heat while diving could help sharks move quickly in the deep ocean, says Julia Spaet, a shark ecologist at the University of Cambridge. While it is “absolutely possible” that these hammerhead sharks do this by suppressing gill activity, scientists will need to get direct evidence using cameras or other means to prove that it is true, she says.</p>



<p>At least one video from a deep-sea dive hints that this is the case. The gills of a scalloped hammerhead roaming at a depth of 1,000 meters near Tanzania appeared to be closed in footage captured a few years ago, the researchers note in their paper. This, along with the new study’s find that hammerheads hold on to their body heat, makes Royer “very confident” that sharks are in fact holding their breath. “It just goes to highlight how extraordinary this species is,” he says.</p>

<p>Species of extinct, hefty, rhinoceros-like creatures called brontotheres <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade1833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved into both bigger and smaller forms</a> over their 22-million-year run, researchers report in the May 12 <em>Science</em>. But big brontotheres seem to have enjoyed relatively uncrowded ecological niches compared with their smaller kin and so were less prone to extinction, explaining the group’s overall trend toward larger bodies over time.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s a more complex evolutionary world than what pure Darwinism would tell us,” says paleobiologist Juan Cantalapiedra of the University of Alcalá in Madrid. “It&#8217;s not this organized, predictable world where progress is a thing in nature and the better adapted always ended up surviving.”</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-last-days-extinction-book-destruction-recovery">nonavian dinosaurs were wiped out</a> about 66 million years ago, mammals got bigger — and some got really big (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>). Previously no larger than cats or coyotes, some mammals rapidly transformed into titans of a metric ton or more. Brontotheres were among the first mammals to grow to enormous size — their name comes from Greek words for “thunder” and “beast.”</p>



<p>But while more than half of the nearly 60 known brontothere species tipped the scale at over a metric ton, the first footfalls of these “thunder beasts” weren’t thunderous at all. When the earliest brontotheres appeared in the lush forests of ancient North America and Asia in the early Eocene Epoch, roughly 56 million years ago, they were about the size of a border collie — hardly the stuff of thundering herds.</p>



<p>Within about 16 million years, these modest mammals had grown into a family of giants.</p>

<p>This dramatic transformation played out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in other mammal lineages</a> too (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>). And the orthodox explanation for this trend, called Cope’s rule, holds that bigger individuals of a single species have a fitness advantage over smaller ones. Towering over predators is a good way to stay off the menu, and bigger bodies can enable bigger brains, expanded dietary options and many other advantages. “So populations will become larger over time, just because it&#8217;s better,” Cantalapiedra says.</p>



<p>Cope’s rule predicts that natural selection would lead to species and their lineages gradually getting larger over time. But the new study suggests that brontotheres followed a different evolutionary path to gigantism.</p>





<p>Cantalapiedra and colleagues tested how well three different evolutionary scenarios — including Cope’s rule — could explain the fossil record of brontotheres. They also used the fossil data to look for links between brontotheres’ size, ecology and the likelihood of going extinct or splitting into new species.</p>



<p>The new analysis suggests that brontothere species usually stayed about the same size until splitting off into new species, which could be either bigger or smaller than their forebears. But because smaller species branched into new species and went extinct more often, brontotheres overall tended to get bigger with time.</p>



<p>Comparing the family tree of brontotheres with a bonsai, Cantalapiedra says that this mechanism is a bit like letting the bonsai tree’s branches split normally while “cutting branches away from one side.” Cope’s rule, on the other hand, would be like using wires to continuously guide the tree in one direction.</p>



<p>“We often invoke Cope’s rule for large body size in mammals,” says Ryan Felice, an evolutionary biologist at University College London who was not involved in the study. “And maybe this is evidence saying: That’s not the end of the story.”</p>



<p>Beyond body size, there’s a wider question in paleobiology about how drastic evolutionary changes happen.</p>



<p>Going back to Cantalapiedra’s bonsai, does natural selection bend the branches of the tree of life gradually, shaping individual species á la Cope’s rule? Or do dramatic transformations happen when large-scale ecological or environmental processes cut away entire branches?</p>



<p>Brontotheres’ trend toward titanic proportions seems to suggest the latter. In a world with fewer big plant eaters than smaller ones, little brontotheres seem to have faced stiffer competition compared with their colossal kin. Big brontotheres won out because of their different ecology, not necessarily because bigger individuals had an advantage over smaller members of their own species, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Checking whether the same pattern holds for other groups of large animals would be an interesting next step, Felice says. He also suggests incorporating paleoclimate data into the analysis to look for any links between changes in climate and mammal evolution — patterns that could hint at possible rippling evolutionary effects of modern climate change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-universe-expansion-hubble-constant">A reappearing supernova offers a new measure of the universe’s expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cosmic camera hog is helping astronomers figure out the rate of the universe’s expansion.</p>



<p>Images of the supernova Refsdal have popped up multiple times in the constellation Leo, thanks to light from the stellar explosion wending its way through the gravitational field of a cluster of galaxies. Analyzing delays between Refsdal’s appearances provides <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new measurement of the Hubble constant</a>, researchers report online May 11 in <em>Science</em>. That constant describes how quickly galaxies are flying away from each other as the universe expands. The new measurement is now contributing to debate over how fast the universe is expanding.</p>





<p>Supernovas are massive explosions that come at the ends of some stars’ life cycles. They’re among the most violent and brilliant events in the universe. In 2014, astronomer Patrick Kelly of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis discovered the Refsdal supernova in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Instead of a single burst in the sky, Kelly says, “We saw four images of it.” They formed a pattern known as an Einstein Cross. The cross resulted because the gravity of a cluster of galaxies between the Earth and Refsdal distorts space and time to create a gravitational lens that deflects the light on its way to us.</p>



<p>The location and arrival times of the images we see depend on three things: the distribution of matter in the galaxy cluster that makes up the lens; the distances between Earth, the lens and the supernova; and the Hubble constant. The combined effect on the light from Refsdal is so strong that in 2014, Kelly predicted that one more image from the supernova would be delayed by another year. Sure enough, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/supernova-captured-quadruple-comes-back-encore">light from Refsdal showed up in the sky again in 2015</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/16</em>).</p>



<p>The new calculations from Kelly and colleagues greatly improve a 2018 measurement of the Hubble constant using Refsdal’s appearances, putting it at about 66.6 kilometers per second per megaparsec, based on gravitational lens models that most closely matched their observations. “The meticulous modeling of the [lens] system, along with the gravitational forces it generates, have allowed [the team] to decrease the margin of error in estimating the Hubble constant by more than a factor of two,” says astronomer Vivian Miranda of Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Studies that estimate the Hubble constant in other ways don’t agree well with each other. One method that relies on ancient light left over from early cosmic times suggests that the universe is expanding at about 67 km/s/Mpc. That’s close to the value Kelly’s group found. But an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">expansion estimate that uses the distances to supernovas</a> based on their brightness comes in around 74 km/s/Mpc (<em>SN 7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>“The predicted value of the Hubble constant is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the universe, both in the distant past and the recent present,” Miranda says. “If our understanding of the universe is accurate, all the various methods of measuring the Hubble constant should align.”</p>



<p>Settling the discrepancy between different values of the Hubble constant is crucial to explaining things like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">dark energy</a>, which appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe (<em>SN: 3/21/98</em>).</p>





<p>It will take another supernova and lens to make a big leap in precision over the Refsdal study. A <a href="https://www.sci.news/astronomy/hubble-multiply-imaged-gravitationally-lensed-supernova-09873.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recurring image of a supernova in the constellation Cetus</a> that’s expected to appear in 2037 might do the trick (<em>SN: 9/13/21</em>). In the meantime, Kelly says, further refinements in the model of the gravitational lens that caused the multiplied Refsdal images could improve estimates of the Hubble constant somewhat.</p>



<p>“This is the first example of this kind of measurement,” Kelly says. “It sets the stage for additional measurements and increased precision,” which could deepen astronomers’ insights into our ever-expanding universe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-explains-shout-wind-acoustics">Science explains why shouting into the wind seems futile</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shouting into the wind isn’t so ineffective after all.</p>



<p>The idiom is commonly used to describe an unsuccessful attempt to communicate. But it’s not actually more difficult to shout upwind, says acoustics researcher Ville Pulkki of Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. </p>



<p>Sending a sound upwind, against the flow of air, makes the sound louder due to an acoustical effect called convective amplification. Sound sent downwind is quieter. So, if you’re yelling upwind, a listener standing in front of you should have no problem hearing you — contrary to popular belief.</p>





<p>The misperception has a simple explanation, Pulkki says. “When you yell against the wind, you hear yourself worse.” That’s because, in this scenario, your ears are downwind of your mouth. That means your own voice sounds quieter to you.</p>



<p>Pulkki’s first attempt at testing the effect involved him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3DG8QPYEX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hollering with his head out the top of a moving vehicle</a> as microphones recorded the amplitude of his voice. The <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/143/2/1173/606458/Effects-of-flow-gradients-on-directional-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results were inconclusive</a> about the reason yelling upwind seems hard, so Pulkki and colleagues upped their technology game.</p>



<p>For the new study, the team put a simulated yeller — a cylinder and a speaker playing multiple tones — on top of a moving vehicle. Microphones measured sound amplitude at the location of the mouth and ears when the yeller was facing either upwind or downwind. The experiments together with computer simulations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32306-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the source of the misperception</a>, the researchers report March 31 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A similar effect occurs when an ambulance goes by. Most people are familiar with the sudden change of pitch of the siren’s sound due to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doppler-effect-takes-spin">Doppler effect</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/13</em>). But the siren is also slightly louder when moving toward a stationary observer than it is when it’s moving away. When you’re bellowing upwind, it’s not the source of sound that’s moving, but the medium in which the sound travels.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Whichever way the wind blows, acoustics can explain it.</p>

<p>An investigation at McMaster University found that Jonathan Pruitt, a behavioral ecologist by training who has <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dPruitt%252c%2bJonathan%2bN">had 15 papers retracted</a> in the last three years, “engaged in fabrication and falsification” including duplicating data, according to summarized findings sent to coauthors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kate Laskowski, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, shared on Twitter the summary McMaster had sent her about three papers she had coauthored with Pruitt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>McMaster’s investigation found Pruitt “generally failed to meet the requirements expected of a tenured professor” under the university’s research integrity policy, and had breached the policy in multiple ways:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee also found that Dr. Pruitt failed to exhibit the rigour, reasonably necessary to comply with the Policy, in the performance of their research or in reporting their data and findings in the various papers which were examined.

<p>Laskowski told us that multiple summaries of findings about other papers were sent out, and another she’d seen was “very similar” to the one she received. McMaster University has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, Pruitt would claim to have collected data in the field and then share it with collaborators at various institutions who took it on faith that the data were real. Laskowski was one of those collaborators who kicked off public scrutiny of Pruitt’s work in 2020 after being alerted to anomalies in the data. The case gained attention when she tweeted about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/20/im-starting-the-year-off-with-something-i-didnt-expect-to-ever-do-im-retracting-a-paper/">retracting</a> one of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKate%2bL%2bLaskowski">All three</a> she co-authored with Pruitt have since been retracted, as well as a dozen Pruitt coauthored with other scientists who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/29/authors-questioning-papers-at-nearly-two-dozen-journals-in-wake-of-spider-paper-retraction/">reevaluated their work after Laskowski came forward</a>.

<p>Pruitt <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/embattled-spider-biologist-resigns-university-post">resigned</a> from a prestigious Canada 150 Research Chair position at McMaster last summer after reaching a settlement with the university, <em>Science</em> reported at the time. Pruitt appears to be listed as a science teacher at Tampa Catholic High School in Florida, but the extension on their <a href="https://www.tampacatholic.org/team-member/jonathan-pruitt">faculty page</a> directs to a different person’s voicemail. Pruit has not responded to a request for comment sent to their school email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laskowski told us that McMaster’s lack of transparency in the case had been “frustrating.” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I honestly assumed we&#8217;d never hear anything about the results of McMaster&#8217;s investigation, so this is a pleasant, albeit highly delayed, surprise. I had come to the same conclusion on my own years ago, but it&#8217;s nice to have some measure of closure on the whole thing.</p>

<p>Update, 2100 UTC, 5/11/23: McMaster released a <a href="https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/worthmentioning/update-on-research-misconduct-case/">statement</a> about the findings and published a &#8220;<a href="https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/RI-Pruitt-summary-of-findings.pdf">copy of the committee&#8217;s key findings</a>.&#8221; The statement reads, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When the university received complaints about some of Pruitt’s research in early 2020. McMaster retained retired academic and prominent labour arbitrator William Kaplan to investigate the matter. Throughout the investigation more complaints surfaced that required the university to expand Kaplan’s mandate and required the review of thousands of documents. As well, Kaplan interviewed Pruitt eight times, along with 13 other people, including complainants, co-investigators, and witnesses. The university immediately began its hearing process after receiving Kaplan’s report.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soft-robot-flower-shape-brain-monitoring">A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive</a></h4>

              
                <p>A tiny, flexible machine might one day help neuroscientists eavesdrop on electrical activity in the brain, allowing them to pinpoint and potentially treat seizures.</p>



<p>Inserted into the skull through a hole just 1 to 2 centimeters wide, the flower-shaped device <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.add1002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfurls a flexible array of sensors that contact the brain’s surface</a>, allowing it to monitor electrical activity, researchers report May 10 in <em>Science Robotics</em>. A successful demonstration on a minipig suggests the device could be a less invasive way to place sensors directly on the brain, which currently can require removal of a large section of skull.</p>





<p>The device is known as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-soft-robot-snailfish-crushing-pressures-deep-ocean">soft robot</a>: soft, because unlike traditional mechanical devices, it&#8217;s made of flexible materials, and robot, because its sensory apparatus moves, opening like a flower once implanted (<em>SN: 3/3/21</em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;Of all the soft robotics that I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s kind of the one that you say, ‘Wow, this is really going to change, potentially, the way we do things in neurosurgery,’&#8221; says Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. &#8220;The idea of a robot that kind of internally unfolds and goes over the brain is just very elegant.&#8221;</p>



<p>The robotic device consists of a central hub surrounded by six flat, petal-shaped sensors made of a soft, flexible material. At first, the petals are inverted into the hub. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit like a glove where &#8230; you flip it outside in,” says Stéphanie Lacour, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva.</p>



<p>Once inside the skull, a flow of saline solution through the hub gently forces the petals open, where they then lay flat against the surface of the cerebral cortex. Sensors in each petal signal when they’re in place and then start monitoring the brain, sending information back to a monitor via electrical wires.</p>



<p>Lacour and colleagues tested a prototype in the brain of a minipig, successfully deploying the roughly daisy-sized sensor array inside the skull and recording electrical activity. The technology could be sized up to cover a larger area for human use, Lacour says. Future versions could be bidirectional, she says, not only sensing brain activity but also stimulating it. That might allow the device to stop seizure activity before it begins, stimulate brain areas damaged by stroke or act as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">a brain-machine interface</a> to allow people to control devices (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers have created a company to further develop the technology and conduct the additional testing that will be required to gain approval for use in human patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity">The new human pangenome could help unveil the biology of everyone</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than 20 years after people got a peek at the first draft of the human genome, our genetic instruction book, researchers have unlocked the next level: the human pangenome.</p>



<p>In four studies published May 10 in <em>Nature</em>, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe the achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01793-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the pangenome was built</a> and some of the new biology scientists are learning from it.</p>



<p>The more complete reference book, which includes almost all the DNA of 47 people, will allow researchers to explore types of variation that could never be examined before, such as large chunks of duplicated, lost or rearranged DNA. That work could possibly reveal more details about the genetic underpinnings of heart diseases, schizophrenia and various other diseases and disorders.</p>





<p>The pangenome adds 119 million DNA bases — the information-carrying units of DNA — not present in the existing human genome, called the reference genome. Much of that DNA is in never-before-explored parts of the genome containing multiple copies of genes that are duplicated from originals elsewhere in the DNA.</p>



<p>Those duplicated parts are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05895-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing faster</a> than nonduplicated portions of the genome, says Evan Eichler, a human geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle and one of the leaders of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. What’s more, when Eichler and colleagues examined the types of variants that arise in these duplicated regions, they found “a very strong signal that the mutations that are occurring are fundamentally different from [mutations in] the rest of the genome,” he says.</p>



<p>Some of these duplicated regions include ones implicated in humans’ large brains relative to other species and other traits that set humans apart from other primates. Others have been implicated in certain traits or diseases.</p>



<p>Conversely, another study found that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05976-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very short arms of certain chromosomes</a>, including chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, are becoming more like each other as they swap DNA. Those short arms are important because they contain genes for making ribosomal RNAs, which serve as the scaffolds for ribosomes, the machinery responsible for building every protein in the body.</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest achievement of the pangenome project is that it is finally giving researchers a more complete look at the full spectrum of human genetic diversity.</p>



<h4>How was the pangenome built?</h4>





<p>The roughly two-decade-old human reference genome derives mostly from one man, but is a patchwork <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">quilt of more than 60 people’s DNA</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). It has been restitched and added to over the years but still has holes.</p>



<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">first fully complete human genome</a> was announced (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>). That genome contains all of the DNA from tip to tip, or telomere to telomere, of each human chromosome. Except that genome wasn’t from a person. It came from a type of tumor known as a hydatidiform mole. These unusual tumors result when a human sperm fertilizes an empty egg and the father’s chromosomes are duplicated.</p>



<p>The genetic information from such tumors represents “not even one individual. It&#8217;s from one half of one individual,” says human geneticist Timothy O’Connor of the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore who was not involved in either project.</p>



<p>The new pangenome draft is from actual people and contains almost complete DNA from 47 anonymous individuals from different parts of the world. That diversity is important “because it helps us to understand ourselves as a single human species, as a single human race,” O’Connor says.</p>



<p>Past genetics research has been criticized for relying too heavily on DNA from people of European heritage. Studying just one population of people could mean missing genetic variants that have arisen in specific populations, O’Connor says. “Having a pangenome reference allows us to assess that population-specific variation in a much more detailed way. And hopefully, that will then lead to greater insight into the biology of everyone.”</p>



<p>While the pangenome is a great first step to better represent all human genetic diversity, O’Connor says, “it still is missing key groups in the world. It&#8217;s still underrepresenting Latin Americans and Indigenous Americans, and … there&#8217;s nobody included from Oceania.… There&#8217;s still a lot more variation that needs to be added to the pangenome to really, truly be representative of everyone.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Added diversity is coming, human geneticist Karen Miga of the University of California, Santa Cruz said during a May 9 news conference. The consortium plans to complete a total of 350 genomes, including these 47, by mid-2024. The first phase of the project was aimed at developing the technology to build the pangenome.</p>



<p>Now, the consortium is in talks with Indigenous groups and scientists from around the world about “trying to develop a shared framework, so that it&#8217;s not the U.S. trying to set the table. It&#8217;s really providing a table and inviting other stakeholders who see the value in creating this type of reference resource to join us,” said Miga, who helped lead the pangenome project.</p>



<h4>How is the pangenome important for human health?</h4>



<p>Having a more complete understanding of human genetic diversity could help researchers begin to unravel the genetic underpinnings of various diseases and disorders.</p>



<p>What’s more, new DNA deciphering technologies have allowed pangenome researchers to examine types of genetic variants that have been difficult to study before.</p>



<p>In particular, duplicated regions of the genome were hard to study because researchers previously could read only short pieces of DNA. There was no way to tell where in the vast puzzle of the human genome those nearly identical pieces fit. Newer “long-read” DNA deciphering, or sequencing, technology makes it possible to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">read stretches of DNA many thousands of bases long</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>Being able to assess where some people have extra DNA and others are missing DNA, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shared-differences">structural variants</a>, adds a more nuanced view of human genetics,  O’Connor says, revealing more of its complexity (<em>SN: 4/10/09</em>).</p>



<p>For instance, researchers used the pangenome map to trace how chromosomes fold up so that different parts are touching each other. Scientists could see some folds and chemical marks in structural variants that may affect how genes are turned on and off. That could affect traits or health. Eichler’s group also mapped one version of a gene that has converted another copy into its own image. These gene conversions were surprisingly common with each person having, on average, more than 2,000 instances of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this more nuanced and complex view of human genetics comes a promise for improved genetics-based medicine. But it may take a while before the pangenome makes a difference in medical clinics, Eichler says.</p>



<p>Researchers hope the pangenome will help them more easily diagnose the genetic changes that contribute to rare diseases and find treatments for common disorders, he says. Once that happens, clinicians may start incorporating data from the pangenome in their practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruption-nitrogen-lightning-life">Ancient giant eruptions may have seeded nitrogen needed for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millions of years ago, giant volcanic eruptions in what’s now Turkey and Peru each deposited millions of metric tons of nitrate on the surrounding land. That nutrient <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-7027.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have come from volcanic lightning</a>, researchers reported April 24 at a meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna.</p>



<p>The discovery adds evidence to the idea that, early in Earth’s history, volcanoes could have provided some of the materials that made it possible for life to emerge, says volcanologist Erwan Martin of Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>





<p>Nitrogen is an essential ingredient in biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA. It makes up about 78 percent of the atmosphere. But nitrogen molecules in the air consist of two tightly bound nitrogen atoms. Only when these atoms are separated will they react with other elements and create <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-thin-air">forms of nitrogen useful to life</a>, such as nitrate (<em>SN: 4/8/08</em>).</p>



<p>Some microbes can tease apart the nitrogen molecules and provide “fixed nitrogen” to plants and fungi. Human chemists can do it too, creating fertilizer. But before life could start, some nonbiological process must have been at play.</p>



<p>Lightning is the obvious candidate, Martin says. These extremely energetic electric discharges can tear apart nitrogen atoms, which will combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides and eventually nitrate.</p>



<p>The lightning in thunderstorms, brought about by ice particles colliding and charging, separates nitrogen molecules every day, but at low rates and spread out over large areas. Volcanic plumes, in which dust particles do the colliding and charging, can provide localized lightning at staggering intensities. During one day of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai</a> volcano in Indonesia, for instance, there were about 400,000 discharges (<em>SN: 12/13/22</em>).</p>



<p>Even that large amount of lightning creates a relatively small amount of nitrate. But rare, huge eruptions, of the kind that happen only every 100,000 years or so, could create much more. The idea that such events could produce and deposit a lot of nitrate is not new, Martin says, but until now nobody had actually looked at the nitrogen content of volcanic deposits from these eruptions.</p>



<p>His group sampled outcrops in Turkey and Peru linked to 10 explosive eruptions that happened between 20 million and 1 million years ago. Their locations’ relatively dry climate helps ensure that any nitrate formed long ago, which is soluble in water, would not have all leached out by now.</p>



<p>The nitrate that the researchers found turns out to contain oxygen atoms with different masses, in a proportion similar to that of the three oxygen atoms that make up each molecule of ozone in the air. This shows that the nitrates were formed in the atmosphere and not by some process on the ground, the team says.</p>





<p>Based on their sampling, the researchers estimate that each eruption on average deposited about 60 million tons of nitrate.</p>



<p>Life may have begun <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-microfossils-suggest-life-thrived-earth-about-4-billion-years-ago">roughly 3.7 billion years ago</a>, long before the eruptions that Martin and colleagues studied (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>). But Earth’s early years were full of such extreme volcanism. Some researchers think that lightning over volcanic islands, in particular, played a role in the emergence of life, before even the continents were fully formed. On the young Earth, Martin says, similar amounts of nitrate as those estimated in the new study could have been produced on such islands, long since submerged.</p>



<p>The study&#8217;s concept is interesting, says marine chemist Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. But he thinks the researchers should have addressed the different composition of the atmosphere at the time that life first came on the scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;In today’s world, lightning on volcanic islands produces copious amounts of nitrogen oxides,” Bada says. “But in the early Earth, when the atmosphere had little oxygen in it, the product would have been probably ammonia.” Like nitrate, ammonia is a form of nitrogen that’s biologically usable.<br><br>But, Martin says, in a volcanic plume, there is a lot of water and other oxygen compounds coming from the magma, which could have supplied some of that oxygen. And in those early days, he says, “maybe it wasn&#8217;t nitrate but ammonia — it&#8217;s still nitrogen available for life. These are still things that need to be studied.”</p>

<p>A new report from a UK Parliament committee calls for scientific publishers to correct and retract papers much quicker than they currently do, for the sake of research integrity and reproducibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-and-technology-committee">Science, Innovation and Technology Select Committee of the House of Commons</a> issued its <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmsctech/101/report.html">report</a> today, following an inquiry to which Retraction Watch and one of our cofounders, Ivan Oransky, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/3142/html/">provided</a> <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/42152/html/">evidence</a>. Many others also gave evidence, including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">sleuth</a> <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/3142/html/">Dorothy Bishop</a>. </p>



<p>The report is an extensive look at current issues of reproducibility and research integrity, and includes many recommendations. About the role of scientific publishers, the report says:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127086"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Publishers should support academics who report issues with published research in their journals and should commit to timely publication of research error corrections and retractions where necessary—in our view this process should not take longer than two months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As readers of Retraction Watch know, the process of correcting or retracting a paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/17/what-took-more-than-five-years-elsevier-retracts-20-papers-by-worlds-most-prolific-fraudster/">often</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/05/why-did-all-of-these-retractions-take-more-than-three-years/">takes</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/23/which-takes-longer-to-produce-an-infant-who-can-sit-on-his-own-or-a-retraction/">years</a>. That average length of time <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ivanoransky/the-relationship-between-pubpeer-comments-and-the-speed-of-retraction">has not changed significantly</a> in years, either. In a passage quoted by the committee in its report, we note that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A growing group of ‘sleuths’ has found thousands of problematic papers, most of which have yet to be corrected or retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee also called for publishers to provide sufficient outlets for negative or confirmatory studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond recommendations for publishers, the report recommended funding for replication studies and for the inclusion of statistical experts and software developers on research teams, that researchers publish their data and code in open-access repositories, and that undergraduate, postgraduate, and early career researchers receive training on reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/san-francisco-plane-waste-covid-19-variant">San Francisco airport will monitor plane waste for COVID-19 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>International travelers can now contribute valuable data to COVID-19 surveillance efforts in the United States from above the clouds.</p>



<p>San Francisco International Airport has launched a new program to test airplane wastewater for variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, <a href="https://www.flysfo.com/about/media/press-releases/sfo-first-airport-launch-new-cdc-program-test-airplane-wastewater-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airport announced May 9</a>. The program is the first in the country to continuously monitor sewage from airplanes, after previous studies demonstrated the potential value of this work.</p>



<p>Airplane wastewater is a key source for COVID-19 surveillance because international travelers frequently bring new variants into the country, experts say. As fewer people get their noses swabbed in health care facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7219e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking for new ways</a> to keep tabs on how the coronavirus mutates. Searching for genetic material in airplane <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">bathroom waste</a> can help fill that data gap — and even provide early warnings for future health crises (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>).</p>





<p>“We know variants have been imported from around the globe,” says Alexandria Boehm, an environmental engineer at Stanford University who leads <a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WastewaterSCAN</a>, one of the biggest wastewater surveillance programs in the United States. Testing airplane waste “can give us a sense of which variants are being imported and help us prepare.”</p>



<p>For the new project, the San Francisco airport is collaborating with the CDC and Concentric by Ginkgo, a biosecurity and public health team in Boston.</p>



<p>Testing started on April 20, according to a spokesperson for the airport. Airport workers are taking samples from vacuum trucks that suck waste out of airplane bathrooms, using an automatic machine that plugs into a central dumping point. “We’re basically creating a composite sample of the trucks, which themselves are a composite sample of aircraft,” says Andrew Franklin, director of business development at Concentric.</p>



<p>The San Francisco airport has one dumping point dedicated to international flights, which are a priority for testing because passengers are more likely to use the restroom — and deliver solid samples — when they spend many hours on the plane. The airport is shipping one composite sample per day, six days a week, back to a lab, where scientists isolate the coronavirus’ genetic material and put the results through machines that map the virus’ genes.</p>



<p>The resulting data are complicated, says Casandra Philipson, director of bioinformatics at Concentric, as each sample includes hundreds of passengers from around the world. “Trying to figure out how to determine actual frequencies of mutations or variants” in the sewage samples will be a challenge, she says, though simply seeing certain variants pop up in the data will warn health officials about what to watch out for.</p>



<p>Concentric has worked with the CDC on <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring COVID-19 among international travelers</a> since fall 2021, when the company started offering free PCR tests to people returning from long flights. About 170,000 travelers have contributed to the program, which has picked up new variants before they spread widely in the United States.</p>





<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smruthi-karthikeyan-coronavirus-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">wastewater surveillance</a> is more efficient than voluntary nose swabs, leading scientists to focus on this approach for future monitoring efforts (<em>SN: 9/29/22</em>). In August and September 2022, Concentric and CDC researchers ran a pilot program at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to test the idea. Out of 88 samples collected from airplane bathrooms, the team was able to perform PCR tests on 80, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7208a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2</a>, the scientists reported in the Feb. 24 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Analysis of genetic material from 25 samples turned up a variety of coronavirus variants.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00129-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other research projects</a> and <a href="https://www.luminultra.com/blog/luminultra-participates-in-innovative-wastewater-surveillance-pilot-project-at-toronto-pearson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot programs</a> have similarly <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated this technique’s potential</a> for detecting variants. The <a href="https://wastewater-observatory.jrc.ec.europa.eu/static/pdf/Sampling%20Aircrafts_FINAL_Version%209%20Jan%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission has issued guidance</a> for airports in the European Union that may want to try it out. As with other forms of wastewater surveillance, though, scientists are still working to understand how they might interpret and act on the data. “It will be a new data stream that we’ll have to learn to use as it evolves,” Boehm says.</p>



<p>In addition to tracking coronavirus variants, scientists hope that future programs like the one at the San Francisco airport can lay the groundwork for monitoring new diseases that might enter the United States through international airports. “It’s easy to also test the samples for other emerging pathogens,” says Colleen Naughton, an environmental engineer at the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>The Concentric team is excited about this potential and looking for other types of health data that might come out of airplane waste. “We’re building this future technology,” Philipson says, “to expand the toolkit for pathogens of public health concern.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnets-meteorites-space">Why you shouldn’t use magnets when looking for meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s time to drop the magnets, meteorite hunters. The commonly used method for identifying space rocks can destroy scientific information.</p>



<p>Touching even a small magnet to a meteorite can <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JE007464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erase any record the rock might have retained about the magnetic field</a> of its parent body, researchers report in the April <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>. And the concern isn’t theoretical: a subset of the oldest known Martian meteorites appear to have already had their magnetic memories wiped, the team showed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists often turn to meteorites to get a closeup look at other worlds, as well as understand our own. The space rocks can contain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crushed-space-rocks-meteorites-exoplanets-early-atmosphere">traces of planetary atmospheres</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">chemical building blocks for life</a> and more (<em>SN: 1/26/21</em>; <em>SN: 4/26/22</em>).</p>



<p>Planetary scientist Foteini Vervelidou uses meteorites from Mars — chunks of the planet that were blasted into space by an impact and later captured by Earth’s gravity — to study its ancient past. Just <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few hundred</a> are known to exist. Rarer still are specimens that contain minerals carrying imprints of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sad-magnetic-state-solar-systems-rocky-worlds">the Red Planet’s magnetic field, which collapsed</a> about 3.7 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/7/15</em>). The oldest known Martian meteorites, which date to roughly 4.4 billion years ago, therefore present an “amazing chance to study the magnetic field,” says Vervelidou, of MIT and the Institute of Earth Physics of Paris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But such opportunities can be readily squandered, Vervelidou and colleagues have shown. The team’s numerical calculations and experiments with earthly rocks — stand-ins for meteorites — confirmed that bringing a hand magnet close to a rock can rearrange the spins of the rock’s electrons. That rearrangement overwrites the imprint of a previous magnetic field, a process called remagnetization.<br><br>What’s more, the process appears to happen frequently. The team examined nine meteorites found at different times and places on Earth. All of them are thought to have originated from the same oldest known chunk of Mars, which most likely broke up when it entered Earth’s atmosphere. All had been remagnetized. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The finding is unfortunate, but it’s not surprising, says Melinda Hutson, a meteoriticist at Portland State University in Oregon and the curator of the <a href="http://meteorites.pdx.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cascadia Meteorite Laboratory</a> who was not involved in the research. “Just about everyone wants to stick a magnet on the side of a potential meteorite.”</p>



<p>It is possible to evaluate a meteorite without destroying its magnetic properties. Vervelidou uses a lab instrument called a susceptibility meter, which measures how an object would respond to a magnetic field. And portable versions exist: She and a team of meteorite researchers used one to find nearly 1,000 meteorites on a recent expedition in Chile. Hopefully, Vervelidou says, some of those space rocks will shed light on Mars’ magnetic past.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pythagoras-math-reality-music-spheres">How Pythagoras turned math into a tool for understanding reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever heard the phrase “the music of the spheres,” your first thought probably wasn’t about mathematics.</p>



<p>But in its historical origin, the music of the spheres actually was all about math. In fact, that phrase represents a watershed in the history of math’s relationship with science.</p>



<p>In its earliest forms, as practiced in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, math was mainly a practical tool for facilitating human interactions. Math was important for calculating the area of a farmer’s field, for keeping track of workers’ wages, for specifying the right amount of ingredients when making bread or beer. Nobody used math to investigate the nature of physical reality.</p>





<p>Not until ancient Greek philosophers began to seek scientific explanations for natural phenomena (without recourse to myths) did anybody bother to wonder how math would help. And the first of those Greeks to seriously put math to use for that purpose was the mysterious religious cult leader <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pythagoras of Samos.</a></p>



<p>It was Pythagoras who turned math from a mere tool for practical purposes into the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. As the historian <a href="https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/geoffrey-lloyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Lloyd</a> noted, “The Pythagoreans were … the first theorists to have attempted deliberately to give the knowledge of nature a quantitative, mathematical foundation.”</p>



<p>Pythagoras was born in about 575 B.C. on Samos, an island in the Eastern Mediterranean near the coast of present-day Turkey. He traveled widely, to Egypt and Babylonia and perhaps even Persia, to learn how math was used in those ancient cultures. He may even have spent time in the city of Miletus (not far from Samos) to study with the aging Thales, the founder of the ancient Greek effort to explain the world rationally.</p>



<p>Around the age of 40 or so, Pythagoras headed west to southern Italy, settling in the Greek colony town of Croton. There he initiated a new phase of ancient science, mixing religion, music and math in a cult devoted to living in harmony with nature. For Pythagoras, the historian of Greek philosophy W.K.C. Guthrie wrote, philosophy ceases to be primarily about explaining nature but instead “becomes the search for a way of life whereby a right relationship might be established between the philosopher and the universe.”</p>



<p>Of course, if your goal is to live in harmony with the universe, you need to know something about the universe. So even though Pythagoras basically established a religious cult, he and his followers still expanded the Greek quest to explain the cosmos.</p>



<p>And that’s where math came in.</p>





<h4>The universe is made from numbers</h4>



<p>Pythagoras believed that, at its root, reality was made from numbers. That sounds crazy to modern minds taught that matter is made of atoms and molecules. But in ancient times, nobody really knew anything about what reality is. Every major philosopher had a favorite idea for what sort of substance served as reality’s foundation. </p>



<p>Thales, for instance, thought everything derived from water. His student Anaximander rebelled, arguing that reality at its root consisted of some infinite, featureless material called the apeiron, or the unlimited. Anaximenes, Anaximander’s successor, rejected the apeiron in favor of air — everything could be explained by air either rarefying or solidifying. A later philosopher, Heraclitus, insisted that everything ultimately came from fire.</p>



<p>Pythagoras chose numbers. Numbers, he taught his followers, are the seeds from which all reality grows. All members of the Pythagorean cult had to recite an oath crediting him with identifying the numbers “which contain the fount and root of ever-flowing nature.”</p>



<p>Specifically, Pythagoras identified the root of reality in what he called the <em>tetractys, </em>consisting of the first four integers: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Added together, those numbers equal 10. Ten, Pythagoras concluded, is the “perfect” number, the number that holds the key to understanding nature.</p>



<p>And why 1, 2, 3 and 4? Because those numbers were the key to creating harmonious sounds.</p>



<p>Imagine plucking a taut string of fixed length, producing a musical note. If you pluck a string half as long, you get another note, separated from the first note by an octave. If the strings are plucked simultaneously, the two notes are harmonious. In other words, a 2:1 ratio of string lengths produces a pleasing sound. In a similar way, other harmonious musical intervals called the fourth and the fifth represent string length ratios of 4:3 and 3:2. Pythagoras realized that these harmony-producing ratios all involved the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Therefore, he concluded, their sum, 10, was the key number for developing a theory of the universe.</p>

<p>Pythagoras himself may not have developed that theory fully, but his later followers produced a vision of the universe consisting of heavenly bodies revolving around a “central fire.” That fire was NOT the sun, which was just one of the other heavenly bodies. The sun shone brightly because it reflected the light from the central fire back to the Earth (and the inhabited part of the Earth always faced away from the fire).</p>



<p>The Pythagoreans surmised that the motions of the heavenly bodies generated pleasant music. As Aristotle later explained it, those bodies move rapidly and therefore they must make sound, because anything moving quickly on Earth makes sound (think arrows whizzing through the air). Proper ratios of the planets’ speeds (which depended on their distances from the central fire) guaranteed that the sounds would be harmonious. Hence the moving planets created a “harmony of the heavens.” Because later Greek writers supposed that each planet is carried on its orbit by a rotating sphere, eventually that harmony became known as “the music of the spheres.”</p>



<h4>The universe is a musical instrument</h4>



<p>So in a sense, the Pythagoreans believed that the universe itself could be regarded as a gigantic musical instrument. As Aristotle put it, the Pythagoreans thought “the whole heaven to be a musical scale and number.”</p>



<p>But this picture had a problem. The Pythagoreans knew of only eight heavenly bodies: Earth, moon, sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. A ninth, outermost sphere transported the fixed stars. But to be perfect, the cosmos needed a 10th body. So the Pythagoreans proposed the existence of another planet, a “counter-Earth,” orbiting the central fire inside the orbit of the Earth. Nobody could see that planet because it was always on the other side of the fire. Rather than limit their description of the cosmos to what could be observed, the Pythagoreans resorted to mathematical theory to infer the existence of an unseen reality.</p>



<p>This theory was wrong, of course. But it nevertheless foreshadowed the modern use of mathematics to predict unseen phenomena. In the 19th century, for instance, James Clerk Maxwell used equations to predict the existence of radio waves. In the 20th century, Paul Dirac used math to predict the existence of antimatter. And in the 21st century, astronomers detected gravitational waves, vibrating space itself, as physicists had expected based on the math of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Using math for understanding nature was unknown before Pythagoras. It was his idea. Previously math had been a tool for scribes or surveyors or cooks. “Pythagoras freed mathematics from these practical applications,” the Dutch mathematician B.L. van der Waerden wrote in his <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.134.3494.1975.a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classic history of ancient math</a>. “The Pythagoreans pursued mathematics as a kind of religious contemplation, as a way to approach the eternal Truth.”</p>



<p>As for the music of the spheres, one issue remained. If the heavens made harmonious sounds, why didn’t anybody hear them? Aristotle reported that the Pythagoreans “explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence.”</p>



<p>Aristotle rejected that explanation, just as he rejected the idea of a “counter-Earth” as well as the whole notion that everything was made from numbers. And yet, the importance of numbers in science, first expressed by Pythagoras, ultimately proved to be much more resilient than most of Aristotle’s ideas. As experts on early Greek philosophy André Laks and Glenn Most have written, “Of all the early Greek philosophers,” Pythagoras “without a doubt exerted the longest-lasting influence until the beginning of modern times.”</p>

<p>The authors of a 2018 nanoscience paper have retracted the article after three doctoral students highlighted a problem with its methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2018 study <a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/nanospears-may-revolutionize-gene-therapy/">attracted media attention</a> for suggesting that nanospears, microscopic structures similar to splinters, may be useful in delivering gene therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/weiss-paul-s/">Paul Weiss</a>, a nanoscientist and a corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://twitter.com/PSWnano/status/1643694132924383232">announced</a> the retraction on Twitter April 5, the same day the retraction notice appeared. Weiss holds several academic positions, including Presidential Chair of Chemistry and Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).</p>



<span id="more-127070"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b00763">study</a>, “Precision-Guided Nanospears for Targeted and High-Throughput Intracellular Gene Delivery,” was published in <em>ACS Nano,</em> of which Weiss was a <a href="http://archive.sciencewatch.com/inter/jou/2010/10sepACSNano/">founding editor-in-chief</a>. It has been cited 80 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.3c02453">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors retract this article (DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b00763) as the fluorescence method by which the transfection efficiency was determined is unreliable and incorrect and led to greatly overestimated values of efficiency. The original data are also no longer available and cannot be verified.</p>



<p>We thank Drs. Jason Belling, Alexandra Mendoza, and Natcha Wattanatorn for bringing the measurement issue to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Xiaodong Chen, the journal’s editor-in-chief and a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, for comment and heard back from an ACS spokesperson, who said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The issue you mention below was an author-requested retraction. For reference, we follow <a href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines">COPE’s retraction guidelines</a> in such situations.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three scientists the notice credited for flagging the error were PhD students at the time.&nbsp; One was an author of the original study, Weiss and his co-authors Hsian-Rong Tseng and Steven J. Jonas, both also at UCLA, told <em>Retraction Watch </em>in a joint email. All have since earned their degrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted Belling, Mendoza, and Wattanatorn, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>Weiss, Tseng, and Jonas said the three then-students flagged the error about a month after the paper was initially published, preventing it from creeping into other papers. They said they had planned to repeat the experiments properly, but “the equipment and people were not available,” so they retracted the paper. They added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We plan to repeat these experiments with the correct measurements to determine accurate efficiencies.</p>



<p>We did a thorough search for the original data and could not find it as, at the time, the data on the microscope used were not archived. We have addressed this issue throughout our laboratory.</p>



<p>We very much appreciate the support the community has shown since we published and publicized this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After Weiss posted the retraction note on Twitter, several scientists tweeted in support.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">The James Webb telescope revealed surprise asteroids in the Fomalhaut star system</a></h4>

              
                <p>The star Fomalhaut is ready for its close-up.</p>



<p>Rings of dust encircle the young star in stunning new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. The photos offer a clearer view of the star system — already famous for previous images of a purported, now widely disputed, planet. Features in the system include an oddly cockeyed asteroid belt, an expanding cloud of debris from a possible planet collision, and other unidentified bits <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01962-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that hint at a dynamic and crowded environment</a>, researchers report May 8 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“It’s the first time we’re actually looking at the inner system, and it looks really different than I think anybody expected it to,” says astrophysicist Meredith MacGregor of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. “The expectation was that there would be something like our solar system,” a place that is relatively mature and stable. “It really starts changing how we think about the dynamics of the [Fomalhaut] system.”</p>



<p>Fomalhaut, a scant 25 light-years away, is a young star at the center of a rapidly evolving planetary system. It was once thought to host one of the first planets to be photographed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">outside of our solar system</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/08</em>). However, the existence of the planet — dubbed Dagon — has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-faux-malhaut-b">long been in question</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/12</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new JWST images add to the growing evidence that Dagon is actually a cloud of dust. A collision among planets probably explains the dusty feature, says András Gáspár, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It is fading, and it is expanding in size,” he says, as it follows a trajectory consistent with dust blowing in the stellar wind from Fomalhaut. Those are all characteristics more indicative of dust clouds than planets.</p>



<p>But just because Dagon hasn’t seemed to have panned out, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other planets lurking around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>Indirect evidence for other worlds comes from an unexpected asteroid belt, seen for the first time in the new images. The belt is tilted at a jaunty 23 degrees from everything else seen in orbit around the star.</p>



<p>“This is a truly unique aspect of the system,” Gáspár says. The tilted belt, he says, could be the result of as-yet-undiscovered planets stirring up the debris around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>MacGregor agrees. “If you see a disk that&#8217;s like this, that has an [elongated] outer ring and a bunch of dust that&#8217;s getting dragged in, there are probably planets there,” she says. “I think the easiest explanation [for the tilted belt] is there&#8217;s a planet in there, and the planet is on an orbit that is not aligned with the disk.” The misaligned planet, in turn, is dragging the asteroid belt off-kilter with respect to the plane of the solar system, she says.</p>





<p>The JWST images also turned up a newly identified feature in the outer belt around the star.&nbsp; It’s a blob that Gáspár and his colleagues call the Great Dust Cloud. It’s not yet clear whether it’s a real feature, or just some bright object shining through from beyond the Fomalhaut system.</p>



<p>“It could easily be a background galaxy,” Gáspár says, “which would be a really cruel trick by nature.” Follow-up observations with JWST will help them decide, he says. If the object stays put while the Fomalhaut system keeps spinning, then it’s a cosmic photobomber, lurking in the background.</p>



<p>The latest images answer some questions about Fomalhaut while raising a host of new ones, Gáspár says. “This single observation of Fomalhaut revealed way too many aspects of the system that we need to understand and unpack,” he says. “We set out to spatially resolve the asteroid belt component but ended up opening a much greater box of surprises.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-pipistrelle-bats-echolocation">Pregnancy may hamper bats’ ability to ‘see’ in the dark</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy can do weird things to the body. For some bats, it can hamper their ability to “see” the world around them.</p>



<p>Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats (<em>Pipistrellus kuhlii</em>) <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01557-7#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20pregnant%20bats%20emitted%20longer,in%20hunting%20performance%20during%20pregnancy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">echolocate less frequently while pregnant</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>BMC Biology</em>. The change may make it harder for the tiny bats to detect prey and potential obstacles in the environment.</p>



<p>The study is among the first to show that pregnancy can shape how nonhuman mammals sense their surroundings, says Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.</p>





<p>Nocturnal bats like Kuhl’s pipistrelles famously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bat-brain-signals-illuminate-navigation-dark">use sound to navigate and hunt prey in the dark</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/17</em>). Their calls bounce off whatever is nearby and bats use the echoes to reconstruct what’s around them, a process aptly named echolocation. The faster a bat makes calls, the better it can make out its surroundings. But rapid-fire calling requires breathing deeply, which is something that pregnancy can get in the way of.</p>



<p>“Although I’ve never been pregnant, I know that when I eat a lot, it’s more difficult to breathe,” Yovel says. So pregnancy — which can add a full gram to a 7-gram Kuhl’s pipistrelle and may push up on the lungs — might hamper echolocation.</p>



<p>Yovel and colleagues tested their hypothesis by capturing 10 Kuhl’s pipistrelles, five of whom were pregnant, and training the bats to find and land on a platform. Recordings of the animals’ calls revealed that bats that weren’t pregnant made around 130 calls on average while searching for the platform. But bats that were pregnant made only around 110 calls, or 15 percent fewer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decline in calls among pregnant bats could impede hunting, the team says. A computer simulation showed that the study’s expectant moms would catch 15 percent fewer insects than nonpregnant bats. That finding could help explain why some bat species chase after larger and slower prey once they become pregnant, focusing their energy on easier-to-spot food. Figuring out whether diminished echolocating ability is responsible for these diet shifts will require more fieldwork, Yovel says.</p>



<p>However, the idea that carrying a fetus would interfere with echolocation makes a lot of sense, says behavior ecologist Erin Gillam of North Dakota State University in Fargo. “As a mammal who has been pregnant, I don’t think these results are surprising at all.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First successful enzyme therapy in humans</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-successful-enzyme-therapy-humans"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 28, 1973</p>



<p>Fabry’s disease … [is caused by] a faulty fat-metabolizing enzyme called alpha-galactosidase. Because the abnormal enzyme does not break down lipids in the blood as it should, they accumulate in the body. [Researchers] tried to purify the enzyme in its normal form from human placental tissue. Four months ago they got enough of the enzyme to inject into two patients…. The results look promising.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Though the trial showed that enzyme replacement therapy could work, it took decades before such treatments were cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 1991, an injection to treat a different rare inherited disorder called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/enzyme-therapy-another-success">Gaucher disease</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/altered-enzyme-reverses-gauchers-symptoms">became the first to gain approval</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/74; </em>SN: 5/25/91). Approval for an enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry&#8217;s disease followed in 2003. Scientists are still developing enzyme therapies. Last year, researchers reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-treated-rare-genetic-disease-womb">treating a developing fetus for Pompe disease</a>, which causes severe heart and muscle defects (SN: 11/9/22).</p>

<p>A 2021 article that found journals from the open-access publisher MDPI had characteristics of predatory journals has been retracted and replaced with a version that softens its conclusions about the company. MDPI is still not satisfied, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133">Journal citation reports and the definition of a predatory journal: The case of the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)</a>,” was published in <em>Research Evaluation</em>. It has been cited 20 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.us.es/trabaja-en-la-us/directorio/maria-de-los-angeles-oviedo-garcia">María de los Ángeles Oviedo García</a>, a professor of business administration and marketing at the University of Seville in Spain, and the paper’s sole author, analyzed 53 MDPI journals that were included in Clarivate’s 2018 Journal Citation Reports.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127066"></span>



<p>Oviedo García assessed each journal by eight criteria associated with predatory publications, including self-citation. She also compared the MDPI journals to the journals with the highest impact factor in their subject category. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211211124315/https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133">original abstract</a> described her findings like this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The formal criteria together with the analysis of the citation patterns of the 53 journals under analysis all singled them out as predatory journals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Soon after the paper was published in July 2021, MDPI issued a “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/2979">comment</a>” about the article that responded to Oviedo García’s analysis point by point. The comment called out “the misrepresentation of MDPI, as well as concerns around the accuracy of the data and validity of the research methodology.”</p>



<p>In September 2021, <em>Research Evaluation</em> published an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/420/6360986?login=false">expression of concern</a> about the article that stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal and publisher have been alerted to concerns about this article, and an investigation is in progress. In the interim, we alert readers that these concerns have been raised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The article was retracted and replaced with a revised version earlier this month. The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvad014/7126683?login=false">notice</a>, which is labeled as a “correction,” stated that the replacement addressed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>concerns about conclusions drawn in the article. The conclusions in the updated article are reached based on cited sources.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Oviedo García what led to the retraction and replacement, and she told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In a nutshell, after the publication of the article both the journal&#8217;s editors and the publisher received communications raising concerns about it. Then, that original version was revised and have been now published replacing the old version of the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Oviedo García told us that she did not “have full details” about who raised concerns about the article. “The revision of the article was a joint work between the publisher and myself,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/thed-van-leeuwen#tab-1">Thed van Leeuwen</a>, a senior researcher at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies of Leiden University in the Netherlands, and an editor of <em>Research Evaluation, </em>has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Language throughout the article was changed to describe the findings less definitively. (See a comparison we created <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Comparison-version.docx">here</a>.) The sentence in the abstract we quoted above now states that the analysis of the 53 journals “suggest[s] they may be predatory journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical language remains in the new version, such as this discussion of the MDPI journals’ huge and <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/quality-questions-publishers-growth-challenges-big-players">increasing number of special issues</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fact that the number of special issues in JCR-indexed MDPI-journals is so much higher than the number of ordinary issues per year coupled with their constant increase since 2018 inevitably awakens suspicions of a lucrative business aim.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The revision removes some references to MDPI’s temporary inclusion on librarian Jeffrey Beall’s list of “potentially predatory” publishers, along with links to an <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived version</a> of the list, which was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">taken down in 2017</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised version also includes additional caveats about the limitations of the work, such as which analyses Oviedo García did not conduct on the control group of top-ranked journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, rather than the original statement that the uniformly short review times at MDPI journals were “highly questionable,” the paper now states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As such the question arises whether or not this speed is achieved with a thorough peer review in line with editorial and publishing best practices or if the rigor and quality of the peer review process is compromised in order to achieve these speeds. It is beyond the scope of this research to answer that question based on the analysis conducted, further research is needed to address this key question.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A new paragraph in the section discussing the article’s limitations calls for further research to compare MDPI journals with other journals with similar impact factors, rather than the top-ranked journal in the subject area, as Oviedo García had done. MDPI’s comment on the article specifically called the comparison of its journals to those with the highest impact factors “flawed,” among many other critiques.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After <em>Research Evaluation</em> published the expression of concern about the paper, MDPI contacted Oxford University Press, the journal’s publisher, to follow up on the status of the article multiple times, said Giulia Stefenelli, chair of MDPI’s Board of Scientific Officers. But, Stefenelli told us, “We did not receive any response from OUP that showed progress on the handling of this paper, nor did we receive an update when this paper was retracted and replaced by a revised version.”</p>



<p>Stefenelli expressed dissatisfaction with the journal’s process, and the republished version of the paper:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were expecting more transparency and communication, and to be informed at key stages of the progression of the investigation. As we have demonstrated, the original article contained serious flaws in its methodology, which have yet to be addressed or corrected. This was highlighted in our initial comment on the article (https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/2979).</p>



<p>We would expect more details to be made publicly available for the readers so they can understand why this article was retracted and corrected. We found no track record of the original version retracted nor record about the corrections that have been made. In this case, we question OUP’s processing of this retraction/correction, as it would appear to be against COPE guidelines and standard practices.</p>



<p>The article sends a strong message affecting MDPI directly and ultimately begs the question, is this an article the public can trust? It is important to note that a retraction is issued when there is clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, as a result of major error. The fact that this article was retracted raises questions about the details of the significant changes made in order for it to be republished.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AdobeStock_569558679-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Maternal vaccination</h4>
<p>Pregnancy and early infancy are increased risk periods for severe adverse effects of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937812007223?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respiratory infections</a>. Influenza vaccines (IIV) and whooping cough (pertussis) vaccines are <a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended</a> and free to every Australian pregnant woman to combat these infections during pregnancy, and the vaccines provide protection for young infants as well for approximately the first six months of life, through the transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta.</p>
<p>Because there is no central, national system in Australia that routinely monitors maternal vaccination uptake, it is unclear whether there is equitable distribution of these vaccines among our diverse populations. This is important because despite being recommended and free in Australia for decades, the overall uptake of IIV in pregnancy varies greatly between the different states and territories. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.13130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uptake generally remains sub-optimal</a>, and we need to be confident that those with higher risk factors for infection in pregnancy and early infancy are being offered and provided vaccination. These risk factors include people with co-morbidities, living in remote regions, lower socio-economic status, inadequate housing, decreased rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and limited access to culturally safe and appropriate, affordable health care.</p>
<h4>Existing inequities</h4>
<p><a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajo.13548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our previous work</a> found that rates of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy were higher than they were for IIV, and that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajo.13548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key driver</a> for having IIV in pregnancy. But we also found that pertussis vaccination was considerably lower (17%) among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander pregnancies (respectfully referred to as First Nations) compared to other Australians (54% vs 71%). This was concerning because First Nations women and infants in Australia bear a disproportionately <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/baseline-incidence-of-adverse-birth-outcomes-and-infant-influenza-and-pertussis-hospitalisations-prior-to-the-introduction-of-influenza-and-pertussis-vaccination-in-pregnancy-a-data-linkage-study-of-78-382-motherinfant-pairs-northern-territory-australia-19942015/E5B9726C48B9177FD9E5CE7822E7A901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher burden</a> of respiratory diseases compared to non-Indigenous women and infants, which is a consistent finding in other countries’ Indigenous populations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vaccination against these infections has to be prioritized in these groups as a key public health strategy in preventing severe disease in pregnancy and early infancy and is the benchmark of equitable healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05574-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, we sought to understand these findings further, so we explored the equity of maternal IIV and pertussis vaccination for three Australian groups between 2012-2017: First Nations women; women from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds; and women living in remote areas or areas considered socio-economically disadvantaged. Our cohort of 445,590 individual pregnancies from the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia comprised of 29,181 First Nations women (6.5%), 93,561 women from CALD backgrounds (20.9%), and 322,848 other Australian women (72.4%).</p>
<p>Over the six years we found that although maternal vaccination rates were steadily increasing over time, overarching inequity persisted in participants who a) identified as First Nations, b) lived in remote areas, and c) lived in areas considered the highest in disadvantage. Compared with the other groups, First Nations women were <strong>less likely</strong> to have received <em>both</em> of the recommended maternal vaccines whereas women from CALD backgrounds were <strong>more likely</strong> to have. Women living in the highest areas of advantage were <strong>more</strong> <strong>likely</strong> to have received both vaccines during pregnancy too.</p>
<p>We know the increased risk factors for acquiring influenza or pertussis infections are living in remote regions, lower socio-economic status, inadequate housing, and limited access to culturally safe and appropriate, affordable health care. Vaccination against these infections has to be prioritized in these groups as a key public health strategy in preventing severe disease in pregnancy and early infancy and is the benchmark of equitable healthcare.</p>
<h4> What’s next?</h4>
<p>We plan to reassess these outcomes using contemporary data to determine whether our study findings still hold true five years later. Acquiring these multiply linked, whole of population data is a slow process though, and as experts in our field, we believe that a national, maternal vaccination surveillance system is warranted. One that can provide ongoing, reliable, accurate and timely data on vaccination uptake, and identify areas in vaccine inequity, so that appropriate resources can be mobilized to address the areas of inequity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salty-water-ice-mars-equator">Salty water may have flowed near Mars’ equator as recently as 400,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Crusts, cracks and other geologic features on sand dunes near the Martian equator are leading researchers to believe there may have been water there much more recently than previously thought.</p>



<p>The features, likely caused by the movement of thawed, salty water, turned up in images taken by China’s Zhurong rover. A chemical analysis from the rover shows that they may have formed as recently as 400,000 years ago, researchers report April 28 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>The results could help guide future missions to find life on Mars. Atmospheric conditions on Mars 400,000 years ago were similar to what’s seen now, suggesting it’s possible that there’s still liquid, salty water at the planet’s low latitudes, says Xiaoguang Qin, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>



<p>The Zhurong rover — China’s first Mars rover — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">landed on the Red Planet</a> in May of 2021 in a region called Utopia Planitia, just north of the Martian equator (<em>SN: 5/19/21</em>). Over nine months, the rover gathered images and information on the chemical composition of the region’s dunes and took measurements of the cracks found along the sandy surfaces.</p>



<p>When Qin and his team first saw the rover images they were surprised. The crust’s features appeared to be related to water activity. Wind wouldn’t leave those geologic tracks; it would instead erode the crust. Nor would dioxide frost; it wouldn’t exist at lower latitudes. Melting pockets of frozen water best explained the features found on the dunes, the team concluded.</p>



<p>Mapping the number and size of meteorite impact craters in the area gave a rough estimate of the dunes’ age — they likely formed 1.4 million to 400,000 years ago. That suggests there was water in the region as recently as hundreds of thousands of years ago, not billions of years ago, as previously speculated.</p>



<p>It’s the combination of the features seen in the dunes with the age which makes the new research special, says Aditya Khuller, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “We’ve seen these features before,” says Khuller. “But they’re usually much older.”</p>



<p>Scientists also have previously found <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence for </a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current-day </a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water</a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ice</a> in the mid-latitude gullies of Mars. And data from NASA landers hint that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">liquid brines</a> can exist on the planet at middle to high northern latitudes, although it would be too cold for life (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Qin says the findings from the Zhurong rover point to comparatively mild ground temperatures, which suggests the low-latitude sand dunes of Mars could be hospitable to life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-who">WHO declares an end to the global COVID-19 public health emergency</a></h4>

              
                <p>COVID-19 is no longer a global public health emergency, the World Health Organization announced May 5.</p>



<p>The organization pointed to two factors: Dropping COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations, and high levels of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from vaccination or prior infection. While the pandemic is not over, those trends signal that it’s <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-05-2023-statement-on-the-fifteenth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time to transition</a> to more long-term prevention and control of the disease, WHO said in a statement.</p>



<p>“It’s reasonable, it makes sense,” says infectious disease specialist Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco, noting that “it follows on the heels of many countries” doing the same thing. The U.S. public health emergency is officially <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">set to end May 11</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/23</em>).</p>





<p>But, Chin-Hong adds, “this doesn’t mean that it’s not still a global health threat.”</p>



<p>Worldwide, more than <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">750 million confirmed cases of COVID-19</a> have been reported to the WHO as of May 3. And nearly 7 million people have died from the disease, including more than 1.1 million people in the United States alone.</p>



<p>WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, on January 30, 2020. It’s the highest level of alarm under international law. Two months later, the organization also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-who-pandemic">named the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a pandemic</a>, indicating it was not containable (<em>SN: 3/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>These declarations came at a scary and chaotic time: Countries initiated lockdown measures to prevent spread of the disease; there were way more questions than answers about the deadly disease, and no treatments or vaccines.</p>



<p>WHO’s designations prompted nations to work together, collaboratively collecting and sharing COVID-19 data including confirmed cases, hospital admissions, deaths and research. Since then,&nbsp;tests, vaccines and treatments have been developed. More than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide.</p>



<p>Even as the global public health emergency ends, the WHO noted remaining challenges to keeping the disease in check, including global inequities in accessing care and vaccines, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">evolving virus</a> and “pandemic fatigue” (<em>SN: 1/13/23</em>).</p>





<p>What <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WHE-SPP-2023.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term management of the disease</a> will look like remains to be seen; WHO plans to form a committee to examine that question. The agency will also continue monitoring the disease, but it will be integrated into a system that’s used to survey global influenza data.</p>



<p>But the end of the PHEIC may also mean that COVID-19 tracking data — already incomplete for a variety of reasons including the proliferation of at-home testing — will decline even more, Chin-Hong says. And researchers might have less available funding, which could slow the development of new vaccines and treatments. “There are repercussions both from a research perspective and a clinical care perspective,” he says.</p>



<p>In a May 5 news conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to keep their COVID-19 systems in place and remind people that SARS-CoV-2 is still dangerous.</p>



<p>“This virus is here to stay,” he said. “It’s still killing, and it’s still changing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-black-hole-spiral-galaxy">A streak of light may not be a black hole fleeing its galaxy after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A trail of starlight thought to possibly indicate a runaway supermassive black hole may be something much more mundane: a spiral galaxy seen edge on, a new study finds.</p>



<p>In February, astronomer Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University and colleagues reported spotting a line of stars near a compact galaxy in Hubble Space Telescope images. The researchers’ analysis suggested that three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-black-hole-galaxy-hubble">galaxies had interacted and merged, kicking a supermassive black hole out of its host galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/23</em>). The black hole then traveled through a nearby gas cloud, the scenario goes, triggering the formation of stars in a line that points toward the home galaxy and revealing the black hole’s madcap escape.</p>





<p>But other researchers have been skeptical of this interpretation, with some suggesting that the scenario is too complex to explain the linear feature. In the new study, “we decided to explore what we thought was the most simple explanation,” says astronomer Ignacio Trujillo of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain.</p>



<p>He was inspired by a data plot in the original study, which compared the velocities of the stars in the linear feature with their positions, a comparison known as a velocity curve. To him, it looked like a spiral galaxy’s plot of its pinwheel rotation, where the stars in the galactic disk all <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vera-rubin-biography-ashley-yeager-dark-matter-cosmology">move at nearly the same speed</a>, no matter if they appeared to travel toward or away from Earth (<em>SN: 8/17/21</em>). That, combined with van Dokkum and colleagues’ estimate of the feature’s mass — roughly 100 million suns, which was surprisingly large for a simple line of stars — implied that the object is actually a spiral galaxy viewed on its edge, Trujillo says.</p>



<p>So he and his colleagues compared characteristics of the linear feature with those of a well-studied spiral galaxy called IC 5249, which astronomers know we see edge on from Earth. The team looked at the objects’ masses, surface brightnesses and general motions of stars. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">properties of the galaxy and linear feature matched closely</a>, the researchers report in the study, which is in press in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </em>and was also submitted April 24 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>For now, “the evidence is not conclusive either way,” says astrophysicist Christopher Conselice of the University of Manchester in England who studies galaxy evolution and was not involved in either study.</p>



<p>“A black hole being ejected from a galaxy would be really cool,” Conselice says. “But I think the simple explanation is that it’s either an edge-on galaxy, or some kind of filament or tidal debris,” left over from some previous galaxy interaction.</p>



<p>Van Dokkum still favors the black hole scenario, in part because of one new image. In the original Hubble images, the linear feature merely points toward a compact galaxy at its left. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a new ultraviolet image,</a> from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, “you start to see that this feature is actually connected to the galaxy,” which strengthens the runaway black hole theory, he says.</p>



<p>Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that the edge-on spiral galaxy and compact galaxy are independent structures but members of the same galaxy group, coincidentally close to each other from our viewpoint.</p>





<p>The debate’s resolution may have to wait at least until this summer when better imagery from Hubble arrives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-pterosaurs-dinosaurs-fossils-pterodactyls">New discoveries are bringing the world of pterosaurs to life</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In an eat-or-be-eaten world, flight conveys a bevy of benefits. A creature that takes to the third dimension can more easily escape earthbound predators, dine off a much broader menu or drop down on unsuspecting victims from above. Flying also allows an animal to cover distance more quickly, forage more efficiently and find mates more easily.</p>



<p>So it’s perhaps surprising that only three groups of vertebrates have ever evolved sustained, muscle-powered flight. Pterosaurs, Greek for “wing lizards,” arrived on the scene in the Triassic Period, perhaps as early as around 237 million years ago. These original vertebrate fliers preceded birds by at least 70 million years and bats by more than twice that.</p>





<p>What caused pterosaurs’ demise is clear: The same <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">asteroid that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs</a> about 66 million years ago also took them out — along with more than 75 percent of all life on Earth (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 10</em>). But how pterosaurs took to the air in the first place remains a big mystery. “We don’t have any properly transitional fossils for pterosaurs, or at least ones that we recognize,” says Matthew Baron, a freelance vertebrate paleontologist.</p>



<p>Despite the gap in the early fossil record, recent research offers clues to who pterosaurs’ earliest cousins were and what they looked like, and how pterosaurs evolved from small, flitting creatures into an incredibly varied group. They eventually occupied ecosystems worldwide and consumed a wide variety of prey — getting bigger and spreading farther earlier than previously thought, recent studies reveal. Some grew bizarre crests atop their heads, while others sported mouths full of teeth that projected threateningly at various angles. </p>



<p>“Some pterosaurs looked like creatures from your nightmares,” says Brian Andres, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Sheffield in England.</p>



<p>During their lengthy reign of the skies, pterosaurs ranged in size from creatures that could sit in the palm of your hand to soaring behemoths with wingspans that rivaled those of an F-16 fighter jet. In fact, the largest animal that ever took flight — an iconic species discovered more than half a century ago but only recently described in great detail — was a pterosaur.</p>



<h4>Where did pterosaurs come from?</h4>



<p>Pterosaur fossils were first unearthed in the late 1700s — coincidentally, from the same limestone formation in Germany that later yielded the earliest known bird, <em>Archaeopteryx</em>. Scientists didn’t quite know what to make of the fossils. One scientist proposed they belonged to a weird sea creature, and another thought they represented a transitional form between birds and bats. But soon, experts settled on the fact that pterosaurs were flying reptiles, distinct from dinosaurs.</p>



<p>The first discovered species was named <em>Pterodactylus antiquus</em>, the genus name stemming from the Greek words for “wing finger.” (Although this species and many discovered soon after were commonly referred to as pterodactyls, that term officially applies only to this species and a small group of related species within the broader pterosaur lineage.) Unlike in bats, whose wing membranes are stretched between four elongated fingers of the hand, a pterosaur’s wing is supported by only one hyperelongated finger, a hallmark that helps distinguish pterosaurs from other creatures.</p>





<p>But something pterosaurs and bats do share is that when they first appear in the fossil record, they’re already able to fly. Direct evidence of how the reptiles took to the skies is lacking. “As yet, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825221002786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we do not know of any ‘missing link’ pterosaurs</a>,” Baron reported in 2021 in <em>Earth-Science Reviews</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h4>Pterosaur timeline</h4>



<p>Pterosaurs originated during the Triassic Period — well before the other two groups of flying vertebrates, birds and bats — and then died out in the same mass extinction that killed off non-avian dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>237 million years ago</strong>: Suspected origin of pterosaurs</li>



<li><strong>230 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known dinosaur fossil</li>



<li><strong>219 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known pterosaur fossil</li>



<li><strong>150 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known bird skeleton</li>



<li><strong>66 million years ago</strong>: Asteroid hits and pterosaurs, along with non-avian dinosaurs, go extinct</li>



<li><strong>52 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known bat skeleton</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>The oldest known pterosaur fossils date to about 219 million years ago, though paleontologists suspect pterosaurs originated as early as 237 million years ago, Baron notes. That’s when the oldest and closest relatives of pterosaurs lived, and thus probably around the time that pterosaurs would have split off and formed their own lineage. The gap in the fossil record is in part due to the fact that rocks from this period are scarce worldwide. And many pterosaur bones were hollow, so they were vulnerable to being crushed soon after death or during fossilization. “Often, pterosaur remains are just a jumble of bones,” Baron says.</p>



<p>But there are indirect clues to what a proto-pterosaur might have looked like and whether pterosaur flight evolved from the ground up — in terrestrial creatures that flapped and leaped into the air — or from the trees down — in tree-living animals that glided.</p>



<p>Those clues come from studies of pterosaurs and their relatives. In 2020, researchers published a paper in <em>Nature</em> comparing the anatomy of 157&nbsp;species of early pterosaurs, primitive dinosaurs and a variety of reptiles that lived at the same time or earlier. A group known as lagerpetids — from the Greek for “rabbit reptiles,” so named because of the general proportions of the bones in the limbs — was most closely related to pterosaurs.</p>



<p>A separate analysis, reported last year in <em>Nature</em>, showed that a fast-running, roughly 20-centimeter-long reptile that lived about 230 million years ago was a close relative of both lagerpetids and pterosaurs. Given that close relationship, this creature, called <em>Scleromochlus taylori,</em> may serve as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-reptile-relative-fossils-tiny-fast-evolution">a good stand-in for the kind of animal that pterosaurs evolved from</a> (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 15</em>).</p>



<p><em>S. taylori</em> had slender limbs, small hands and straight claws, all of which point to a ground-dwelling creature, says Davide Foffa, a vertebrate paleontologist at National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh. Because a critter like<em> S. taylori </em>presumably didn’t spend a lot of time in trees, that argues against the idea that pterosaur flight evolved out of gliding. But a small pelvic girdle suggests that <em>S. taylori </em>wasn’t a leaper, Foffa says. That would seem to argue against the standard idea for how a ground dweller would take to the skies. However, he says, “it’s not necessary to be a leaper to evolve flight.”</p>

<h4>What did pterosaurs eat?</h4>



<p>What pterosaurs ate is often a matter of conjecture. Although some fossils preserve stomach contents — direct evidence of what was consumed — most of the time researchers must look at where a pterosaur lived and how its anatomy compares with modern creatures to reconstruct diet. Based on such comparisons, researchers have speculated that various species of pterosaurs ate everything from insects and worms to fish, crustaceans and meatier prey such as small land vertebrates.</p>



<p>But sometimes, researchers are left to comb through other types of evidence.</p>



<p>Take <em>Kunpengopterus sinensis</em>, a pterosaur that lived in what is now China between 165 million and 153 million years ago. Last year, researchers reported unearthing fossils of this species alongside <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-fossils-puke-pellet-regurgitation-food">gastric pellets chock-full of fish scales</a>, a strong hint that the creatures had eaten fish and then regurgitated the indigestible bits, as modern owls and gulls do (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 5</em>).</p>



<p>Other evidence comes à la fossilized poop — or, more delicately, coprolites. If a coprolite can be linked to the creature that made it, any contents can be reasonably identified as a part of the diet, says Martin Qvarnström, a vertebrate paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. A few years ago, he and colleagues analyzed three coprolites from more than 150-million-year-old rocks unearthed in south-central Poland. The fossilized dung was deposited on an ancient tidal flat that also preserved a multitude of pterosaur footprints, Qvarnström says. The well-trampled surface appears to have been rapidly buried, perhaps as soon as the next tide came in, so it’s very likely that both <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/7375/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the footprints and the coprolites were made by pterosaurs</a>, he and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>PeerJ</em>.</p>



<p>Using high-energy radiation to perform CT–like scans of the fossilized poop, the team found that the largest coprolite, which was about 1.5 centimeters long and 6 millimeters in diameter, contained more than 100 calcium-rich shells of single-celled organisms called foraminifera. One of the smaller coprolites contained many bristles from what may have been bottom-dwelling marine worms. The large numbers alone suggest that ingestion of these forams and worms wasn’t accidental, Qvarnström says. Instead, the researchers propose, the pterosaur had been targeting this prey.</p>

<p>For these pterosaurs to consume such minuscule prey, they must have been filter feeders, much like flamingos or baleen whales. To capture the forams — which were mostly about 300 micrometers across, about the size of a large dust mite — these pterosaurs must have had jaws full of closely spaced teeth, the team suggests. Although filter-feeding pterosaurs are known from later ages, this is the first strong evidence for them living as early as about 150 million years ago, says Qvarnström.</p>



<p>Because skeletal fossils of these pterosaurs aren’t yet known, Qvarnström’s group doesn’t know what the mystery filter feeders looked like or how big they were. But maybe they resembled the newly discovered species <em>Balaenognathus maeuseri</em>. (<em>Balaenognathus</em>, roughly translated from Latin, means “whale jaw,” a reference to baleen whales.) Its fossils were unearthed from limestone rocks laid down as sediment sometime between 157 million and 152 million years ago in what is now Germany, says David Martill, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England.</p>

<p><em>B. maeuseri </em>had a wingspan of about 1.5 meters, similar to a large flamingo. The pterosaur had a 10-centimeter-long, spatula-shaped bill that sported at least 480 teeth. Many of those long, thin teeth — not strong enough to provide a clamping bite on struggling prey — had tiny hooks on their ends, Martill says. That’s unlike anything seen in any other pterosaur. The crochet hook–like features probably helped the pterosaur <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12542-022-00644-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter and trap itty-bitty prey</a> more effectively than straight teeth would have, Martill and colleagues reported January 21 in <em>PalZ</em>. When foraging, this long-legged creature probably waded through shallow water, facing into the flow and opening its jaws just enough for plankton-­rich water to enter, Martill says. Then, water drained away through the teeth, leaving behind a food-rich slurry.</p>

<h4>Growing large and going global</h4>



<p>Thanks to a fossil discovered in 2017 on Scotland’s Isle of Skye, researchers now realize that pterosaurs grew to larger sizes much earlier than once thought. That, in turn, has helped debunk some theories about why pterosaurs evolved large body sizes.</p>



<p>Embedded in limestone laid down as sediments in a lagoon about 167 million years ago, the well-preserved fossil lacks only parts of the skull, wings, hind limbs and tail, says Natalia Jagielska, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. She and colleagues dubbed the creature <em>Dearc sgiathanach</em>, which in Scottish Gaelic means “winged reptile from Skye.”</p>



<p>Microscopic analyses of cross sections of some bones revealed features akin to the growth rings in trees, hinting that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00135-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pterosaur was at least 2 years old and still growing when it died</a>, Jagielska and colleagues reported in February 2022 in <em>Current Biology</em>. Based on the size of the pterosaur’s upper-arm bone, the team estimates the youngster had a wingspan of around 2 meters.</p>



<p>Comparisons with the growth patterns of closely related pterosaurs suggest that an adult would have had a wingspan of at least 2.5 meters and possibly 3 meters or more. That makes <em>D. sgiathanach</em> the largest pterosaur to have lived up until that time, with a wingspan that rivaled a trumpeter swan’s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-800x450.jpg" alt="An illustration of Dearc Sgiathanach next to a dinosaur." class="wp-image-3124173" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124173">The recent discovery of <em>Dearc sgiathanach</em> (illustrated next to a dinosaur) suggests that pterosaurs evolved large body sizes by at least the middle of the Jurassic Period.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124173">N. Jagielska</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before the discovery of <em>D. sgiathanach</em>, studies had suggested that pterosaurs didn’t start to become larger until the late Jurassic Period, between about 160 million and 145 million years ago. At that point, the story goes, competition with newly evolved birds forced pterosaurs to expand beyond being just insect eaters and into new ecological roles. But <em>D. sgiathanach</em> evolved tens of millions of years before the first birds took wing, so other, not-yet-identified factors must have been at play, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Another recent study speaks to how widely and how quickly pterosaurs spread around the world, Andres says. Some extremely fragmentary specimens unearthed from sandstone in northwestern Argentina, including scattered portions of a snout, a jawbone and a wing bone, are distinct enough to be classified as belonging to pterosaurs. The features are so distinct that Andres and colleagues named two brand-new species:<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spp2.1424" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Yelaphomte praderioi</em> and <em>Pachagnathus benitoi</em></a>. The team described the fossils in March 2022 in <em>Papers in Palaeontology</em>.</p>



<p>The sandstone probably dates to sometime between 206 million and 200 million years ago, the researchers estimate. Unequivocal pterosaur remains known from that time come from North America, Europe and Greenland — all then part of the northwestern portions of the supercontinent Pangaea. The new fossils were found in an area that was once southwestern Pangaea, Andres notes. That reveals a wider distribution tens of millions of years earlier in pterosaur history than was previously presumed, Andres’ team argues. And because the sandstone formed in upland areas far from the nearest coast, the find reveals that pterosaurs lived in a greater diversity of habitats in this era than previously recognized.</p>



<h4>The largest animal ever to fly</h4>



<p>Of all the pterosaurs ever found, none has captured imaginations as much as <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature to ever take flight. Besides cameos in <em>Jurassic Park: Dominion</em> and the comic strip <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>, the species has appeared on the postage stamps of more than two dozen nations and on two coins struck by the Royal Canadian Mint.</p>



<p>Scientists are enamored of the species too. The 1975 paper that initially described it has been cited more than 500 times, despite its brevity, Andres says. In late 2021, Andres and colleagues <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2021.1907587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built on that paper’s description</a> with a number of papers that, for the first time, delved deeply into the iconic species’ size, appearance, movements and the habitat where it lived.</p>



<p>Only a handful of <em>Q. northropi </em>fossils have been found, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2020.1780599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most in the Big Bend area of southwestern Texas</a>, Andres says. Most of the identifiable remains come from a handful of creatures and together comprise a partial wing and a few leg bones. They, and several hundred other poorly preserved pterosaur bone fragments, were unearthed from rocks formed from sediments that accumulated in stream channels between 69 million and about 66 million years ago, says Tom Lehman, a vertebrate paleontologist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. That means some of these pterosaurs could have been alive when or just before an asteroid struck Earth and brought on a long-lasting and worldwide climate catastrophe.</p>



<p>Much of what scientists suspect about <em>Q. northropi</em> stems from the more common fossils of a related species, <em>Q. lawsoni</em>. Andres and his colleagues have unearthed fossils of more than 200 of these individuals, offering enough bones to reconstruct the majority of the pterosaur. The team estimates that this smaller relative had a wingspan of about 4.5 meters and lived in the same area around the same time as<em> Q. northropi</em>, Lehman says. He and colleagues estimate that <em>Q. northropi </em>had a wingspan of about 10 meters.</p>

<p>If these two species did live simultaneously, Lehman says, they evidently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2019.1593184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divvied up the ecosystem and foraged separately</a>. When they died, their carcasses ended up in different types of sedimentary rocks, suggesting different parts of the environment.<em> Q. lawsoni</em> apparently spent a lot of time in oxbow lakes. <em>Q. northropi</em>, on the other hand, seems to have foraged along the edges of the river itself. Plenty of water snails and other creatures lived in these bodies of water and would have provided ample food for hungry pterosaurs and other predators, Lehman says.</p>



<p>Based on their measurements, the researchers made life-size models of <em>Q. northropi</em>’s bones to see how the creatures would have moved and to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2020.1780247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconstruct the range of motion of their joints</a>. “First of all, their back is so short and their legs are so long that they couldn’t walk like other quadrupeds,” says Kevin Padian, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “And their forelimbs are so long, they couldn’t avoid touching the ground.” Yet pterosaur footprints suggest that those forelimbs weren’t helping propel the creature forward when it walked, he says. Instead, they appear to have been used for support only, like walking sticks.</p>



<p>It appears that <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em> could reach down to the ground with its long, toothless beak — and even lower, into bodies of water. Once it grabbed its prey, it could tilt its beak to the sky and swallow its victims whole. So Padian and colleagues suggest that this pterosaur patrolled through meadows or waded in shallow waters as modern-day storks or herons do, plucking up fish, mammals or even small dinosaurs using a beak that acted like chopsticks.</p>



<p>The sight of a giraffe-sized predator stalking through swamps would have undoubtedly been impressive. “The worst thing about pterosaurs,” Andres says, “is that they’re no longer around.”</p>
