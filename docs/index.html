<p>A veterinary journal has retracted a paper from a major pet food company after criticism prompted the authors to re-examine their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction is the first in the <em>Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</em>’s 180 years of publication, Lisa Fortier, the journal’s editor in chief, told Retraction Watch. But veterinary researchers who wrote to the journal with concerns about the article say the retraction doesn’t address all the issues they raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/aop/javma.23.11.0621/javma.23.11.0621.xml">Sixteen years of canine hepatic copper concentrations within normal reference ranges in dogs fed a broad range of commercial diets</a>,” appeared online March 7. Most of the authors are affiliated with Hill’s Pet Nutrition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within weeks of the article’s publication, the journal got the first of seven letters “crying foul,” Fortier said. </p>



<span id="more-129295"></span>



<p>The topic of copper in dog food has been “very controversial,” she said – the authors of a <a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/258/4/javma.258.4.357.xml">2021 editorial</a> in <em>JAVMA</em> called for re-examining guidelines about the <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/news/20220128/looming-concern-about-copper-dog-food-copper-overload-quietly-killing-our-dogs">copper content of dog food</a> because they had “seen what we believe to be an increased incidence” of dogs with <a href="https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/10/copper-associated-liver-disease-in-dogs">liver damage from copper</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper from Hill’s scientists, with Leslie Hancock, the company’s chief medical officer, as the last author, concluded “although there is an increase in copper concentrations, it is not clinically significant,” and the recommendations for copper content in dog food “are not resulting in hepatic copper toxicity.”&nbsp; An <a href="https://www.petfoodindustry.com/nutrition/research-notes/article/15668056/dog-copperstorage-disease-lacks-clear-diet-breed-correlations">article in <em>Petfood Industry</em> about the study’s findings</a> (which has been updated to highlight the retraction) stated the team “didn’t note any clear correlations between copper levels in dogs’ livers and their varied diets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortier sent the critical letters to Hancock and her team, who re-examined their work and found an error in their data. The effect of the mistake on the paper was too much for a correction, Fortier said, so she told the authors to draft a retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following <a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/aop/javma.2024ret/javma.2024ret.xml">notice</a> appeared on May 21:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On behalf of my coauthors, I write to formally request a retraction to accurately respond to concerns expressed in the received Letters to the Editor regarding “Sixteen years of canine hepatic copper concentrations within normal reference ranges in dogs fed a broad range of commercial diets,” published online on March 7, 2024. Unfortunately, with further investigation, new data were discovered that materially change the results of the article as it reads today. The latest information revealed a change in reported liver copper concentration results imported from a portion of the 2006 to 2014–era sample. As a result of these findings, it is necessary to make corrections to uphold the integrity of scientific research and maintain the trust of our readers and the veterinary community. All coauthors agree with the retraction, with the full intention to resubmit and share the full results of this meaningful study in a timely manner. We regret that these new findings were unavailable to the authors earlier and apologize to the readers and editors for any confusion. We look forward to the opportunity to share corrected data in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Hancock told Retraction Watch the study’s first author, a master’s student, obtained additional data files that led to identifying the error in the company’s internal database:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We discovered a critical field necessary for analysis was lost during an update to our electronic medical records and data system after 2014. This data loss was not due to negligence or inadequate methods; instead, it resulted from a sequence of unforeseen events. The error might have remained undetected for years, which would have been even more disheartening for the author who initially pointed out the inconsistency.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hancock said her team is preparing a corrected manuscript with a reanalysis of the internally procured samples. (Her full comments are available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hancock-comment.pdf">here</a>.)</p>



<p>“​​I think the master’s student who found this is amazing to have dug that far, it’s real due diligence,” Fortier said.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">None of the journal’s editorial team had ever dealt with a retraction before, but an associate editor had recently attended a session about retractions at the <a href="https://cse.memberclicks.net/2024-annual-meeting-schedule">Council of Science Editors meeting</a> just weeks ago. (A speaker recommended editors reach out to Retraction Watch ahead of the retraction, which they did.) </p>



<p>Fortier said her focus was on “how can I make this process fair and honest for our authors, and therefore our readers.” Hill’s is a sponsor of the AVMA, which owns the journal, but Fortier said she “didn’t treat them any differently.” She expressed respect for the authors, and the scientists who wrote to her about the article: “I think the process worked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several of the letter-writers said they disagreed with Fortier’s decision not to publish their letters. In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Keith Richter, a veterinarian in San Diego, Calif., wrote to Fortier: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The retraction statement does not address many of our concerns, and it is hard to imagine how correction of “a change in reported liver copper concentration results imported from a portion of the 2006 to 2014–era sample” can overcome deficiencies in study design, study subjects, and errors in copper quantification.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Richter’s formal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/letter-to-the-editor-javma.pdf">letter to the editor</a>, signed by two other veterinary researchers, detailed those concerns and said the paper’s authors “make several unsubstantiated conclusions.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/letter-to-Fortier.pdf">longer letter</a> Richter and his colleagues sent to Fortier personally, they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors state the objective of this study is to “examine the effects of age, sex, breed, liver histopathology, and year of death on liver copper concentrations in dogs fed commercial dog foods”. We believe the real underlying objective was to prove that commercial dog foods are not responsible for increasing hepatic copper concentrations and copper associated hepatopathies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The whole thing is concerning, both from an ethics standpoint as well as from the numerous design and method flaws along with misguided conclusions,” <a href="https://cvm.msu.edu/directory/langlois">Daniel Langlois</a>, an associate professor at Michigan State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, in East Lansing, told Retraction Watch. In a formal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/letter-2-to-Fortier.pdf">letter</a> to the editor, Langlois and two other colleagues wrote some of the article’s findings “defy logic,” and the liver specimens seemed not to have been processed properly, according to the study’s methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This was a massively flawed study,” Langlois said, and was not designed to address any link between copper in dog food and copper-associated liver disease in the animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors&#8217; conclusions were also completely overstated, and they immediately disseminated their results and conclusions to a number of veterinary news outlets with the final message being that regulations for dietary copper supplementation are not involved in the etiology of copper-associated hepatopathy in dogs,” Langlois said. “Even if their results were accurate, this would not be a reasonable conclusion based on their study populations and design.”</p>



<p>“One thing is clear,” he added. “This paper was not appropriately reviewed.” </p>

                <div>arXiv users will soon see changes to the date format in /list URLs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Currently, arXiv /list URLs use the YYMM date format when displaying papers from a specific time range. arXiv will soon be deploying a change that would switch from the YYMM to the YYYY format in /list URLs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For example, if a user was interested in browsing all the papers from the year 2020 (20) that were announced in November (11) in the subject area Differential Geometry (math.DG), currently they would visit <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.DG/2011">https://arxiv.org/list/math.DG/2011</a>. Once we deploy the /list URL format change, https://arxiv.org/list/math.DG/2011 will return all math.DG papers from the year 2011 instead. To find all the Differential Geometry papers announced in November 2020, arXiv users would visit <a href="https://arXiv.org/list/math.DG/2020-11">https://arXiv.org/list/math.DG/2020-11</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To summarize:</div>
<ul>
<li>Currently, arXiv /list URLs use the YYMM format: https://arxiv.org/list/category.SUBCATEGORY/YYMM</li>
<li>Soon, arXiv /list URLs will use the YYYY format: https://arxiv.org/list/category.SUBCATEGORY/YYYY
<ul>
<li>Under this new format, to specify a year and a month for listings, use the YYYY-MM format: https://arxiv.org/category.SUBCATEGORY/YYYY-MM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="p-rich_text_section">When this change is deployed, arXiv will automatically redirect unambiguous URLs to the correct page, where possible.</div>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may recall the work of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/michael-dougherty/">Michael Dougherty</a>, who has established a reputation as a sleuth focused on plagiarism. We are pleased to present an excerpt of Dougherty&#8217;s new book, <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/70376">New Techniques for Proving Plagiarism: Case Studies from the Sacred Disciplines at the Pontifical Gregorian University</a>, Studies in Research Integrity, vol. 2 (Leiden: Brill 2024).</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The principles of textual criticism—borrowed from the fields of classics and medieval studies—have a valuable application for plagiarism investigations. Plagiarists share key features with medieval scribes who worked in scriptoriums and produced copies of manuscripts. Both kinds of copyists—scribes and plagiarists—engage in similar processes, and they commit certain distinctive copying errors that fall into identifiable classes. When committed by plagiarists, these copying errors have probative value for making determinations that a text is copied, and hence, unoriginal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To demonstrate fully that a text is a plagiarism of another text, one must show <em>how</em> the text is plagiarizing the other text. Many plagiarism researchers, as well as members of institutional research integrity committees, miss this step. They take the mere identification of textual overlap to be the upper limit of analysis. By stopping short, they leave themselves vulnerable to the typical defenses made—sometimes in bad faith—by academic malefactors and their apologists. Those defenses can include: a claim of independent fortuitous discovery; a claim that one was simply recalling a lecture from memory; a claim that one had cryptomnesia from reading many sources; and the like. </p>



<span id="more-129298"></span>



<p>The careful application of the principles of textual criticism, however, which focuses on very particular types of copying errors, can in many cases rule out these standard defenses. Complex features of overlapping texts can be used to prove that one text really is a copy of another. A comprehensive approach to plagiarism must incorporate evidence beyond simple verbatim overlap; the identification of new and subtle forms of evidence of plagiarism is critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Distinctive case studies are required to exhibit the efficacy of newly proposed techniques for proving plagiarism. For this role, I have selected monographs in the sacred sciences (e.g., philosophy, theology, canon law) that are the published versions of doctoral dissertations from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. That university is the major degree-granting institution for many clerics around the world who have ascended to high offices in the Roman Catholic Church. The focus on these monographs as case studies is beneficial for two major reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, most studies in research integrity today are pursued from the standpoint of the natural, social, and biomedical sciences. The predominant issues in those fields include data fabrication, data falsification, irreproducible experimental results, publication bias, and shoddy or manipulative statistical methods. From such perspectives, the significance of plagiarism is sometimes downplayed. Frameworks for discussing research integrity are typically modeled after the problems and concerns of those disciplines, which are not always adaptable to research conducted in the humanities or the sacred disciplines. </p>



<p>Yet plagiarism remains the central problem of research integrity in the humanities and sacred disciplines, and it should be treated from the vantage of these disciplines. The discussions of plagiarism in this volume are intended to contribute to establishing a more comprehensive and inclusive model of research integrity with applicability across a broader range of disciplines. It is therefore important to offset any disproportionate influence that other disciplines have carried in contemporary approaches to research integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, a focus on the research outputs of a major pontifical university provides an occasion for a detailed examination of the lasting and pernicious effects of plagiarism committed in an ecclesiastical environment. That topic only recently has begun to attract <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/59184">serious</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/horizons/article/abs/magisterial-authority-and-theological-authorship-the-harm-of-plagiarism-in-the-practice-of-theology/EAF23C6C002FA221A774A1DE41C6DB2B">scholarly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-46711-1">attention</a>. By using new techniques for proving plagiarism, we see apparent research integrity failures on a large scale at a major institution of Catholic higher education.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Code of Canon Law uses the term <em>disciplinae sacrae </em>(sacred disciplines) to designate academic fields of special significance for the formation of leaders in the Roman Catholic Church. Principal among them are philosophy, theology, and canon law. An advanced degree in one of these disciplines, awarded by an ecclesiastical institution, is required to hold various curial offices and academic positions in Catholic seminaries. The possession of the terminal degree—a doctorate—is regarded as an optimal credential for some of the highest offices, including the episcopacy. It is therefore useful to explore the repercussions for the Church and the academy in cases where the crucial credential of a doctoral degree appears to be unwarranted due to substantial plagiarism in the doctoral dissertation.</p>



<p>Although many ecclesiastical institutions of higher education exist worldwide, the narrow focus on the Pontifical Gregorian University is justified due to the institution’s unparalleled role in the formation of priests who later go on to hold high offices in the Catholic Church. Nearly one out of every four of the more than 5,000 Catholic bishops around the world are counted among its alumni. The institution counts over one-third of the College of Cardinals as former students. Sixteen previous popes are graduates or former faculty members of the Pontifical Gregorian University, including seven of the last twelve.</p>



<p>My work used principles of textual criticism to examine nine published monographs by clerics that originated in doctoral-level dissertations at the Pontifical Gregorian University. These published dissertations, all written in English, are treated as distinctive examples of the quality of the research conducted during a recent period at the university and then distributed—via publication—to the larger world of learning. Chosen from the <em>disciplinae sacrae</em> of theology, philosophy, canon law, and missiology, these published dissertations appeared in print from 1995-2014 under the aegis of the university press of the Gregorian University. Together they represent the major areas of research for which the Roman institution is best known.</p>



<p>A decade or more has passed since each of the nine published doctoral dissertations appeared in print. This extended period allows for an examination of the laudatory reception each has received in the downstream research literature within their respective academic disciplines. This time frame also allows for a consideration of the beneficial effects that high academic qualifications—the doctoral degree and the published dissertation—bestow on their possessors over the span of their careers. A pontifical doctorate and a published dissertation are key credentials for promotion to academic and ecclesiastical leadership positions. The authors of record (or stated authors) for these published dissertations have acquired various positions in seminaries and diocesan curiae throughout the worldwide church. So far, a third of them (3/9) have been elevated to the episcopacy to lead dioceses around the globe. The number seems likely to increase.</p>



<p>Yet culpability is not placed <em>in toto</em> on the authors of record of the published dissertations. Although responsibility rests primarily with doctoral students, plagiarism in dissertations cannot be successful on a wide scale unless it is permitted (either by encouragement or negligence) by those tasked with academic institutional oversight. Rectors, academic deans, dissertation advisors, university professors, and thesis committee members, among others, must be regarded as complicit if plagiarism is found to occur on a significant scale within an institution.</p>



<p>One may reasonably question whether a university adequately mentors doctoral students and genuinely promotes doctoral studies, when substantially defective dissertations are found in proportionately high numbers. Widespread plagiarism is a systemic failure involving lapses and omissions by individuals throughout the hierarchy of an institution who have not provided reliable oversight of doctoral students and who have neglected to provide truthful evaluations of institutional research products.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/06/04/there-is-no-recipe-for-discoveries/">There is no recipe for discoveries</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is no recipe for discoveries, and there is no cookbook on how to publish a paper. But at least there are typical events and routes that are often encountered. Here, I&#8217;d like to share the trajectory of a study that we recently published in Nature Neuroscience (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">Rupprecht et al., 2024</a>), with the hope that my recount will be useful for those who have a similar path before them and especially for those who may encounter these obstacles for the first time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span class="uppercase">Conceiving a research project</span></strong></h3>



<p>When I joined the lab of <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">Fritjof Helmchen</a> at the University of Zurich in Summer of 2019, I was primarily interested in the role of pyramidal dendrites, and I was hoping to work on dendritic calcium imaging for my postdoc. However, at very short notice, Fritjof was looking for somebody to shoulder a project focused on calcium signals in hippocampal astrocytes, and he managed to convince me to give it a shot. At this point, we had a clear hypothesis (derived from the slice experiments of a PhD student), and I thought this could be a mini-project to get me started working with mice: doing my first surgeries, building a 2P microscope, and building my first behavioral rig.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The first technical problems</strong></h3>



<p>The initial plan was to perform calcium imaging of pyramidal neurons and astrocytes in hippocampus of mice on a treadmill. The treadmill design I copied from the then-junior research group of <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=t4nRobkAAAAJ">Anna-Sophia Wahl</a> and learned from her and other researchers how to implant a chronical window that enables to look into the hippocampus of living mice. However, I soon struggled with the first major problems.</p>



<p>First, in an attempt to perform <span class="uppercase"><strong>dual-color imaging of astrocytes and neurons</strong></span>, I injected two viruses. One to express the red calcium indicator R-CaMP1.07 in neurons, the second to express the green calcium indicator GCaMP6s in astrocytes. To be sure, I replicated the procedures from a neighboring lab that had used this very same approach in cortex (Stobart et al., 2018). However, my attempts were not successful. I could express either R-CaMP in neurons or GCaMP in astrocytes, but not at the same time. It seemed like a mutual exclusion pattern, due to phase separation or some sort of competition among the viruses. I learned that this has happened to others as well, but nobody seems to fully understand under which conditions it does so. In any case, I gave up on dual-color imaging and simply performed calcium imaging of astrocytes to get started.</p>



<p>A second, more severe problem was my struggle with the interpretation of the observed calcium signals.  The calcium signals were extremely weak and dim, and astrocytes only become vaguely brighter during activity. I therefore focused on the only astrocytes that I could see, the very superficial ones. This turned out to be a mistake. After my first surgeries &#8211; and I waited only little before performing imaging experiments &#8211; there was <strong>a thin layer of reactive astrocytes</strong> at the surface between hippocampus or corpus callosum and the cover slip. These astrocytes were not only a bit larger than normal astrocytes, but also brighter, and responsive towards slightly increased laser power (Figure 1).</p>

Different from typical astrocytic activation (see below), calcium does not propagate from distal to central compartments.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After several months of confusion and iterations, I suspected and confirmed that these astrocytes were activated not by behavioral circumstances but by the infrared imaging laser. I then improved my surgeries and focused the imaging on the deeper and much dimmer normal hippocampal astrocytes. But I remained suspicious about reactive astrocytes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lockdown / Covid-19</strong></h3>



<p>In March 2020, I had my first cohort of mice with nicely expressing astrocytes (in particular non-reactive astrocytes!). I had recently improved my microscope in terms of collection optics, resolution and pulse dispersion. First tests under anesthesia were promising, and I was starting to habituate the animals to running on the treadmill. I was about to generate my first useful dataset! Then, Covid-19 hit me. The Brain Research Institute, as all of the University of Zurich, was locked down, and <strong>I had to euthanize my mice and terminate the experiments</strong>. I went into home office and, not having acquired any useful data yet, worked on the analysis of existing data for other, independent projects that I expanded instead (Rupprecht et al., 2021).</p>



<p>In Autumn 2020, finally, I again prepared a cohort of animals, verified proper expression in astrocytes, and recorded my first dataset of mice running on a treadmill, while recording body movement and running speed. At this point, it was already quite clear that my data did not contain any evidence to support the initial hypothesis that I had used as a starting point. So the project switched from hypothesis-driven to exploratory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking at the data</strong></h3>



<p>My first decent recordings of astrocytes with calcium imaging were incomprehensible to me at first glance, and <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/04/24/why-your-two-photon-images-are-noisier-than-you-expect/">drowning in shot noise</a>. The activity did no obviously correlate with behavior, at least from what I could tell when watching it live. I was a bit lost. One of the main problems I struggled with was the efficient inspection of raw data. Finally, <strong>I spent two days and wrote a Python-based script to browse through the raw data</strong> (not much in hindsight, but very useful to advance the project). To this end, I synchronized calcium data, behavioral videos of the mouse, and behavioral events such as sugar water rewards, spatial position or auditory cues. Then I carefully browsed through the data, something like 20-30 imaging sessions of each roughly 15 minutes with very variable recording quality. It took me roughly two weeks of focused work (Figure 2). I noticed that the random spontaneous activity of individual astrocytes did not correlate with anything. From the single trials where I found a correlation, I tried to build different hypotheses, but none of them could hold up to a critical test with the rest of the data. The only thing which was more or less consistent was an almost simultaneous activation of most astrocytes throughout the field of view.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

In total, I took around six pages of such notes.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Given my bad experience with laser-induced activation of reactive superficial astrocytes, I was worried rather than happy. Was there an effect of switching on the laser, which lead to a global activation of astrocytes due to accumulation of heat? I spent a few months investigating this artifact. I reasoned that these activations might be due to laser-induced heating, as described for slices (Schmidt and Oheim, 2020). So <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/05/01/heating-up-the-objective-for-two-photon-imaging/">I warmed up the objective with a custom-designed objective heater</a> (Figure 3). However, I did not observe astrocytic activation through heating. Together with more experiments, I started to believe that what I was seeing was real.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed that often the animal, whether it was moving or not, seemed to be quite aroused approximately 10 seconds before these activation patterns. This was difficult to judge and only based on my visual impression of the mouse. From these rather subjective impressions, <strong>I drew the conclusion to definitely monitor pupil diameter as a readout of arousal for my next batch of animals</strong> – which turned out to be essential for the further course of this project.</p>



<p>In hindsight, these observations seem pretty obvious. While I struggled with the conceptualization of the data, similar results and very clear interpretations were already in the literature, and not too well-hidden (Ding et al., 2013; Nimmerjahn et al., 2009; Paukert et al., 2014). The only problem: I did not know about them. I was definitely reading a lot of papers on astrocytes &#8211; but still driven by my initial hypothesis, which was focused on a slightly different subfield of astrocyte science that was somehow not connected at all to this other field of astrocyte science. Only several months later, when I had confirmed my own results, I noticed that some of these results were already established, in particular the connection of astrocyte activation with arousal and neuromodulation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>First results</strong></h3>



<p>A key decision for the progress of this project was to drop all analyses of single-cell analyses for the moment. For a long time, I had been trying to find behavioral correlates for single astrocytes that were distinct from the global activity patterns, but I was unable to find anything robust. The main problem was that astrocytic activity is very slow. As a consequence, a single astrocyte will sample only a very small fraction of its activity space during a typical recording of 15 to 30 min. This feature makes it challenging to find any robust relationship with a fast-varying behavioral variable.</p>



<p>Therefore, I started analyzing the mean activity across all astrocytes in a field of view. This part of my analyses is now reflected in the figures 2-4 in the paper (Rupprecht et al., 2024) in its current form.</p>



<p>After more in-depth analysis, validation and literature research, I still found these systematic analyses of the relationship between astrocytic activity and the behavior or neuronal activity quite interesting and relevant. At the same time, <strong>I also realized that much of these findings had already been made before</strong>: often in cortical astrocytes (Paukert et al., 2014), but partially also in Bergmann glia in cerebellum (Nimmerjahn et al., 2009), although not in hippocampus. Nowhere, however, the description seemed as systematic and complete as in my case. So I thought this could make a good case for a small study of somewhat limited novelty but with solid and beautiful descriptive work. I also felt that recently published work on hippocampal astrocytes made misleading interpretations about the role of hippocampal astrocytes (Doron et al., 2022), an error that was easy to identify with my systematic analyses. So I started to make first drafts of figures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A bold hypothesis</strong></h3>



<p>In Summer 2021, I had an interesting video call with <a href="https://mschottdorf.github.io/">Manuel Schottdorf</a>, then located in Princeton and working in the labs of David Tank and Carlos Brody. Among other things, we discussed about the role and purpose of hippocampus. Specifically, we discussed about the hippocampus as a sequence generator. I can see this discussion topic tracing back to the work on “time cells” by Howard Eichenbaum (Eichenbaum, 2014), but also to work from David Tank’s lab (Aronov et al., 2017). The potential connections of such sequences to theta cycles, theta phase shifting, replay events and reversed replay sequences seemed complicated and still opaque, but also highly interesting. I left the discussion with new enthusiasm about studying the function of hippocampus.</p>



<p>A few days later, I went back to the analysis of astrocytic calcium imaging data from hippocampus, and to the analysis of single-cell activity. Out of curiosity, I checked for sequential activity patterns by sorting the traces according to their peaks. Indeed, <strong>I found a clear sequential activation pattern across astrocytes</strong> (Figure 4).</p>

This finding was later explained by subcellular sequences (centripetal) instead of population sequences. See also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8#Fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5a</a> of the main paper.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I expected this effect to be an artifact that can occur when sorting random, slowly varying signals and performed cross-validation (sorting on the first part of the recording, visualization on the second half), but the sequential pattern remained. I was a bit puzzled (why should astrocytes tile time in a sequence?), but also a bit excited. I went on to analyze recordings across multiple days and observed that the same astrocytes seemed to be active in the same sequences across days. Intriguing! This was a very unexpected finding. And, as most findings that are unexpected and surprising, it was wrong. But I was still excited and set up a meeting with my postdoc supervisor Fritjof  to discuss the data and analyses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Death of a hypothesis, birth of a new hypothesis</strong></h3>



<p>The evening before the planned meeting, I was questioning the results and performed further control analyses. For example, I specifically looked at astrocytes that were activated early in the sequences and those that were activated later. Was there any difference? I could see none.</p>



<p>I checked whether there was any spatial clustering of astrocytes that were temporally close in a sequence, but this did not seem to be the case. Finally, already late during the evening, I wondered whether sequences could be subcellular instead of across cells, for example always going from one branch of an astrocyte to another branch. To test this alternative hypothesis systematically, I came up with the idea to test the sequence timing on a single-pixel basis. Single pixel traces were quite noisy, but it was quite clear to me correlation functions would solve this problem (only a few years before this time, I had written even <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/01/09/the-power-of-correlation-functions/">a blog post on the amazing power of correlation functions</a>!). So, I used correlation functions to determine for each pixel in the FOV whether it was early or late in the sequence, using the average across the FOV as a reference. It took me an hour to write the code, and I let it run over night over a few datasets. In the morning (as the next paragraph will show, I’m definitely not a morning person), I looked at the results, and at first glance I could not really see a pattern (Figure 5). In some way, I was relieved, because this was only a control analysis. I quickly made a short set of power point slides ready and went to work.</p>



<p>Fritjof was quick as usual to understand all the details of my analyses and controls. He was intrigued, but with a good amount of scepticism as well (and I was still very sceptical myself). However, when I showed the results of the pixel-wise correlation function analysis, telling him that I did not see a pattern, he looked carefully and was a bit confused.</p>

<p> He clearly saw the pattern: somatic regions of astrocytes were activated later, while distal regions were activated earlier. It took me several seconds to acknowledge that this was indeed true. Why had I not seen it myself? Maybe because the colormap that I used was not a great fit for my colorblind eyes; or because I had not slept a lot before looking at the data; or because I had introduced a small coding error that shifted these delay maps compared to the anatomy maps. A bit confused, I promised to look very carefully into this observation. And every analysis I did afterwards confirmed it. <strong>That’s how we made the central observation of our study &#8211; centripetal propagation</strong><em>.</em> At this point, I was not yet fully convinced that this would be an important finding; interesting, for sure, but not necessarily the key to understanding astrocytes. I changed my mind, but only gradually.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Writing up a first paper draft</strong></h3>



<p>End of 2021, I decided to write everything up for a paper: a solid and descriptive piece of work: No fancy optogenetics, no messy pharmacology, no advanced behavior or learning, just a solid paper.</p>



<p>Often times, my writing and analysis is an entangled process that can take months if it requires complex analyses and a lot of thinking. In this process, I found two additional interesting aspects about centripetal propagation that I had missed before. I noticed that sometimes propagation towards the soma seemed to start in the periphery of the astrocyte, only to fade out before reaching the soma. Very quickly, I realized that these fading events occured primarily when the arousal, as measured by pupil diameter, was low. I took me a bit more time to understand the relevance of this finding: <strong>Arousal seemed to control whether centripetal propagation occured or not.</strong></p>



<p>The more I thought about it, the more I found it interesting. I had always been fond of dendritic integration mechanisms and how apical input to pyramidal cells gated certain events like bursts (Larkum, 2013). Here, I saw a similar effect at work, with somatic integration in astrocytes being gated by arousal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Submitting the manuscript</strong></h3>



<p>After a few iterations with my postdoc supervisor Fritjof, we finished a first version of the  manuscript. I presented the data at FENS in Paris in Summer 2022 and received positive feedback. Briefly after that, we submitted the manuscript to Cell. I’m rather hesitant to submit to the CNS triad (the journals Cell/Nature/Science). However, in this case I thought that the story of conditional somatic integration in astrostrytes was so interesting that it did not need to be stretched and massaged in order to be fascinating for a broader audience. We selected Cell because they accept papers with a larger number of figures. After a reasonable amount of time, we got an editorial rejection, with an helpful explanation of why they did not consider the paper; I was a bit disappointed but was positively surprised by the editor who provided some helpful feedback. We transfered the manuscript to Neuron, which would in my opinion have been a perfect fit for the paper due to manuscripts of related topics in the same journal in the past, but it got rejected with a standard reply. Quite disappointing! I decided to give it another try, with Nature Neuroscience. But first I rewrote the Abstract and the Introduction entirely, because I thought that they had been the weak parts of the initial submission. Luckily, the paper went into review. <strong>As is our lab policy, we uploaded the preprint of the manuscript to bioRxiv once it went into review</strong> (Rupprecht et al., 2022). This was in September 2022.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The reviewers&#8217; requests</strong></h3>



<p>The reviewer reports came back ~80 days after submission. <strong>Four reviewers!<em> </em></strong>The general tone was positive, appreciative and constructive. The editor had done a good job selecting the reviewers. Besides some more analyses and easy experiments, the reviewers also asked for more “mechanistic insights” and additional (perturbation) experiments to dissect the “molecular” events underlying our observations. The reviewers asked both for pharmacological and optogenetic perturbation experiments. I had anticipated the requests for pharmacology and started to write, in Summer 2022, an animal experiment license to cover those experiments. Fortunately, the license got already approved by beginning of 2023. I started pharmacology experiments with classical drugs affecting the noradrenergic system, e.g., prazosin, DSP-4, etc. Not all of these experiments worked, and all drugs exhibited strong side effects on behavior that confounded the effects we wanted to observe. This way, I learned (again) how messy pharmacology can be when it affects a complex system.</p>



<p>To reduce side-effects, I was planning to use a micropipette to inject e.g. prazosin locally in the imaging FOV under two-photon guidance through a hole drilled into the cover slip. This was an extremely difficult experiment that I did together with Denise Becker in early 2023. It worked for only a single time, and when it exhibited only a small effect, interpretation was difficult. We decided to stop here and use only the previous pharmacology experiments for the paper, with an open discussion of the confounds on animal behavior (now described in the newly added <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8#Fig8">Fig. 8e-f</a>). Altogether, <strong>a lot of work with mixed results that were difficult to interpret</strong><em>. </em>Underwhelming!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New collaborations, new experiments</strong></h3>



<p>Luckily, via mediation of my colleague <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/zhang/Group-members/zhang-xiaomin.html">Xiaomin Zhang</a>, I realized that there was Sian Duss, a PhD student in the lab of <a href="https://bohaceklab.ethz.ch/">Johannes Bohacek</a>, working on the locus coeruleus. This seemed interesting because the locus coeruleus is one of the key players of arousal, and it would be nice to manipulate this brain region and see what happens to hippocampal astrocytes.<em> </em><strong>It turned out that Sian had done this very same experiment already! </strong>She had used fibers to optogenetically stimulate in locus coeruleus and to record from hippocampal astrocytes. And she had observed exactly what we would have predicted from our observations. We could have stopped here, and probably we would have gotten the paper through the revision at Nature Neuroscience.</p>



<p>However, I realized that we could try one more experiment, a bit more challenging, but much more interesting: To optogenetically stimulate locus coeruleus and perform subcellular calcium imaging of astrocytes in hippocampus. And that’s what we did.</p>



<p>First, <strong>I wrote an amendment of our animal license</strong> to cover these experiments, and after a lot of tedious but efficient Swiss bureaucratic processes, we got it approved in Spring 2023. Sian and I immediately started experiments, rather complicated surgeries with two virus injections, one angled fiber implant and one hippocampal window in transgenic mice. To cut it short, the experiments with Sian were very successful and its outcomes very interesting (check the paper for all the details!).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final steps towards publication</strong></h3>



<p>At this point it was clear to me that the paper would very likely be accepted at Nature Neuroscience. All results of our additional experiments supported the initial findings fully and very cleary. It took me a few more months to analyze all the data, draft a careful rebuttal letter (I did not want to go into a second round of reviews) and re-submit to the journal in August 2023. <strong>After two months, we received a message from the journal with “accepted in principle”</strong><em>.</em> Nice!</p>



<p>In the same email, the editors promised to send us a list with additional required modifications from the editorial side. We received those almost two months later, with requests that concerned the title, some important wordings and the length of the manuscript (<em>“please reduce the word count by 45%”</em>). We followed up on that until January and returned the revised manuscript. Then, in March, we received the proofs, treated by a slightly over-motivated copy-editor, and it took me two evenings to fix these changes. <strong>In April 2024, exactly 617 days after our submission to Nature Neuroscience, the paper was published online</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overlap with work of others</strong></h3>



<p>Over the duration of the project, I became only gradually aware of similar works, both ongoing or completed. For example, I discovered only during the project work from <a href="https://henneberger-lab.com/">Christian Henneberger&#8217;s lab</a> (King et al., 2020), which inspired the analysis of history-dependent effects of calcium signalling (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8#Fig6">Fig. 6f</a>). And in Summer of 2023, I talked to his lab members during a <a href="https://bonnbrain.de/">conference in Bonn</a>, which helped me refine the Discussion for the revised manuscript.</p>



<p>Specifically related to centripetal propagation, I noticed that such phenomena had already been observed in slices, but rather anecdotally, and hidden in a small supplementary figure (Bindocci et al., 2017). However, in Summer of 2023, a study appeared that showed some of the same effects that we had reported in our preprint in 2022, in somatosensory cortex. I was only later informed that these findings had been obtained independently of our results (Fedotova et al., 2023).</p>



<p>There were also two relevant papers that I had missed entirely before acceptance of our manuscript. First, a study came out in Summer of 2023 (very shortly before we resubmitted our revised manuscript). This very interesting preprint from the <a href="https://www.araquelab.com/">Araque lab</a> described somatic integration in cortical astrocytes (Lines et al., 2023). Second, after publication of our manuscript, my co-author Chris Lewis spotted a paper from 2014 that actually described some of the observations that we had thought to have made for the first time, in a small paper with analyses that seemed a bit anecdotal but solid (Kanemaru et al., 2014). I put these two papers on my list “I should have cited them and will definitely do so at the next opportunity!”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future directions and follow-ups</strong></h3>



<p>One of the greatest parts of this project were the experiments done in 2023 with Sian Duss, an extremely skilled experimenter and great scientist. It turned out that she was eager to continue the collaboration to better understand the effects of locus coeruleus on hippocampus (and so was I). While doing experiments with her, so many interesting observations popped up that I find it hard to restrain my scientific curiosity and not dive into all these different observations, each of them probably worth a few years of intense scrutiny!</p>

<p>In December, Solange Saxby, a postdoctoral research fellow at Dartmouth Health in Lebanon, New Hampshire, was notified by her friend of a paper published in the MDPI journal <em>Nutrients</em> that sounded similar to her <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2494967216?%20Theses&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;parentSessionId=zP6WNK9tXs81kfV7lhmNuOeA%2BExLxd5lV%2BZ2NfU8g5g%3D">dissertation</a>. Saxby pulled up her 2020 dissertation, “The Potential of Taro (Colocasia esculenta) as a Dietary Prebiotic Source for the Prevention of Colorectal Cancer,” and compared it to the 2023 <em>Nutrients</em> article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To her dismay, the paper “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/15/3337">Taro Roots: An Underexploited Root Crop</a>,” co-authored by researchers at North Carolina A&amp;T State University in Greensboro, North Carolina, overlaps significantly with Saxby’s work, including some passages of word-for-word copying with no citation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the corresponding author of the paper has called the omission of any citation to Saxby’s work “unfortunate” and said that she is working with Nutrients’ publisher – MDPI – to add one, the publisher said the behavior did not amount to plagiarism because the prior work was a thesis.</p>



<span id="more-129328"></span>



<p>“This is not the way I wanted my early career as a researcher to start,” Saxby told Retraction Watch. “It&#8217;s been very stressful and emotionally draining because I put in so much work into my dissertation and having it published open access. And the worst part was, I wasn&#8217;t even cited. At least have the decency to cite my dissertation if you&#8217;re going to copy it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Feb. 1, Saxby filed a report with the office of research compliance and ethics at North Carolina A&amp;T State University. In an email thread seen by Retraction Watch, Saxby stated her “intellectual property has been plagiarized and not properly cited.” A day later, Stephanie Evans, the director of the office, replied that she would review the allegations in the next 12 days, at which point she would “issue a determination” on how to proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next few months, Saxby received a handful of updates from Evans on the status of the investigation. In the most recent such message, sent May 28, Evans told Saxby the university was still conducting a “thorough investigation” of the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other publications, Saxby’s dissertation has been cited a total of six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Meanwhile, Saxby has been trying – without success – to have the offending article retracted from <em>Nutrients</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 25, Saxby contacted Vladimir Vuksan, the academic editor for the <em>Nutrients </em>paper, informing him of the plagiarism. Vuksan said he doesn’t “remember” reviewing the work. After months of emails, the members of the journal’s editorial board reached a decision on April 17. Shannon Zhao, the journal ethics specialist informed Saxby the&nbsp; journal would “resolve this situation by correcting the manuscript to add the citation of your paper.”</p>



<p>“This just seems like an easy way out by the Nutrients editorial staff to sweep things under the rug and not pursue any further action. It almost seems like they&#8217;re protecting individuals who plagiarize or do research misconduct –– there really is no action or ramification,” Saxby told us.</p>



<p>In response, the <em>Nutrients</em> editorial office said “It is considered that this is not plagiarism, because thesis materials are not classified as prior publications.”</p>



<p>The journal has still not added the citation of Saxby’s dissertation, despite their statement in April. Zhao said that the correction would be “completed soon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roberta Claro da Silva, an assistant professor in Food and Nutritional Sciences and corresponding author on the <em>Nutrients</em> paper, told Retraction Watch that her team takes “these claims very seriously and are committed to maintaining the integrity of our research.” She said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Unfortunately, there was an oversight in the citation of Dr. Solange Saxby&#8217;s dissertation in the references. We have promptly worked with the editor of Nutrients to correct this mistake and ensure that Dr. Saxby&#8217;s dissertation is properly cited in the revised version of the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saxby will continue to send weekly emails to both parties until they fully acknowledge and deal with the plagiarism. “I hope this never happens to anybody else,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a very awful feeling.”</p>

<p>Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy</em> has retracted eight articles for image manipulation and overlap, with more on the way, according to the sleuth who notified the publication of the issues.</p>



<p>Each retraction notice credits an “anonymous reader” with having raised concerns about manipulated or duplicated images, with the journal’s editor in chief determining a retraction was warranted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That anonymous reader was <a href="https://www.igm.columbia.edu/profile/mu-yang-phd">Mu Yang</a>, an assistant professor of neurobiology at Columbia University, in New York City, who started emailing the journal about problematic papers in January 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 16th, the journal notified Yang of the following retractions: </p>

<p>We found another paper retracted the same day:</p>

</ul>



<p>The retracted articles have been cited a total of six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The retractions come after the journal’s founding editor and former editor in chief <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/hwm-steinbusch">Sir Harry W.M. Steinbusch</a> stepped down in January of this year. “I think that says a lot,” Yang told Retraction Watch. She felt the depth of his investigations were often lacking and “inappropriate.” After he stepped down and the new editor in chief took over, things didn’t seem to get much better, Yang said, but she acknowledged that the journal is trying to raise their standards.</p>



<p>Steinbusch initially agreed to an interview with Retraction Watch, but cancelled a short time later. We emailed the current editor in chief, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-chemical-neuroanatomy">Goran Šimić</a>, and heard back from a spokesperson for Elsevier, who stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are currently investigating these papers and do not have any further information at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zOc6u6sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Kingsley Afoke Iteire</a>, a vice-dean and senior lecturer at the University of Medical Sciences in Ondo, Nigeria, and the corresponding author of one of the retracted <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061823000789">papers</a>, told us one of his co-authors used PowerPoint to resize the offending images, but this shouldn’t have distorted them.</p>



<p>Replacing the images instead of retracting the paper would have been a better decision, Iteire said, and he speculates the previous editor wouldn’t made as harsh a decision. “It&#8217;s likely to discourage mostly early career researchers like us, coming from this side of the world, where we cannot compete favorably with the global North for public grants. We are honest researchers, even though we are from Africa, with low income.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061823000984">paper</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R8kvh4UAAAAJ">Mohammad Ali Azarbayjani</a>, a professor of exercise physiology at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, Iran, said he had not made “any changes or manipulations” to the flagged images, which were obtained from methods carried out by the external lab <a href="https://histogene.ir/">Histogenotech</a>. Azarbayjani said he “had no role in its implementation, and I took the results from the laboratory and adjusted the article based on the report of that laboratory.”</p>



<p>“Professor Goran Šimić told me because of my honesty in replying to the journal that if I could solve the problem with the images, they would give me the opportunity to resubmit the article,” Azarbayjani told<em> </em>Retraction Watch. With the new images added and based on his statistical analysis, “there has been no change in the quality and trend of the results (although the quantity of the data has changed slightly due to the change in the staining technique),” he said.</p>



<p>The corresponding authors of the other retracted papers did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Yang is more <a href="https://x.com/mumumouse2/status/1793237110264037713">concerned </a>about a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0891061821000934?via%3Dihub">paper</a> that hasn’t yet been retracted by the journal, which she says contains “heavy” image manipulation. In Steinbusch’s correspondence with the authors of this paper, he pointed out “irregularities” in Figure 8 and  asked them their “opinion” about the mistake and whether they preferred the figure to be removed or changed. The corresponding authors did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gailmrodney/">Gail M. Rodney</a>, a senior publisher at Elsevier, told Yang more retractions are “forthcoming.” Rodney told her the journal will now analyze every figure before a submission is sent out to review and apologized on behalf of the publisher for “failing the neuroscience community.”</p>

<p>Kumba Digdowiseiso has been dismissed from his position as dean of the economics and business faculty at the Universitas Nasional (UNAS) in Jakarta, Indonesia, following an investigation into claims he used the names of other academics without consent on papers with which they were not involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digdowiseiso <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/19/dean-in-indonesia-resigns-following-retraction-watch-report/">had already announced his resignation</a> from the university on April 19, a week after Retraction Watch reported several researchers from the Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) were accusing Digdowiseiso of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/10/the-dean-who-came-to-visit-and-added-dozens-of-authors-without-their-knowledge/">using their names on papers without permission</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, the university’s official account on X had reposted Digdowiseiso’s response to our report in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/April-11-Tweet-UNAS.png">a now-deleted tweet</a> from April 11. In the tweet, Digdowiseiso wrote that after an internal meeting with UMT, the institution decided the authorship allegations were “a personal issue” and therefore didn’t need “further intervention/action from both universities or even faculties.” Another UNAS <a href="https://x.com/UNAS1949/status/1779475726003212377">tweet from April 14</a> that is still online does not include this paragraph. </p>



<span id="more-129317"></span>



<p>Now, a team UNAS formed to investigate the issue the same day he resigned found several “incriminating” factors and concluded Digdowiseiso “committed a misconduct of academic ethics, scientific propriety, as well as integrity violation as a lecturer,” according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UNIVERSITAS-NASIONAL-PRESS-RELEASE_English_Prof-Kumba_Rev.290504.docx.pdf">university press release</a>. The team recommended his dismissal from his position as dean, and has barred him from lecturing at UNAS for a maximum of three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digdowiseiso had previously contested our reporting as “one-sided” and said publishing it, as well as his photo, without his permission was “completely wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the press release, Digdowiseiso will be required to publicly apologize to the affected lecturers at UMT, remove their names from the implicated papers and pursue retractions for those articles. The affected UMT researchers we had previously spoken to have not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigating team opted against harsher penalties, on the grounds this incident was his “first offence and [he] never has been found to commit any other violations.”</p>



<p>They added they may review the decision if Digdowiseiso shows “good academic ethics”. The press release also stated Digdowiseiso did not include the flagged papers in his application for a professorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we asked him to comment on the developments, Digdowiseiso wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am unable to comment on the results of the TPF [the investigating team formed by UNAS] and Chancellor&#8217;s decisions. You may request information from UNAS as an institution, which I am unable to provide.</p>



<p>TPF only contacted me for explanation once, on April 27, 2024. The clarification lasted three hours, and TPF did not ask for any additional information. TPF then summoned witnesses and reported the findings to the Chancellor.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this case, I did not speak to the media and protected UNAS as an institution because I wanted the issue to be settled properly.</p>



<p>I have submitted an application to become inactive as a permanent lecturer at UNAS on May 14, 2024. Moreover, in compliance with the Chancellor&#8217;s direction, I already apologized to UMT for procedural errors and miscommunication in a letter dated May 22, 2024.</p>



<p>Finally, I ask that you not escalate this problem because we want to resolve it appropriately.</p>

<p>A former professor and vice provost for research at the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York, falsified data in two published papers, according to <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-mousa-shaker">findings</a> from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI).</p>



<p>Shaker Mousa, who was also chairman and executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research Institute at Albany, already has at least 10 retractions and two corrections, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMousa%252c%2bShaker%2bA">our count</a>. </p>



<p>The falsified data appeared in “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2217/nnm.12.200">Tetraiodothyroacetic acid-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles: a nanomedicine approach to treat drug-resistant breast cancer,</a>” which appeared in <em>Nanomedicine</em> in 2013, and “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx">The proangiogenic action of thyroid hormone analogue GC-1 is initiated at an integrin,” which appeared in the <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em> in 2005 and was retracted last September</a>. ORI called for Mousa to request a correction or retraction of the <em>Nanomedicine</em> paper as well.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129311"></span>



<p>The ORI found seven micrograph panels appeared in both the <em>Nanomedicine</em> and <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em> papers and were relabeled to “report pro-angiogenic factors as alternate pro-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic drug treatments as alternate anti-angiogenic drug treatments, and control treatments and anti-angiogenic treatments as the same treatment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings relate to research funded by two grants. One, on which Mousa was the sole principal investigator from 2009-2010, received nearly $375,000 in funding. The other grant awarded over $6 million from 1997-2020 to Thomas Scanlan, a professor at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, as principal investigator. Mousa received nearly $1.9 million in total funding as sole principal investigator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings follow <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08B9F69210C010F574B92EC02C9E07?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome#">comments on PubPeer</a> from 2022, when commenter “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” compared images from the 2013 <em>Nanomedicine</em> paper with those that appeared in another Mousa paper from 2009, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35983480/">The anti-angiogenic activity of NSITC, a specific cathepsin L inhibitor</a>.” The latter was <a href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/43/10/4780.long">retracted</a> in October 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mousa, whose work attracted <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/07/11/shaker-mousa-ny-pharma-gangsta/">other scrutiny</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08B9F69210C010F574B92EC02C9E07#2">defended</a> the recurring image by claiming it was the result of using the same positive control, FGF2, in both studies: “That is why you see the same representative FGF2-mediated stimulation of angiogenesis selected in both reports.”</p>



<p>Actinopolyspora also commented on the 2005 paper from the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx"><em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em></a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EDC5782C2E220C4508B1AAB9CB2C6E?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">suggesting</a> images from it appeared in two of Mousa’s later papers, “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx">Fluorinated Analogs of Organosulfur Compounds from Garlic (<em>Allium sativum</em>): Synthesis, Chemistry and Anti-Angiogenesis and Antithrombotic Studies</a>,” which was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36771183/">corrected</a> in January 2023, and “<a href="https://www.dovepress.com/nanoformulated-bioactive-compounds-derived-from-different-natural-prod-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">Nanoformulated Bioactive Compounds Derived from Different Natural Products Combat Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation</a>,” which was <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-nanoformulated-bioactive-compounds-derived-from-different-n-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">retracted</a> in August 2022. Mousa did not respond on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Mousa has not yet responded to our requests for comment. As part of a settlement with ORI, he agreed to have his research supervised for four years and will not serve on federal committees, boards, or peer review committees during that time.</p>

<p>Last May, Devrim Çavuşoğlu, an engineer at Turkish software company OBSS, was looking at feedback from a conference reviewer of a paper he and his colleagues had submitted. One comment stood out to him: The reviewer had noticed a resemblance between Çavuşoğlu’s work and another paper accepted to a different conference on computational linguistics. </p>



<p>When Çavuşoğlu first skimmed through the other paper, he came across some sections containing an uncanny resemblance to his own ideas. “I thought, it’s like I wrote that,” he recalled. “How could it be so similar, did we think about the same thing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He checked the accompanying source code and found the authors of the other paper seemed to have directly copied and built upon his own publicly released code without any attribution – a violation of the license connected to the work. “I was shocked, to be honest,” Çavuşoğlu told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-129288"></span>



<p>In July 2021, Çavuşoğlu and his team had publicly released their software, <em>jury, </em>on the code-hosting platform GitHub. The software, designed to assess the quality of natural language generation models, was licensed to allow others to use it with attribution. They decided to submit a paper describing their work for a conference in early 2023 and received comments from the conference reviewer a few months later in May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plagiarized paper appeared in October 2022 — in the period between when Çavuşoğlu and his team released the code and submitted the paper about the work. They were not aware of the other paper, according to Çavuşoğlu. “<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.306.pdf">NLG-Metricverse: An End-to-End Library for Evaluating Natural Language Generation</a>,” was published by five authors from the University of Bologna in Italy, and <a href="https://github.com/disi-unibo-nlp/nlg-metricverse">describes software</a> the authors claim to have created. They make reference to Çavuşoğlu’s project in the paper, but at the time of publishing, failed to disclose they had used his existing code in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Çavuşoğlu flagged the similarities with the conference committee that had accepted the paper. It took eight months and several follow ups from Çavuşoğlu for the committee to decide to retract. The notice on the source code appeared just last week on May 21, stating that the retraction was “per publication chair request.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last August, Çavuşoğlu <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cpdIcoBHbFBv0U_OYjsANvhHCWZSPdwf/view?usp=sharing">emailed the committee</a> for COLING 2022, the conference that had accepted the other paper, as well as the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which runs the conference and publishes its proceedings.His letter <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zhDPUs4eX1aw0GSCR_Ak1QQSKXjxdSNBER2WCw_u0ps/edit?usp=sharing">described the unreferenced use of <em>jury</em></a> and identifies nine instances of suspected plagiarism, including identical segments of code and segments with only slight changes. He received a response in October, two months later, from one of the COLING 2022 committee members, Leo Wanner. Wanner wrote that the group was looking into the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most irritating part, Çavuşoğlu told Retraction Watch, is that the authors had written about <em>jury</em> in the paper, referring to it as one of the other available resources, and had even compared attributes of their own project with <em>jury </em>in a table.<em> </em>“They copied our source code and our system architecture,” he said, but there was no mention that they had built their software on top of <em>jury</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He argues in his letter that the references to <em>jury</em> expose the plagiarism as intentional, since the authors were aware of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While improvements to code are typical in open-source software, failing to credit the original work still amounts to plagiarism, Çavuşoğlu said. If there had been appropriate attribution – which usually involves adding a license file which credits the original authors to the repository of files – “there would be no problems in terms of software use,” Çavuşoğlu said. “But they didn’t include it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the plagiarizing paper have not replied to requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In December 2023 – several months after Çavuşoğlu had first flagged the similarities – the files on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/disi-unibo-nlp/nlg-metricverse/commit/cc303cde997e9ce07c0352961ff6fcccab6ec9d3">were updated to include</a> an acknowledgement to <em>jury</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, Wannerwrote to Çavuşoğlu that “indeed, in the paper you drew our attention to, required references to your work are missing and that this constitutes a case of plagiarism.” He added that the publication chairs for the conference had asked the ACL Anthology, a library of the work published at ACL conferences, to retract the paper “quite a long while ago.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Contacting the ACL authorities was not easy,” Çavuşoğlu said, noting the length of time it took to have the plagiarism verdict. “I clawed my way to what we have now.” Wanner did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PDF of the paper associated with the code is watermarked as retracted, and a note was included <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/commit/2f7071a7e408cdf81192c5e8a03ba3ab7480c4c3">on the GitHub page</a> for the work last week – about eight months after Çavuşoğlu’s first email to the committee.</p>



<p>There is no notice explaining the reason for the retraction. Matt Post, who manages the library of conference papers for ACL, said updates are processed in monthly batches, and this one would be live after the end of May.</p>

<p>A university vice president has received his first retraction – and disagrees with it, according to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction for <a href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/jaydutt.vadgama">Jaydutt Vadgama</a>, the Vice President for Research and Health Affairs at the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, comes after a <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1">commenter on PubPeer</a> noted similarities between data in two papers from the same group. Similar comments have led to corrections to two other papers by Vadgama, who is also professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-017-4211-y">A83-01 inhibits TGF-β-induced upregulation of Wnt3 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells</a>,” appeared in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017. It has been cited 38 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-024-07371-1">notice</a>, published this month, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129284"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After publication, concerns were raised regarding image overlap with the authors&#8217; earlier article [1] and highly similar bands in the western blot images presented in the figures. Specifically:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figure 1d Twist, E-Cadherin and β-actin blots appear highly similar to the same proteins in Fig. 3a of [1];</li>



<li>Figure 3d α-Tubulin blot appears highly similar to the same protein in Fig, 4c of [1];</li>



<li>A number of bands in Figs. 1d, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3d, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5d and S2 appear to be duplicated.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, in Fig. 5b, the 4 h images for pSmad3 and pSmad3/DAPI don&#8217;t seem to correspond to the same area, and two nuclei in the pSmad3/DAPI image appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#1">April 2023</a>, PubPeer user “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” raised concerns about “possible data reuse between papers, as well as possibly duplicated signals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#2">responded</a>, and posted photos of what they said were the original gels:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research and being critical of the figures. We wish to reassure the commentator that there is NO data reuse between the two papers identified, even though the loading controls β-actin and α-Tubulin look similar under each blot. The first author is the primary lead investigator who conducted the studies, while the last author is the senior author and PI whose grants have funded this study. All of our data presented in the papers were produced several times by different individuals in the lab. We made sure that the data were reproduced with accuracy and reproducibility.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Actinopolyspora <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#3">responded once again</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am unable to locate the published bands in these images, with one exception.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors didn’t respond to this comment, also from April 2023. The paper’s retraction came over a year later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama has not responded to our request for comment, nor has first author <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/cancer/members/yanyuan-wu">Yanyuan Wu</a>. Both did “not agree to this retraction,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Vadgama’s other papers have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=vadgama">comments on PubPeer</a> questioning the validity of images, which commenters have claimed appear to be repeated, overlaid, or superimposed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some PubPeer comments on Vadgama’s articles have spurred corrections. The journal <em>Cancers </em><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/1/7">issued a correction</a> last April to a paper after first author Pranabananda Dutta said “an <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/132BE5039FDCBCA817485CE574858E">inadvertent error</a>” resulted in the same image being used twice with slightly altered brightness. In another case, after Actinopolyspora biskrensis raised concerns of image splicing, horizontal stretching, and duplication, study author Nalo Hamilton admitted the image was “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/6E1F7DB052E59C511B3F21EDDD65A0#10">inadvertently duplicated</a>” and the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/5/2579">issued a correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama and a coauthor admitted mistakes or said they were looking into the issues raised for <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/B175BBC425CDDCF05F123580FE112D#2">two</a> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/F26738B524F3162E9E389DEA6C94E4#3">other</a> papers, which have yet to be corrected.</p>

<p>The dean of science at the University of Sydney is reassessing a series of review papers after commenters on PubPeer pointed out each cited several retracted articles, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people.html">Marcel Dinger</a> and his coauthors will submit addendums to the journals noting the retracted references, he told Retraction Watch, and work with editors to determine whether the reviews should be retracted. </p>



<p>Dinger, who also is a professor of genome biology, is a middle author of four review articles and last author on one more that sleuths using the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> flagged as referencing retracted articles. The articles have been cited nearly 100 times altogether, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guillaume Cabanac, who developed the screener, commented on one of the papers in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#1">August 2022</a>: </p>

<p>Responding to Cabanac, one of the authors, Mohammad Taheri of the Institute of Human Genetics at Jena University Hospital in Germany, who has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Mohammad+Taheri">many more papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#2">wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The retracted papers cited by us were retracted one or two years after our publication, not before. When writing a review paper, it is not feasible to evaluate all 200 original papers that you intend to cite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(Helping scientists with this problem was one of the reasons we created the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">Retraction Watch Database</a>, now <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">part of Crossref</a>: Researchers using Zotero, Endnote and other software can automate checking their references for retracted articles.)</p>



<p>Dinger told us he and his coauthors had cited the problematic papermill articles unwittingly, and have begun assessing the damage to their work:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most of these comments relate to a series of review papers &#8211; they were part of a cataloguing effort of noncoding RNAs in various disease contexts – the underlying work in these literature curation efforts had been intended to inform an update to the long noncoding RNA database (a project I led a number of years ago, but has since fallen out of date – (see <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/20/nar.gku988.long">Quek et al</a>, <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>, 2015).</p>



<p>In an effort to be comprehensive, we erred on the side of inclusivity in terms of the literature cited in each of the specific disease contexts. What we were unaware of at the time was that this coincided with the emergence of the so-called “Chinese papermills”, which ended up contaminating the peer-reviewed literature with 1000s (or even 10,000s or 100,000s) papers that were in essence completely fraudulent. Regrettably, a number of these papers were cited in some of the review articles.</p>



<p>I am in contact with the co-authors of the affected papers at the moment and we are now undertaking a review of the papers to assess the impact of these citations to now-retracted publications (I should note the publications were not retracted at the time the papers were published). We will then put together addendums to the journals to highlight those publications that were cited that are retracted. We will also assess the overall impact to the content/commentary/conclusions in the papers. If the impact is potentially significant, we will work with the respective editors to determine if the entire paper should be retracted also.</p>
