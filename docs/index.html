<p>An Elsevier journal has pulled three articles after the publisher determined an author had been “involved in the peer review and decision making” as managing guest editor of the special issues in which they appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The author, botany researcher <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rERy_8wAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Vijay Kumar</a> of Lovely Professional University in Punjab, India, told Retraction Watch his apparent involvement in assigning reviewers was “purely unintentional” and a “foolish mistake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the articles appeared in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/south-african-journal-of-botany/vol/149/suppl/C">special issue section</a> of the <em>South African Journal of Botany</em> in 2022. They were:</p>



<span id="more-130856"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629922001818?via%3Dihub">Optimization of lycorine using Response Surface Methodology, extraction methods and in vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities from the roots of Giant Spider Lily: A medicinally important bulbous herb</a>,&#8221; and </li>



<li>&#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629922002046?via%3Dihub">The potential of plant-derived secondary metabolites as novel drug candidates against <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>: Molecular docking and simulation investigation</a>.&#8221;  </li>
</ul>



<p>A third paper, &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629920309960?via%3Dihub"><em>In vitro</em> propagation and assessment of genetic fidelity in <em>Dioscorea deltoidea</em>, a potent diosgenin yielding endangered plant</a>,&#8221; appeared online in a different <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/south-african-journal-of-botany/vol/140/suppl/C#article-31">special section</a> in August 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2023, an anonymous user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E3F3894199E5091F051FE984704AA3#2">posted</a> a screenshot of the 2020 paper on PubPeer that listed Kumar as both an author and editor of the article. A commenter with a different username posted about the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2F9FC2448E173B0175531876FFC80#1">other</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/52F15BCFDC87DC87AFF2FA3FC5A99A#1">papers</a> the following August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924006860">retracted</a> the 2020 article in October, and pulled the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007579">other</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007609">two</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices for each article are nearly identical. They state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief as the reliability of the peer-review process of the article cannot be guaranteed.</p>



<p>After a thorough investigation, the Editor and publisher have concluded that the Managing Guest Editor of the Special Issue, Dr. Vijay Kumar, was also an author of the article and involved in the peer review and decision making.</p>



<p>As such this represents an abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author of one of the articles “claimed that they were unaware that Dr. Vijay Kumar was involved in the peer review process for the paper, and do not agree with the retraction,” according to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629922002046?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>. The author, Namrata Misra of the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology in Odisha, India, declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the webpages for the notices themselves contain different text than what appears on the article pages. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007609">One</a> includes what appears to be an internal communication, with instructions to “​​Specify details needed for R&amp;R panel to evaluate the case.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007579">Another</a> states the article “is an accidental duplication” of an article previously published in the journal, and has been withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar told us other co-guest editors had handled the papers and assigned reviewers. Then, during revisions, “the revised manuscript was assigned to me by the journal (as a managing guest editor) and by mistake I sent to the same reviewers, which was purely unintentional.” He continued, “I agreed with these retractions with my full responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253617">other</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11240-023-02572-w">papers</a> on which Kumar was a coauthor were retracted in 2023 after PubPeer users raised concerns about duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson confirmed the publisher was investigating how Kumar’s apparent involvement in the processing of his own manuscripts could have escaped notice before publication. The spokesperson referred us to <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/editor/role/guest/guide">updated journal policies</a> on guest editors, which state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The guest editor must not be involved in the handling or decisions about papers which s/he has authored or co-authored him/herself, or have been written by family members, colleagues, or which relate to products/ services in which other conflicts of interest are present. Furthermore, any such submission must be subject to all the journal’s usual procedures. Peer review must be handled independently of the relevant author/editor and their research groups, and there will be a clear statement to this effect on any such paper that is published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The policy also states a guest editor should not submit more than one article to their special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Kumar’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214662824000902">recent articles</a> in <em>Current Plant Biology</em>, another Elsevier title, contains the following statement as part of the section on competing interests:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr Vijay Kumar and Prof. Karel Dolezal are guest editors for the special issue in Current Plant Biology, as such, Dr. Kumar and Prof. Dolezal have not been involved in any stage of the evaluation and decision making of this submission. This status had no bearing on the editorial consideration of the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>For our new article, we talked to Rachel Horne, journalist and co-chair of the Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Group for the NIHR Policy Research Unit in Dementia and Neurodegeneration at Queen Mary University of London, where she is also an Honorary Research Fellow at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health.

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Its symptoms include difficulty walking, blurred vision, spasms and fatigue, and its onset ranges between 20 and 40 years of age. However, it is a highly heterogeneous disease, with symptom occurrence and health outcomes varying across individuals. For example, MS affects women three times more than men – a gender gap that has been progressively increasing over the last decades. Despite this, there is still little understanding of the factors influencing multiple sclerosis (read</span></span><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">here</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> our interview with MS researcher and neurologist Professor Ruth Dobson) and there has been a lack of clinical and biomedical research on MS in women. It is fundamental to address women-specific issues to fully understand and treat MS, and to do so, it is critical to centre the lived experiences of women with MS.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With her work as a journalist and a patient advocate and her efforts in funding women-led research, Rachel Horne advocates for more inclusive and representative research that looks at the impact of gender and ethnicity in the diagnosis and treatment of MS.</span></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>&quot;In recent years, we have seen globally an assault on women&apos;s healthcare rights and we have sadly realised we can’t take anything for granted. &quot;</strong></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Can you tell us about your background and your story?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me. I think the work Women in Neuroscience UK do is incredibly important. For too long, women scientists and women patients have been overlooked. Something I only realised when I was diagnosed with MS in 2009 after a severe attack - seemingly out of nowhere - left me paralysed on one side of my body. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Luckily I recovered, but the diagnosis came as a huge shock. I knew nothing about the disease. At first I was fine, but as my symptoms became more pronounced, I started researching more about MS. I am a journalist by training so I also began to write about it as well as interviewing people in the MS community, attending conferences and doing lots of reading and listening.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Women’s health needs have been historically overlooked, even when some conditions, including MS, disproportionately affect so many more women compared to men. What are some of the issues that people with MS, in particular women, face?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The more I started learning about MS - including care and treatment - the more I was struck by this gender disparity and how it was barely mentioned. In particular, I noticed two things. MS is a disease that overwhelmingly affects women and it is often diagnosed around the age of 30. This is a very crucial time in women’s life: they are young adults, their careers are starting, they may be thinking about starting or expanding their family. The first thing I noticed is there didn&apos;t seem to be a lot of focus on our unique health needs - from menstruation, managing contraception, pregnancy, breast-feeding through to menopause - while we were managing a serious disease. We were seriously understudied and under researched. For example, there was a scoping review in</span></span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.812147/full" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.812147/full" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">2022 in Frontiers Neurology</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> showing that between 1980 and 2020, there were just ten studies on menopause and MS, which I think is pretty galling considering every woman with the disease who lives long enough, will go through it. Therefore, neurologists have struggled to give data-driven advice to their female patients about this stage of their life - and how it will affect their MS care. To me, that is just plain bad medicine, ignoring a huge chunk of the MS population. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Your work is quite diverse; you do a lot of different things to tackle MS challenges from different perspectives, including through your advocacy for patients’ involvement. How do you think that people’s lived experiences can inform clinical practices in MS? And how can their involvement contribute to mitigating the disparities you mentioned?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve been really cheered about the growing “nothing about us without us” movement in medicine - and how it emphasises the importance of including patient’s perspectives and experiences when it comes to medical research. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was, by necessity, a sudden shift to providing remote care to treat MS patients at home. For many health care professionals, telemedicine was seen as a panacea which should continue post-pandemic. However, when I spoke to patients with MS, some of them were not nearly as enthusiastic. With MS there are a lot of invisible symptoms that are very difficult to show over a screen or describe by phone. Also some people do not have access to Wi-Fi, are not digitally savvy or might have issues with language. To them, they much prefer to see a neurologist or their MS nurse face-to-face. That’s why I think it is so key to speak with patients to get the full picture when it comes to any issues surrounding changes in treatment and care. Here’s a</span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></em><u><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/09/14/covid-19-induced-changes-in-the-management-of-multiple-sclerosis/" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">BMJ</span></span></em></a></u><u><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/09/14/covid-19-induced-changes-in-the-management-of-multiple-sclerosis/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> blog post</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I helped to write.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another example: I was also involved in a study called</span></span><a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/attackms/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/attackms/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">AttackMS</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. The aim of the study is to see if it is possible to diagnose and start someone on a highly-effective MS drug within 14 days of showing up in A&amp;E with MS symptoms. I had some interesting discussions with clinicians about how best to tell a person they have a serious, incurable, life changing  disease in a busy hospital setting. For example, making sure this key conversation happens in a private room, that ideally the patient has someone to support them and how vital it is for the doctor to let the person speak, or cry or ask any question. I remember saying: “They will remember it for the rest of their lives, so it&apos;s really important to get it right”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How can women’s lived experience with MS inform research?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One thing that surprised me when I started looking into MS research was that almost all clinical trials stop at age 55. But at the same time there is evidence that women with MS find their disease course gets worse post-menopause. So should women at that age stop being given disease-modifying drugs? Should they be switched to less effective drugs? Why is there so little data on this? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At the same time, I think in MS research men and women patients are pretty much seen as the same, even though women have specific health issues - including menstruation,   pregnancy, IVF, breastfeeding and menopause. We are not small men with boobs and tubes! I would absolutely love to see the drug companies start focusing on clinical trials that involve looking at women and at men and seeing the differences. To me, it just seems quite logical to focus on the role of hormones and cell differences. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Also there has been a tendency in MS research to focus on white patients because MS was generally considered a disease affecting people from a white European or North American background. However, there has been increasing evidence this is not the case at all. MS is a genetically diverse disease. But the big international trials continue to focus on studying people from white ethnic backgrounds. </span></span><u><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/explore-our-research/search-our-research-projects/which-genes-people-different-ancestral" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The Adams Study</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, conducted by Professor Ruth Dobson and Dr Ben Jacobs, is hoping to correct that by investigating how genes from different ethnic backgrounds affect the risk of getting MS.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think the big trigger point for me was in 2017 when I attended</span></span><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/ectrims-highlights-2024" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/ectrims-highlights-2024" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">ECTRIMS</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, the largest annual MS research conference in the world. I noticed how few women neurologists and neuroscientists (less than 30%) were speaking on expert panels. That was a shock. Also, I assumed there would be much more discussion of women’s specific health issues in treating MS, since about 70% of patients who have MS are women. So you imagine my surprise when I didn&apos;t see that at all. I started doing research into this gender gap and realised women neurologists are paid, published and promoted less compared to their male counterparts. They also win far fewer prizes. My answer was to set up an award only for women scientists for their work in focusing on women’s health issues in MS. Less than 20% of the</span></span><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><u><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/for-professionals/for-researchers/research-funding-opportunities/awards-prizes/barancik" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Barancik Prize</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">winners are women; less than 10% of the </span></span><u><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/for-professionals/for-researchers/research-funding-opportunities/awards-prizes/john-dystel" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">John Dystel Prize</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology, goes to women; and the Sobek Prize, Europe&apos;s largest MS research award, has never been solely won by a female scientist. The RH Prize, worth US$40,000, is also my way to say to all those women neurologists and neuroscientists working out there - a big thank you. You deserve to be recognised and rewarded for all you do. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Who is the latest winner of the Rachel Horne Prize?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This year&apos;s prize winner was Professor Kerstin Hellwig, a neurologist specialising in pregnancy and MS. When Dr Hellwig came back from maternity leave, she realised she was unable to provide answers to the questions her female patients were asking about pregnancy and MS - such as what MS drugs they could safely take, which ones would allow them to breastfeed and whether they could deliver healthy babies. If you think about it, Dr Hellwig wasn&apos;t just dealing with one patient, she was actually counselling for two - the mother and the child. You can&apos;t afford to make a mistake when it comes to pregnancy. So, she set up the first German MS Pregnancy Register, which now has data on more than 5,000 pregnancies. For the first time, clinicians were able to refer to that and see what has worked and what was unsuccessful. She&apos;s also been pushing drug companies to do trials for women while they are pregnant. I think she was an incredibly popular choice among researchers, but also among women with MS. Because, you know, up until very recently women with MS were told by their neurologists not to have children. Now we know we can - but we want to be able to do it safely and with confidence.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>That shows how important it is to develop and share new resources so that everyone can benefit from the information. Speaking of novelties, how do you think the field is changing and advancing?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I do believe, and I hope I&apos;m not being naïve, that there is change in the air. In recent years, we have seen globally an assault on women&apos;s healthcare rights and we have sadly realised we can’t take anything for granted. We must be vigilant. That’s why I am so appreciative of all the young women scientists coming through, being aware and calling out sexism and misogyny in medicine. I also think there has been a shift in the amount of research looking at women&apos;s issues, especially in MS. For example, one area that I have actually started looking into is MS and domestic violence and abuse (read Rachel’s recent article</span></span><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><u><a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/view/hiding-plain-sight-ms-domestic-violence-abuse" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">here</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">). We know women are much more likely to be victims (and survivors) of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) and we know that people who are disabled are also at greater risk - yet, research into this complex issue is almost non-existent. So, I have funded the </span></span><u><a href="https://msdva.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">MS Domestic Violence and Abuse Research Initiative</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> at the University of Leeds and Nottingham to find out more. This includes how health care professionals can recognise DVA in their MS patients and how best to support them.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Thank you for talking about this. It reminds us that a person is often experiencing much more than just their condition. Our issues are complex, and they intersect with one another, so they should be looked at as such, even by researchers, scientists and doctors.  </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I agree. I mean, on one hand, it&apos;s difficult. Most people with MS see their neurologist for just 15 minutes a year. We also ask a lot from our MS nurses. On top of that, we also have an overstretched healthcare system. But as you said, I think we should see if we can pivot and have a system which has a more holistic and intersectional approach. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>To conclude, is there anything that you&apos;re particularly excited about that you see happening in the field?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Yes, absolutely. One thing I am really excited about is research around social determinants of health and MS. We always talk about the postcode lottery when it comes to healthcare. Why do some people get better treatment in the UK versus others? What can we do to make it equal? Is care dictated by a person’s education, gender, ethnic background, age or where they live? Or all of these? We need to pick these things apart and ask “what can we do to try and make it better and more equal for all patients.”  </span></span></p>

<p>A psychology journal has retracted an article on IQ tests nearly 50 years after publication — and more than 35 years after an investigation found the lead author had fabricated data in several other studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephen Breuning, a former assistant professor of child psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.2881355">gained notoriety</a> after a 1987 National Institute of Mental Health <a href="https://legacyfileshare.elsevier.com/legal/NIMH-Breuning-Investigation-final-report.pdf">report</a> found that he “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly engaged in misleading and deceptive practices in reporting results of research.” The report concluded Breuning had “engaged in serious scientific misconduct” by fabricating results in 10 articles funded by NIMH grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five of Breuning’s articles published in the 1980s have been retracted; three in the 1980s, one in 2022, and another in 2023. Retraction Watch reported on one of them, “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/13/in-1987-the-nih-found-a-paper-contained-fake-data-it-was-just-retracted/">Effects of methylphenidate on the fixed-ratio performance of mentally retarded children</a>,” published in 1983 in <em>Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior </em>(now published by Elsevier) and retracted in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newly retracted article predates those papers. Published in 1978 in the <em>Journal of School Psychology</em>,&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">Effects of individualized incentives on norm-referenced IQ test performance of high school students in special education classes</a>,” found record albums, sporting event tickets, portable radios, and other incentives boosted scores on IQ tests.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130811"></span>



<p>To many, including research psychologist Russell Warne, who has been investigating Breuning’s work since late 2021, these seemingly simple results appeared “too good to be true.” In early 2022, Warne emailed the journal’s editor-in-chief Craig Albers, raising concerns about the article&#8217;s validity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, nearly three years later, the journal, an Elsevier title, has retracted the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>, issued in December 2024, acknowledged the NIMH investigation, and continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Within this Journal of School Psychology article, the research was reported to have been conducted in seven suburban Chicago high schools across four school districts. Although the above article was not part of the NIMH investigation as it fell outside the scope of NIMH funded research, the NIMH Panel report identified an ongoing pattern of scientific misconduct by Dr. Breuning that introduces substantial concerns regarding the trustworthiness of this article. Despite several attempts, Dr. Breuning has not responded to requests for an explanation. The co-author confirmed that he (the co-author) was only involved in statistical analysis and not in data collection. This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief due to concerns about the integrity of the data reported and other issues identified within the NIMH Final Report that clearly established a pattern of ongoing scientific misconduct.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we reached out to Albers for comment, an Elsevier spokesperson responded with a statement that reiterated the retraction notice. We followed up to ask why it took several years to issue the retraction, and they said via email, “The journal team took all necessary steps during the investigation, including notifying the author, which can often cause delays before the final decision is made.”</p>



<p>Warne said he believes several factors contributed to the delay, including Albers’s recent appointment as editor and his initial email being mistakenly sent to the wrong folder. “I don&#8217;t know why it takes so long, and I really wish the COPE ethics guidelines would put recommended deadlines,” Warne said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In <a href="https://russellwarne.com/2022/01/25/unfinished-business-breuning-fraud-case-left-articles-unretracted/">January</a> and <a href="https://russellwarne.com/2022/02/22/more-articles-by-stephen-breuning-that-need-retraction/">February 2022</a>, Warne published blog posts outlining Breuning’s unretracted and potentially fraudulent work, including studies that weren’t part of NIMH’s 1980s investigation because they had different funding sources. This research led him to Breuning’s 1978 article.</p>



<p>Among several concerns, the most striking to Warne was the rapid speed and scale of the experiments, as well as the results showing significant IQ score increases with such simple incentives. He said, “If it were that easy to raise IQ, I think we would know that by now.”</p>



<p>While gathering evidence, Warne also spoke with the study’s co-author, William Zella. Breuning and Zella were in graduate school at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1970s, and Zella told Warne that Breuning had enlisted him as a coauthor to analyze the data and assist with the write-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Warne spoke with him, Zella “agreed that the study probably never happened.” More than four decades had passed since the study was conducted, so understandably, Zella could not recall many details. “He was not pleased that his co-author classmate from graduate school decades before had done this and that his name was attached to it,” Warne said. Zella clarified that he had no involvement in administering the tests or coordinating the volunteers.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, Breuning made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/us/us-study-finds-fraud-in-top-researcher-s-work-onmentally-retarded.html">major headlines</a>, but since then, his name has largely faded away. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380979">1990 study</a> by Eugene Garfield and Alfred Welljams-Dorof found Breuning’s work was largely rejected by the academic community. While Breuning&#8217;s research was cited often, few articles were in agreement with his methods or findings.</p>



<p>But his unretracted work remains in the scientific record and is still cited in meta-analyses and other studies. Breuning and Zella’s 1978 article has been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%E2%80%9CEffects+of+individualized+incentives+on+norm-referenced+IQ+test+performance+of+high+school+students+in+special+education+classes&amp;btnG=">cited 12 times</a>, according to Clarviate’s Web of Science. And a 2011 meta-analysis in <em>PNAS</em>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21518867/">&#8220;Role of test motivation in intelligence testing,&#8221;</a> includes data from the paper and has been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=Role+of+test+motivation+in+intelligence+testing&amp;btnG=">cited more than 200 times</a>. Breuning’s work significantly influenced the results of that meta-analysis, Warne said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warne said he has reached out to the lead author, Angela Lee Duckworth, and to <em>PNAS</em>, and was informed by the publisher that the journal is investigating the matter. When Retraction Watch reached out to <em>PNAS </em>for comment, Prashant Nair from the news office responded via email with the same sentiment: “We are aware of the matter and looking into it.”</p>



<p>Warne believes the journal should first publish an expression of concern to clarify that Duckworth and her co-authors are not at fault.</p>



<p>Warne sees Duckworth and her collaborators, as well as Breuning’s coauthor Zella, as victims of Breuning’s fraud. One of Warne’s primary objectives in all of this is to highlight how long-buried fraudulent articles can continue to cause harm and “re-victimize people.”</p>

<p>A case of mistaken identity among sharks has led to a correction that changed, among other content, an article’s title, its abstract and the discussion section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, published in February 2024 in <em>Environmental Biology of Fishes</em>, was originally titled “Expanded vertical niche for two species of pelagic sharks: depth range extension for the dusky shark <em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em> and novel twilight zone occurrence by the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falciformi</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But after re-examining the data, the authors concluded: “the dusky shark from the published paper was misidentified, and instead, it is most likely a bignose shark,” according to an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01610-6">October 2024 correction</a> to the article.</p>



<span id="more-130815"></span>



<p>The title is now “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01527-0">Novel deep-sea observations reveal twilight zone occurrence for two species of pelagic sharks: the bignose shark <em>Carcharhinus altimus</em> and the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falciformis</em>.</a>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes to the title amend the name of the shark and revoke the range extension for the dusky shark. The updated species ID also required changes in the abstract, paragraphs in the introduction, results, and discussion, a figure caption, and references. The original text, including its original title, is no longer available online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article has been cited twice, once under each version of the title. The journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Olivia Dixon, the research coordinator at <a href="https://beneaththewaves.org/people/">Beneath the Waves</a> and corresponding author of the study, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://umanitoba.ca/science/directory/biological-sciences/margaret-docker">Margaret Docker</a>, a professor at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, was editor-in-chief at the time of the correction. In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, she justified the issuing of a correction rather than a retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[E]ven though the original identification of a dusky shark led to an erroneous depth range extension for this species,” Docker said, “in consultation with the authors and Advisory Editor, we felt that enough of the original study was still valid that correcting the misidentification was more appropriate than retracting the whole paper.”</p>



<p>Springer Nature’s <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/editorial-policies/corrections-and-retractions?srsltid=AfmBOooNYAA8C7Bfhcxi7pDbEYP5wpO3jBim6M_q8gRjehcYHRl6BMs-">policy</a> on retractions and corrections addresses cases of scientific misconduct, but not cases of mistaken species identification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most of the corrections, “the bulk of these sections were unchanged,” Docker said, and the second species, the silky shark, “was not affected at all.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hello, readers! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">2024 has been a monumental year for Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK), marked by huge growth, many firsts and some fantastic new partnerships. If you’re new to who we are and what we do, in a nutshell WiNUK tackles gender inequalities in neuroscience through a multi-platform approach, developing events, blogs, social media, and newsletters, to inspire, connect and advocate for a world of inclusive neuroscience. Let&apos;s take some time to reflect on our highlights from 2024:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li><p><u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We grew our volunteer team!</strong></span></span></u></p></li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Over the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our volunteer team size, welcoming over 40 new volunteers to WiNUK across our sub-teams (alongside many more guest writers for the blog too!). Check out our impressive team on </span></span><u><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/team" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Our Team page</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> here.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We created four brand new sub-teams to continue our organisation&apos;s sustainable growth: In-Person Events, Human Resources, Partnerships and Finance. We even established ourselves as a company limited by guarantee - exciting!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li><p><u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Our Global Impact Increased</strong></span></span></u></p></li>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">WiNUK was founded in the UK, but that doesn&apos;t stop us engaging with neuroscientists all over the world - you’re following us on social media from six continents! We&apos;ve loved seeing you signing up to our events, following our social media posts and reading our blog articles from</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">33 countries!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Across platforms, we estimate a total of 5000-6000 followers, doubling our community compared to the previous year. WiNUK saw significant growth on social media, surpassing 1,000 followers on each major social media platform (excluding TikTok), demonstrating increased community interest and engagement. Thanks to our amazing expanding community, WiNUK has the pleasure of ending 2024 celebrating significant community growth. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Each month we brought our subscribers our WiNUK newsletter, updating you with exclusive content, updates and sneak peeks! 323 more of you joined our mailing list this year (there are now nearly 700 of you!), to hear about our monthly highlights across WiNUK platforms.

</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We were very busy with in-person events this year! With 4 conference stalls and 6 in-person workshops, from an LGBTQ+ research showcase to the inaugural WiNUK awards ceremony, there was plenty to attend!</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For our first ever in-person event, our founder, Lizzie English, held an informative and engaging session at the </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) Annual Conference’</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> in Liverpool, with 200 attendees learning more about statistics, panelists’ experiences and strategies to tackle the gender gaps in dementia research.

It was a well-attended session and 100% of our WiNUK survey respondents found the session very interesting, enjoyable and useful! Attendees thought it was “great that ARUK [was] providing space for these important topics”, that for someone starting out in their career it was especially “valuable to hear panel experiences” and that the “statistics shown…provide[d] concrete evidence of the issue” which made them want to be “more outspoken about gender equity and be[come] an ally”. The only request was to make the session longer! We also featured an exhibition stall to engage with attendees and advertise our organisation.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In our mission to reach neuroscientists across the UK, we attended </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘ARUK ECR Days’</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> in Cambridge and in Plymouth. At the South West ECR Day, we found that 35% of attendees were unaware of the gender bias in dementia research workplaces, with the event prompting reflection for attendees about how subtle biases can persist. Attendees liked Lizzie’s suggestions of “simple actions towards inclusive workplaces” which were “inclusive of all genders while addressing women’s issues – it foster[ed] solidarity”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At our conference stalls, in Cambridge, Liverpool and Harrogate, we distributed our brand new flyers and merchandise, including stickers and badges! We have loved seeing your reactions and social media posts about these. Across the year, we conducted trial research surveys at our conference stalls and talks to investigate your experiences of sexism and gender bias. Thanks for helping us to understand your experiences and allowing us to take inspiration from these to tailor WiNUK’s strategies. </span></span></p>

<p>Two management journals from the same publisher have retracted a pair of articles for taking “models, samples, and results” from each other and earlier work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A tip from an anonymous account sent in November to Retraction Watch, sleuth Elisabeth Bik, and others called out duplications in the papers. Bik then posted the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A03358728BCC84CE8F15BDDFCD3A89">two</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/724C26B5898C267CA09CECB9935D45">articles</a> on PubPeer in November 2024, noting several identical sets of tables between the papers, despite the works investigating survey data on different topics from different populations — intention to leave among employees from the hospitality sector, and resistance to change among managers at private organizations.</p>



<span id="more-130804"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-07-2019-0293/full/html">&#8220;Workplace bullying and intention to leave: a moderated mediation model of emotional exhaustion and supervisory support&#8221;</a> was published online July 8, 2020, in <em>Employee Relations </em>and has been cited 35 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The other article, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jocm-02-2020-0063/full/html">&#8220;Resistance to change and turnover intention: a moderated mediation model of burnout and perceived organizational support,”</a> appeared online July 29, 2020, in the <em>Journal of Organizational Change Management </em>(<em>JOCM</em>)<em> </em>and has been cited 59 times.</p>



<p>The journals are both titles of <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/">Emerald Publishing</a> and are listed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first author on the articles is Shalini Srivastava, a professor at the Jaipuria Institute of Management in India, according to her <a href="https://www.jaipuria.ac.in/faculty/shalini-srivastava/">faculty profile page</a>. <em>Employee Relations</em> <a href="https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/er">lists her</a> as an associate editor of the journal. Links to Google Scholar and LinkedIn on Srivastava’s <a href="https://www.jaipuria.ac.in/faculty/shalini-srivastava/">faculty profile page</a> appear to have been deleted, although an archived version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240718162153/https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QjR1lOQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">the Google Scholar profile</a> exists on the Internet Archive.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jocm-02-2020-0063/full/html">retraction notice</a> for the <em>JOCM</em> article, posted December 23, acknowledged the similarities: “It has come to our attention that a large portion of this article’s models, samples, and results are taken, without full and proper attribution, from an earlier original work” — referring to the other retracted article. The notice continues:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On investigation of this matter, further concerns were raised with regard to the data used as the same analysis employed in the earlier work was also applied here despite the two articles looking at fundamentally different contexts. As such, the findings of this article cannot be relied upon. The authors of this paper would like to note that they agree with the content of this notice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-07-2019-0293/full/html">notice</a> for the <em>Employee Relations </em>article, published December 24, cites overlap with yet another paper coauthored by Srivastava — a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0972262919869747">2019 article on organizational citizenship behavior</a> that appeared in <em>Vision</em>, a journal of the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon, India, published by Sage Publications.</p>



<p>Queries to the editors in chief of <em>JOCM</em> and <em>Employee Relations</em> were answered by a spokesperson from Emerald’s research integrity department. “Emerald’s research integrity team and the Editors-in-Chief of both journals investigated the system evidence and the content of both articles in accordance with COPE&#8217;s principles on duplicate publications,” the spokesperson told Retraction Watch. “The authors were contacted for an explanation. The investigation concluded that the responses were insufficient and that the results in the articles could not be relied upon.”</p>



<p>Bik and others have called out several of Srivastava’s articles <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=shalini+srivastava">on PubPeer</a> for various reasons, including for similarities in data and methodology between articles, and for omitting mention of institutional review board approval, participant consent, or recruitment strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Srivastava nor Swati Agrawal, the coauthor on the two retracted articles, responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sage journal <em>American Surgeon </em>has issued a mass expression of concern for 116 articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031348241305412">expression of concern</a> states the journal “was made aware” of “concerning author activity” on the articles.</p>



<p>Sage is no stranger to mass editorial actions. In 2023, the publisher pulled large tranches of papers at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/21/sage-retracting-three-dozen-articles-for-compromised-peer-review/">least</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/02/sage-retracts-more-than-200-papers-from-journal-for-compromised-peer-review/">three</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/14/turmoil-at-sage-journal-as-retractions-mount/">times</a>, and last year it retracted over <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">450 papers</a> from a journal the company had acquired from IOS Press. The publisher was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/31/guest-post-a-look-behind-the-scenes-of-bulk-retractions-from-sage/">one of the first</a> to begin retracting papers in bulk, primarily to combat manipulated peer review.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.care.piedmont.org/provider/Don+Ken+Nakayama/2451980">Don Nakayama</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal and a pediatric surgeon in Columbus, Georgia, forwarded our request for comment to Sage.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Laura West, a Sage spokesperson, said “SCOPUS” — presumably Elsevier’s Scopus database — reached out with concerns “about the quality of content in this journal.” Sage won’t provide any additional information while the investigation is ongoing, West said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier did not respond directly to questions regarding the tip from Scopus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the concerning papers had one common author: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7730-617X">Adel Elkbuli</a>. Elkbuli’s affiliation is listed on the most recent articles as the Department of Surgery at Orlando Regional Medical Center, in Florida, although he does not appear to have a directory listing or profile page <a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/facilities/orlando-regional-medical-center">at the center</a>. He is also affiliated with the University of Miami.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elkbuli did not respond to our request for comment. He has 378 publications listed in Clarivate’s Web of Science that have been cited a total of over 3,000 times.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/neurons-and-learning-activity-driven-neuroplasticity">Neurons and learning: activity-driven neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When we start learning a new skill, every little aspect requires deliberate, conscious effort. With practice and repetition, our actions become smoother and easier to recall, eventually transforming initially demanding skills into second nature. Underlying this process of skill acquisition are intricate firing patterns in brain networks, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP), or &quot;activity-driven neuroplasticity.&quot; LTP strengthens specific synaptic connections without affecting others, maintaining input specificity. Its counterpart, long-term depression (LTD), works in the opposite direction. Together, LTP and LTD play crucial roles in fine-tuning neural circuits, which are essential for learning and memory, and rely on similar neurological processes at the molecular level.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Molecular mechanisms</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The concept of LTP was introduced over 30 years ago, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remained elusive until the 1980s, when key insights identified NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors as central players. These Ca²⁺ channels in the brain are unique because they are blocked by Mg²⁺ ions at resting membrane potentials. During low-frequency stimulation, smaller action potentials activate AMPA receptors by facilitating glutamate binding, but NMDA receptors remain blocked by Mg²⁺. Only when the neuronal membrane depolarizes sufficiently to expel the Mg²⁺ ion do NMDA receptors open, allowing Ca²⁺ to enter the postsynaptic neuron.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Importantly, the unique properties of NMDA receptors explain LTP&apos;s specificity and associativity. When one group of synaptic inputs is strongly activated, LTP occurs only at those specific synapses, as NMDA receptors at other synapses fail to meet the activation threshold. For associativity, weakly stimulated synapses alone cannot depolarize the neuron enough to remove the Mg²⁺ block. However, if neighboring synapses are strongly activated, they can provide sufficient depolarization, enhancing Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptors at the weakly stimulated synapse and inducing LTP.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;LTP is closely linked to learning processes in the hippocampus, the brain region critical for memory formation.&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ca²⁺ influx is critical for LTP, as it activates key protein kinases like CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and Protein Kinase C (PKC). CaMKII, in particular, is abundant in LTP-associated synapses and is thought to increase postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate by either adding more receptors to the synapse or enhancing the sensitivity of existing ones. Some theories also suggest that LTP involves increased neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling, where the postsynaptic neuron regulates presynaptic activity using molecules like nitric oxide to strengthen communication.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>LTP &amp; learning</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">LTP is closely linked to learning processes in the hippocampus, the brain region critical for memory formation. Dendritic spines, small protrusions on neurons housing excitatory synapses, are indicators of synaptic growth and restructuring driven by LTP and LTD. These processes are initiated by cascades of Ca²⁺ signaling influenced by pre- and postsynaptic activity. Moreover, LTP occurs in two distinct phases: early-phase LTP, which is transient and prone to decay, and late-phase LTP, which is longer-lasting. Late-phase LTP involves a mechanism called synaptic-tagging-and-capture (STC), where synapses marked during the early phase &quot;capture&quot; proteins necessary for long-term changes. This process helps consolidate and stabilize memories. Interestingly, recent research highlights that LTP decay, an active process occurring within 1-6 hours after induction, is mediated by the endocytosis of AMPA receptors.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;(...) if neighboring synapses are strongly activated, they can provide sufficient depolarization, (...) inducing LTP&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>LTP &amp; neurodegenerative conditions</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">LTP&apos;s role also extends to understanding neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, where impaired synaptic plasticity contributes to cognitive decline. Protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), essential for maintaining non-decaying LTP, is often mislocalized or degraded due to neurofibrillary tangles. This disruption weakens synaptic strength and memory retention. However, recent advances show promise: the synthetic peptide GluA23Y inhibits AMPA receptor endocytosis, converting decaying LTP into non-decaying LTP and slowing memory loss. Furthermore, GluA23Y has demonstrated the potential to reduce toxic plaques in Alzheimer’s mouse models, making it a promising therapeutic avenue.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In conclusion, long-term potentiation lies at the core of our understanding of how the brain learns and remembers. Through the contributions of NMDA receptors, Ca²⁺ influx, and protein kinases, LTP and LTD shape synaptic plasticity. Its links to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s underscore its importance, while innovative interventions like GluA23Y highlight the potential to restore cognitive functions. Exploring the mechanisms of LTP continues to unlock profound insights into brain function and paves the way for transformative therapies in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.</span></span></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Last October, Martin McPhillie, a <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/5234/dr-martin-mcphillie">lecturer</a> in organic chemistry at the UK’s University of Leeds, received an email alert from his institution about a new article bearing his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “Docking Study of Licensed Non-Viral Drugs to Obtain Ebola Virus Inhibitors,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology</em>, a title of Istanbul, Turkey-based <a href="https://deniz.pub/journals">Deniz Publication</a>. The journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was within McPhillie’s area of expertise, and aligned with work he and the other listed coauthors had previously published. But he knew the new study wasn’t his.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130766"></span>



<p>“I felt very professionally violated at the time and still angry about the whole episode,” McPhillie told Retraction Watch. “I am acutely aware of how academic malpractice can ruin an academic career so did not want to be associated with this paper.”</p>



<p>McPhillie emailed the journal’s <a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/journal-page/editorial-team">editor in chief</a>, Marcello Iriti, an <a href="https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/marcello-iriti">associate professor</a> of biomedical, surgical, and dental sciences at the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, and explained the situation. Iriti “was apologetic but did not offer an explanation,” McPhillie said. According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, the editor called the publication of the article a “mystery.”</p>



<p>Iriti also told us he didn’t know how the paper came to be published with the names of authors who had no involvement in the work. He referred our question to an unnamed managing editor copied on his reply. The managing editor did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McPhillie was initially “relieved” Iriti responded, but then the journal removed the article from its website with an undated notice that stated only “<a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/article/docking-study-of-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-qiq049ivryvrbac">This article has been retracted</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To my mind, ‘retracted’ usually means that the authors have committed malpractice,” McPhillie said, but in his case, “the authors are innocent” and the problem likely lies with the journal. “There is stigma associated with retracted papers.”</p>



<p>When McPhillie contacted Iriti again, the editor was “rather dismissive” and said “there was nothing more they could do,” McPhillie said. </p>



<p>“I would have thought the journal would have other options to remove papers like this,” McPhillie said, which he thinks would also benefit the journal. “They don&#8217;t seem to care.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases we’ve covered previously, researchers who find their names attached to papers they didn’t write have had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/09/violated-engineering-professor-found-her-name-on-four-papers-she-didnt-write/">mixed</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">results</a> in getting the papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to alerting the other listed authors, McPhillie Googled the paper title and found an <a href="https://ijpras.com/article/docking-study-o-f-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-gcjqwyjxkygeu9g">identical article</a> with different authors published in 2024 in the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em>. The journal appears to belong to another Istanbul-based entity, <a href="https://meralpublisher.com/">Meral Publisher</a>, and also is not listed in Web of Science. Ozgur Karcioglu, the editor in chief, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

The paper on the right has been retracted. Neither journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Muhammad Rafiq of the Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences in Quetta, Pakistan, the listed corresponding author of the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em> article, told Retraction Watch he had “nothing to do” with the paper. “I don’t know why this appeared with my name.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafiq and the same group of coauthors had published a similar study, “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/14/6/660">Identification of Prospective Ebola Virus VP35 and VP40 Protein Inhibitors from Myxobacterial Natural Products</a>,” in <em>Biomolecules</em>, an MDPI title, in June 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in December, an anonymous PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/90992B779547EB4C3E4A34EE2D8A7A#1">posted</a> about the retraction statement in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology </em>and asked the authors or publisher to clarify the reason for their decision. The user also pointed out several issues in the paper, most notably the stated use of “AutoCAD,” a design software used in engineering. “I have never seen AutoCAD used in computational chemistry,” the commenter wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the journal had removed the paper from its website, the PubPeer commenter had found a version of record on White Rose, the University of Leeds institutional repository, which has since been removed as well. McPhillie learned of the copy of the paper in the repository from PubPeer, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have asked our research library team for information about how this paper could be deposited internally, as someone had to &#8216;claim&#8217; it,” he told us. “I haven&#8217;t received a response to that, although they were sympathetic to our situation.”&nbsp;</p>
