<p>Seven papers on various aspects of vaping and cigarettes published in <em>Toxicology Reports </em>listed each authors’ affiliation –&nbsp; the tobacco company Philip Morris International – when they originally appeared in the journal between 2019 and 2023. And all but one article disclosed the funding for the research originated from the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That apparently wasn’t enough for the journal.</p>



<p><em>Toxicology Reports </em>has issued a correction to add those affiliations as a conflict of interest. The statements were “missing or incorrect” in the original papers, according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2024.101881">correction notice</a>, published in the June 2025 issue of <em>Toxicology Reports</em>. In addition to reiterating that the authors work for PMI, the correction also adds to the conflict of interest statements that the authors were funded by the company and used its products in the research.</p>



<span id="more-132294"></span>



<p>“While the authors’ affiliation to Philip Morris was indeed listed on the articles, Elsevier policies and ICMJE recommendations require disclosures of competing interests to be added to articles, and full details on the potential conflict of interests of authors, where applicable, must be provided,” a spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told us.</p>



<p>The spokesperson said the issue “was flagged to us recently” but would not say by whom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier contacted the authors at Philip Morris, and both parties agreed to the correction. “At the publisher’s request, we added details to the conflict of interest section to reflect information already included in the author affiliations,” a spokesperson for the company said. </p>



<p>The correction added the following “Declaration of competing interest” to each paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The work reported in this publication involved products developed by Philip Morris Products S.A., which is the sole source of funding and sponsor of this research. All authors are employees of PMI R&amp;D or worked for PMI R&amp;D under contractual agreements.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The papers included reviews and primary research on the toxicology of heated tobacco and e-cigarettes. Others ranged from a study of aerosols from hookah tobacco to a methods paper comparing multiple cigarettes for use as a baseline reference in studies of other tobacco products. Most of the papers have been cited up to 19 times; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018307352?via%3Dihub">one of them</a> has been cited 63 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p><em>Toxicology Reports </em>has had oversight issues in the past. In 2021, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/19/elsevier-subjects-entire-special-issue-of-journal-on-covid-19-to-an-expression-of-concern/">issued an expression of concern</a> on an entire special issue on COVID-19 over “concerns raised regarding the validity and scientific soundness of the content.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100161X">At least</a> two <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750021000445">of the papers</a> in the issue have since been retracted.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gokhan_hotamisligil_harvard.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="510" height="340" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gokhan_hotamisligil_harvard.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132285" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gokhan_hotamisligil_harvard.jpg 510w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gokhan_hotamisligil_harvard-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gökhan Hotamışlıgil</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just as a Harvard lab brought in tens of millions of dollars in private equity funding to pursue new treatments for obesity, past research from its lead investigator has come under fresh scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the lab of Gökhan Hotamışlıgil, a professor of genetics and metabolism at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/drawing-on-harvard-chan-school-research-biotech-startup-aims-to-to-tackle-age-related-illness/">secured a $39 million dollar investment</a> from İş Private Equity, an Istanbul-based firm. The partnership centers on FABP4, a protein associated with obesity and other metabolic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over the past decades, two of Hotamışlıgil’s papers have been corrected for image duplications, and since the announcement, renewed scrutiny of Hotamışlıgil’s work appeared on PubPeer, including for issues with statistical analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132282"></span>



<p>“Of course when we become aware of an irregularity or mistake, or someone makes an allegation, we take these issues very seriously and do all we can to address the question,” Hotamışlıgil told us in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most recent comments are from <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Reese Richardson</a>, a computational biologist <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">who looks into</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/patent-mills-sell-scientists-inventorship-bizarre-medical-devices">scientific reproducibility</a>. Richardson said he became curious about Hotamışlıgil’s work after seeing news about the funding deal. He soon found existing concerns flagged on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I figured that it would be worthwhile to check his papers out,” Richardson told us. Initially, two articles piqued his interest, although Hotamışlıgil is not the senior author on either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one PubPeer post, Richardson <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B02230187046D5707C7EF41936F01">raised concerns</a> about a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28346411/">2017 paper in <em>Nature Medicine</em></a> in which he discovered mislabelling of data, claims of statistical significance the raw data didn’t seem to support, and some missing source data. The author contribution statement indicates Hotamışlıgil oversaw some of the experiments.</p>



<p>Richardson also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8F92D52CAB80E6456D2D0364086C5C#0">looked into</a> a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413119303742">2019 article in <em>Cell Metabolism</em></a> that contained “either wrongly reported or apparently manipulated” statistics, he told us. Nearly every result “features inexplicable methodological inconsistencies or reporting errors,” he wrote on PubPeer. “These result in a massive exaggeration of the effects observed.”</p>



<p>According to Richardson’s analysis, some statements made in the paper were true only when samples were arbitrarily excluded, but the methods didn’t describe any procedure for the exclusion of samples. According to the author contribution statement, Hotamışlıgil helped with the discussion and interpretation of results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Heathers, a scientific sleuth and director of the Medical Evidence Project — an initiative of the Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch — said the extent of the problem is mostly unknowable. “How can you adjust for the effects of data that isn&#8217;t presented?” If outliers are left in the dataset, but redacted from the analysis, “the redaction should be explained in 100% of cases,” he said.</p>



<p>Hotamışlıgil said the work for those two papers was led by Yu-Hua Tseng, another researcher at Harvard, and his group’s involvement was limited. “We have provided some help with their experiments, my fellow Alex Bartelt provided some training and physiology and biochemistry experiments,” he told us. “We were not directly involved with the rest of the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Apart from Richardson’s recent comments, anonymous commenters on PubPeer have pointed out irregularities in Hotamışlıgil’s published work over the years. A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18773087">2008 <em>PLOS One</em> paper</a>, for example, was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/annotation/1074cd39-708b-45ef-943a-e9d1c5bbdedd">corrected</a> after a commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A750E93E9DF8076D38B99B0B520573#">found a duplicated image</a>. A <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6700A447752FC285435695E91506A4#">similar issue was flagged</a> in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.11.009">2020 paper in <em>Cell Metabolism</em></a>, which included two identical images in one figure. “We deeply regret this unfortunate error,” one of the authors wrote on PubPeer. That paper was <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00321-1">also corrected</a>. Another flagged paper appears to contain <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C2B3AE84F49A817EB59C491B3EEB#">similar-looking blots</a>. Hotamışlıgil is listed as the senior and corresponding author on each of these papers.</p>



<p>For a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aav0120">2019 article in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em></a> related to FABP4&nbsp; — the protein at the center of the new funding deal — <a href="http://pubpeer.com/publications/24DA13D73B914C4B429A12B9ADBD1D#">an anonymous commenter questioned</a> the statistical significance of the findings. After analysing the raw data, the commenter found no statistical significance for some findings reported in the paper, despite them having been reported as such. Hotamışlıgil was the senior and corresponding author for this paper. Heathers said these statistical concerns comprised “a concerning pattern of oversights” and would “necessitate exactly the kind of audit that universities tend not to do.”</p>



<p>Reflecting on the PubPeer posts appearing under his name, Hotamışlıgil said, “In many cases, there is no basis, for example there are several posts where there is no comment, there is even one post about a review that I have written but nothing can be found at the post, and some state opinions or perceptions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hotamışlıgil also co-authored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01137">a 2002 <em>Nature</em> paper</a> with Michael Karin, a prominent cancer researcher and the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=michael+karin&amp;sessionid=64B62C7B545931FCFC39&amp;commit=Search+Publications">subject of previous scrutiny</a> for image problems, including in our own <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/08/29/authors-including-highly-cited-cancer-researcher-blame-clerical-error-for-image-mixup-in-cancer-paper/">reporting</a>. The paper was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06285-0">corrected in 2023</a> after <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4966AA09CF15E616FF386E8643BE34#0">PubPeer commenters identified</a> duplicated blots. In the correction, the editors wrote: “as the raw data for the blots used in the manuscript are no longer available, unfortunately we cannot ascertain the issue with the figure.” Hotamışlıgil was listed as the senior and corresponding author on this paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has also co-authored papers with Umut Ozcan, <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2015/06/18/former-researchers-sue-hospital-lab-chief/">who in 2015</a> was accused by postdocs of fabricating data and creating a hostile work environment. The case was dismissed from court in 2018. Hotamışlıgil <a href="https://kectil.com/leadership/faculty/gokhan-s-hotamisligil-m-d-ph-d/">was Ozcan’s graduate advisor</a>, and the two articles where Hotamışlıgil is listed as the senior and corresponding author, and Ozcan as the first, appear to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/36D0A9BC3CE8FF1D6D8A53DCF6A497#">contain duplicate lanes</a> in the blot data or have a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8EEA13EA78904DA5D1388923A9E2E6#">mismatched number of lanes</a>. Mike Rossner, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/03/guest-post-nih-funded-replication-studies-reproducibility-crisis-preclinical-research/">an image manipulation consultant</a>, said these PubPeer allegations also had merit, although the mismatched lanes could be a clerical error, which is “unusual, but not unheard of,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Harvard <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/drawing-on-harvard-chan-school-research-biotech-startup-aims-to-to-tackle-age-related-illness/">has described</a> the Turkish firm’s partnership with Hotamışlıgil’s lab as a “potential model” for revenue for the T.H. Chan School. According to a press release about the funding, the school has seen almost $200 million in federal funding dry up in recent months, and the Trump administration terminated nearly every direct federal grant for research and training. The deal was in progress before the administration came into office, and would have taken place despite the recent decline in federal funding, a Harvard spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iş Private Equity is currently the only private equity funder at the T.H. Chan School, although the school is “accelerating” efforts to engage with the private sector, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such arrangements between universities and private equity are “not common,” Robert Field, a professor of law and public health at Drexel University in Philadelphia, told us. In recent years, private equity has been moving into health care — buying up hospitals, nursing homes and physician practices — but investing into universities is unusual. Private equity is “by nature, profit oriented, and usually short-term profit oriented,” Field said, and are most likely to fund projects that are close to fruition, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research has the same oversight, regardless of the funding source, said the Harvard spokesperson, and they will not accept collaboration that “imposes any restriction on our faculty’s freedom to publish and speak about their research.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Richardson told us he shifted his focus to Tseng, who was the senior author on the two recently flagged papers. Richardson came across a different pair of 20-year-old papers she was the lead author on, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/49CF8B8D475FEC31081FB3A677DB01">both of which</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BCA9D861466EC06B0852887D54EF37">seem to contain</a> similarities between parts of Western blots, or inconsistent features in the blot lanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rossner told us the allegations about image duplications had merit and the data raise enough concerns for a journal editor to want to verify the published results. Some of the PubPeer comments note mismatched lanes in the Western blots; this could be due to clerical error, Rossner said, and one image was too low resolution to tell whether it could be a duplicate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richardson has also since raised concerns about <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7D9D497F92B58F02D10436D77F2F47">several</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/35F1CF6464E70D7DE92656681D5FB0">other</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B02230187046D5707C7EF41936F01">papers</a> by Tseng, citing statistical irregularities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tseng told us she is aware of the comments and has “already discussed them with the leading authors.” Since speaking with <em>Retraction Watch</em>, she has responded on the platform, writing, “Thank you for your comments. We are currently reviewing the original data and conducting additional analysis. We will respond to the comments once the investigation is complete.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authors of a paper that went viral with attention-grabbing headlines <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/black-plastic-spatula-health-risks-6fddfdad?mod=e2tw">urging</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/">people</a> to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/theres-a-scary-rumor-about-black-plastic-cookware-should-you-throw-yours-out-ano_l_67d35711e4b00eb3dcd1faf8">throw out</a> their <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/news/throw-away-black-takeout-container-kitchen-utensils">black plastic</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/black-plastic-cooking-utensils-rcna183495">kitchen tools</a> have corrected the work for a second time.</p>



<p>But a letter accompanying the correction suggests the latest update still fails “to completely correct the math and methodological errors present in the study,” according to Mark Jones, an industrial chemist and consultant who has been following the case. “The errors are sufficient to warrant a restating of the abstract, sections of the paper and conclusions, if not a retraction.”</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653524022173">From e-waste to living space: Flame retardants contaminating household items add to concern about plastic recycling</a>,” originally appeared in <em>Chemosphere </em>in September. The study authors, from the advocacy group Toxic-Free Future and the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, looked for the presence of flame retardants in certain household plastic items, including toys, food service trays and kitchen utensils.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132273"></span>



<p>The researchers found toxic flame retardants in several items that wouldn’t ordinarily need fire protection, such as sushi trays, vegetable peelers, slotted spoons and pasta servers. Those items, the authors suggested, could have been made from recycled electronics — which do contain flame retardants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, for kitchen utensils, the authors used findings <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717321708?via%3Dihub">from another study</a>, which measured how toxic chemicals including BDE-209 transfer from black plastic utensils into hot cooking oil, to estimate potential intake based on findings in their own study. They estimated a daily intake of 34,700 ng/day of BDE-209 from using contaminated utensils, which “would approach the U.S. BDE-209 reference dose” set by the Environmental Protection Agency, they reported.</p>



<p>But the authors miscalculated that reference dose. They had put it at 42,000 ng/day instead of 420,000 ng/day. That hiccup led to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X">the first correction to the paper</a>, published in December. “This calculation error does not affect the overall conclusion of the paper,” the authors said in the corrigendum.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653525004965">latest corrigendum</a>, published July 3, states the formula the authors used to estimate exposure to the flame retardant BDE-209 “was misinterpreted.” It continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This misinterpretation led to an overestimation of the BDE-209 exposure concentration. The corrected estimated BDE-209 exposure is 7900 ng/day instead of 34,700 ng/day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“While we regret the error, this is a correction in one exposure example in the discussion section of the study,” lead author Megan Liu of Toxic-Free Future told us by email. “The example was not part of the core research objectives or methods of the study.”</p>



<p>Jones, who spent his career at Dow Chemical, told us the second corrigendum is “inadequate and still incorrect.”</p>



<p>“If the error is sufficiently large to only provide context, the statement in the Conclusions that brominated flame retardants ‘significantly contaminate products’ no longer can be supported and must be corrected or retracted following the reasoning presented in the second corrigendum,” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653525004862#bib2">Jones wrote in a letter to the editor</a> published with the second correction.</p>



<p>Jones took to task some of the calculations and other estimates Liu and colleagues made, which the authors refute <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653525004916?via%3Dihub#bib2">in a response to Jones’ letter</a>, also published in <em>Chemosphere</em> this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elsevier journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/18/journal-that-published-viral-study-on-black-plastic-removed-from-major-index/">was delisted from Clarivate’s Web of Science in December</a> for failing to meet editorial quality criteria. Last December an Elsevier spokesperson told us the publisher’s ethics team was“conducting in-depth investigations” of “potential breaches of <em>Chemosphere’s </em>publishing policies.” The journal had published more than 60 expressions of concern in 2024 and has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;qs=retraction%20notice&amp;years=2025&amp;show=50">retracted 34 articles so far this year</a>.</p>



<p>Part of delisting means Clarivate no longer indexes the journal’s papers or counts its citations. Google Scholar shows seven citations to Liu’s paper, and Dimensions lists four scholarly citations.</p>

<p>Mario Biagioli, a distinguished professor of law and communication at the University of California, Los Angeles — and a pioneering thinker about how academic reward systems incentivize misconduct — <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/news/mario-biagioli-memoriam-influential-thought-leader-law-and-technology">passed away in May</a> after a long illness. He was 69.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other intellectual interests, Biagioli wrote frequently about the (presumably) unintended consequences of using metrics such as citations to measure the quality and impact of published papers, and thereby the prestige of their authors and institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is no longer enough for scientists to publish their work. The work must be seen to have an influential shelf life,” Biagioli <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/535201a">wrote in <em>Nature</em></a> in 2016. “This drive for impact places the academic paper at the centre of a web of metrics — typically, where it is published and how many times it is cited — and a good score on these metrics becomes a goal that scientists and publishers are willing to cheat for.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132259"></span>



<p>Such cheating takes the form of faking peer reviews, coercing citations, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/23/a-new-form-of-plagiarism-when-researcher-fake-co-authors-names/">faking coauthors</a>, or buying authorship on papers, among other tactics described in the 2020 book <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/4598/Gaming-the-MetricsMisconduct-and-Manipulation-in"><em>Gaming the Metrics: Misconduct and Manipulation in Academic Research</em></a>, which Biagioli edited with Alexandra Lippman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mario saw the increasing reliance of metrics within scholarship, and their gaming, not simply as a moral problem but rather as an intellectual problem,” said Lippman, whom Biagioli mentored in a postdoctoral fellowship. “Mario was interested in how the gaming of metrics fundamentally changed academic misconduct from epistemic crime – old fashioned fraud – to a bureaucratic one – the post-production manipulation of impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lippman and Biagioli organized a <a href="https://library.ucdavis.edu/news/gaming-metrics-innovation-surveillance-in-academic-misconduct/">conference</a> at the University of California, Davis, in 2016 on the topic, from which the book <em>Gaming the Metrics</em> followed. “To create a serious conversation about this new issue, Mario invited not only historians of science, computer scientists, anthropologists and other scholars but also misconduct watchdogs and other practitioners from the trenches to share their research, expertise and perspectives,” Lippman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That conference “can be considered the moment when the milieu of the new style science watchdogs, to which belongs Retraction Watch, was launched,” said <a href="https://isns.fr/membre/emmanuel-didier/">Emmanuel Didier</a>, a sociologist and research director at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France. “It was the first time everyone met the other,” said Didier, who participated in the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biagioli “had high expectations for excellence, a strong sense of adventure, and a constant twinkle in his eye along with a biting sense of humor,” Lippman said. He was “an expansive thinker,” she said, and his intellectual legacy “is also expansive through his work not only on scholarly metrics and misconduct but also on scholarly credit, intellectual property, copyright, academic brands, and scientific authorship.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/mario-biagioli">Biagioli</a> earned his Ph.D. in the history of science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989. Before joining the UCLA faculty in 2019, he taught at many institutions, including Harvard University, Stanford, and UC Davis, where he founded the Center for Science and Innovation Studies.

<p>“I learned something from every conversation I had with Mario, and everything of his I read,” said our Ivan Oransky. “His way of looking at the structure of academia and scholarly publishing was unique, bracing, and constructive.”</p>



<p>Biagioli’s <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/fraud-by-numbers-metrics-and-the-new-academic-misconduct/">idea</a> that &#8220;the article has become more like a vector and recipient of citations than a medium for the communication of content&#8221; is “a guide to what research assessment has become,” Oransky said. “He is already missed.”</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently we turned off arXiv&#8217;s legacy search endpoint, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/find"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/find</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was deprecated in 2018 as part of a server migration initiative. Its replacement, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://arxiv.org/search/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was </span><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2018/04/17/new-release-arxiv-search-v0-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to retire the legacy /find endpoint is part of migrating arXiv to the cloud. The legacy endpoint&#8217;s underlying code is no longer in service as part of this move. Although some users may have continued to use the legacy endpoint, the current search endpoint offers an improved, user-friendly interface while retaining the most commonly used functionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full-text search is available from the search box on the arXiv homepage by selecting &#8220;Full text&#8221; from the &#8220;All Fields&#8221; dropdown menu.</span></p>

<p>In its second batch of misconduct findings this year, the organization responsible for allocating basic research funding in China has called out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19UBiLZL5rwKzx9GCGab0zURbmC9OYnE7hTE7pL_Rm9o/edit?usp=sharing">25 researchers</a> for paper mill activity and plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Natural Science Foundation of China, or NSFC, gives more than 20,000 grants annually in disciplines ranging from agriculture to cancer research. The NSFC publishes the reports periodically “in accordance with relevant regulations,” the <a href="https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/publish/portal0/jd/04/info94739.htm">first report</a>, released in April, states. The organization awarded 31.9 billion yuan, or about US$4.5 billion, in project funds in 2023.</p>



<p>The NSFC <a href="https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/publish/portal0/jd/04/info95025.htm">published the results of its investigations </a>on June 13. The reports listed 11 specific papers and 26 grant applications and approvals.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132257"></span>



<p>The misconduct findings were similar to those in the NSFC’s first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/15/national-natural-science-foundation-china-misconduct-investigations/">first batch in April</a>. Offenses included&nbsp; “buying and selling of experimental research data” and “plagiarism, forgery and tampering.” As a result, NSFC barred those researchers from applying for or participating in grants for three or five years, and, in some cases, required grant recipients to pay back funds they’d already received.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven of the studies on the list, coauthored by 14 of the sanctioned researchers, were retracted before the report was released.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email to the NSFC asking whether the organization informed the journals about the misconduct findings bounced back, but correspondence with several of the journals suggests the NSFC did not contact them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/17392/text/">Two</a> of the <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/22781/">papers</a> that haven’t been retracted came from <em>Oncotarget,</em> an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=oncotarget">embattled journal</a>. Elena Kurenova, the scientific integrity editor for the publication<em>,</em> told us the articles were already under investigation before the NSFC findings, but the journal was “not aware of the current NSFC report.” Kurenova told us given the results of their investigation and the report, “the Editorial decision was made to retract these papers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four of the papers listed in the report come from journals published by Dove Press, part of Taylor &amp; Francis: two in <em>Onco Targets and Therapy </em>(and retracted in <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-long-noncoding-rna-linc00525-promotes-the-aggressive-phenot-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OTT">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-long-noncoding-rna-ccdc144nl-as1-promotes-the-oncogenicity--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OTT">2023</a>), one in <em>Cancer Management and Research</em>, which the journal retracted <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-long-non-coding-rna-c1qtnf1-antisense-rna-1-upregulates-hex-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CMAR">in 2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/doxorubicin-loaded-redox-responsive-micelles-based-on-dextran-and-indo-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">one</a> in the <em>International Journal of Nanomedicine</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor-in-chief for the <em>International Journal of Nanomedicine</em>, which has not retracted the paper included in the report, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Robinson, media relations manager from Taylor &amp; Francis, told us the article from <em>International Journal of Nanomedicine</em> was “already under investigation” before the report was released. He also said NSFC didn’t contact the journals about their report.</p>



<p>Two researchers named in the report, Yao Yang and Jinjin Wang, of South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, included a paper they wrote in their grant applications that was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138358662302703X?via%3Dihub">retracted in 2024</a>. NSFC penalized them for “buying and selling papers” and “unauthorized marking of other people’s scientific fund projects,” among other offenses.

<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/21/3803">Another paper by</a> Yang and Wang, published in <em>Water</em>,<em> </em>had those same offenses&nbsp; and had not been retracted when NSFC’s report was released. Jovana Mirkovic, journal relations specialist at MDPI, which publishes <em>Water</em>, told us in an email the journal would be “issuing a retraction notice for this article.” She did not respond to our follow-up email regarding whether the investigation began before our email or whether she was aware of the NSFC report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He Juliang, who listed affiliations with Guangxi Medical University, had two of his projects revoked. The notice says the “allocated funds” were “recovered” from the researcher. Juliang did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wen Zhong, who listed affiliations with Jiangxi University of Science and Technology in Ganzhou, used a retracted paper in the application form, progress report, and final report of a project, according to the NSFC. The report also says he committed “plagiarism, forgery and tampering, use of other people’s signatures without consent, and unauthorized marking of other people’s fund projects.” Zhong did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten of the researchers were sanctioned after they “plagiarized the contents of other people&#8217;s fund project applications,” the report states.</p>
