              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watch-microbial-life-earth">Watch: Recent microbial discoveries are changing our view of life on Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gumdrop with an earring.</p>



<p>That’s what pops to mind when I look at Sebastian Hess’ photos of a kind of plump, violent, single-celled creature he collected from a pond rich in sphagnum moss in southern Germany. The shape-shifting amoebozoan cell, prowling for algal cells to attack, curls its long strand of a flagellum into an earringlike loop. Holding the loop steady, the cell somehow glides. Yet the loop doesn’t flick, lash or wave. “They look basically like tiny flying saucers,” Hess says.</p>





<p>He first collected the creatures, with no species name and a baffling form of locomotion, in 2010 and wondered for years how the locomotion worked. Hess has been seeking and tending such single-celled wonders since he was a teenager with a windowsill microzoo. As a grown-up, now at Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, he specializes in the microscopic group his zoo featured: the protists.</p>



<p>This big, varied group of single cells are among the closest microbial cousins to multicellular life, and they wrap their genetic material inside a cell nucleus just as animals, plants and fungi do. Schoolroom trees of life for much of the 20th century and sometimes afterward often relegated the protist kingdom to some lower branch beneath the glorious crown of mostly multicellular kingdoms. Biologists think a little differently now, and bigger than mere kingdoms.</p>



<p>Today’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">more modern schemes</a> feature at least two vast hoops of microbial creatures, called the domains of Bacteria and Archaea (<em>SN: 7/29/15</em>). A third hoop, the Eukaryota, sweeps together the protists and the formerly proud treetop kingdoms: the animals, plants and fungi. Another sweep may be imminent, as the whole domain of eukaryotes, including the protists and the people who classify them, appear to be a branch of Archaea.</p>



<p>As for the flying saucers, Hess and colleagues worked off and on for almost 10 years to understand how such a cell moves so strangely. It’s a form of locomotion never found before in a living being, Hess says. This toroidal, or “doughnut,” swimming inspired Hess and colleagues in 2019 to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0478-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put the newfound species in its own new genus</a> — <em>Idionectes</em>, roughly meaning “peculiar swimmer.”</p>



<p>More in a bit on how to swim like a doughnut, but the species, <em>Idionectes vortex</em>, makes a fine example of how high-tech biology plus old-fashioned boots-in-mud exploration are creating a rush of discovery for a charismatic group of tiny lives on Earth. These single-celled organisms are far from boring little dots. Plus, they’re adding some unexpected twigs and branches to the evolutionary tree of life.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We live on a non-animal planet</h4>



<p>To pick just a few examples of 2023’s new protists, a species named in June has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head. In this roughly globe-shaped cell discovered in a South American termite’s gut, the top spins steadily around without ripping or self-strangling. Discoverers picked <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a demon-themed name, <em>Daimonympha friedkini</em></a>, inspired by the spinning head of the demonically possessed child in director William Friedkin’s 1973 film <em>The Exorcist</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The recently discovered protist <em>Daimonympha friedkini </em>has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some other new species belong to the odd-looking but ecologically important coccolithophores. This branch as a whole may do as much as 10 percent of the oceans’ photosynthesis, turning sunlight into stuff other creatures eat. Each coccolithophore cell covers itself in what look like tiny hubcaps. Among the distinctive features of the newly named <em>Calciopappus curvus</em> is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1434461023000457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pair of thumblike stubs on some of those hubcaps</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers in China named a notably small species in the <em>Euplotes </em>genus, <em>E. mazeii</em>. <em>Euplotes</em> cells grow several sets of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-023-5506-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skinny projections called cirri</a> that look like stick-drawing legs. Even with no brain or nervous system, the various kinds of <em>Euplotes</em> can move their legs with enough coordination to walk on an underwater surface. Engineers seeking inspiration for microscale robots have been analyzing such gaits.</p>

<p>Even long-known protists have allure as a form of micro­wildlife. Like big cats and polar bears, many of these charismatic microfauna deserve their own nature documentaries. Hess has helped film one of his longtime favorite protists, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>. This mildly pretty teardrop-shaped cell chases prey by shooting out a cartoonishly long swan neck that can stretch more than seven times the organism’s original body length. The neck, with a headlike bump at the end, swerves this way and that lithe as a snake, until a sudden pounce finally snags dinner.</p>





<p>“Stunning” is Hess’ word for protists. “They really behave like entire organisms. But they are just cells.”</p>



<p>Or consider five new species of tiny, voracious cells nicknamed nibblerids. Only about 3 micrometers across in their sickle-shaped hungry form, these protists bite (sort of) their typically larger victims by closing down on them with a special body groove armored with hardened toothlike bits called denticles.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This teardrop-shaped single cell, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>, hunts by shooting out a long necklike projection. The neck can follow fleeing prey until the enlarged end gets a grip.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The nibblerids and their closest known relatives, called nebulids, represent such a distinct and ancient lineage that they deserve their own big branch on the eukaryote family tree, evolutionary biologist Patrick Keeling of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and colleagues reported last year. Keeling speaks passionately about the importance of predators as more than nature-watching fun. “If you took all the lions and cheetahs and killed them all,” he says, “the whole ecosystem would go wacky.” That’s likely the case with protists, too.</p>



<p>Today’s protists are sorted into supergroups, which are branches bigger than the classic eukaryote kingdoms and give a broad and deep view of evolution. The Amorphea supergroup, for example, spans all animals and fungi plus some one-celled relatives including many amoebas. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05511-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new supergroup named for the nibblerids and nebulids, Provora</a>, alludes to “devouring voracious protists,” Keeling and his colleagues wrote.</p>



<p><em>Idionectes</em> too, for all its serene UFO-like travel, is a fierce predator. When it finds algae to feed on, the gliding spaceship becomes an attack amoeba. It dissolves a hole through the algal cell wall but doesn’t feed tiger-style, flesh-ripping from outside the kill. Instead, <em>Idionectes</em> slides through the hole in the wall, decanting itself into the doomed prey cell. Then this hunter devours its prey from the inside.</p>



<p>Watching protists could be terrifying, if they were bigger. Or if humans were smaller.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The microbial environment is totally different</h4>



<p>“We spend so much time trying to imagine alien worlds,” says Keeling. “There’s one right under our noses, more weird than anything we can think of.”</p>



<p>He’s not being theatrical. Consider the way specks of protist bodies experience water, for example. It’s radically different from the way giant lumbering humans and other macroscopic swimmers do. Lone cells are so tiny, the properties of plain water push them down evolutionary paths barely recognizable to us.</p>



<p>Dive into a swimming pool and, “if you’re not kicking, you still go forwards for quite a while until you stop, right?” Keeling says. A single cell, though, is so small that even the viscosity of water means the tiny <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microswimmers-make-splash">swimmer barely glides at all</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/09</em>). If it stops swimming, it just … stops. “It’s more like you’re in corn syrup,” Keeling says.</p>



<p>Besides slowing locomotion to a creep, the Syrup World no longer allows for certain swimming strokes. A scallop normally jets around by opening its shell slowly and closing it fast. But if magically miniaturized, the scallop would be stuck in place, flapping, physicists have predicted. It would make progress by shutting its shell but unmake that progress opening it again.</p>



<p>On the upside, though, motions that are useless for full-size people or scallops could propel a tiny swimmer. In 1952, physicist Geoffrey Ingram Taylor theorized that a microbial swimmer shaped like a doughnut <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1951.0218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could move itself</a> with a sort of inward rotation. (The idea gets credited to a charming talk in 1976 by U.S.&nbsp;Nobel laureate and physicist Edward Mills Purcell, but Taylor came before Purcell.)</p>



<p>That rotation is basically how the loop <em>Idionectes</em> cell turned out to swim, Hess and colleagues announced nearly 70 years after Taylor’s suggestion. The cell’s long, stringy flagellum curls into the scrawniest, skinniest thing ever likely to be described as a doughnut. It’s far more hole than dough, but it still approximates Taylor’s notion.</p>



<p>In a diagram developed by Taylor, the sides of a doughnut rise through the hole, over the rim and wrap around the other side for another slide into the middle. At first, Hess could tell that his gumdrop cell clearly spun, but looking at the flagellum’s skimpy doughnut-shape with plain microscopy, “you cannot see any movement,” he says. But when he and colleagues made underwater blizzards of latex microparticles in syrupy fluid (a technique that gave the researchers a breakthrough eight years into their efforts), Hess saw telltale particle movements showing the flagellum was rotating.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How one protist spins and swims</h4>



<p>The protist <em>Idionectes vortex</em> was discovered in 2010, but only recently did scientists show that it moves via toroidal swimming. Its flagellum loops like a doughnut. The flagellum and the dome-shaped part both rotate (purple arrows).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How protists are discovered</h4>



<p>Vittorio Boscaro, in Keeling’s lab at the University of British Columbia, has another rotation mystery. “We have no idea why they’re doing this,” he says. We’re on a video call, and he’s sharing his screen to show the new protist species with a rotating head, <em>D. friedkini</em>. In the ghostly grays of light microscopy video, a chunky cell swims as its top, like a large knobby polar ice cap, steadily rotates. It’s mesmerizing.</p>



<p>The 2023 paper announcing the discovery of <em>D. friedkini </em>calls rotating wheel structures “famously rare” in biology. Bacteria can freely spin their flagella without twisting themselves into pieces, but cells with more built-in structures rarely manage.</p>



<p>Still, this wasn’t the first spin-top among complex cells. Analyzing genetic material, researchers worked out a probable family tree of near and far relatives. Oddly, this beast doesn’t seem that closely related to another species with a rotating head informally called rubberneckia, which researchers have sporadically written about since 1974. To study protists is to live in weirdness.</p>



<p>That the new species came from a termite gut was no big deal, Boscaro gently tells me, because protistologists have been gutting termites in search of new species of rotating protists (rubberneckia and <em>D. friedkini</em> both belong to a group called Parabasalia) for more than a century.</p>



<p>Protists are everywhere. Kiran More, then an undergraduate at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, picked up a bunch when he added a little bit of species prospecting to a family trip in 2016.</p>



<p>As summer waned before More’s senior year, his family went driving through the eastern countryside of Nova Scotia. They stopped at a village on Cape Breton Island to admire a replica of the beloved 1920s schooner pictured on the Canadian dime, and More scooped up some shore sand. It took only a matter of minutes; he had packed a set of sampling tubes just in case. “I just carried it from hotel room to hotel room and stuck it in the minifridge, when there was a minifridge,” he says.</p>



<p>When he returned to school, the sludge became part of his undergraduate project looking for unknown species of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-microbes-sucked-some-ancient-life-dry">marine amoebas called vampyrellids</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/15</em>). The name may conjure nightmares, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeu.12698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even two of More’s ferocious finds</a> look less jaw-and-claw and more bed-and-breakfast. They resemble a fried egg.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="650" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3.jpg" alt="An image protist named Placopus melkoniani." class="wp-image-3132020" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3-401x383.jpg 401w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3-471x450.jpg 471w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3-195x186.jpg 195w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_protist_inline-3-607x580.jpg 607w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132020">A recently discovered protist named <em>Placopus melkoniani</em> looks like a fried egg.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132020">K. MORE <em>ET AL</em>/<em>J. OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY</em> 2018</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Though vampyrellid body plans vary, in this case, the egg’s “white” is the structure that breaks through the outer covering of prey to harvest the nutritious insides. Watching a small algal cell caught by the vampyrellid reveals the predator pressing against the algal cell until the victim stops moving, draining the dying cell’s innards in five to 10 minutes.</p>



<p>More’s single sample of collected sand ended up providing at least seven visibly different kinds of vampyrellid amoebas. <em>Placopus melkoniani</em> and <em>P. pusillus</em>, fried-egg vampyrellids now named as new species, hunt by rolling forward. Their outer membranes move “like a conveyor belt,” More says, or the treads on a tank. “You can see all their cell contents inside also rotating as the outer membrane rotates, which is almost beautiful,” he says.</p>



<p>In 2021, that same vacation sample delivered a third new species. More, by then a graduate student in systematics and evolution at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and colleagues named that new species <em>Sericomyxa perlucida</em>, meaning “transparent silken slime.” It looks like a road-killed badminton shuttlecock but with exquisitely delicate tufts. And it was <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just a new species in a new genus</a> but also represented a whole new family.</p>



<p>Any ornithologist or mammalogist would have been thrilled with the results. But in the giddy frontier of protist discovery, “I was disappointed,” More says. “I was so determined that I was going to find an environmental lineage where no one had seen anything before.”</p>



<p>When Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, the 18th century founder of Western science’s biological naming system, studied single-celled organisms, he was limited to looking. He named relatively few single-celled organisms and put most in a genus he eventually called <em>Chaos</em>. Today’s biologists have many more high-tech tools at their disposal, but the evolution of life on Earth still looks chaotic. One cell of a type of protist called a cryptomonad has seven separate sets of genes, according to research reported this year. Three of the extra sets come from little organs descended from long-ago free-living cells, two from symbiotic bacteria that had apparently become essential and another from a virus hitchhiking in one of the bacteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Microbes dominate Earth</h4>



<p>“We’re an aberration,” says Maureen O’Malley, a philosopher of microbiology at the University of Sydney, as one multicellular earthling talking to another. In the modern view of life, single-celled microbes — protists among them — dominate the planet. Big multicellular life-forms now look like the rare, outlier freaks. A 2018 comparison estimates that Earth’s protists account for twice the gigatons of carbon as all the animals put together. Add in other microbes, and together they hold 40 times the biomass.</p>

<p>Earth was entirely a microbe’s world for some 2.5 billion years or more, the majority of life’s history, O’Malley points out. We big multicellulars evolved on the backs of microbe innovations. Just a few examples: The oxygenated atmosphere came from cyanobacteria photosynthesizing 2.7 billion years ago. Even today an estimated half of the oxygen we breathe comes from microbial sources, not from plants. And plants’ ability to generate oxygen came from engulfing the microbial technology we know as chloroplasts.</p>



<p>Termites “eat” wood thanks to the protists packed into their guts. Tomato plants grow better with more of the predatory protists in the soil around their roots. Bobtail squid get the glow in their light organs from engulfed bacteria. Tsetse flies can’t sustain milk-feeding for their bizarre live-birthed young without specialized live-in bacteria to provide B vitamins. The list goes on and on for influential microbes. They shaped the world and keep us alive in it.</p>



<p>O’Malley sums up microbes as “the dominant life-forms not only in today’s world, but also in all past eras of the living Earth.” For bird watchers, wildflower lovers and nature enthusiasts of all stripes, truly seeing these invisibly small creatures for the first time can be like realizing dark matter exists. And not only that it exists, but that it makes up so much more of the universe than the supposed ordinary stuff.</p>



<p>New discoveries of protists and other microbial species and their ways of living are creating a very different view and appreciation for life in all its forms. With a few quirky exceptions — including us — to be an earthling is to be microscopic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/10/06/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-theory/">Interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (theory)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) is a form of single-shot learning observed in hippocampal place cells in mice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan3846">2017</a>). This finding is both interesting and inspiring for computational neuroscience for several reasons. In the first place, synaptic plasticity is the basis for learning, and any neuronal theory on the organizing principles of the brain must consider synaptic plasticity. In addition, previous findings on plasticity were usually based on artificial stimulation protocols in slices (LTP, LTD, STDP), often requiring unphysiological stimulation intensities, careful selection of stimulation protocols and many repetitions, while BTSP is a single-shot learning paradigm. Here are a some quite recent interesting theory papers on BTSP, complementing a previous blog post about <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">experimental studies</a> on BTSP:</p>



<p><strong>Nonlinear slow-timescale mechanisms in synaptic plasticity</strong></p>



<p>This review by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07801">O’Donnell (2023)</a> nicely covers both experimental results and modeling work about the potential mechanisms of synaptic plasticity on a slow timescale. O&#8217;Donnell attempts to reconcile seeming discrepancies between experimental results on LTP from a theory perspective, and he stresses the importance of non-linearities to induce plasticity specifically during bursts but not regular spiking.  A quick and interesting read!</p>



<p>One aspect I found particularly interesting is when he points out the relevance of long timescales and non-linear processes for classic slice LTP/LTD or STDP protocols (pages 2-3 of the PDF). Typically, one forgets about the long timescale and only focuses e.g. on the millisecond timing difference for the STDP protocol.</p>



<p><strong>How BTSP affects subthreshold representations of place</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> perform some really nice experiments and analyses to show that BTSP does not only induce new place fields but can alter existing synaptic weights in both ways, potentiation and depression.</p>



<p>If you read the abstract of the Milstein et al. study and have no idea what this is about: worry not, the rest of the paper is much easier to digest and actually super interesting. After reading the abstract myself, I was rather confused. One of the problems is that the &#8220;bidirectional plasticity&#8221; mentioned in the title can be misread as plasticity among bidirectionally connected cell pairs, while here the &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; only refers to &#8220;depression&#8221; (down-direction) and &#8220;potentiation&#8221; (up-direction) of synpases.</p>



<p>Two things I like in particular about this paper: <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73046#fig3">Fig. 3L</a>, which summarizes the main finding in a very nice visualization. And the experiments reported in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73046#fig4">Fig. 4A-K</a>, where the authors try to disentangle the contributions of cellular depolarizations vs. initial synaptic weights for plasticity &#8211; a beautiful perturbation experiment.</p>



<p>P.S. This is not exactly a very &#8220;recent&#8221; paper, but I found it useful as context to better understand the subsequent paper by Moldwin et al. (2023).</p>



<p><strong>A calcium level-based, general framework for plasticity</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548837">Moldwin et al. (2023)</a> describe a framework for synaptic plasticity focused on calcium levels. It is based on the well-established finding that (a) synaptic depression occurs for low calcium levels and (b) synaptic potentiation occurs for high calcium levels, while (c) synapses remain approximately stable for the lowest (baseline) calcium levels. With their modeling work, the authors extend on existing models and make them more flexible and more easily parameter-adjustable.</p>



<p>In general, I think it is interesting to generate such a more general and flexible framework. At some points, however, I had the feeling that adding more model features to fit all use cases does not necessarily make the model better (more powerful yes, but not always more useful). For example, the authors write that some experimental edge cases were “incorporated into [their model] by adding additional thresholds into the step function”. Adding parameters to account for special cases does not seem the most elegant way if this additional complexity does not make any further predictions about model behavior. Despite these concerns, however, I believe that their general model based on calcium as a single actor is interesting, and their attempt to apply the model to diverse plasticity protocols is useful. It also helps to understand which assumptions are necessary to make the calcium-based plasticity model work for a particular experiment.</p>



<p>In the title, the authors claim that this framework could also be used to describe BTSP. Their take on BTSP is similar to the one described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> (see above).  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548837">Moldwin et al. (2023)</a> assume that there is a summation of synaptic calcium induced by pre-synaptic stimulation and calcium induced by the plateau potential. The summed calcium signal would then induce LTP or LTD at this synapse. The main difference compared to <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> is therefore the idea that both slow signals, the eligibility trace and the instructive signal, are encoded in the local calcium concentration; apart from that, the mathematical shape of their model seems to be pretty similar compared to <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> as far as I can judge.</p>



<p>The main problem of this application to BTSP is the decay time of calcium at synaptic locations. The authors make the following assumption: “The synaptic calcium decayed with a time constant of ~2 seconds”. This seems really unrealistic &#8211; calcium levels after synaptic activation typically decay faster by an order of magnitude. Most experimentalists would assume that this long timescale is taken care of by a slow turnover of more stable mediators like CaMKII (for potentiation) or Calcineurin (for depression); see also the review by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07801">O&#8217;Donnell (2023)</a>. Overall, I have the impression that this framework is a nice and generalizable model for LTP, LTD and STPD, but maybe less so for BTSP. It is unclear to me why they advertise their model to cover BTSP so prominently in the title – this aspect may not represent the best part of their work.</p>



<p><strong>A review on normative models on synaptic plasticity</strong></p>



<p>In their review paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.04988">Bredenberg and Savin (2023)</a> discuss the criteria that should be used to judge normative models on synaptic plasticity. What do they mean with “normative models”? The authors nicely describe a very clear distinction between phenomenological and mechanistic models on the one side, which use fitting or equations to describe experimental observations; and normative models on the other side, which try to understand the importance of the modeled process for the organism. These normative models therefore ask: how should synaptic plasticity be like in order to serve the organism well? That’s an interesting perspective, not driven bottom-up by experimental observations but top-down from “desiderata”, as the title of this review indicates.</p>



<p>The review is interesting and establishes &#8211; not surprisingly given its focus on the practical usefulness of plasticity models &#8211; many connections to deep learning-based approaches. I was, however, slightly disappointed by the apparent lack of discussion of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). For example, they describe how to choose an objective function for synaptic plasticity to improve performance and how to linearize it for small weight changes, which I found a very interesting point of view. It would be instructive to investigate BTSP and single-shot learning in such a model. In particular, it seems to me that BTSP &#8211; due to its single-shot learning behavior &#8211; cannot be a learning rule based on small and linear weight changes. It would therefore be interesting to describe BTSP in a normative model and, for example, to investigate how a loss function can be used to derive or describe BTSP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/non-western-art-design-alternate-math">Non-Western art and design can reveal alternate ways of thinking about math</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Help me and let me help you.” Or in Ghana’s Twi language: “Boa me na me mmoa wo.”</p>



<p>The aphorism signifies cooperation and interdependence. And like many Twi expressions, it can be communicated with a symbol, or adinkra. This adinkra has two triangular halves that are almost, but not quite, symmetrical. One triangle has a circle sitting atop it and is missing a square from its interior, while the other triangle has a square attached to it and is missing a circle. Each half completes the other.</p>





<p>The symbol intrigues ethno-computing expert Ron Eglash. “There is no math concept in Europe for ‘complete me,’” says Eglash, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>



<p>Contemporary math has mostly Western origins, so ideas from non-Western cultures are often missing from the field, say Eglash and others who study ethno-mathematics, or the relationship between math and culture.</p>



<p>“It is useful to think of mathematics as a language,” says physicist Richard Taylor of the University of Oregon in Eugene. Some words and concepts will overlap across cultures but look different, while others will remain unique.</p>



<p>Efforts to identify those convergent and divergent math concepts — and add them to school curricula — can make math more culturally relevant, researchers say. Such research can also expand mathematical knowledge.</p>



<p>One way to detect math languages is through a given culture’s art, architecture and design. Eglash and his wife, graphic designer Audrey Bennett, have spent years teasing out the math hidden in these artefacts. That work has resulted in math models for cornrows, Native American bead work, henna designs, adinkras and others.</p>

The Atoma Ntosa, or linked hearts, adinkra (right) uses rotational symmetry to communicate that in any relationship, all partners should play their part.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131843">adinkra.org</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time, those models have transformed into <a href="https://csdt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free online coding tools</a>. Users can learn about cultural concepts and math principles and then use that knowledge to generate their own designs, says Bennett, also of the University of Michigan.</p>



<p>The tools can increase math scores among students <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-technology-math-race-ethnicity-gender-diversity-gap">not traditionally represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields</a>, such as minority students in the United States or students in the Global South, Eglash’s research suggests (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>). One study for example, showed that the adinkra model can help middle school students in Ghana understand logarithmic spirals.</p>



<p>Unlike linear spirals, where the space between each spiral revolution stays the same, log spirals grow as they extend outward. Snail shells follow this pattern. Many adinkra curves also derive from nature, such as those depicting a ram’s horns, chicken’s foot, bird’s neck and even a human fist. Ghanian artisans alter the tightness or looseness of a spiral to change the look of their adinkra designs. Students using the adinkra computing software can likewise change coil “strength” in their own designs.</p>



<p>In Eglash’s Ghana study, nine students in one class used the adinkra model to learn about log spirals while 10 students in another class learned the concept through conventional models. On a test of the material, the adinkra students <a href="https://hipatiapress.com/hpjournals/index.php/remie/article/view/1399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored higher</a>, with an average test score of 45 percent, than the other students, who scored 14 percent on average, Eglash and colleagues reported in 2015 in the <em>Multidisciplinary Journal of Education Research.</em></p>





<p>The experiment needs scaling up, but the team’s casual observations were striking. Students in the control group typically left immediately once class ended, while students in the adinkra group often stayed late to work on their computational designs.</p>



<p>Mavis Okyere, a math education researcher at the Catholic University of Ghana in Sunyani, has observed a similar phenomenon among middle and high school students in the Kumasi metro area who were learning about proportion, symmetry and other basic math concepts.</p>



<p>For instance, Ghanian students typically learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forms-symmetry">rotational symmetry</a> — the idea that a shape can maintain its form as it spins in space — by rotating triangles or squares (<em>SN: 4/12/07</em>). Okyere developed a curriculum that taught the concept through adinkras, such as <em>Akoma Ntoasa, </em>or “joining of the hearts.” This adinkra, a square connected to semicircles via four lines, can rotate 90 degrees in any direction and look the same.</p>



<p>Teaching math with adinkras proved immensely popular. The class was optional to join and initially only a handful of students showed up, Okyere says. “By the end of the fourth lesson, the class was full.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Math education should give students both a window to a new world and a mirror reflecting their own world, says Rochelle Guttiérez, a mathematics education researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was not involved in any of the research. “Too many times in math classrooms, people just look out and see lots of windows. They never get mirrors.” These tools provide that mirror, she says.</p>



<p>Besides adding cultural relevance to established concepts, learning new math languages has the potential to unearth previously unidentified patterns. That’s the case for the “complete me” adinkra. Eglash refers to this almost symmetry as “mutuality.”</p>



<p>Such discoveries can help students think through the math process from the ground up. Eglash’s thoughts on mutuality inspired seven U.S. geometry professors to develop a lesson around helping students define the concept. Students <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2021/05/06/best-laid-co-plans-for-a-lesson-on-creating-a-mathematical-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively debated key theoretical questions</a>, the professors wrote in a 2021 blog post for the American Mathematical Society. One student wondered if an exchange could be considered mutual if the corresponding shapes were of unequal size.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to the student, that query captured the adinkra’s true significance, which Okyere, a native Twi speaker, describes as such: “We need each other, and we help each other in various ways even though … they are not the same. But I need you, and you also need me.”</p>



<p>Finding these sorts of links between math and cultural beliefs is at the root of ethno-mathematics, Eglash says. “There is a relationship between the geometric meaning and the social meaning.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vela-exploded-star-highest-energy-pulsar">Vela’s exploded star is the highest-energy pulsar ever seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sweeping beams of cosmic lighthouses called pulsars are much more energetic than previously thought, calling into question the bulbs that power them.</p>



<p>A new analysis, from the High Energy Stereoscopic System array in Namibia, reveals a pulsar that radiates at 20 trillion electron volts —&nbsp;making it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02052-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most energetic pulsar ever seen</a>. The finding, described October 5 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>, is challenging scientists’ understanding of how pulsars can emit such extreme radiation.</p>



<p>The observation is “spectacular,” says Hayk Hakobyan, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not part of the study. “This is basically a stress test for our theories.”</p>





<p>Pulsars are the dense remnants of exploded stars, emitting beams of light as they twirl up to hundreds of times a second. Pulsars <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-pulsars-burst-scene">were first discovered in the late 1960s</a>, from a throb of radio waves so consistent that some suggested it was an alien broadcast (<em>SN: 3/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>As a pulsar rotates, its massive magnetic field rips charged particles from the surface, ejecting them along magnetic field lines and spitting radiation out the pulsar’s poles. Over the decades, scientists have found pulsars that beam radiation at higher energies, topping off at about a trillion electron volts, as observed in the <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/01/aa26853-15/aa26853-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crab pulsar in 2016</a>.</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists analyzed 80 hours of data from the Namibian array, which looks for a wake of light given off when high-energy light emitted elsewhere in the universe crashes into molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. The researchers identified 78 super-energetic particles of light that they traced to a pulsar about 1,000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Vela. That light, the team determined, had at least 20 times higher energy than the Crab pulsar observation.</p>



<p>The team first spotted hints of the mighty radiation a few years ago and struggled to interpret the data. “This discovery was so unexpected …&nbsp;that it somehow was difficult to understand,” says Arache Djannati-Ataï, an astrophysicist at CNRS in Paris, who led the analysis.</p>



<p>To reach such high energies, the light is probably boosted by collisions with other speedy, energetic particles such as electrons. But how it becomes so energetic is still up for debate.</p>



<p>The new finding lends support to the growing idea that, thousands of kilometers from a pulsar’s surface, its magnetic field lines can collide and snap, launching particles to extreme speeds in a process called magnetic reconnection. But the observed radiation is pushing the limit of how much energy the reconnection process can release, and scientists will have to scramble for new explanations if higher-energy pulsar radiation keeps turning up.</p>



<p>The possibility of extreme pulsar radiation had been looming over theorists, Hakobyan says. “But now, it’s definite. So now, you have to go do something about it.”</p>

<p>Last week, an environmental journal published a paper on the use of renewable energy in cleaning up contaminated land. To read it, you would have to pay 40 euros. But you still wouldn’t know for sure who wrote it.</p>



<p>Ostensibly authored by researchers in China, &#8220;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-29672-6">Revitalizing our earth: unleashing the power of green energy in soil remediation for a sustainable future</a>&#8221; includes the extraneous phrase &#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; at the end of a methods section. For those unfamiliar, &#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; is a button in OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> that prompts the chatbot to rework an unsatisfactory answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did the authors copy-paste the output of ChatGPT and include the button&#8217;s label by mistake?&#8221; wondered <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a professor of computer science at the University of Toulouse, in France, in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83DCF77815DC61C4ED6DCD88847EC4#1">a comment on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>And, he added, &#8220;How come this meaningless wording survived proofreading by the coauthors, editors, referees, copy editors, and typesetters?&#8221;</p>



<span id="more-128009"></span>



<p>The case is the latest example of a growing trend of sloppy, undeclared use of ChatGPT in research. So far, Cabanac, whose work was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02477-w">covered in <em>Nature</em></a> last month, has posted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Regenerate+Response%22+AND+ChatGPT">more than 30 papers</a> on PubPeer that contain those two telltale, free-floating words. And that&#8217;s not including articles that appear in predatory journals, the scientific sleuth told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Computer software has been used for decades to support the authors,&#8221; Cabanac told us. &#8220;Just think about Grammarly or DeepL for people like me. I&#8217;m not a native English speaker, so I go to WordReference, I go sometimes to DeepL. But what I do, I look at the result and I correct the mistakes.&#8221;</p>



<p>ChatGPT and other tools relying on AI systems known as large language models <a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-hallucination-chatbots-chatgpt-falsehoods-ac4672c5b06e6f91050aa46ee731bcf4">tend to make things up</a>. As we reported earlier this year, that freelancing can <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/01/withdrawn-ai-written-preprint-on-millipedes-resurfaces-causing-alarm/">be a problem for researchers</a> looking for help to find references.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes it elaborates things that were not in the head of the researchers,&#8221; Cabanac said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the tipping point to me. When people use the system to generate something that they hadn&#8217;t in mind, like fabricating data, generating some text with references to works they didn&#8217;t even read, this is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to some publishers,&nbsp; chatbots do have legitimate uses when writing papers. The key is to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00191-1">let readers know what was done</a>.</p>



<p>The corresponding author on the environmental paper, Kangyan Li of <a href="https://www.inogenalliance.com/associate/esd-china">ESD China Ltd</a>., did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did a contact person listed on his company&#8217;s website.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the journal <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> in which the article appeared, said the publisher was &#8220;carefully investigating the issue in line with COPE best practice&#8221; but could not share further details at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How the authors, let alone the journal, could have missed the strange phrase is unclear. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s not about the authors, maybe it involves a paper mill,&#8221; Cabanac said, referring to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/">dodgy organizations selling author slots</a> on scientific papers that may contain fabricated data.</p>



<p>He added that he and his frequent collaborator <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a>, another sleuth, have <a href="https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1671646001340227585?s=20">found dozens of suspicious papers</a> in <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. They notified the journal’s editor-in-chief, Philippe Garrigues, a CNRS researcher based in Bordeaux, France, of the problems last year. </p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Garrigues told Cabanac that he had already taken action and that “this is not over.” Garrigues added (translated from the French):&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Believe me, I am well aware of all the problems that can arise in the world of scientific publishing and new ones arise every day. I could write entire books about my experience as an editor of several journals and the cases I encountered. Vigilance and attention must be the rule at all times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Garrigues did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">&#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; is not the only sign of undeclared chatbot involvement Cabanac has seen. An even more egregious example is the phrase &#8220;<a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22As+an+AI+language+model%2C+I%22">As an AI language model, I</a> …,&#8221; which he has found in nine papers until now.</p>



<p>Cabanac worries about how such flagrant sloppiness, arguably the tip of the iceberg, can slip past editorial staff and peer reviewers alike.</p>



<p>&#8220;These are supposed to be the gatekeepers of science – the editors, the reviewers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a computer scientist. I&#8217;m not in the business of these journals. Still, I get the red flag, &#8216;Regenerate response.&#8217; That&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p>

                <p>In a new <em>PLOS ONE</em> study researchers found that participants tended to judge faces appearing against backgrounds featuring houseplants or bookcases as more trustworthy and competent than faces with a living space or a novelty image behind them.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Prior research has demonstrated that first impressions can make a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives; for example, they can influence criminal sentencing decisions or choices of romantic partners. In recent years, a major increase in video conferencing has resulted in many first impressions of others now occurring virtually. Popular video conferencing platforms let users customize their background image. However, few studies have explored how background choice might influence first impressions.</p>

<p><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></p>



<p>Researchers Paddy Ross, Abi Cook, and Meg Thompson at Durham University, UK asked 167 adults to view still images that appeared to have been captured during a videoconference. Each image showed the face of a man or woman, either smiling or with a neutral expression, against a background featuring a living space, a blurred living space, houseplants, a bookcase, a blank wall, or a novelty image of a walrus on an iceberg. Participants reported how competent and trustworthy they perceived each face to be </p>



<p>Statistical analysis showed that participants rated faces against the houseplant and bookcase backgrounds as being more trustworthy and competent than faces with other backgrounds. Faces against a living space or novelty image were rated as the least competent or trustworthy.</p>



<p>Participants tended to perceive happy faces as more trustworthy and competent than neutral faces. They also perceived female faces as more trustworthy and competent overall. However, among female faces, those with the living-space background were perceived as no less trustworthy than those with houseplants or a bookcase, suggesting that the lower trustworthiness associated with the living-space background were primarily driven by male faces.</p>



<p><strong>Further Insights</strong></p>



<p>More research is needed to confirm these findings and examine whether they apply across cultural contexts&mdash;for instance, the image database used in the study primarily featured white individuals. Nonetheless, they suggest that videoconference users concerned with making a good impression, especially men, might smile and choose a background with houseplants or a bookcase.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;This research shows how our Zoom backgrounds can affect the first impressions we make. If you want to come across as trustworthy and competent there are some backgrounds you should use and some you should definitely avoid.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-footprints-new-mexico-ancient-dating">Human footprints in New Mexico really may be surprisingly ancient, new dating shows</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human footprints in White Sands National Park in New Mexico sparked controversy two years ago when scientists found the prints to be surprisingly old, dating to about 22,000 years ago. Now, two other ways of dating the fossilized tracks <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh5007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converge at similar ages as the first estimate</a>, potentially resolving the dispute, researchers report in the Oct. 6 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding adds to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/texas-toolmakers-add-debate-over-who-first-americans-were">mounting evidence</a> that humans arrived in North America thousands of years earlier than previously thought (<em>SN: 7/11/18</em>).</p>





<p>“The answer to how old the footprints really are is critical,” says archaeologist Loren Davis of Oregon State University in Corvallis, who wasn’t involved with the new study. “We need to be able to understand how early we should be looking for archaeological evidence in the Americas.”</p>



<p>In 2021, researchers described <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7586" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 60 footprints</a> embedded in what was once mud alongside an ancient lake in what’s now New Mexico. Radiocarbon dating of an aquatic plant’s seeds in and around the footprints — which span several rock layers — suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">people roamed there for two millennia between roughly 23,000 and 21,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/21</em>). The result added to other evidence pushing back on a long-held theory that the first humans in North America came from Siberia via a land bridge sometime around 16,000 to 14,000 years ago.</p>



<p>But some scientists noted that the aquatic plants used to date the footprints could have absorbed ancient carbon in groundwater, a well-known phenomenon. “There’s a potential then for the plant to give exaggerated perspectives on its age,” says Davis, who cowrote a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critique</a> of the 2021 paper.</p>



<p>The criticism wasn’t surprising, says geologist Jeff Pigati of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center in Denver. “We knew from the very beginning that we were going to have to independently evaluate the ages with different dating techniques.”</p>



<p>To add to their past work, Pigati and colleagues radiocarbon-dated pollen stuck in the same layers as some of the footprints. The pollen came from land plants, primarily pine, spruce and fir trees, avoiding the groundwater carbon issue. The researchers also collected quartz grains above the lowest footprints and used a dating method that estimates how long the quartz had been buried.</p>



<p>The pollen yielded an age range of roughly 23,400 to 22,600 years old, and the quartz gave an age minimum of about 21,500 years old. Both results echo the previous age estimate.</p>



<p>“This triumvirate is really, really robust and difficult to argue against because they’re just fundamentally different approaches for dating,” Pigati says.</p>

<p>Still, Davis wants the researchers to find quartz ages from more rock layers with footprints. If completed, he says, “we would very likely have a resolution.”</p>



<p>But the authors say many of the other layers are too thin for sampling. Collecting a sediment sample there would mix multiple layers of different silts, sands and clays, which would complicate results.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Despite possible errors in the individual dating methods, “the data overall from the [new] study strongly indicate human presence in the Americas” around 22,000 years ago, Bente Philippsen, a physicist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, wrote in a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk3075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentary</a> in the same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>One thing is certain: There’s still plenty to uncover about the footprints, says coauthor Kathleen Springer, a geologist also at USGS’s Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dormant-hiv-human-body-immune-system">‘Dormant’ HIV has ongoing skirmishes with the body’s immune system</a></h4>

              
                <p>For two decades, the dominant idea in HIV research has been that antiretroviral therapy effectively wipes out active viruses that cause devastating infections but leaves behind a reservoir of infected cells seemingly invisible to the immune system — until treatment is stopped. Then the virus comes roaring back.</p>



<p>Now two new studies reveal that the virus continues to put the immune system through a workout. Some infected cells <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00331-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003311%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">churn out bits of viral RNA and protein</a> that <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00337-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003372%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elicit an immune response</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 13 <em>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</em>.</p>





<p>While not infectious, those damaged viral particles appear to weaken the immune system. The discovery provides a possible explanation for what allows the virus to reemerge with such vigor when people stop taking antiretroviral drugs.</p>



<p>The two new papers “cement — or should cement — that paradigm shift,” says immunologist R. Brad Jones of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who coauthored an <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00338-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003384%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accompanying perspective</a> in the same journal. Notes Steven Deeks, an HIV expert at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine: “No one actively questioned the presence of an active reservoir, but here [the researchers] find evidence that it might in fact matter.”</p>



<p>The studies are sobering news in the larger effort to cure HIV because the results show that the immune system is seeing but failing to successfully respond to the viral proteins, even when the virus’s replication is stopped with medication. It makes “our job much harder,” says immunologist Lydie Trautmann of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in Bethesda, Md. But it also offers a glimmer of hope: The new findings suggest a path toward figuring out how to make the immune response to HIV more effective, she says.</p>



<p>Both studies took blood cells from people on HIV antiretroviral therapy and looked for evidence of viral activity. Virologist Mathieu Dubé and colleagues used fluorescent RNA probes to look for viral genes in immune cells called helper T cells, a primary target for the virus. “We run 10 million cells, and the machine will detect which one is positive for HIV and which one is negative,” says Dubé, of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center. The researchers then analyzed the infected cells, searching for viral RNA and protein production.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="420" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092523_JC_dormant-HIV_inline.jpg" alt="An image of two blue colored cells with green and magenta spots in the middle." class="wp-image-3131880" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092523_JC_dormant-HIV_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092523_JC_dormant-HIV_inline-620x383.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092523_JC_dormant-HIV_inline-301x186.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131880">Green and magenta spots reveal the presence of HIV RNA inside these cells’ nuclei. New research shows that infected cells in people taking antiretroviral medications still produce bits of virus that harm the immune system response to the virus.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131880">Aurélie Cleret-Buhot and Mathieu Dubé/CRCHUM</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One surprise, Dubé says, was the large number of cells that were producing viral proteins. “We expected to see some spontaneous expression in a couple of cells, but not in so many.” The cells weren’t actually making new intact and infectious viruses; instead “most of what we found was defective — what we call junk,” he says. Another surprise was that even T cells that contained defective HIV genes, such as those with big chunks of DNA missing, were still able to produce viral proteins.</p>



<p>The key finding is that these junky viral proteins are a big biological problem. “Even though they are defective and do not trigger infection, they can still drive immune responses,” Dubé explains. And not in a good way.</p>



<p>In a healthy immune system, certain T cells would respond to the viral proteins by turning into specialized killer T cells capable of pouncing on and eradicating any HIV-infected cells. But in people with HIV, the immune cells fail to become potent killers, Trautmann’s team’s research shows.</p>



<p>Her interpretation: There are enough viral bits floating around to keep the immune system running ragged. Immune cells that should lead the attack on the virus are being asked to run marathon after marathon without ever stopping, she says. “They can’t keep up.”</p>



<p>The new results do suggest two possible strategies for better treating people infected with HIV. One is redoubling efforts to dramatically shrink the reservoir of infected cells, which could reduce the production of the problematic viral particles. The other is to figure out ways to reinvigorate T cells, perhaps by applying lessons from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-prod-patient-immune-system-fight-cancer-wins-nobel-prize">successes in boosting the immune response to cancer</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/18</em>). If the T cells are more capable, then the bits of viral protein floating around could have a vaccinelike effect, keeping the immune system primed to control any new viral production more effectively, says Deeks, who was not involved in the research.</p>





<p>But both strategies are challenging. “We’ve come a long way, but the problem we have left is a tough one,” says Jones.</p>

<p>A paper that found smoking rates in the United States fell faster than expected as more people started using e-cigarettes has been retracted over the objections of its authors, who have filed a complaint with the journal’s publisher. </p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">reported in July</a>, <em>BMC Public Health</em> informed the authors of “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>” that the editors had decided to retract the article after receiving a critical letter. We reported:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the retracted paper are employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we published our story about the pending retraction, 23 researchers wrote a <a href="https://clivebates.com/documents/ExpertLetterFoxonRetractionAugust2023.pdf">letter</a> to the journal expressing concern about the decision. They wrote: </p>



<span id="more-128004"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors appear to have addressed the various concerns raised in their responses to the prepublication peer reviews and their sensitivity analysis, which shows that the findings are robust under a range of initial assumptions.</p>



<p>We are aware of the authors’ role as consultants for Juul Labs Inc., not least because it has been transparently disclosed by the authors throughout the editorial review process. The reported conflicts justify due skepticism and scrutiny. They do not justify unfair or unequal treatment. The proper way to respond is through the open science concept of <em>replication</em> to confirm, refute, or challenge the findings using the same publicly available datasets.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice does not refer to any conflict of interest, but stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers raised concerns around the methodology. A post-publication review highlighted concerns about the assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data; this assumption is not fully supported by the sensitivity analyses performed by the authors. Therefore, the Editors have lost confidence in the results reported by the article. None of the authors agree to this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the paper “believe that a retraction is not warranted, and we stand by our results,” they said in a statement shared by Floe Foxon, a data analyst at Pinney Associates and the corresponding author of the article. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe the process was wrong, and their interpretation of the data and science is demonstrably wrong. Consistent with open science principles, we believe the journal should have published the Letter it received and our response. Since the journal has not done so, we invite readers and interested parties to read the article and subsequent correspondence with the journal, which we have made available in full on OSF at <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correspondence the authors posted contains their detailed refutations of the concerns mentioned in the retraction notice, and conviction that the decision “is based on fundamental misconceptions regarding basic elements of our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also sent a formal complaint about the “process followed, and scientific judgment” of the journal’s editors to SpringerNature, its publisher, on September 22, and said they have not received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaint, available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BMC-Public-Health-complaint-letter.pdf">here</a>, argued the authors addressed the concerns raised about the paper during the peer review process and in post-publication correspondence with the journal editors, and that the retraction was “inappropriate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than a retraction, the authors said that the journal should publish the original complaint letter it received, as well as the subsequent assessment by an editorial board member and the authors’ reply, “so that interested readers can decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By retracting the paper, the journal denies readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A SpringerNature spokesperson confirmed receipt of the complaint and said the publisher was “currently in the process of providing a detailed response.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Although the journal followed COPE guidelines throughout the retraction and the editors were fully transparent with the authors during the investigation, we hope this response will provide further clarity on the process undertaken.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hippos-ferocious-fighters-teeth">Hippos might be ferocious fighters, but their big teeth make them terrible chewers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippos are horrible at chewing, and their giant tusks and front teeth are to blame.</p>



<p>These intimidating dental features are used by hippos, in part, to protect themselves and their territory. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the gnarly teeth interlock</a> or hinder jaw movements, preventing hippos from efficiently chewing with the side-to-side grinding technique that other herbivores use, researchers report October 4 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plant-eating mammals typically use the broad teeth near the sides of their mouths to grind and shred fibrous vegetation before swallowing it. Since their digestion process barely reduces food particle size, you can gauge chewing efficiency by looking at their feces.</p>





<p>In 2009, veterinarian Marcus Clauss of the University of Zurich and his colleagues compared the sizes of fecal particles across nearly 200 mammal species. They found that hippos were the least effective chewers among herbivores.&nbsp;Years later, he and his colleague Annika Avedik wondered whether hippos’ enormous front teeth were the cause of their meager munching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some herbivores, such as deer and cattle, have lost some of their front incisors during evolution, possibly because they impeded chewing. African rhinos have lost theirs entirely. “Hippos are a case example of a taxon that did not lose them,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>The researchers <a href="https://youtu.be/HMSJX8CatEY?si=gNZrGuCMBsPkwGaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nFa6TyQYZdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> of common (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) and pygmy hippopotamuses (<em>Choeropsis liberiensis</em>) eating, closely tracking how the teeth interacted as the jaws moved. The team also measured physical features of 86 common hippo and 21 pygmy hippo skulls in museum collections, including the spacing and arrangement of the teeth, and tested the side-to-side jaw range of these skulls and measured places where the teeth wore on each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clauss had originally thought that common hippos’ huge tusks, which are modified canine teeth, would be what stopped the animals from proper side-to-side chewing. “Boy, was I wrong,” he says.</p>



<p>Instead, the team found that common hippos’ upper and lower sets of long, spearlike incisors cross and interlock as the lower jaw closes, restricting the back teeth to up-and-down mashing.&nbsp;The herbivores still try some side-to-side movement of the jaw, Clauss says, evidenced by wear marks on the sides of the incisors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a hippo skull on a black background." class="wp-image-3132111" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132111">Skulls of common hippos (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) like this one showed researchers that the top and bottom incisors interlocked during chewing, keeping the jaw from moving side to side.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132111">Michelle Aimée Oesch (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC-BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pygmy hippos’ incisors don’t interlock, but their tusks bump up against the snout, allowing only a limited amount of side sliding. Wear patterns show that the incisors glide past each other when chewing.</p>



<p>Because pygmy hippos show some side-to-side jaw movement when chewing, it hints that “lateral grinding chewing is something [hippos] once did, and that it got lost along the way,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>Hippos now use their rigid jaws, wide gapes and sharp, sturdy tusks and incisors, in part, to combat other hippos over territory and access to mates, and to defend against predators.&nbsp;But the potential shift to less efficient chewing could have come with consequences. Because hippos can’t mulch food into very small pieces, it takes longer for it to be digested, Clauss says.</p>



<p>“If food has to stay longer in the gut, it means one cannot eat more, quickly. Hence hippos are, among mammalian herbivores, characterized by relatively low food intakes,” he explains.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Their comparatively low food intake may put hippos at a competitive disadvantage against other, more efficiently chewing ruminant herbivores such as antelope. An inability to compete with fully land-dwelling species for sufficient food may keep hippos wedded to the African waterways the semiaquatic animals call home.</p>



<p>The study is “a really good reminder of the complexity of organisms, and that when anatomical parts, such as teeth, are viewed in isolation, they may not explain the whole picture,” says comparative biomechanist Susan Williams of Ohio University in Athens.</p>



<p>Studying fossil hippo ancestors could reveal if, and when, hippos’ side-to-side motion during chewing stopped, rounding out understanding of the animals’ evolutionary story. Juvenile hippos also don’t yet have incisors large enough to interlock, so Clauss is curious to see if these youngsters temporarily use side-to-side chewing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-nanoparticles-bawendi-brus-ekimov">The development of quantum dots wins the 2023 Nobel prize in chemistry</a></h4>

              
                <p>Work on tiny dots that light up TV screens and help doctors see the blood vessels that feed tumors has earned three scientists the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chemist Moungi Bawendi, chemist Louis Brus and physicist Alexei Ekimov split the prize for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 4.</p>

<p>“Quantum dots are a new class of materials, different from molecules,” said Heiner Linke, a member of the Nobel committee. Just adjusting the size of these nanoparticles, roughly a few billionths of a meter across, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-get-second-chance-shine">can change their properties</a> — optical, electric, magnetic, even melting points — thanks to quantum mechanics (<em>SN: 6/29/15</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s also true of color. “If you want to make different colors with molecules, you would choose a new molecule, a new set of atoms” arranged in a different structure, Linke said. But quantum dots of different colors have the exact same arrangement of atoms. The only difference is particle size.</p>





<p>When quantum dots are irradiated by light, electrons within get energized, eventually releasing that energy as fluorescent light. The smaller the dots are, the more they compress the wave function of an electron, increasing its energy so that the dot appears blue. Larger dots appear red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dots of the same size made from different materials may also emit slightly different wavelengths of light, says Jean-Marc Pecourt, a chemist at CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society. Quantum dots are usually made from semiconductor materials, such as graphene, selenite or metal sulfides, Pecourt says. So by adjusting materials or the size of quantum dots, chemists can alter their properties for a wide variety of uses.</p>



<p>The idea that the size of these nanoparticles could alter their properties was predicted nearly a century ago, but at the time it seemed impossible to reproduce that effect in the real world. To do that, researchers would need a perfectly crystalline material, and would need to control the size of the nanomaterial very precisely, sculpting it atom layer by atom layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in the early 1980s, Ekimov and Brus independently showed that it could be done. Ekimov, now at Nanocrystals Technology, Inc., in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., demonstrated this in glass, adding copper chloride to produce tiny crystals and revealing that the color of the glass was linked to the size of those crystals. Brus, of Columbia University, made a similar discovery, but in a different context: He demonstrated the link between size and color for nanoparticles floating freely in a solution <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/creating-crystals-study-quantum-effects">and in gaseous compounds</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/92</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those discoveries triggered intense interest in how to harness these little dots for a variety of applications. But manufacturing them would require being able to control the size of the particles to precise specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade later, Bawendi, of MIT, developed a method to precisely control the speed of the crystals’ growth in a solution, figuring out how to stop them right when they reach a desired size. He did this by first injecting chemical reagents into the solution that instantaneously formed the tiny crystals and then promptly adjusting the temperature of the solution, halting their growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m deeply honored and surprised and shocked by the announcement this morning,” Bawendi said October 4 during an MIT news conference. “I&#8217;m especially honored to share this with Lou Brus, who was my postdoctoral mentor [from] whom I learned so much. I tried to emulate his scholarship and his mentoring style as a professor myself when I came to MIT.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bawendi started working on quantum dots after he met Brus at Nokia Bell Labs, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J. The researchers needed high quality quantum dots to study the physics of the nanoparticles, Bawendi said. “It wasn&#8217;t because I wanted to make the best quantum dots possible for application, it was because we needed to make the best possible quantum dots to study them.” It took years of trial and error to work out the method, he said.</p>



<p>By making it possible to manufacture quantum dots, Bawendi’s method opened up a world of possible uses for the nanoparticles. Quantum dots make it possible to very precisely change the color of LED lights and dramatically improve their efficiency. Dots that glow with fluorescent light, injected into the body and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-light-cancer-cells-mice">attached to immune cells that swarm to cancerous tissues</a>, can help surgeons distinguish even hard-to-see tumors (<em>SN: 8/3/04</em>).&nbsp;The ability to be tuned to absorb different wavelengths of light could also allow the manufacture of customized solar cells that are highly efficient in different light conditions. The dots might also be used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">to build quantum computers</a>, Pecourt says (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biomedical engineer and chemist Warren Chan says the prize is well deserved. “They&#8217;re the ones who built the foundation,” says Chan, of&nbsp;the University of Toronto. “I&#8217;m really happy that the field is getting credit for really changing the world, not just in quantum dots, but in a lot of different areas.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>One of the first applications came in the late 1990s when Chan and colleagues used quantum dots to tag cells in the lab, he says. “The surface modifications that were used for integrating quantum dots for applications were then also adapted for other types of nanoparticles.”</p>



<p>The Nobel committee looks not only at past contributions, but also the effect a discovery may have on the future, Chan says. The ability to tune nanoparticles by changing their size or surface properties could open a wide variety of possibilities that have not yet been explored. Chan and colleagues are now using quantum dots to detect infectious diseases, including HIV, influenza and hepatitis B.</p>



<p>“I was absolutely thrilled to see this,” says Judith Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society. “We have three people recognized who brought this technology from a dream, a hope, a theoretical construct … all the way through synthesis and manufacture.”</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-2023-mrna-vaccine-covid">the development of mRNA vaccines</a> — widely speculated as a candidate for the 2023 chemistry Nobel Prize — received the Nobel in medicine or physiology instead (<em>SN: 10/2/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sometimes chemistry gets a bad rap,” Giordan says. “But here are two magnificent examples of how chemistry has solved problems in the world.”</p>



<p>The three winners will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report">A global report finds amphibians are still in peril. But it’s not all bad news</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 20 years ago, the first global assessment of amphibians found the animals facing widespread declines. Now, a second, updated report shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06578-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many amphibians are still in trouble</a>, but with some silver linings, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“We are realistic and hopeful at the same time,” says Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks extinction risk trends for species around the world.</p>



<p>In particular, the wealth of data in the new report, which includes about 8,000 amphibian species, could help focus conservation efforts for years to come, says Luedtke, who also works from Washington, D.C., for Re:wild, a conservation organization based in Austin, Texas. That’s what happened after the <a href="https://www.iucn-amphibians.org/red-listing/global-amphibian-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Global Amphibian Assessment</a> in 2004, which brought awareness to the amphibian crisis and galvanized researchers to coordinate efforts.</p>





<p>Having two assessments that can be compared is a big deal, experts say. “It’s important not just to have a picture, but actually to have a sequence of pictures … where you can see what’s happening over time,” says conservation ecologist Ana Rodrigues of CNRS in Montpelier, France, who worked on the first assessment but was not involved in the second. “I’m really happy to see this done.”</p>



<p>Here are five big takeaways from the new report.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Amphibians remain more threatened with extinction than any other vertebrate group.</h4>



<p>About 41 percent of amphibian species, which include frogs, toads and salamanders, are threatened with extinction, Luedtke and her colleagues found. That’s more than any other group of vertebrates, beating out sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (27 percent), reptiles (21 percent) and birds (13 percent).</p>



<p>Amphibians held this title in 2004 too, when 39 percent of species were threatened. As part of the 2022 update, researchers also used data to reconstruct the situation in 1980. They found that even in 1980, that number was already high, at 38 percent. Basically, amphibians have been really threatened for a really long time, Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The most common threat that affects amphibians is habitat loss and degradation, with agriculture affecting as many as 77 percent of the studied species. Other threats include climate change and disease, each affecting 29 percent of species. Of course, “these things are never completely isolated,” says Rodrigues, and each threat may increase the likelihood of other threats.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Many of the worst amphibian declines are being caused by climate change now, instead of disease.</h4>



<p>Luedtke and colleagues also wanted to know which threats were most responsible for driving the worst declines. So they looked at a subset of 788 species that, between 1980 and 2022, moved down an <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/#:~:text=It%20divides%20species%20into%20nine,in%20the%20Wild%20and%20Extinct." target="_blank" rel="noopener">IUCN Red List status</a> level — for instance, from vulnerable to endangered. They found that, in 2004, disease was the primary driver behind the drop in conservation status for 58 percent of that species subset. At the time, the fungal pathogen<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-frog-killing-disease-may-not-be-so-new"> chytrid was devastating frog populations</a> around the world (<em>SN: 8/23/02</em>). Climate change, on the other hand, was a significant contributor to declines in only 1 percent of species.</p>



<p>Now, less than 20 years later, climate change is behind a status drop for 39 percent of species. That makes it the most common primary driver of declines across the amphibian group, the researchers found. And still the finding is probably an underestimate, Luedtke says, as studies continue to emerge detailing how climate change–related temperature increases, changes in precipitation, extreme weather events and wildfires impact amphibians.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s very worrying,” Rodrigues says. “We’re at the beginning of climate change.… What’s ahead of us?”</p>

ROJAS-RUNJAIC</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. It’s bad around the world. But amphibians are doing worse in some regions than others.</h4>



<p>Each region faces its own set of threats. The chytrid outbreak, for example, has affected much of the world, but it hit Central and South America especially hard from the 1970s to the 2000s. That likely explains why that region contains the largest proportion of species in the IUCN Red List categories of highest concern, the researchers say. New Guinea and Africa were spared much of the devastation, though the pathogen has recently started to emerge in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>





<p>Across Europe and East Asia, habitat loss is the leading cause of decline, followed by a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fungus-species-found-killing-salamanders">newly emerging fungal pathogen</a> in Europe called <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, this time that affects salamanders (<em>SN: 9/3/13</em>). It hasn’t yet spread to North America, which would be disastrous, Rodrigues says. The continent is home to more than 200 types of salamanders, over a quarter of the world’s salamander species.</p>



<p>For now, North America’s amphibian declines are most associated with climate change, the report found. South and Southeast Asia are seeing an improving trend among their species’ extinction risk, probably due to better management of protected areas.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Scientists know a lot more about amphibians now than they did in 2004.</h4>



<p>One of the assessment’s few bright spots is its sheer amount of data. The update includes more than 2,000 additional species — all newly described since 2004. There was also a decrease in species labeled as “data deficient” by the IUCN, from 23 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent in 2022. By comparison, though, less than 1 percent of bird species are listed as data deficient.</p>



<p>While there’s still a long way to go for amphibians, researchers are thrilled by the new amount of information. “It’s like, wow, all the knowledge!” Rodrigues says. “So that’s absolutely good news.” With more data, she says, conservation efforts can be better focused.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Some amphibian species have improved since 2004.</h4>



<p>The new report didn’t just find declines — 120 species saw their IUCN conservation status improve.</p>



<p>About half of those species recovered unaided. Many of those had suffered declines due to chytrid and are now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-frogs-may-be-bouncing-back-after-killer-chytrid-fungus">bouncing back</a>, possibly as frogs become resistant to the pathogen (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>). It’s a source of hope that “we have these little frogs evolving, in front of our eyes, resistance to chytridiomycosis,” Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The other half improved thanks to conservation efforts, the report found. One of those species is India’s indigo bush frog (<em>Raorchestes indigo</em>), which was classified as critically endangered in 2004. A couple years later, a legal battle led to the end of all mining in the Kudremukh Massif mountain range, and the species’ IUCN status has since improved to vulnerable.</p>



<p>Stories like that are evidence that effective habitat protection can make a noticeable difference, the researchers say, and yet, with most amphibians still facing declines, it’s clear that current efforts are not enough. The assessment’s accompanying State of the World’s Amphibians Report focuses on action steps based on the new findings. Among other things, it identifies 50 target conservation areas around the world — including Jamaica, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and the Central Annamite Highlands in Vietnam — that feature a high density of threatened species.</p>



<p>“Yes, the number of threatened amphibians continues to increase, but our understanding is improving,” Luedtke says. “And because we understand them better, we can act in a more accurate and effective way.”</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from Trust in Medical Research, a </em><a href="https://doi.org/10.26180/23827920.v2"><em>freely available</em></a><em> new book by </em><a href="https://www.monash.edu/alumni/alumni-events/graduation/speaker-profiles/may-2023/professor-warwick-anderson-ao"><em>Warwick P. Anderson</em></a><em>, emeritus professor of physiology and biomedical sciences at Monash University in Victoria, Australia.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It has always been difficult for me to admit that we have a genuine and substantial problem of fraud and rubbish science in medical research. I suspect this is true for most scientists. We want to think of science as being free from half-truths and fake news. We hope that the high moral purpose of medical research will guard against wrongdoing, that it will weigh on our minds so heavily that we all take care to work and publish honestly and competently.</p>



<p>We know that scientists sometimes make unintentional mistakes due to ignorance, but we also know in our hearts that some people are so ambitious that they push the envelope, stretch the truth and take shortcuts. We know, too, that a few others go further and get carried away by the prospects of scientific and financial rewards and so cheat, commit fraud and lie in publications. This is what some humans do in all walks of life.</p>



<p>We know all this, but it is fair to say that we generally do not want to face up to it. Jennifer Byrne at the University of Sydney put it well when <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00439-9">she wrote</a> that we tend to overlook the research fraud issue “because the scientific community has been unwilling to have frank and open discussions about it”:</p>



<span id="more-127991"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Fraud departs from community norms, so scientists do not want to think about it, let alone talk about it … This becomes a vicious cycle: because fraud is not discussed, people don’t learn about it, so they don’t consider it, or they think it’s so rare that it’s unlikely to affect them, and so papers are less likely to come under scrutiny. Thinking and talking about systematic fraud is essential to solving this problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When challenged about the incidence of fraud in medical research, many scientists tend to take defensive positions. We might contend that the usual self-correcting methods of science, replication of experiments and peer review will solve the problem. But we know that peer review is not honed to detect fraud reliably (though it can do), that replication of experiments is something that most of us are not very interested in doing (and it rarely gets supported by funders anyhow) and that a negative result from replication research will struggle to get published. All medical researchers should talk more about research misconduct because it is we who have most at stake: our reputations, the reputation of medical research itself, and our time and resources when we spend months or years on a project based on what turns out to have been fraudulent research.</p>



<p>So, what should we do as scientists to better own the problem and guard medical research? One way, I contend, is for medical research to become a true profession.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Medical research is not a profession, even though it demands a high level of professionalism. Anyone can call themselves a medical researcher. There are no processes that affirm an individual has reached some agreed level of expertise, proficiency and reliability. There is no specific training and no accreditation program. There is no requirement to learn a designated set of skills and knowledge, such as the proper use of statistics, what good research practices are or what the ethical obligations are. There is no equivalent of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and the national- and state-based medical boards. There is no need for registration and demonstration of training. There is not even a set of stated principles that we expect every medical researcher to share.</p>



<p>Other groups of people who train to be expert, whose jobs involve individual responsibilities and can be hazardous to others, have professional bodies that manage accreditation or are accredited by government. Such fields have training and competency entry requirements, and they usually require ongoing training and education. They have formal ways to withdraw recognition and accreditation when their members act in ways that harm their customers or patients and tarnish the reputation of the profession itself. Why should medical research be different to doctors, dentists, physiotherapists and vets? Why don’t we have a professional certification system in medical research that requires achievement and maintenance of competency and ethical standards and could remove accreditation when misconduct is proven?</p>



<p>I have written this chapter with some trepidation. Some of my colleagues fear that any internal criticism of the methods and procedures of medical research will be seized upon by critics, especially politicians, to attack scientists and medical research itself and potentially even take control of funding.</p>



<p>I understand this concern, but the bigger risk in the medium to long term is to not address the problems ourselves. After all, if scientific training teaches us anything, it is how to critically examine everything – methodology, results, applications for funding, proposed publications, PhD theses, seminars and conference presentations – and then to find solutions.</p>



<p>The danger signs are already flashing. Richard Smith, a previous editor of <em>The BMJ</em>, <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/07/05/time-to-assume-that-health-research-is-fraudulent-until-proved-otherwise/">wrote recently</a> about clinical trials: “We have now reached a point where those doing systematic reviews must start by assuming that a study is fraudulent until they can have some evidence to the contrary.” When someone as experienced as Smith makes such a statement, it is past time for us to put our house in order.</p>

                <p>Glimpses of the ultrafast world of electrons are changing scientists’ vision of the inner workings of atoms and molecules. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physics goes to three physicists who illuminated this realm with ultrashort pulses of light, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 3.</p>



<p>Physicists Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier will split the 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million) prize, awarded &#8220;for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within atoms and molecules, electrons zip around at extreme speeds. Capturing their to-and-fro is possible only with pulses of light that are extremely short. It’s akin to a camera flash that lasts mere attoseconds, or billionths of a billionth of a second.</p>



<p>Humans have long strived to measure processes with increasing precision, says Peter Armitage, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University. “With the advent of lasers, the timescales that you could measure became shorter and shorter [because] you&#8217;re doing it with ultrafast light pulses.”</p>





<p>Over decades, researchers have honed the ability to create such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pursuit-briefest-beat">near-instantaneous bursts of light</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/10</em>). In the 1980s, L’Huillier, now at Lund University in Sweden, noticed that infrared laser light sent through a gas would <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/21/3/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create light of a variety of wavelengths</a>, what’s known as high-harmonic generation. The effect is a result of how that light interacts with the electrons in the gas, by a process which L’Huillier’s research helped clarify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These other wavelengths, known as overtones or harmonics, are similar to the overtones that help give musical instruments their distinctive sounds. Adding together the right combinations of overtones results in very short pulses of light. With this method, researchers led by Agostini, now at Ohio State University in Columbus, in 2001 produced <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1059413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of light pulses</a>, each of which lasted just 250 attoseconds. The same year, Krausz, now at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues created single pulses lasting just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35107000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">650 attoseconds</a>. Today, scientists can make much shorter pulses tens of attoseconds long.</p>



<p>“I was personally fascinated by this field from the start, and this is why I continued with it during many, many years,” L’Huillier said in a phone call during the announcement. &nbsp;L’Huillier is only the fifth woman to receive the physics Nobel. “There are not so many women that get this prize, so it’s very, very special,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have used this technique to explore the behavior of electrons inside atoms and molecules. For example, the technique has revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1189401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timescale for the photoelectric effect</a>, in which light knocks an electron out of an atom, and details of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-tunneling-takes-time-new-study-shows">quantum tunneling</a>, in which electrons pass through barriers that seem insurmountable (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>The technique also reveals the behavior of molecules. “You can watch the motions of molecules themselves, essentially to make movies of molecular motion,” Armitage says. “And this is of vast interest for all kinds of things: for [everything from] understanding why some materials are superconductors at high temperatures to photovoltaic applications, harvesting energy from light…. I think it&#8217;s really just right at the beginning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Rosner, a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago, says one application involves designing materials from scratch.“Chemistry is all about how electrons … interact with one another,” he says. “It&#8217;s like building a house, and you need to know what goes first and what&#8217;s the next step.” But in this case, you want to follow what the electrons do during chemical synthesis — which is something ultrashort light pulses can do. “It really opens up an entirely new way of thinking about how we actually make stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/noisy-environs-pied-tamarins-smell-communicate">In noisy environs, pied tamarins are using smell more often to communicate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Native to the Brazilian Amazon, pied tamarins have always used vocal calls to communicate. But noise pollution from car traffic and other human activity are forcing some tamarins to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03949370.2023.2248591?src=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complement those voice calls with smell markings</a> to alert others to dangers, researchers report September 20 in <em>Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Most pied tamarins (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>) live in Manaus, Brazil, inhabiting fragmented patches of forest scattered around urban environments. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this small, black and whitish-yellow primate <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critically endangered</a>.</p>





<p>Vocal communication is crucial for pied tamarins’ survival; they use it to alert other individuals to danger — an important feat considering the urban environment surrounding them. &#8220;Pied tamarins have 12 different types of vocalization with several uses, from pointing to food and cuddling each other to calling out for some danger,&#8221; says Tainara Sobroza, a biologist at the Federal University of Amazonas in Manaus.</p>



<p>The &#8220;danger&#8221; vocalization is particularly important for these animals, Sobroza says, as many are hit by cars and killed when they cross streets to move between forest patches. &#8220;We wanted to understand if this type of vocalization is being affected by the noise of urban environments,&#8221; she says.</p>



<p>Sobroza and colleagues spent about a year observing pied tamarins, which normally wander in groups of less than 10 individuals. Using radio collars, the team tracked nine groups in Manaus for 10 days each from November 2018 to December 2019. While physically following the groups, the researchers measured the loudness of the alpha female’s alert call and visually counted how often individuals rubbed their chest and lower parts on the ground and trees, spreading an odorous, waxy substance to signal which direction they were heading.</p>



<p>The team thought the tamarins would use fewer vocal callings and more smell-spreading to communicate effectively between groups — but that is not what happened. Estimates of the behaviors suggest tamarins complemented one with the other: They maintained the loudness and quantity of their vocal calls while also marking the terrain with their scents.</p>



<p>“It is just like being at a noisy party, and you want to call a friend that can&#8217;t hear you from the other side of the room,” Sobroza says. “Added to calling him or her, you also usually wave and do arm gestures to call the attention of that person.”</p>



<p>The new observations bring extra knowledge about the ecology and behavior of this species, says Luciane Lopes de Souza, a biologist at the University of the State of Amazonas in Manaus who did not take part in the study. &#8220;It is very interesting to see that pied tamarins can adapt to use [a scent-marking] form of communication, which we see much more frequently in other species such as the squirrel monkey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Human activity is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cities-create-accidental-experiments-plant-animal-evolution">changing the behavior of several species</a> such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/city-song-birds-sing-higher-near-urban-traffic">birds</a>, spiders and crabs (<em>SN: 6/26/16, SN: 7/16/03</em>). Understanding these changes is crucial if humans want to mitigate their impacts through conservation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do hope this study goes on, as it is of extreme importance we have research like this running for longer periods,” Souza says. “This way, we can understand annual or seasonal changes in animal behavior and think of evolutionary changes they might be facing.&#8221;</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, David Haydock will talk about the paper entitled &quot;EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state
activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method
involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as
successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field
remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-
scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across
time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these
microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious
mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of
mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes
associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the
temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source
imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-
state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of
EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time
scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available
methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these
microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.</p>

<p>The latest Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset has arrived! And with it, a brand new indicator. Read on for details, and be sure to explore the data for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators identify and quantify instances of specific Open Science practices in published scientific literature using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques applied and developed in partnership with <a href="https://dataseer.ai/">DataSeer</a>. At PLOS, we use indicators as a tool to support our mission to advance Open Science. Other members of the scholarly community use them to <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/">understand trends in their institution</a>; to <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8117154">explore markers of research integrity</a>, and to <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">benchmark new tools for monitoring Open Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The latest Open Science Indicators dataset</h2>



<p>This is the fourth quarterly update to Open Science Indicators since we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">introduced the dataset</a> in December 2022. It covers January 1 2019 to June 30 2023 (four full years, plus the first half of 2023). Like the previous installments, this update measures data-generation and -sharing, code-generation and -sharing, and preprint posting. <strong>It also includes a preliminary version of our first new indicator: protocol sharing</strong>. Watch this space for more on how we developed the protocol sharing indicator in a future post.</p>



<p>OSI Version 4 (Sept 23) also includes an expanded comparator corpus, which has doubled the number of articles from other publishers included in the dataset from 8,176 in version 3 (June 23) to 16,023 today.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=41362998">README</a> for a full list of updates related to version 4.</p>



<h2>Observations</h2>



<p>For the first half of 2023, all four indicators remain stable overall, consistent with patterns observed in 2022. In keeping with previous results, PLOS articles were more likely to link to public research data or code than non-PLOS articles, and equally likely to link to a preprint.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Nobel Prize week, and the work behind mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has just <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/">earned the physiology or medicine prize</a>. But this is Retraction Watch, so that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>



<p>A Nobel prize-winning researcher whose publications have come under scrutiny has retracted his <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSemenza%252c%2bGregg%2bL">10th paper</a> for issues with the data and images. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis had flagged possibly duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s publications on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=gregg+l+semenza">PubPeer</a> before 2019, and other sleuths posted more beginning in October 2020. </p>



<span id="more-127996"></span>



<p>Last September, Semenza and his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/03/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-retracts-four-papers/">pulled four papers</a> from <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Another <em>PNAS</em> paper, one in <em>Oncogene</em>, and two from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> were retracted over the past year, with each notice stating that Semenza requested or agreed to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, <em>Molecular Cancer Research</em> has retracted another of the Nobelist’s articles,&nbsp; “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/11/5/456/89397/Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is-Essential-for">Procollagen Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 Is Essential for Hypoxia-Induced Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” which appeared in 2013. The article has been cited 181 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a 2011 retraction for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 24 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – today’s retraction makes 10 for Semenza. More <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03032-9">may be on the way</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/21/10/1120/729213/Retraction-Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is">notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that lanes 4, 5, and 6 of the HIF-1α immunoblot in Fig. 3A are identical images. An internal review corroborated the authors’ claim, and the editors agreed with the authors’ retraction request. The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article.</p>



<p>A copy of this Retraction Notice was sent to the last known email addresses for all authors. Four authors (Denis Wirtz, Carmen C. Wong, Daniele M. Gilkes, and Gregg L. Semenza) agreed to the retraction; the 3 remaining authors could not be located.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Semenza did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Johns Hopkins would not comment on whether they were investigating the matter when a reporter from <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-gregg-semenza-retractions-20230801-2wv7kspmq5awfes3omkacb4bpy-story.html"><em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asked this summer</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#1">commented</a> that the lanes of the figure identified in the retraction notice were “much more similar than expected.” The first author, Daniele M. Gilkes, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#3">responded</a> by posting an image of the “original uncropped version.” Another commenter raised more concerns about the image, but Gilkes did not respond again. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-citrus-fruits-china-origin">The first citrus fruits may have come from southern China</a></h4>

              
                <p>Citrus fruits’ hometown is in China, a genetic analysis suggests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>An extensive look at wild members of the orange family tree hints that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01516-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first species in the <em>Citrus </em>genus arose around 8 million years ago</a> in what’s now south central China, researchers report October 2 in <em>Nature Genetics</em>. The <em>Citrus </em>lineage’s ancestors may have first arrived in Asia on the Indian tectonic plate around 25 million years ago, when it collided with the Asian plate.</p>





<p>Today, myriad tart fruits — including human-bred versions of oranges, lemons and limes — stockpile grocery store shelves. But it’s unclear where their oldest ancestors evolved. Previous studies pointed to places like northeastern Australia, southern China or the southeastern foothills of the Himalayas. Piecing together citrus evolution could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lemons-kumquats-roots-citrus-variety-dug">help researchers make drought- or disease-resilient plant varieties</a> that still bear tasty fruit, says horticulturalist Qiang Xu (<em>SN: 4/14/15</em>).</p>



<p>To pinpoint <em>Citrus</em>’ origins, Xu, of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China and colleagues built a family tree using the genetic blueprints of 314 <em>Citrus </em>and <em>Citrus-</em>related plants, which included 15 <em>Citrus</em> species. The researchers also trekked into the field to find where the trees grow in the wild. The oldest citrus fruits — including <em>C. trifoliata,</em> the trifoliate orange — are found in south central China, suggesting that region is the genus’ birthplace.</p>



<p><em>Citrus</em> evolution didn’t stop there. Some species have roots in the regions that the earlier studies identified, the team found. Pomelo and citron fruits appear to have sprung up in the Himalayan foothills, and some wild limes evolved in Australia.</p>



<p>The researchers also confirmed that a gene called <em>PH4</em> is linked to the amount of citric acid inside each fruit. <em>PH4</em> turns on a proton pump that allows citric acid to build up inside oranges and their relatives. The more citric acid, the more tart the taste.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-2023-mrna-vaccine-covid">Early mRNA research that led to COVID-19 vaccines wins 2023 medicine Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two scientists who laid the groundwork for what would become among the most influential vaccines of all time have been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biochemist Katalin Karikó, now at the University of Szeged in Hungary, and Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania were honored for their research on modifications of mRNA that made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">the first vaccines against COVID-19</a> possible (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody has experienced the COVID-19 pandemic that affects our life, economy and public health. It was a traumatic event,” said Qiang Pan-Hammarström, a member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which awards the medicine or physiology  prize. Her remarks came on October 2 after a news briefing to announce the winners. “You probably don&#8217;t need to emphasize more that the basic discovery made by the laureates has made a huge impact on our society.”</p>





<p>As of September 2023, more than 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses — including mRNA vaccines as well as other kinds of shots — had been administered since they first became available in December 2020, according to the World Health Organization. In the year after their introduction, the shots are <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to have saved nearly 20 million lives</a> globally. In the United States, where mRNA COVID-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech accounted for the vast majority of vaccinations, the vaccines are estimated to have <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/dec/us-covid-19-vaccination-program-one-year-how-many-deaths-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented 1.1 million additional deaths</a> and 10.3 million hospitalizations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A different kind of vaccine</h4>



<p>RNA is DNA’s lesser-known chemical cousin. Cells make RNA copies of genetic instructions contained in DNA. Some of those RNA copies, known as messenger RNA, or mRNA, are used to build proteins. Messenger RNA “literally tells your cells what proteins to make,” says Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire, a viral immunologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Proteins do much of the important work that keeps cells, and the organisms they’re a part of, alive and well.</p>



<p>The mRNA vaccines work a bit differently than traditional immunizations. Most traditional vaccines use viruses or bacteria — either weakened or killed — or proteins from those pathogens to provoke the immune system into making protective antibodies and other defenses against future infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna instead contain mRNA that carries<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating"> instructions for making</a> one of the coronavirus’s proteins (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). When a person gets an mRNA shot, the genetic material gets into their cells and triggers the cells to produce the viral protein for a short amount of time. When the immune system sees the viral protein, it builds defenses to prevent serious illness if the person later gets infected with the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccines using mRNA were a good choice to combat the pandemic, Corbett-Helaire says. The technology allows scientists to “skip that step of making large amounts of proteins in the laboratory and instead … tell the body to do things that the body already does, except now we make an extra protein,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to protecting people from the coronavirus, mRNA vaccines may also work against other <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/research/product-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infectious diseases</a> and <a href="https://www.biontech.com/int/en/home/pipeline-and-products/pipeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a>. Scientists might also use the technology to help people with certain rare <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/behind-the-science/unlocking-power-our-bodys-protein-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetic diseases</a> make enzymes or other proteins they lack. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mrna-vaccine-next-viruses-flu-hiv-zika">Clinical trials are under way</a> for many of these uses, but it could take years before scientists know the results (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A long time coming</h4>



<p>The first mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 became available just under a year into the pandemic, but the technology behind it has been decades in the making.</p>





<p>In 1997, Karikó and Weissman met at the copy machine, Karikó said during a news conference October 2 at the University of Pennsylvania. She told him about her work with RNA, and he shared his interest in vaccines. Although housed in separate buildings, the researchers worked together to <a href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/modified-mrna-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solve one fundamental problem</a> that could have derailed mRNA vaccines and therapies: Pumping regular mRNA into the body gets the immune system riled up in bad ways, producing a flood of immune chemicals called cytokines. Those chemicals can trigger damaging inflammation. And this unmodified mRNA produces very little protein in the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found that swapping the RNA building block uridine for modified versions, first pseudouridine and then N1-methylpseudouridine, could dampen the bad immune reaction. That nifty chemistry, <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(05)00211-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported in 2005</a>, allowed researchers to rein in the immune response and safely deliver the mRNA to cells.</p>



<p>“The messenger RNA has to hide and it has to go unnoticed by our bodies, which are very brilliant at destroying things that are foreign,” Corbett-Helaire says. “The modifications that [Karikó and Weissman] worked on for a number of years really were fundamental to allowing the mRNA therapeutics to hide while also being very helpful to the body.”</p>



<p>In addition, the modified mRNA <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/38/17/5884/1031556?login=false#82637740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced lots of protein</a> that could <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(16)32681-8?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spark an immune response</a>, the team showed in 2008 and 2010. It was this work on modifying mRNA building blocks that the prize honors.</p>



<p>For years, “we couldn&#8217;t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said at the Penn news conference. Vaccines using the technology failed clinical trials in the early 1990s, and most researchers gave up. But Karikó “lit the match,” and they spent the next 20 years figuring out how to get it to work, Weissman said. “We would sit together in 1997 and afterwards and talk about all the things that we thought RNA could do, all of the vaccines and therapeutics and gene therapies, and just realizing how important it had the potential to be. That’s why we never gave up.”</p>



<p>In 2006, Karikó and Weissman started a company called RNARx to develop mRNA-based treatments and vaccines. After Karikó joined the German company BioNTech in 2013, she and Weissman continued to collaborate. They and colleagues reported in 2015 that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365915300535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encasing mRNA in bubbles of lipids</a> could help the fragile RNA get into cells without getting broken down in the body. The researchers were developing a Zika vaccine when the pandemic hit, and quickly applied what they had learned toward containing the coronavirus.</p>



<p>The duo’s work was not always so celebrated. Thomas Perlmann, Secretary General of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, asked the newly minted laureates whether they were surprised to have won. He said that Karikó was overwhelmed, noting that just 10 years ago she was terminated from her job and had to move to Germany without her family to get another position. She never won a grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health to support her work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She struggled and didn’t get recognition for the importance of her vision,” Perlmann said, but she had a passion for using mRNA therapeutically. “She resisted the temptation to sort of go away from that path and do something maybe easier.” Karikó is the 61st woman to win a Nobel Prize since 1901, and the 13th to be awarded a prize in physiology and medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though it often takes decades before the Nobel committees recognize a discovery, sometimes recognition comes relatively swiftly. For instance, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2020</a> a mere eight years after the researchers published a description of the genetic scissors CRISPR/Cas 9 (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>“I never expected in my entire life to get the Nobel Prize,” Weissman said, especially not a mere three years after the vaccines demonstrated their medical importance. Perlmann told him the Nobel committee was seeking to be “more current” with its awards, he said.</p>



<p>The timely Nobel highlights that “there are just a million other possibilities for messenger RNA therapeutics … beyond the vaccines,” Corbett-Helaire says.</p>



<p>The researchers said at the Penn news conference that they weren’t sure the early morning phone call from Perlmann was real. On the advice of Weissman’s daughter, they waited for the Nobel announcement. “We sat in bed. [I was] looking at my wife, and my cat is begging for food,” he said. “We wait, and the press conference starts, and it was real. So that’s when we really became excited.”</p>



<p>Karikó and Weissman will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or roughly $1 million.</p>

                <p><strong>In this short interview series, we will be shining a light on inspiring women working in neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. We explore  job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations, and goals for the future.

Her research focuses on the genetics of autism, in particular what underpins aggressive behaviours in some. She previously completed a BSc in Developmental Psychology at the University of East Anglia.</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science/neuroscience? </strong></h6><p><p>I did my undergraduate degree in Developmental Psychology after working for a charity for children and young people with additional needs throughout college and developing an interest in working with young people with neurodevelopmental disorders. During my placement year at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) during this degree, I was most interested in the work done by the Forensic CAMHS team and decided to pursue a Master’s in this field.</p>
</p>
<h6><strong>Can you tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>My MSc is Forensic Mental Health, which looks at the mental health needs of the offending population and the causes of antisocial behaviour, whether that is mental illness, personality disorders, trauma, substance misuse. For my thesis project, I am investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of two high-risk genetic mutations associated with aggression in Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). Having worked with children and young people with ASC for years, and with the high rates of people with neurodevelopmental disorders in the Criminal Justice system, I was drawn to this thesis project as it allows me to explore the biological causes of the condition and understand this population better. This project is at the forefront of ASC research and its findings will allow for the development of targeted medication to manage aggression in people with ASC, which will be so beneficial to people with ASC and those that care for them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job? </strong></h6>
<h6><p>Being able to observe the link between brain structure and behaviour - I’m fascinated by the ‘nature vs. nurture’ debate, and how genetic makeup and differences in brain structure can predispose some people to certain mental illnesses if they are exposed to particular environmental stressors. I think this allows us to have a better understanding of mental health and what someone is experiencing because their symptoms and behaviours can be somewhat explained by what is happening in their brain, and this can give us an idea of how we can best work with them to improve their symptoms.</p></h6>
<h6>What are the challenges?</h6>
<h6><p>The need to be able to detach from the patients I work with, but still provide empathetic care. You can’t take on what your patients are experiencing as you wouldn’t be able to care for them effectively and it wouldn’t be healthy for myself, but you also must be present with your patients and build good therapeutic relationships! This is a hard thing to learn and is something that I am always consciously practising, especially when working with such vulnerable people that might find it difficult to open up to a professional in the first place.</p></h6><h6><strong>What skills are you currently trying to improve?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I am trying to speak up and not let imposter syndrome keep me back. I am often the youngest in the room when at my placement and this can stop me from contributing to conversations as I feel that I do not have the knowledge or experience to share my opinion, but I do! Finding the balance between my placement, my university work and having a social life and space to relax has been hard over this year, but I think I have become better at it and learnt to enforce boundaries where I need them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>The women I work with in the psychology team at my placement - we are a team of women working in a male inpatient unit aiming to provide psychological care within the medical model of the hospital. These women are knowledgeable, resilient and powerful. They have highlighted the importance of compassion in healthcare, and advocating for your patient’s wider needs, not just those that can be managed by medication, and I have learnt so much from them.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></h6>
<h6><p>I plan to work within the prison system and qualify as a forensic psychologist, ideally working with juvenile offenders. I am passionate about the accessibility of mental health support for all, whether that be for individuals with learning difficulties or those at a socio-economic disadvantage, and I hope to take this forward by opening these spaces up and improving their accessibility.</p>

</h6>
<h6>What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</h6><p><p>Ask questions - most people want to share their knowledge and these can lead to interesting conversations with new perspectives and ideas, and often further opportunities. Don’t be afraid to re-email someone - the majority of the time they are not ignoring you, they are just very busy and it has slipped their mind. Being a woman in a male-dominated field can be daunting but your opinions on things matter, and are needed to make sure all perspectives are heard!</p>
</p>
<h6>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</h6><p><p>The inaccessibility of the field! A lot of positions want experience and a lot of opportunities at an undergraduate and postgraduate level are unpaid, and so excludes those that do not have access to financial support that allows them to take on unpaid work. Recognising that individuals from a lower socio-economic background are being excluded should be a priority of the field and steps should be taken to prevent this from happening. Doing so is so important as it gives a voice to all and benefits the whole field by giving it new perspectives on research areas.</p></p><hr><p>This article was written by Lauren Wallis and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p><strong>A powerful pulse of laser light: Step toward fusion</strong> —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/powerful-pulse-laser-light-step-toward-fusion"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;September 29, 1973</p>



<p>One spur to the development of more powerful lasers is the possibility of using them in projects seeking to gain electric power from controlled thermonuclear fusion. The idea is to use laser light to evaporate, ionize and implosively compress a solid fuel pellet and thus trigger nuclear fusions.… Now the Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque have announced a new laser that appears to be a significant step on the way.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update </h4>



<p>Laser fusion is starting to hit its stride. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California use 192 laser beams to blast a target with millions of joules of energy in an attempt to initiate fusion. Last year, the lab achieved ignition, in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-energy">more energy is released than initially hits the target</a> (<em>SN: 1/14/23, p. 6</em>). Then in July, the lab repeated the feat, achieving the highest energy yield yet. A blast of about 2 million joules resulted in an output of nearly 4 million joules of fusion energy, according to a lab statement. But much more energy is required to power the laser facility, meaning laser fusion still isn’t a net power source.</p>

<p>On Aug. 17, 2022, Nicki Tiffin received a notification that she had published a new study. The problem? She had never submitted an article to the journal in which the paper appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, despite efforts by Tiffin and others, the journal has not responded to retraction requests, and the article remains online. Further investigation by Retraction Watch has revealed other dysfunction at the journal, including falsely representing its editors and a schism from its founders and original sponsor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Triumphs and improvement of Computational Bioinformatics in South</a> <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/scholarly-articles/triumphs-and-improvement-of-computational-bioinformatics-in-south-africa.pdf">Africa</a>,” was published in June 2022 in the <em>European Journal of Biomedical Informatic</em>s (EJBI).</p>



<p>Tiffin, a professor at the South African National Bioinformatics Institute at the University of the Western Cape, discovered that the new paper was a plagiarized version of an article she had published in 2016. That paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004395">The Development of Computational Biology in South Africa: Successes Achieved and Lessons Learnt</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s <em>Web of Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, Tiffin was a professor at the University of Cape Town. Although she had no role in publishing the <em>EJBI </em>article, it lists her name as the sole author of the paper, as well as her University of Cape Town affiliation.</p>



<span id="more-127975"></span>



<p>For over a year, Tiffin, editors at <em>PLOS</em>, and Paula Saner, the research integrity manager at the University of Cape Town, have been trying to get <em>EJBI </em>to retract the plagiarized article, with no success.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In an email to Retraction Watch, Saner described the steps she had taken, all fruitless:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I… went about writing to the EJBI asking them to retract the article/correct the publication record. I wrote to the website domain hosts to notify them of the fraudulent publication, requesting that they remove the website and I wrote to stop predatory journals to ask them to add the EJBI to their list.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Saner said she contacted the university’s internal cybersecurity team, who weren’t able to do anything, as well as PLOS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By March 2023, the author name and affiliation on the paper had been changed to “Nicki R Adolf, Kyushu University.” Saner said PLOS agreed to reach out to Kyushu University in Japan, which has no record of a person named Nicki R Adolf having worked there. Since the University of Cape Town affiliation had been removed, Saner said she left the issue to PLOS and others.</p>



<p>But in early September, Tiffin noticed that her name and affiliation reappeared on the PDF of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Renee Hoch, managing editor of the PLOS Publications Ethics Team, told Retraction Watch that practices like the ones employed by <em>EJBI</em> are a “substantial threat to researchers and the integrity of the published record.” Journals and authors have little recourse if the publisher of the concerning article doesn’t respond or act according to standards such as those set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Tiffin’s predicament, she said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to COPE guidance, in cases of dual publication the first journal may issue a notice of redundant publication and the journal(s) who publish subsequently should retract the redundant article(s). PLOS has not issued a public notice in this case: we do not have any concerns about the PLOS Computational Biology article and would not want a public notice to cast a negative light on the PLOS article or its authors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hoch said the PLOS did attempt to contact <em>EJBI </em>about the article, but that it has not responded or retracted the duplicate article.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Tiffin described discovering the plagiarized paper as “quite a surprise.” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It has been quite hard to understand what the journal gains from this kind of fraud, and it seems most likely that they are attempting to pad out their content with known researchers claimed as authors, to appear more like a bona fide journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tiffin said that although she had absolutely no involvement in publishing the paper, its publication is damaging to her reputation as a researcher and the reputation of the University of Cape Town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also noted how unusual and unnerving it is that an obviously fraudulent article like this could stay published for so long, despite repeated efforts by her, Saner, and PLOS. She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is also disturbing that the journal has not cleaned up properly despite the challenge from the University of Cape Town, and have so blatantly simply altered the fictional author details provided with the paper. They have not taken the fraudulent material offline. This means that they intend to continue with these kind of practices, and this should not be allowed to continue unchecked. It is, however, quite difficult to find a route to ensure this fraud is halted – as Paula has demonstrated through her multiple and very determined efforts to have the fraudulent article taken down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>EJBI </em>was previously the official journal of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), but Saner noted that the organization <a href="https://efmi.org/2020/05/31/special-announcement-european-journal-for-biomedical-informatics-ejbi-no-longer-under-status-official-journal-of-efmi/">withdrew that claim</a> in 2020 because of “completely inappropriate behaviour for a scientific journal and the lack of quality assurance.”</p>



<p>At that time, <em>EJBI </em>had not removed its claim to be an EFMI journal from its website, “despite repeated requests,” according to EFMI’s statement, and the association was “preparing legal action.” <em>EJBI</em>’s <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/">website</a> no longer refers to EFMI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website lists three editors in chief: Mauro Giacomini of the University of Genoa in Italy, Izet Masic of the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bernd Blobel of the University of Regensburg in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when contacted by Retraction Watch, Giacomini said all three editors had resigned from the journal at the same time the EFMI withdrew its support, and elaborated about why. Giacomini said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The [EJBI] has had a great history, starting from the founding [by our] colleague Jana Zvárová. Shortly before her death, Jana sold the magazine to its current ownership. Upon Jana&#8217;s death (2017), in her memory and in agreement with the European Federation for Medical Informatics, Izet Mesic, Bernd Blobel and I took over the title of Editor-in-Chief of the same journal. Until 2019, we tried to manage this journal with the normal rules of the scientific world, but we noticed serious actions against these rules by the owners. For this reason, after the EJBI pHealth 2019 Special Issue, EFMI withdrew its endorsement of the journal and at the same time the three of us resigned from the role of Editor-in-Chief. We have written to the magazine several times to remove our names from the site but have received no response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Blobel, who helped launch the journal, said it was originally a “home-made” publication produced at Charles University in Prague. When Zvárová’s health got worse, she decided to move the journal to the UK, he said. Giacomini added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For years Jana has carried on the journal in a personal way and with great dedication. When the registration mechanism began with the various international bodies (Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, &#8230; ) many persons suggested that Jana find a suitable publishing house that could bring EJBI into these accredited registers. I didn&#8217;t follow the negotiations, I think none of us followed them in detail, but I believe that these people deceived Jana first, certainly promising to work for the registration of EJBI, which was never done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">It is unclear who, if anyone, is currently serving as editor in chief of the journal, or what entity publishes it. Though Blobel said he originally communicated with colleagues in the UK, the <a href="https://www.ejbi.org/contactus.html">journal’s website</a> lists an address in Brussels, Belgium.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>EJBI </em>staff<em> </em>did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch. A message sent to an email address associated with a LinkedIn profile for DJ Uppari, who Blobel said was previously a managing editor for <em>EJBI</em>, also yielded no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also emailed several editors and associate editors listed on the journal’s website. Yasser Mohammed Hassanain Elsayed, a doctor and researcher with the Egyptian Ministry of Health, said he was an editor for the journal but had no knowledge of the article in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two others expressed confusion that they were listed as associate editors. Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeago, who is currently a senior lecturer at Kampala International University in Uganda, said he didn’t “know when my name was listed among the associate [editors].” Diego Mauricio López Gutierrez, a researcher at the University of Cauca in Colombia, said he was invited to serve as an associate editor and agreed, but never heard from the journal after that.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t get the memo, the presidents of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and the Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA) want you to stop talking about sex already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or at least they want anthropologists to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127981"></span>



<p>Ellie Kincaid <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/27/anthropology-groups-cancel-conference-panel-on-why-biological-sex-is-necessary-for-research/">reported last week</a> for Retraction Watch that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">a panel presentation</a> entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology” had been scheduled for November’s joint AAA-CASCA meeting in Toronto. The conference session had been approved by the programming committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then AAA President Ramona Pérez and CASCA president Monica Heller <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">decided</a> “safety and dignity” were threatened by anthropologists who think biological sex is still a category worth considering. Overriding the programming committee, the two leaders canceled the panel.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, gender is okay with the presidents. It’s talking about biological sex as if it matters to human experience that is a strict no-no. It’s particularly not okay if panelists are “gender critical,” i.e., scholars who think females are being harmed in the move to talking only about gender constructs and not in terms of biological sex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panelists had intended to talk about sex identification in skeletons, coeducation, tech-centric pornography, and misogyny using a generally feminist perspective to think about harm to females. You might think these topics are far enough left to pass muster in academe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">statement</a> put out by the AAA and CASCA accuses the panel of committing “one of the cardinal sins of scholarship – it assumes the truth of the proposition that it sets out to prove, namely, that sex and gender are simplistically binary, and that this is a fact with meaningful implications for the discipline.”</p>



<p>“Cardinal sin” is an appropriate choice of language here, because Pérez and Heller are working from dogma so heavy it is worthy of the Vatican. They act as if anytime someone considers the categories of male and female as worthy of study, they must be denying the existence of trans, gender nonbinary, and intersex people. That’s just silly. That’s like saying you can’t compare tangerines and grapefruits because tangelos also exist.</p>



<p>It’s entirely possible – indeed, reasonable – to consider the categories of male and female in science and other forms of scholarship, and doing so does not require denying that not everyone fits those categories. (I say this as someone whose scholarship and activism centered on <a href="https://alicedreger.com/medical_invention/">intersex</a> for <a href="https://alicedreger.com/gmf/">decades</a> as a person who has <a href="https://alicedreger.com/trans/">advocated</a> for trans rights.) Indeed, the canceled panelists alluded to the existence of people who don’t fit those categories in the abstracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the (alleged) risk of endangering safety and dignity, I’m going to say it: The great majority of humans come biologically in one of two forms, male and female. While it’s worth cautioning against simplistic thinking that assumes gendered behaviors and attributes are always biologically inborn and not culturally learned, you can also learn a lot by thinking in terms of categories of sex, especially if you look at the places where genders don’t easily map to sex.</p>



<p>Consider, for example, anthropological research that has focused on cultures that include third-gender categories. Anthropologists have documented how a <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-old-way-to-be-gay-couples-love-evolution-67337">number of traditional cultures</a> around the world provide designated names and pathways for male children who behave in ways identified as feminine. These children are shifted into categories that allow them to live like girls and then like women. (A few cultures also have the opposite, i.e., categories for females who take on masculine cultural roles.)</p>



<p>One might simply think of these categories as “transgender,” but as researchers have documented, there’s definitely a sexed element to all this. Third-gender males in these cultures are recognized as being androphilic (sexually attracted to masculine males), and traditionally no sex-changing interventions have been employed. This is about gender, yes, but it’s also about sex.</p>



<p>Anthropologists have also traced out what two cultures – one in the Dominican Republic and one in Papua New Guinea – have done to deal with an intersex condition that is relatively common in those populations. The condition, 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency, results in a child born looking female but later naturally undergoing a masculinizing puberty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watching what cultures do to preserve gendered (and especially heterosexist) beliefs in the face of recognized sexual minorities helps us understand how humans try to manage sex, including through gendered constructs.</p>



<p>I suppose Presidents Pérez and Heller might allow presentations on what look to them like trans and intersex people; their letter earnestly claims to be defending “members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But policing what scholars can say and think about sex and gender is no way to help minority sex, gender, and sexual-orientation populations. That policing will always end up harming some of them. (The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">letter</a> objecting to the canceling notes that one member of the committee-approved panel is lesbian.) </p>



<p>Moreover, this kind of attempt at silencing feeds the right’s portrayal of academics as hopelessly partisan and the right’s belief that political censorship is fair game.</p>



<p>This is all terribly ironic, too, because historically anthropology was one of the disciplines that taught us sex and gender are not the same thing. Human cultures have created so many different gender-masks for sex, what we learn by allowing free inquiry is just that: that gender (and therefore sex, too) can be a many-splendored thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More irony: the decision by Pérez and Heller silenced women who were making a group argument against the silencing of women. If the presidents want to fight against the core claim of gender-critical scholars – that defense of trans rights is accruing harm to women – can’t they see they’ve just <em>proven</em> the point?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/the-challenges-of-seeing-the-profusion-of-tiny-life">The challenges of seeing the profusion of tiny life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When I imagine life on Earth, I think of grand images: springboks bouncing across the African savanna, penguins waddling in the snow, dolphins leaping into the air, redwood trees soaring above the forest. But scientists are exploring a profusion of creatures with equally fascinating behavior that aren’t seen in David Attenborough–style documentaries. In fact, our eyes can’t see them at all.</p>



<p>Minuscule life-forms known as protists have been known for centuries. But powerful microscopes, advances in genetic and computational technologies, and old-fashioned fieldwork are now revealing extensive diversity among these single-celled life-forms. Many are bizarre enough to star in a science fiction series. As life sciences writer Susan Milius reports, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watch-microbial-life-earth">one critter has a “head” that spins</a>, a skill creepy enough that its discoverers gave it the name <em>Daimonympha friedkini</em>, inspired by the demonically possessed child in the 1973 film <em>The Exorcist</em> and its director, William Friedkin. Another creature, shaped like a flying saucer, glides into the bodies of its prey, devouring them from the inside.</p>





<p>These two discoveries and many other recent ones are forcing scientists to rethink their concepts of how microbes are related to other organisms, as well as to rethink the whole tree of life. “What struck me most as I worked on the story was how little of it I can see,” Milius said of the tree of life and its many microbial branches. That and the fact that it’s not so much a tree as invisible bramble tangles of life, Milius says.</p>



<p>Trying to figure out how to illustrate the protists in the bramble tangles proved a challenge. <em>Science News</em> design director Tracee Tibbitts spent many hours digging through electron microscope images in search of the right tiny, crazy-looking things. “Species ID is a recurring theme at <em>Science News</em>,” Tibbitts told me. “This took it to another level.”</p>



<p>And even when she found the right species, the images often didn’t capture what makes these creatures special; their physiology is so alien to ours that they all tend to look alike. We wondered if drawings might work better. Many historical depictions of long-known protists were penned by Ernst Haeckel, a supporter of the discredited “science” of eugenics, and used as design motifs by René Binet, a Trotskyite turned Nazi. We felt uncomfortable giving those people more attention. So back to the hunt for other options.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we were able to find images that we think do these creatures justice, revealing their remarkable forms and behavior, like that spinning demon “head.”</p>



<p>The experience has left us marveling at the diversity of life, not only these tiny life-forms but also much larger creatures featured in this issue, including a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doctors-live-python-parasite-brain">parasitic worm that made a home for itself in a woman’s brain</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannibal-pirate-spiders-web-arachnid">pirate spiders that trick their prey into walking the plank</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-complex-vocal-skills-problem-solvers">songbirds that are excellent problem-solvers</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakes-big-gulp-gans-egg-eater">small snakes that take supersize gulps</a>.</p>



<p>There’s so much more to discover about Earth’s inhabitants, the majority of which dwell in the microbial world. The tree of life is vast, and the part that looks like us is incredibly small.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dream on</h4>



<p><em>Lucid dreamers — people who are aware they’re dreaming while it’s happening — are helping scientists probe the sleeping mind in real time, <strong>Maria Temming </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucid-dream-sleep-mind-neuroscience-brain">Dispatches from the dreamscape</a>” (</em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Several readers shared their experiences lucid dreaming.</p>



<p>“I have been able to control a dream just about as successfully as a captain can control an oil tanker. I can steer the dream but not completely control it,” reader <strong>Peter Adams</strong> wrote. “I remember [my lucid dreams], and three have become the basis of science fiction stories I am writing.… I even dreamed a musical composition that I wrote down when I woke up. The music sounds rather good.”</p>





<p>Reader <strong>John</strong> wrote: “I have been a lucid dreamer all my life. I am now 71, and I remember most of my dreams. I learned years ago that I could control and even change the direction that a dream was going.… I control them like a movie director.… I once dreamed that I was water-skiing, even down to the surface tension of the water I was on. And the next day, I tried skiing for the first time and got right up the first try and felt that same sensation.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental information?</h4>



<p><em>Chemical analyses of 57 sports supplements revealed that only 11&nbsp;percent­ contain an accurate amount of key ingredients advertised. Some of the supplements even contain compounds prohibited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, <strong>Meghan&nbsp;Rosen</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sport-supplements-ingredients-dietary">Supplements lack key ingredients</a>” (</em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 10<em>).</em></p>



<p>Some readers asked why the story did not list the supplements studied.</p>



<p><strong>Rosen</strong> also wondered which supplements were coming up short. But that information is not publicly available. “The researchers made an agreement with the lab they collaborated with to not make the names of the products they tested public,” <strong>Rosen</strong> says. “In the meantime, consumers’ best bet may be to look to third-party organizations that evaluate dietary supplements’ quality.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Correction</h4>



<p>In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">The thymus isn’t so expendable after all</a>” (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 7</em>), <em>Science News</em> wrote that over 12 percent of people who underwent a thymectomy developed an autoimmune disorder within five years after surgery, compared with about 8 percent of those who kept their thymus — a 1.5 times greater risk. It would have been more accurate to write that thymectomy patients have 1.5<em> times</em> the risk of patients who kept their thymus.</p>
